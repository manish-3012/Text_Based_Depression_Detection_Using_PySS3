crisis about growing up I don't want to grow up. I'm sure its been said literally billions of times, and everyone has felt it, but the feeling is so strong I feel like I might explode.

I'm only 17, but I've lived a hugely eventful life for a 17 year old. I had an amazing and beautiful childhood and an exciting teenage-hood, living overseas as an expat in an asian country (those who are international kids understand what the life entails, it's not exactly the most immature, innocent teenagehood one could have). I have amazing friends, relationships, family... obviously everything is not perfect but that's not the point of this story. 

Ever since I was 9, I remember distinctly that I was excited to grow up and be 17. But now, the responsibilities are piling on that have made me be nostalgic to the point it hurts, daily. My boyfriend of 3 years left for university, my brother left for his masters, school has been so intense and overwhelming with IB it drove me into a numb state for a couple weeks, I'm dealing with an eating disorder I thought I recovered from months ago... It's all just a lot. 

I miss the magic of being a kid, how every discovery felt more interesting than the less, regardless of what it was. 

I hope this post doesn't come across as pretentious, i'm just a kid who wants to feel like a kid again haha
