high school stuff I'll be honest, I wouldn't actually believe I would be doing a post here, as I'm usually a lurker in almost every single place I go, but I would like to say some things about high school as I rarely talk about it to someone, as for what I usually do during online classes(because it was really messy how I went to school; so, when the pandemic started , I didn't leaved home unless It was forced to) is basically play on a "bad" computer that doesn't have a camera and neither a microphone(so I couldn't use it for school) while the laptop that the school gave to me was in front of it and the pc was behind of it and with it I could do whatever I wanted as well as hear the class and reply when needed, so everything would be good.  
as for the classes that I have, they aren't things too harsh, like biology, practical writing *(hardest class to do because of the ambiguity),* English II, US history, ALGEBRA II(**I barely understand it by now**) and the "chosen" classes.  
principles of engineering ( I can understand it as it was supposed to be, but still confusing)  
digital media (easy class)  
and  
***A E R O S P A C E  E N G I N E E R I N G***  
I'll be honest, the class of aerospace engineering intimidated me in the beginning, because of the name , but it resulted to be a neat class, until the math entered more and I couldn't understand it properly, making almost sure that I had worse grades when *those things* started in class, like measuring temperature, pressure, lift, etc. and oh god how I wished that those things were easier to investigate and understand. . .  but anyways, what do you think?   
I'm doing it good  for someone who first language isn't English? &gt;!I mean the post and my grades, since I'm sure that, aside from 74 in algebra and around 84 on biology, all of the classes are at least 90 or higher!&lt;  
PD: idk the flair , but it's about school, so maybe the one that I put was correct
