(19M) I'm looking for friends. I'm just trying to find friends that are around my age range.  
So some stuff about me:

* I'm a nerdy guy; I'm into movies, relaxing, writing, reading, and playing video games.
* I love Mega Man, Sonic, Star Wars Legends (Fuck Disney), RWBY, Transformers, My Hero Academia and other anime, fantasy, &amp; Sci-Fi franchises. I'm into filmmaking and desire to become a writer, director, and voice actor.
* I'm laidback, honesty and open-minded.
* I have a dark, dry and sarcastic sense of humor, dark jokes are funny to me. And I can be a bit blunt at times.

DM me if you wanna be friends.
