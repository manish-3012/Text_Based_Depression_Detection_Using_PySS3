Anyone wanna chat? DMmmmmmm me :))) TheÂ orangeÂ is theÂ fruitÂ of variousÂ citrusÂ species in theÂ familyÂ RutaceaeÂ (seeÂ list of plants known as orange); it primarily refers toÂ CitrusÂ Ã—Â sinensis,[1]Â which is also calledÂ sweet orange, to distinguish it from the relatedÂ Citrus Ã— aurantium, referred to asÂ bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixisÂ throughÂ nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.[2][3][4][5]

The orange is aÂ hybridÂ betweenÂ pomeloÂ (Citrus maxima) andÂ mandarinÂ (Citrus reticulata).[2][6]Â The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo.[7]Â The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced.[2]

The orange originated in a region comprisingÂ Southern China,Â Northeast India, andÂ Myanmar,[8][9]Â and the earliest mention of the sweet orange was inÂ Chinese literatureÂ in 314 BC.[2]Â As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the mostÂ cultivatedÂ fruit tree in the world.[10]Â Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrantÂ peel.[11]Â As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus production.[12]

In 2017, 73 millionÂ tonnesÂ of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 24% of the world total, followed by China and India.[13
