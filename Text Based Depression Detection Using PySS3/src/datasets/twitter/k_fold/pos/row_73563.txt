I sometimes worry how people see me This is normal, ik, but just listen.

I fear people look at me like I'm weird, in person I consider myself to be *very* loud, I scream a lot and a lot of times I have been told I have an annoying laugh. Sometimes, while watching videos or when I'm just bored I'll start making weird noises with my mouth and shit, I also tend to make them when I get startled by something.

That's only what I do, I also worry about my tastes. Everyone around me is pretty much a stereotypical teenager, and I hate to say it cuz I sound like I'm trying to be qUirKy but in really not, but I consider myself to be...not particularly a standard teen where I'm from. Here almost all of them love sports, specially football (or soccer for Americans) or basketball but I personally don't really like sports, I mean, I DO practice handball but I'm not a fan, I don't watch handball matches or anything like that, I just play for the school team. Also, here, if you like any anime that is not DBZ/DBS or Naruto you're a weirdo, guess the two animes I don't really enjoy, take a wild guess, here if you don't like those two not many people will like you. Also I have this feeling that I'm not enough, I'm not entertaining enough to have friends and the only reason people keep me around is to feel better about themselves.


That was my little rant for today, thanks for coming to my TEDtalk, I'll be here for probably and hopefully only 6 more years.

Tldr: I'm an insecure lil bitch and I rant about it
