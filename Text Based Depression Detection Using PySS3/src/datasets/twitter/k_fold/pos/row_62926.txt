Am I getting lead on? I've liked this girl for the good part of the last year and I have a few classes together. I talk to her quite often and we usually laugh and have a good time. 

About two weeks ago I worked up the courage to ask her out (as you can see if you check my post history). Knowing that she can ski I asked if she would go skiing with me the next weekend and she said maybe. Now I know this would usually mean no-go but I wanted a solid answer so I knew for sure. Anyway, later in the week, I reminded her and she said she would let me know the next day. At this point I assumed she was trying to spare my feeling for as long as possible. Come the next day she texts me but deletes it before I got a chance to see what it was. I asked her about it and she claimed to not know (this doesn't make any sense, anyone should be able to remember what they deleted).

So at this point the date that was planned to go skiing was the next day and I still hadn't got an answer so I just figured that it was over. 

Anyway, while I was skiing (I still went with some friends without her) she texts me and tells me that the next time I go skiing she would come with. So I proposed a date and time that she said would work for her. A day later she informs me that the day would not work for her. So I suggested another time, that she also said would work for her. Again she cancelled shortly before that day. Mind you each time she cancelled she gave a valid reason (she was out of state and her parents wouldn't be coming back as soon as previously expected. She also let me know she would really like to go she just can't.

So, If you made it this far, should I just forget about it, or do you think its just really bad luck. Sorry if the answer is obvious but I'm blind to it. Thanks for reading this if you did :)
