I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m posting this~ To be honest...fuck, this is going to be disorganized as all hell because Iâ€™m just writing down what Iâ€™m thinking. I genuinely think thereâ€™s something wrong with me mentally; I want to talk to someone about it, but I know it wonâ€™t help. Iâ€™m honestly just looking for an answer to why my brain is doing the shit is it I guess. 

I know I should feel happy, but I just canâ€™t, hell when I used to get high i couldnâ€™t stop smiling now Iâ€™m just like, for lack of a better term â€œblah.â€ 

See now I feel okay again, when I started writing this I felt like shit, now Iâ€™m fine... bro I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this, as if yâ€™all doctors or something lmao.
