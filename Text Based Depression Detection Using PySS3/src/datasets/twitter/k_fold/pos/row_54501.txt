I am NOT in my rebellious phase, what YOU said was just flat out stupid and illogical. Do NOT call your child "are you in your rebellious phase" or ANYTHING along those lines. There are better alternatives to this by asking to talk about it, or offering help. We are in PUBERTY where mood swings are very OFTEN so just because it happens alot does NOT men you can call it a phase.
