I donâ€™t really know what to do So for context I am 14 and some friends I know are getting very depressed, one used to self-harm a lot and I just get all this pressure and weight on my shoulders all the time, trying to juggle these different people and aspects of my social life and I lose sleep over this a lot, and I just wonder, why do I even try? Things donâ€™t get better no matter what I do, people are still depressed and the world is falling to shit around me. I just... I wonder whatâ€™s the point in living anymore if I canâ€™t help anyone or do anything to make a change. I need something to focus on to help me forget all this shit, but I just donâ€™t know what. I need to distract myself from the world, but I donâ€™t know how. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
