I'm gonna expose myself entirely to my mom after I move out My mother thinks I don't do drugs, am super obedient, thinks I'm ridiculously boring, and would never do anything against her or the law. 

I'm entirely the opposite person she thinks I am and it would give me peace of mind her knowing who I really am. I did so much shit in high school I practically lived a double life. After I move out I've got nothing to lose, why not?
