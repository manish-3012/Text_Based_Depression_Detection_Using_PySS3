I feel better In the past week I worked only one short day so I had plenty of time to reflect on the people and recent events from my life. Most of the times Iâ€™m stressed. Itâ€™s just who I am. During covid and mainly after my first real relationship had ended (you can read about it in my first post for more context if you want) I had time to shift gears, lay back and relax. For the first time in the last few years I feel free. I finally feel great in the summer when I usually just work and do literally nothing else. Itâ€™s a slow period in work so next week Iâ€™m going to travel with some friends I havenâ€™t met in a while. 
Thereâ€™s no real point to this post. I just felt really good and I wanted to share.
