There is no Better Ravioli Than Costco Brand Ravioli. Chefboy'rd brand is inferior to Costco brand in many ways. Costco doesn't taste like soggy noodles and wet beef. Rather than having soggy beef, Costco has crumbly cheese inside the well-done noodles, covered by spaghetti sauce and more cheese. Move aside Chefboy'rd, I only accept Costco brand as my ravioli.
