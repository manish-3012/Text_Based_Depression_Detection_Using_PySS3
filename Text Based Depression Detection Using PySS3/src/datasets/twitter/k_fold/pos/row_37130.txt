Not sure if thatâ€™s a problem or not. So I have like a thingy, where I just go like â€œthere are three world. The real word, the internet world, and the imagination world.â€ And most of the people or spend their time in the internet world or the real world. But I feel like for me it is a problem because I am 90% of the time in my imagination world to the point where I could just go around in circles in my room for hours straight and not pay attention to anything other than the current world Iâ€™m in. So not sure if thatâ€™s worrying or if itâ€™s my depression being so bad to the point where I create and alternative world that I escape to.
