Hey, just a word of warning. If you are in a Zoom class, and everyone is working individually on their own work with their cameras off, PLEASE DO NOT ASK RANDOM QUESTIONS WITH YOUR MIC ON. Use the damn chat, for crying out loud. It is almost impossible to focus when people just have their mic on. SO SHUT UP
