The wild, creepy, and insane kid in my class A kid in my class, this dude- we read a book where a lady got sexually assaulted multiple times, and then the class had an open discussion on it, and why it was wrong. A dude puts his hand up, and goes on a rant about how he thinks the girl deserved it, because she was rude.

When me and the rest of my class, PLUS the teacher told him how wrong he was, he got pissed and kept saying "THATS MY OPINION!!"

He then privately messaged me, since before this I thought he was fine, and he went off at me for not DEFENDING HIM, and for being a bitch to him in class and vaguely threated me.

I blocked his dumbass and had to block him 3 times in the following month on different socials, and then later found out that he had a crush on me. YIIIIIKES.

This man was, and IS fucking crazy, and I've got more stories like when he tried to force me to meet up with him irl, (we in online school) and also the many times he threaten people with his "gang."

He also runs an Instagram meme page, and thinks his sound cloud freestyle no effort rap is gonna Collab with drake and tried to force the whole class to share his rap around.

He also accused me of being a gold digger toward him (bruh), and he thinks all woman are trash, and still wants a gf.

We are all in freshmen year of highschool.

He was in my class the last quad-mester we had and he is now in one of my new ones. Lord have mercy on my soul.
