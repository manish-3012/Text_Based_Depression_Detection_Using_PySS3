I love staying in forest in middle of the night I used to be afraid of darkness but at some point I just began to love it. I was at scout camp once and they wanted a few people to stay awake during night because they were afraid about someone who may get in the camp. So I volunteered and when others were walking everywhere in groups with flashlight on and knives and other shit to self defence  I was just chilling alone and it was awesome
