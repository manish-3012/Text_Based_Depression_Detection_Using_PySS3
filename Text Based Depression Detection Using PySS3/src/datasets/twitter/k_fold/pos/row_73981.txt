Guys help, I just feel horrible. The whole day has been bad. I know most of you guys have been through worse and all, but I just feel tired and stuff. My 8 year old brother has been constantly annoying me, someone pulled me into a stupid reddit argument, and I failed a war attack on top of that. It sucks.
