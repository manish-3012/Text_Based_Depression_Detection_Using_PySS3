Posting something I am greatful for for 7 days day 7 Well we did it! If forgot to say Happy Thanksgiving in my last post, but anyways Happy late Thanksgiving! To end off this week I guess, I am grateful for the knowledge that it will all end well. Now some of you reading this are Atheists or a different religion than me and that's alright you don't have to believe in the same god as me to understand this point. I believe that we were put on this earth by God to go through trials and experiences that will improve us physically, spiritually, social, and with our knowledge. You don't have to believe that Christ died for our sins, or that Moses parted the red sea, and any other biblical things to understand that we all have a purpose in life to become a better person than who we were. We all have weaknesses and strengths, we won't be tested on our strengths, we will be tested on our weaknesses. Although the path is withered and the sky is raining, press on. There is good to come. Amen.
