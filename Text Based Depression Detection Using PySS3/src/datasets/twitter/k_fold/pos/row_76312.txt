Im gonna text my ex tonight. How should i go about it We fell out kinda bad and im not sure why. I miss talking to her though. But im scared ima keep catching feelings for her and shit idk. But uhm, awhile ago i unadded her on everything and i think thats why she got mad at me, but i did it because i still lowkey liked her and i couldnt deal with all the boys and stuff she was posting. 

I had her number but she always left me on read or delivered. We were so close too and she told me she loved talking to me. But i think her phone was turned off. I know a guy friend of mine texts her on social media tho. It kinda gives me mixed feelings but whatever i guess. I want to ask him to text her for me and stuff but he knows how heartbroken i was because of her, heâ€™ll probably make fun of me. But hes the only way i have to talk to her. Idek if sheâ€™ll want to talk to me.
