Reasons NOT to date me but instead be my friend 1. Iâ€™m very funny and quirky, watch this joke:
(I canâ€™t think of one on the spot rn)

2. Iâ€™m very smart, I have good grade in math and you can copy my homework ðŸ‘€ 

3. Iâ€™m actually very loyal so even if you were a stranger, I wouldnâ€™t shoot you in a nerf free for all

In conclusion, I am very smart good friend, donâ€™t date me.
