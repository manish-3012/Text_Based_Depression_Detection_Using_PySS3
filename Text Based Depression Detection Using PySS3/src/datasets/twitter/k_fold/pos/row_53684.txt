Choosing a course I live in Ireland and just chose 2 courses that I could do In college. I can change them later but the ones I chose now r architecture and accounting and finance. I was wondering if u guys had any course suggestions that would pay fairly well  as a job in the future and was also interesting. I'm very physically active and I'm good at art if that's any help. Pls help out. My parents just want me to get a course which would pay well ðŸ™„
