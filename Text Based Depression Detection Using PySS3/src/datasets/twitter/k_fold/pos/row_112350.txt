I need advice please I'm an autistic 16 year old Male. My parents are divorced and remarried other people. I also have 3 younger sisters (1 step sister). My parents treat my sisters way better than I do. I was bullied senselessly for 13 years because of my condition. 

My parents spend time with my sister all the time, never with me. I generally don't remeber the last time they spent time with me that was something I wanted to do or something was wasn't a forced family thing. Then they get pissed whenever I don't want to spend time with them. My only escape is my video games and online friends I play with, and they have threatened multiple times to destroy/sell them because tHeY tAkE uP tOo MuCh TiMe Of YoUr LiFe. I have generally wanted to kill myself multiple times because of how much I got bullied and I had very few people at my side. Last night I had found out that I had 2 F's. 1 was because something got marked missing a few days before it was due (has happened before) and the other one if because my teacher won't grade any of my shit, even though the deadline for Quarter 1 work was November 20th. 

My parents said that they will destroy my shit if this keeps up. I told them everything, how I feel, how they were never there to help me when I asked for help when I was bullied senselessly, how much worse they treat me than my sisters, told then that there were so many times that I wanted to kill myself because it was too much. I told them that if they destroyed/sold the one thing that is basically keeping me from ending it, I would cut contact with everyone of my parents (parents and step parents). 

Did I over react or did I do the right thing?
