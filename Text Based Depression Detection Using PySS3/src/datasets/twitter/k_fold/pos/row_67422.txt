"Just ask her out, WCGW?" is dumb. I always read this advise everywhere, "Just ask her/him out, the worst that can happen is she/he saying no"

If you're talking to someone and enjoy her company, the worst that can happen isn't she/he saying no, it's the possibility of things getting so awkward that you will ruin a friendship for both of you.
