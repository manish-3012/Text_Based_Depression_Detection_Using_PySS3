Wanted to make a meme about this but it keeps getting taken down, My English teacher was taking attendance and called out by name, I answered normally but suddenly she asked my father's name after hearing it she said "Oh that's his name, I know your father".

I did not know how to respond to that situation, so my anxiety filled ass went "Yeah, me too".

Why did my brain have to do that?
