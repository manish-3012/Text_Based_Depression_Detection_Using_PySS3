Nobodyâ€™s going to care Nobodyâ€™s going to care because itâ€™s not your problem but Iâ€™ve had multiple breakdowns because of the stress that online schooling has on me, there all over the place, they donâ€™t talk to the students they talk to there computers, and when the audio breaks up They call you out for interrupting class because you asked if they could repeat that. Itâ€™s just so fucking dumb I want to cry.
