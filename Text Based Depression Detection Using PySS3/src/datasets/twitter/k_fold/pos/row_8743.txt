theres this girl who joined our school halfway through the school last year. i had a class with her and she was just naturally very beautiful. not hot, just pretty. everyone thought so, even the straight girls and gay boys. she wore aviator glasses, she has poofy straight hair and bangs, sheâ€™s fairly tan, and she dresses kinda alternative.

she never talks but she would compliment my clothing sometimes and also she had a boyfriend. i wish i talked to her more. not cuz sheâ€™s pretty or anything tho, she just had a very interesting personality and i need more girl friends
