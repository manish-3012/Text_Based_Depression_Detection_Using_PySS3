I got drunk for the first time. In no way do I want any of you guys attempting drinking. I'm almost 18 (which still isn't good, I get that) and also, it seriously burns your stomach and makes you super nauseous. There are definitely better things out there... My dad only let me because he wants me to be able to make mistakes near him and not near dangerous people who might take advantage of me while I'm vulnerable. 

I just really wanna talk about it to someone, as it's a really weird feeling. 

Firstly, I mixed some vodka with cranberry juice (Which was awful... Holy shit the burn....) and we sat and watched Bugs (a 70's movie about exploding mutant cockroaches) and we both got increasingly more drunk (my Dad's divorce is going slowly so we just drank our feelings a bit) we didn't get overly drunk, just to a point that we get tipsy and happy. 

I'm on medication (Seroquel, which I already checked to make sure it was okay. I'll just be extra sleepy which is fine cause I'm at home) which didn't really effect anything. And again, I didn't drink a lot at all, like literally just a few sips. My dad says that you should never drink past your limit, and once you feel good and silly, you don't need to drink anymore. 

Right now it's 2am and I'm eating crazy bread next to my dad who's sleeping. It seemed to not really put me to sleep, which isn't rare since I'm an extreme insomniac. Regardless, I feel kinda indifferent. Like not sad or happy. It's kinda hard to focus, and it's taken like an hour to write this out as I keep stopping and watching Bob's Burgers. 

I'm pretty spaced out like I'm numb all over. I feel better now since it's been a few hours. But it was pretty weird. I feel like me and my dad had a nice time and were able to forget about the shit going on with my mom for a few. Overall, I'm happy I got to have this experience with him.
