How young is too young for a relationship? Iâ€™ve been getting close with a girl lately and wanted to ask her out on a date. Sheâ€™s 19 and Iâ€™m only 17, that is were the problem arises. I think I might be a bit too young but am still not sure. We have been getting to know each other pretty well and I think it could work out (I hope ;-;) What do you all think about this age gap, is it too big or does anyone think it might detour her away? Thanks &lt;3
