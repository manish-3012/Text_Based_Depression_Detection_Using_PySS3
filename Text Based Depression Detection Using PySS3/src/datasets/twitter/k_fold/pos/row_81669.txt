Just realized my crush was being manipulative I was thinking about previous school year before Labor Day ends and I need to go back to school and I realized my crush was manipulating me so she could get popular with her friends because "A bOy LiKeS mE" or something like that. and I feel really shitty. Oh well. Nothing major but it still hurts a lot.
