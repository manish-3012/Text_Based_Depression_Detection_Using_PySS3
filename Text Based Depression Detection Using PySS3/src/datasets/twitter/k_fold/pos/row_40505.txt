I never realized this So this is personal but my dad gets drunk like an dad but my dad does it for a reason. He has to watch people die, pull headless people out of cars and a whole lot more shit that a lot of people don't see. I am just telling me that things my dad sees you will probably never see. He is a badass dad.
