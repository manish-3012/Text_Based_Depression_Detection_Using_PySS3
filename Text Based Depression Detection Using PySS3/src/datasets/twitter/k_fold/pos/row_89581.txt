So Iâ€™m taking a chemistry course and I need answers for a research/homework 
Hey, so this is my second day in the course and one of the activities was make a research.
The research consist on asking people of the female sex (overage, in Mexico is +18) what are their opinions on the fact that women have access to contraceptives pills or patches, and how does this affects their life.
It would be of so much help if you can answer this, itâ€™s just a homework so I need help and answers of quite some people. :)) 

Thank you for taking your time to read this.
