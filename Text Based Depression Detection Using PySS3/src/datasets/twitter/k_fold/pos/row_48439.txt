Hey teenagers, Iâ€™m an adult planning to have a baby and it would be cool if there was an ask a teenager sub. Our (millennial) boomer parents had no idea what the fuck to do with us so... If one of you were to create or take over the modding of the current zero member ask a teenager subreddits, that would be SO COOL. I donâ€™t want to have to come to this sub as a future parent to ask a question about teens and I know yâ€™all donâ€™t want that either. So is anyone willing to create a sub for this?

Seems like r/askateen and r/askateenager both exist but there are zero members so theyâ€™re up for grabs.

You have probably like 13-15 years to make this happen for it to work for me so if any of you beautiful geniuses feel like doing this, probably most of us olds in our 30s right now would love it. Also the super olds that already have teenagers and somehow understand reddit would like it too!

Let me know what you think! Iâ€™ll join right away! Please and thank you!
