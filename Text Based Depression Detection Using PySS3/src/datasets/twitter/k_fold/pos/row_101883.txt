So there's this family whose kid's go to my school. Let's just say that family is worth literally billions of dollars. Let's just say they have a daughter in 9th grade. Lets just say if I were to get into a relationship with her and somehow stay together long enough I could possible work myself into the family fortune. Lets just say if I were to do this I already have a leg up since I'm cool with her brother who's a junior. Let's just say that the father is an alum of the school also so I could probably get a chance to contact him because lets just say my school does a lot with alumni. Lets just say I leverage every one of them so they all like me.
