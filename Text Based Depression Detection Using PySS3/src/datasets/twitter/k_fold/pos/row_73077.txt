How long before me and my friend's relationship is normal again? She figured out I had a crush on her a few days ago and has refused to talk about it since. She's said that she's just uncomfortable with everything right now. I have to finally see her at school since then tomorrow and it's going to be weird. How long before this all goes back to the happy normal way it was before?
