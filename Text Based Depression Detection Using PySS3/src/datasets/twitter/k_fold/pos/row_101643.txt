I havenâ€™t been having a good year mentally and I decided to buy a snail to try to make me happier Ever since my brother got an aquatic snail, Iâ€™ve been wanting a land snail. I figured Iâ€™d get him to try to cheer myself up because the past month or so has been pretty rough for me mentally. My boyfriend was so confused as to why in the world I would buy a snail as a pet but honestly, now that heâ€™s finally home, Iâ€™m really happy. My boyfriend has been helping me out a ton too with my mental health. Canâ€™t thank him enough :)
