If anybody needs to get feelings or stuff out just post it in the comments, Iâ€™m not one to judge. If you need to spout anything like â€œoh Iâ€™m depressed because quarantine and schoolâ€ then just post it, Iâ€™m again; not one to judge, I feel like schools been hitting me like a truck and that you should be able to share your opinions.
