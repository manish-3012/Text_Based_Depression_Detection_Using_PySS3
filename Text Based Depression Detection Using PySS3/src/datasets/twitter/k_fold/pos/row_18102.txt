Hey, do you wanna tell me something which you won't tell anyone you know. We are internet strangers so we can tell each other anything without any worries.

For me it's that I stopped feeling emotions and also seem to have no empathy left for others. Well I am trying to be my usual self but I just don't seem to care anymore.

OK, not it's your term.
