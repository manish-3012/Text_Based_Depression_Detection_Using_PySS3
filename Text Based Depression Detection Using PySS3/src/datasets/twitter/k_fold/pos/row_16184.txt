Iâ€™m really angry with my parents rn so imma vent a bit So I expressed my opinion with my parents about how school doesnâ€™t really teach me anything I need to know for a modern day job. Itâ€™s great for a job from the 20th century however I think that these jobs that are more reliant on being creative and innovative conflict with our school systemâ€™s way of teaching us to sit down and follow instructions. Given, there are exceptions, as there are with anything, but I feel this is accurate for the vast majority of situations. My parents disagreed. We all got angry with each other after having a very heated â€œdiscussionâ€ and I went to my room to chill for a bit before going to sleep. Next thing I know I hear a bang on my door and it is my mother who now says I canâ€™t use my phone or my computer. Ik Iâ€™m very spoiled and Iâ€™m trying to get better, but I was not in the right mindset to comply. So I was defiant. I had yet another â€œdiscussionâ€ with her until my father came back inside with the dog. He joined in and to sum it up, I wasnâ€™t looking forward to my second semester and thought none of it would help me, and they thought that school was about teaching us life lessons and that I should have an open mind. The life lessons they suggested were how to be organized (self-taught/Internet), how to take notes (an actually good teacher in middle school, which contradicts my argument but Iâ€™m not a liar), and how to follow instructions (great for a job where thatâ€™s the focus of it, but I donâ€™t plan on working in a field that requires that for too long). I do understand that school teaches you things. It teaches you how to memorise and repeat information. It teaches you that sometimes you canâ€™t get out of things because you donâ€™t enjoy doing them. Eventually, we came to the conclusion that we were just arguing and werenâ€™t getting anywhere and that we would try again after I meet with my therapist (i meet with her on Tuesday). I guess what I am most angry about is that I feel like they treat me like a child, but expect me to act like an adult. They are my parents, and they have the right to restrict my freedoms and again Iâ€™m a spoiled piece of shit, but I guess I feel like Iâ€™m constantly getting yelled at for being wrong about a subjective matter. I would love to hear some of your opinions on this and perhaps advice on how I can be better when having these â€œdiscussions.â€ 

TLDR pissed at parents cuz they got mad at me for disagreeing on school.

Also a â€œdiscussionâ€ is a glorified argument to me
