Advice; like wtf even is this Iâ€™m in a bit of a bizarre relationship with this girl. Iâ€™m 17M in my senior year of high school. Iâ€™ve known this girl  for about 2 years. Near the beginning of junior year she invited to her house for Halloween.I admitted to liking her and she liked me back so we dated for a few months before she broke it off. Due to the fact that we had 3 classes together as well a hour long study period, we ended up seeing eachother every weekday and ended up still being friends. Fast forward to this summer we are still talking over text  and she messages me that her boyfriend dumped her.No big deal. We continue talking until she tells me that she still likes me and while sheâ€™s not ready to date again because she is still recovering from her previous ex, she says will tell me when she is ready to date again if I want to give it a second chance. I should add that she is not a girl that likes to play just a girl who had some really bad bfs in the past. She is a genuinely nice person and I still kind of like her. Should I wait for her next r should I just brush her off?
