Remote learning sucks. I just feel so unmotivated. I have been getting my missing assignments done but I have this feeling of anxiety in my stomach that I can't get rid of. I'm scared of getting left back but a part of me knows it won't get that bad but another part of me is like what if it does? I can't eat and I can't sleep. I feel horrible. I had missing assignments in the past too but this anxious feeling is really getting to me. It randomly came out of nowhere and I feel sick. It's the feeling of wanting to cry but nothing coming out.
