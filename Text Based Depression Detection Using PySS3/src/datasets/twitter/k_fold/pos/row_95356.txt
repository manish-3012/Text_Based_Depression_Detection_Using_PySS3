How many times do they give you the ACT and SAT in school? I'm in my junior year and they just gave the ACT. I don't remember signing up for it, so I didn't end up taking it. But they're giving the SAT soon and after I missed the ACT I got really worried about whether or not I fucked myself over missing the ACT (I live in the midwest) so I was wondering how many times they give the test.
