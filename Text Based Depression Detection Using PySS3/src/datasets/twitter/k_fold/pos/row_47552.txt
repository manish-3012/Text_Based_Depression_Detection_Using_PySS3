Why does this sub fake depression and/or pretend to be suicidal so much I see so many memes on here about people's "depression" and how they "lost a will to live". Basically y'all are acting like it's comedy to say "Im depressed I lost a will to live xD". It's obvious you're not actually depressed though and in reality you're just faking it for attention. If you're actually depressed seek help irl but if you make a meme about it don't expect me to believe it. Y'all only get positive attention for it because most of this sub is gullible

DM me if you wanna argue because I can only say something once every 14 minutes due to my negative karma in this sub
