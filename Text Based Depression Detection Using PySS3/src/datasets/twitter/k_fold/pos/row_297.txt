I'm dreading college I start my first day of senior year tomorrow (it's that dumbass zoom shit not real school), and I'm really dreading college. I get really homesick so I'm going to need to come home a ton but there's only 2 schools within biking distance that I'm applying to, and one of them is super competitive, and the other based of their subreddit is full of asshole boring kids. I also don't like the idea of college culture. I'm an accepting person, but I'm the type of kid to make pretty offensive jokes, and college kids are super sensitive about that. I also don't like the vibe where your expected to be mature, like I love being a kid. I feel like college kids are too serious and mature compared to high schoolers and I don't like that. I'm not too worried about making friends, but also like I'm barely halfway through puberty so I'm gonna look mad young. I also need to play a sport to occupy myself, and sense I'm not good enough to play varsity in college, I'd have to form some sort of club sport team which is a ton of work.
