My teen years are almost over and I don't have any friends. How do I make friends? In my school, no one has any common interests with me. I'm an introvert, and I don't think people wil enjoy my interests. My country also speaks 2 main languages, english and its own. I prefer to use english since I'm better at it, but the problem is, not many people in my country speak english and people here find it weird when you do. My teen years are almost over, and I don't wanna live my life knowing and telling others that I didn't have any friends in highschool or my childhood. Help.
