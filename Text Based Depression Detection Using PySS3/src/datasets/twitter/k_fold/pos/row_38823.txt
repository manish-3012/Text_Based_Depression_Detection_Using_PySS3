What do I believe in now It's been 6 months now.

6 months since I turned my back on God. 

I concluded for various reasons that there cannot be a loving god, and therefore there can be no hope for the future.

I miss it, I miss having something I could believe in. But it's gone now, and it can never come back. I'm in a dark place, I have been for some time, but there is no hope, nobody is coming to save me, and in the end we all die alone. 

So why do I try.
