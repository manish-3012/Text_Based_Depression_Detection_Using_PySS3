Today was a good day Woke up feeling good, got through the school day had a good lunch then went to jazz band. At jazz band Iâ€™ve been the only sax coming to in person so it feels like Im soloing when Im playing with my homies in jazz ensemble. Today we were at rehearsal playing Chameleon(good song btw love it) and the BD started choosing the people in the zoom to unmute and play a solo, of course only one person unmuted out of 5 people he choose so he made us in person improvise. I think I actually did well, better than yesterday when improvising. Ive been the only one to go to each in person rehearsal this week out of our jazz ensemble so hopefully my BD will notice me more. Then I got home finished spanish hw ate dinner and then took out my doggos for a walk. After me and Tito played outside I had his favorite tug of war toy and he would always run and chase after me. Just a vent about my day carry on
