New poem I wrote, title is Untethered. Plz give feedback  The stars will not look down without pity,

And I will not look up without pleasure.

Untethered by nature, unnurtured and bound

In leather and spikes, hear the roar

That will come from the rear,

Bullets and bikes, my homeland, my cry.

Rapture comes in waves of steel,

And heavy black smoke too thick to be real.

Death is a choice. The ride is a steal.

&amp;#x200B;

Risk is a given, but what can I say?

Anger within says I like it that way.

Freak by spite. Bane by right.

Untethered I roam, I wander

Beneath where stars may groan,

I shed my skin and peel my face,

Because Iâ€™m untethered to this world,

Untethered to my life,

Untethered to whatever you think is right.

The lifeline means nothing.

I made my own deadline.
