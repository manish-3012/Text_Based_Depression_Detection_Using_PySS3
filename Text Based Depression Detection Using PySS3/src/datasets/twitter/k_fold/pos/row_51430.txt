I'm genuinely curious so tell me... I want to know how you do your own introspection 
I'll start 

â€¢ when I'm out and about and do something I I don't like I make a note (if it's small I deal with it then &amp; there) 

â€¢ I let myself feel it and address how I can fix it 

â€¢ mother fucking breathe its important 

â€¢ jungian psychology states that the shadow is a important part of yourself and is your friend, so if I say/think a dark and disturbing thing It was me who thought that is me

â€¢ I don't have a mold or definition so I can Express myself however I feel like

Yep, that's me , I'm expecting to be roasted or ignored but had to ask how yall do it.
