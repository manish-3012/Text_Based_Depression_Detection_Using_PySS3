I hate MrBeast I hate MrBeast

Well I donâ€™t hate him. I just find him rather annoying. He used to make funny videos. Like the Worst Intros on YouTube series. But now his videos arenâ€™t even entertaining. Iâ€™m not the type of guy to complain to MrBeast about him being greedy and manipulative. I just think his videos are shit. Itâ€™s like watching deal or no deal. Watching other people get money is not entertaining. And his fan base is shit. On his last video some guy got 100k likes for saying â€œfinally an idea Morgz canâ€™t copy because he has no friends.â€ Itâ€™s like mocking a childrenâ€™s show. His youtube is for children so stop acting like you are all high and mighty. I donâ€™t know man I just wish his videos would go away. So do you guys agree with me on this?
