Using this sub as diary day 9 Today was a normal school day... but  i rejected a reunion for being completely used to having to say no LMAO I'll try changing that in the future but for now my eyes are on the goal I've started looking for some job offers close to me. Anything else really notable.

Rating my day a 6/10 not suicidal at all and not extremely sad so all that's left's it's see to tomorrow
