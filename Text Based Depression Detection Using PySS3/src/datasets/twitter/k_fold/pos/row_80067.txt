I'm doing a second r/teenagers Hunger Games! Join now! Title. I did one like six months ago and I think it did really well. If you want to see how that went, click \[here\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/enea0o/results\_for\_rteenagers\_hunger\_games/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/enea0o/results_for_rteenagers_hunger_games/) ) . If you want in, comment below. There's only 24 spots. If we don't get enough, i'll post again after this post dies until we get enough. If you don't specify your gender, i'll just leave it at random. I'll post the results after we get all 24. 

WARNING: YOU WILL GET LIKE 5-30 NOTIFICATIONS WHEN I PUT IT OUT DEPENDING ON HOW WELL YOU PLACE. 

In case you didn't know, you can do your own simulations \[here\]( [https://brantsteele.net/hungergames/disclaimer.php](https://brantsteele.net/hungergames/disclaimer.php))
