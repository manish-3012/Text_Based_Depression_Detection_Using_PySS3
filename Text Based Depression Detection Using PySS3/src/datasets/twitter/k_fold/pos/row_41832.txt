I outsmarted my teacher My Literature teacher assigned us a project where we had to write a letter to our future selves that she will mail to us in five years.  The letter had to be at least 2 pages but after about half a page I couldnâ€™t think of anything else to say.  I remembered that my teacher said that she wouldnâ€™t read it so that we wouldnâ€™t be afraid to write personal stuff in it but I figured that she might at least look at it to make sure it was 2 pages long, so I copied and pasted the same text I just wrote over and over until it filled two pages.


I got full credit for the assignment if you were wondering.
