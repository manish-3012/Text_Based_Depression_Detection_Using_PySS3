What's a good thing to say if you can't play video games with your friends? I need help, its not that i dont want to play with them, but they all have strong pcs and ask me to play R6S or rocket league or fortnite or gta or any game like that and when they ask me why I can't play, I say that I have some work to do because I would be embarrassed to tell them that I have a laptop that is almost as old as us and that I can't play with them.




Yeah, and they will be making fun of me, I still remember that poor dude that got made fun of for not wearing a real off-white t-shirt :/
