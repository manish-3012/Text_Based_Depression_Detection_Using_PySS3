As we know the vaccine is just about to come in a few weeks, How's my idea for a vaccination campaign

A big group will be organised to go to the vaccination center and everyone will get vaccinated in the group.

After everyone gets vaccinated, one person will start video recording and everyone in the group will simultaneously throw their masks in the air.

Just the way university students throw their hats in the air on graduation day, this could be epic.

What do y'all think?
