Its another one of those times Its just another one of those days. I know a lot of you know what I'm talking about because we are teens after all. I'm just feeling all of the emotions except joy right now. Nothing bad is going on in life, but the meds just aren't enough at the moment. I'm feeling sad and anxious but mostly alone. I want so bad to just have someone to hug and talk about my day with and just do ordinary, everyday tasks with someone. I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone and that no one could ever love me. My self esteem is low and I don't think too much of my body either. Because of this I'm developing eating disorders. They aren't too bad yet, but they could go that way in time. I'm having bad thoughts. Most of you know what I mean by that. I want to cut and harm, but I can't bring myself to do it. I really don't want to die, but sometimes I think it would solve everything I'm struggling with. I so badly want to start a family one day, but I'm scared it'll never happen. I wonder if my life even matters. I wonder if anyone would even care. I feel like my friends aren't really friends with me and that they just pity me because of how stupid and unlikable I am; the reason they hang out with me is to make them look like good people for taking on this charity case of a person. If you read this, thank you. Please know I am safe and nothing will happen to me. I felt the need to speak out. Although today I'm sad, tomorrow is another opportunity to be happy.
