Broth in a cup For some reason my family gets really weirded out when I pour leftover broth into a mug or cup and take it with me wherever I'm going, or just drink it at the table, because drinking from the bowl is difficult to do with one hand and I like browsing Reddit or chatting with friends while drinking my broth.

I always get questioned about it, but it just seems like the most logical solution since I like drinking the broth.
