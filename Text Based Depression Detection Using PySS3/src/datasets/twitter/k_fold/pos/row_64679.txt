Who would anyone vacation to BC (trigger warning this is some dark stuff from a local) first off corona so get back inside, second off human trafficking is rampant I know someone who moved here and more people went missing from BC than in South Africa, third there is a forest dubbed by the locals called the gaywoods if you go there after dark it's a high chance of getting r*ped are through the roof, fourth speed problems are everywhere on the island so basically everyone has been or is a tweaker fifth other places look better than where crackheads go to die
