I need help I have a crush on someone. We live in different towns, go to different schools, cant drive, are in national lockdown and we can only communicate through instagram.

I know it's not ideal but I'm such an introvert and I cant get them out of my head.

To confirm, we are both very similar. Love family, like the outdoors and animals and have a bit of an emo side.
