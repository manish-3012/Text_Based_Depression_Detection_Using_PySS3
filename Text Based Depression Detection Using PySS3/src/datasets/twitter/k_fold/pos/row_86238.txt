I literally just donâ€™t talk I feel like I have a lot to say but I rarely initiate conversations and say random things to a large group of people. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I feel like I think a lot about this extrovert introvert shit and honestly, Iâ€™m done even trying to figure out what I like. I think I love having long conversations with people and I love having friends but whatâ€™s funny is that I CANâ€™T EVEN FUCKING TALK. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m incapable of it or something but itâ€™s just that Itâ€™s too much of a risk. It gets me super anxious and I canâ€™t take it anymore. I say the most cliche things and I feel like I just say the same shit as everyone else because I canâ€™t even step out of my own comfort zone. My friends have no idea who I am because I donâ€™t want to come off a certain way by revealing too much of who I am. Iâ€™m happy that they donâ€™t know the parts of me that Iâ€™m ashamed of but at the same time I wish they knew how I felt all the time. I just want someone to not be judge mental I guess. You know what?? I canâ€™t even talk properly to me non judgmental friends either so it could just be in my head. I could just be constantly criticizing every single thing I say. Who the fuck is gonna study every word that that comes out of my mouth other than me? Itâ€™s kinda funny because Iâ€™m also really embarrassed after typing this post but I just wanted to say all this for some reason. I wish I could just TALK without worrying that I said some dumb shit. I mean if I donâ€™t say some dumb shit every once in a while people are probably gonna think Iâ€™m a robot who doesnâ€™t have any original opinions on things. I feel like Iâ€™ve completely LOST my personality beca I hate myself so much. Thatâ€™s the end of that, no one is gonna even reach this far
