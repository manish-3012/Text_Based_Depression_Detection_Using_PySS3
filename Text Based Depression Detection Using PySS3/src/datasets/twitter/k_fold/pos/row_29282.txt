more expensive medal awards are useless to me if you want to show you like someone's post alot you should give them many golds instead of getting platinum or argentium since the gold will give the person more coins and more ad free time. like it should be the opposite. if stuff is more expensive then you should get even more. not the opposite. so instead of spending 20 000 on argentium maybe get 20 000 in golds with a better value for more bonuses
