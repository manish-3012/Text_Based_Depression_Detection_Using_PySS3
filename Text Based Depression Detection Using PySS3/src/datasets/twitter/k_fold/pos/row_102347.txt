My friend asked me to be "Friends with benefits" with her and I don't know what to do... One of my few friends asked me to be friends with benefits with her. She made it clear that she didn't want anything romantic, but wanted me to "rail" her. She had a crush on me in the past and I said I didn't feel the same way, and I still don't have a romantic feeling towards her. I go to an all-boys school, live in the woods, and I don't get out much. I'd prefer to give my virginity to someone I do feel romantic about, even if I know they're not "the one". However, I probably won't get a chance to lose it anytime soon (like years) so I don't know if I want to miss this opportunity.

A part of me really wants to do it because I know I won't get a chance for years, but another part of me doesn't want to do it because I want to give it to someone I care about more than a friend. I'm really confused and would like someone who lived through a similar situation to give me advice.
