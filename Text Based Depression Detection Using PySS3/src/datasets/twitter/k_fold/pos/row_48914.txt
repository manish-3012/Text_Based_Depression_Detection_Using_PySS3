Hey youâ€™re actually pretty good looking I donâ€™t know why youâ€™re doubting yourself mate, even if youâ€™re not a HOTSHOT, â€˜averageâ€™ and â€˜below averageâ€™ is still beautiful 
 
And those insecurities you got? Donâ€™t even stress over em. You donâ€™t need someone elseâ€™s validation to feel important, and they donâ€™t define whether or not youâ€™re   â€œuglyâ€ 

Youâ€™re the main character even when you donâ€™t feel like it - SO GO DRINK SOME WATER, STRAIGHTEN YOUR BACK, AND BE THE MOST BADDEST KING/QUEEN YOU KNOW ARE YOU BUTTFACE

:D
