How many of you have jobs? I am 17 years old, and have never had a "real" job. Meaning, that I have not actually gone through the employment process of applying for jobs, and creating a resume. I have done babysitting here and there. There was a summer that I washed cars for money, and mowed lawns for money. I also was volunteering, but then the pandemic happened and I stopped. But, that's about it. Is it bad to wait until you are done with high school to get a job? It would seem like the best thing for me to get my first job when I am 18(the summer between going to college). Is it abnormal to get your first job at 18?

Also, I don't live in a rich family. We are in the low income bracket, but I don't see why I should get a "real" job now. I mostly focus on school. I use the money I get for Christmas, birthdays, and side jobs to pay for clothes and my phone plan. I also don't drive yet, so I don't have to pay for insurance.
