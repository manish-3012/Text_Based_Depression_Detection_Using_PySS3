non trans gender dysphoria be like menstruation: \*exists\*

me: fuck this, fuck womanhood

\-----------------------------------------------

bras that have padding in the shape of boobs: \*exist\*

me: no

sports bras that flatten boobs: \*exist\*

me: I'm only gonna wear these kinds

\------------------------------------------------

explanation:

I do experience minor gender dysphoria on certain things, but I don't want to become transgender, not because of society, but because the gender dysphoria is incredibly minor and can easily be fixed by either waiting out my period or wearing sports bras/baggy clothes.

plus changing my identity would be fucking hard, I try to change my username when I no longer like it, but thats about it
