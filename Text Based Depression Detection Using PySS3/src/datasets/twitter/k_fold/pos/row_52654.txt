My parents wonâ€™t let me hang out with any boy before meeting them first so let me start out by saying this hasnâ€™t always been like this. when i was a freshman and sophomore, they let me hang out with guys and only needed to meet them if i was planning on dating them. for some reason though, lately, even though iâ€™m a JUNIOR and i have my liscense, they started doing this out of the blue. every single time i would ask to hang out with a guy, even just as friends, my parents said they had to meet him first. this is super frustrating because it makes it super awkward and sends the wrong message. what can i say to them to change their mind about this? itâ€™s horrible.
