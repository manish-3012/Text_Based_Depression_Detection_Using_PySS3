STOP FAKING MENTAL ILLNESS FOR ATTENTION I am so sick of people who say stupid shit like, "my social anxiety was acting up..." Or, "my depression is acting up," when they're self diagnosing and it's not true. STOP. It's not fucking cool to be depressed or anxious or have an eating disorder or anything else along those lines. You're just selfishly taking time, energy and effort away from those who actually need help. Please, if you're actually experiencing mental illness, get diagnosed and get help. But please stop taking this for attention. OK! RANT OVER! Ily all and have a great day!
