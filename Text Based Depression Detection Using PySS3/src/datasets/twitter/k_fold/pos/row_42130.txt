Iâ€™m sorry, I just needed a place to vent Some days I feel like I don't exist and I like it sometimes. But it gets lonely, especially when I have no one to talk to. I miss having friends, I miss the feeling that not everyone hated me and to be honest, I don't know how long I can go on like this, should I talk to someone or just keep bottling it up?

Would anyone honestly miss me if I were to just disappear, or if I were to just stop existing. people say they would miss me but how do I know they're telling truth and not just lying to make me feel better or pretend like they care? 
How do I know that my family and my only actual friend care about me?
