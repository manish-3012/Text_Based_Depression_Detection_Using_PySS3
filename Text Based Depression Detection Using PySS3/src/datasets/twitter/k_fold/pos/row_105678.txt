The cucumber paradox A cucumber is like 99% water. This means that it's not *entirely* made out of water, it contains some mass of solid. This means that the mass is wet, as it's in contact with water, right? But the cucumber contains water, which is not wet; water itself isn't wet but it makes other objects wet. Therefore, the cucumber is not wet. But, the cucumber contains mass which is wet.

Does this mean that the cucumber is wet, not wet, or both? If it's wet, does that mean the solid itself is wet? If it's not wet, does that mean the solid's mass in a cucumber is negligable? If it's both, it implies that the cucumber as a whole is wet, meaning it applies to all matter pertained in the cucumber, meaning the water is both wet and not wet, and that the solid is both wet and not wet -- both of which is 50% true. If it's none, are you an idiot?
