So... I failed to April fool my friends just because they didn't knew the meme. So I had a very good plan to April fool my friends.

The plan was simple I made a yt channel and uploaded a channel trailer (https://youtu.be/RE2PhqhA1FA). Its all seems legit at first but it have a never gonna give you up in it so it's basically a Rick roll. 

I posted the video link on my story and then I waited for expected comments but comments and replies I got were... very unusual. I got replies like congratulations and fire emojies. I was confused but after a bit of thinking I found the biggest flaw in my plan.

MY FRIENDS DON'T KNOW WHAT RICK ROLL IS.

I posted another story asking if they knew what Rick roll is and all except 2 or 3 replied no. 

So basically, I did sooo much, making a channel, making a video, planning everything and at last I failed BECAUSE they didn't knew what Rick roll is.
