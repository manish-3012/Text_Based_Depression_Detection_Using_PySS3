I think I still have feelings from my last crush I thought that I stopped liking her months ago but lately I've been thinking that maybe I never really got over her. I really did like her a lot but never planned on asking her out for reasons. Plus we haven't talked at since school was let out for virus (nkt that we talked a whole lot at that point anyways) and idk if I'll see her again anytime soon so I can't now

But how do I handle this? I was hoping to start dating sometime soon but (other than me not knowing how to talk to girls) this would definitely make that hard if I still like her.
