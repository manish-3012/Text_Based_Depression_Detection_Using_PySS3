Applying for jobs in person So basically this was my idea before quarantine, go into a bunch of places, ask for a job, and one is bound to say yes

Well, Iâ€™ve applied online and didnâ€™t get answers back so Iâ€™m considering doing this, but Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s socially acceptable anymore due to covid 

What are yâ€™alls thoughts?
