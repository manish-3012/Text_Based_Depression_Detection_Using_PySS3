Talking about random stuff: Day 95 Well, school's starting in a week. At least I have a lot of classes with my friends. Although I don't think half of my teachers will have Zoom meetings. Oh yeah, I also have to reinstall Zoom. 

Fucking hell, the pressure is already here. My school doesn't say what time to come to school and pick up my textbooks. I'm worried I'll miss it or come at the wrong time. On top of that, I can't log in to the school's website for homework and tests.
