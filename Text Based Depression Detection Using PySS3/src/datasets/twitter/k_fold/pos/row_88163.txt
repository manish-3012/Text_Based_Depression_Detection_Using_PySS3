Does anyone have suggestions about some songs for a playlist i'm making? The playlist is for songs i can imagine listening to on a road trip staring out the window. It's pretty random in my opinion, but i like the idea. If you do get what i mean, i could suggestions for new songs.

so far i have:
Boredom - Tyler, the Creator
More Than a Feeling - Boston
Dear Mr. Fantasy - Traffic
Rocket Man - Elton John 
Tomorrow Comes Today - Gorrilaz
Country Roads - John Denver 
Supersonic Rocket-ship - The Kinks 
Octopus' Garden - The Beatles
What You Won't do for Love - Bobby Caldwell 
Atmosphere- Guns and Cigarettes
Ziggy Stardust - David Bowie

this is a random idea that i don't expect to work, and please don't make fun of my music taste lol
