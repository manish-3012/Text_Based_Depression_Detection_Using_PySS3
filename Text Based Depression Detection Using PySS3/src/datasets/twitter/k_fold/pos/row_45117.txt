Is asking someone how they have been after they've sent you a meme yesterday and you only reacted to that awkward? like yesterday, they have sent me a meme and i said "HAHAHAH" "i felt that" and then they left me on read. and then today i said "alsoo how have you been?" since it has been quite a while since we had a proper conversation together.

but now i'm starting to wonder if that's weird to ask lmao
