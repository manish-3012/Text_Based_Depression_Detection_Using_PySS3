Will anyone be able to love me once I don't have genitals? Hey. I'm an 18yo enby (AFAB). Me and my family are currently sorting out 0lans to have my reproductive system completely removed. This will leave me with just smooth skin like a barbie doll where my vagina currently is.  

Getting the surgery is definitely the right choice for me, I have server dysphoria so the fact that I have genitals causes me extream upset and uncomfortablity so getting them removed will be a major improvement on my life. 

However I'm still worried on how this will effect certain aspects of my life. I'm out as agender and I haven't gotten many issues because of it (I live in a very liberal part of Manhattan and everyone I know is LGBT+ positive), but actually removing my genitals is a step beyond what many people might be comfortable with. 

The main thing I'm worried about is how it will impact my love life. I'm worried about how girls will see me in terms of a partner once they know my vagina is gone. I recently told a girl who I liked about my dysphoria and it seems like any possibility of sex or romance is gone now. I'm really worried that I wont be able to find a girl who loves me once I don't have genitals. (I'm too dysphoric to use my genitals for sex so Im purely a bottom.) And in general I'm worried a lot of people will see me as some sort of freak. I'm really anxious about my ability to find a girlfriend after the surgery. 

Will I still be able to find love if I don't have genitals?
