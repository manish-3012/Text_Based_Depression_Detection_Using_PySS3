My brother introduced me to COD mobile and itâ€™s a lot more fun than I thought lol. Usually Iâ€™m a sore loser and I prefer more simple games like Minecraft, but COD is really fun.

And surprisingly I take defeat pretty okay.

Iâ€™ve won a lot of battle royales with my brother and managed to win one solo.

I think my preferred gun is the AK117.
