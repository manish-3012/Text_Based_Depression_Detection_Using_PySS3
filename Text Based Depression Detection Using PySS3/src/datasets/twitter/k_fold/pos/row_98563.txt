I have watched more anime then i remember. But i still don't want to live in Japan nor do i have a "waifu" sure, there are a few female anime characters i like but as a character and i don't masturbate to them. And i speak English instead of saying shit like "baka" or "kawaii" because i am not Japanese and if i say these words i will look like a fucking idiot to Japanese people because i am very clearly saying them wrong.
