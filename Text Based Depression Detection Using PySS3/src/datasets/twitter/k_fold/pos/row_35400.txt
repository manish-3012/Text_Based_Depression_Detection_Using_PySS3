Ok so I'm confused. Has to deal with the spanish language. You know how when you refer to non binary people, they sometimes prefer they/them? Well, in the spanish language, wtf are we supposed to do?

Ellos means they/them. But the thing is gendered towards masculine. And ellas also means they/them, but it's gendered towards feminine. So wtf are we supposed to do? Also, el and Ella are of course gendered too so that don't work. 

I mean there's a new term called elle, but that just doesn't sound right. It's latinx imo. Just unnecessary or something. 

Idk I'm just confused as hell
