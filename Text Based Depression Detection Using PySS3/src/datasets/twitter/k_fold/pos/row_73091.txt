This is going to sound dumb as hell I cant understand why i cant talk to girls anymore and its so wierd i just try to push anyone of a deffrent gender away from me am i scared of getting feelings? I think personally im scared of ending up liking someone more then a friend then getting rejected or getting my heart shattered

If anyone has gone through something simular what do i do..
