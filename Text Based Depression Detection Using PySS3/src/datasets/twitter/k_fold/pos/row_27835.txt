Even sleeping makes me more lonely... Last night I dreamt about a girl who I used to have a crush on. Pretty sure she's got a bf by now cause she was "talking" to a guy back when I liked her. 

Anyway, in the dream we were dating or something but we kept hugging and stuff and goddamn was it nice. Even though it was a dream the feeling of security bled over into reality. Then the effect wore off and reality set back in. I've felt super lonely pretty much the entire day afterwards.
