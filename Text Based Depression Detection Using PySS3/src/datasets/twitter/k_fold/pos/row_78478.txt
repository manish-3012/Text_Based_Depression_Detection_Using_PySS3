I was feelin a little down cuz the pandemic and wrote a song about a girl who probably won't love me back but, I think every time I pick up my phone I thiiinnnkk, why can't I see her and think, why can't we talk to each other anymore and I think... maybe it's not too bad because we still have eeeeeaaaaacccchhhh otthhheeeerrr, but I think maybe we just weren't even supposed to talk to eeeeaach other, and I think, and realize we never really had a relationship, and I think, maybe it's over now, but, I know I don't give up that eeeaaasssillly, and I know it doesn't get easier, but I can't stop thinking about how much I love heeeeerrrrr and just want to hear her voice aaaagggain,  because I think(end).
