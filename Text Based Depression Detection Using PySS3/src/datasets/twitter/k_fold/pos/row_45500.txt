Identity politics is silly There are probably some sick fucks out there who would be thrilled by the United States becoming a fascist dictatorship, people who would be LINING UP for their spot in the gas chambers if they knew that those gas chambers were put up by a genderqueer Muslim nonbinary person of color with downs syndrome, eczema, and robot arms or some other completely arbitrary label. This is obviously an extreme example. My point is that a large portion of the American population, maybe like 35%, judges our politicians not based on their policies or their character, but based on shit that doesn't even matter like their race or gender, which is pretty fucking stupid if you ask me.

I know most of you don't care, I just felt like ranting. You can go ahead and downvote me now.
