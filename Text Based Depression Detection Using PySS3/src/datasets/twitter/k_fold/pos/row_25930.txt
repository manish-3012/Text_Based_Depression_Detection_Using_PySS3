Kids are brutal Alright so imagine this. Youâ€™re picking your little cousins up from their school, aged 8 and 9. Itâ€™s all going well and then the 8 year old says, why do you look so strange today? You ask her what she means by than and she replies that your outfit is not good. 

Apparently it is a fashion crime to wear a jumper with a skirt and apparently I look pale today. Well my self confidence has gone now.
