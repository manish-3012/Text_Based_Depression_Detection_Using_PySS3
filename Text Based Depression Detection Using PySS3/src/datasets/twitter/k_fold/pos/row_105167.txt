Need advice getting over former best friend Alright so a long story first, let's go. I hope someone reads this and can give me some advice, because I've been feeling depressed about it for one and a half years, and I want it to stop. 

2 years ago I (17M) met a girl at swimming training, who's a year and 3 months younger than me. Apparently, I reminded her of someone she knew, so she gave me his name as a nickname. We got along quite well, and in January 2019, I got her Instagram and we started chatting. At one point, she asked me "what do you think of me?". That's when I realized how much I meant to her, and we became best friends. It was fantastic, I could entrust her with anything, and we got along perfectly. In March, she even told me, after I haven't seen her for about a week, she even told me that she "misses me as much as she'd miss her sister". However, in May, she started leaving me on "seen" more and more, even when I asked to meet up during the summer in June. I thought she didn't want to be friends anymore, so I blocked her. But when she finally responded, I unblocked her. She was apparently really busy during summer break, and her parent didn't allow her to meet up a lot when she was free. After summer, training started again, and we were able to talk again. However, she started to ignore me more and more, and it was breaking me. Eventually, I had an online anonymous chat with one of those online help centers, and I realized she didn't want to be friends anymore.

I tried to reach out again a few times after that, like after we had a small talk at our club's competition, but I was the only one keeping the conversation going so it didn't go anywhere. That December, I tried again, and even straight-up asking "why don't you want to be friends with me anymore?" I got, yet again, left on 'read'. In February, I tried to arrange that we'd talk after training, but she expertly avoided conversations like a pro. I tried asking my question straight up, and I got blocked. The next month, well, covid happened, and I didn't see her for months. But when training restarted, and I saw her again, I got hit with depression. The worst thing is, sometimes, she'd talk to me normally, saying normal quips. One day in November, when we had to do a particular exercise (where our heads remained above water) she even cheered me on, using my nickname. A stab in the heart would hurt less... 

Every training after that, she'd get stuck in my head, always on my mind during and after training. I only have one friend in that group anymore, however, when she's around, it gets way easier and I don't get depressed as much. But when we did an in-club race, they separated us according to gender, so I got separated, can't talk to her, and can safely sink into depression. Well, that happened today, and here I am.

The issue is that I have now conflicted feelings about her. At the same time, I hate her to the core, and I don't want to see or hear her ever again. But on the other hand, I want to know why she didn't want to talk to me anymore. These feelings are killing me every time I see her. I had another chat with an anonymous helpcenter, and they said that I should leave her alone, and not bother her, as she doesn't want to talk to me. She also had some impact on my real life, as I'm still feeling depressed about it, but because of her, I had trouble talking with my other friends, as I always thought that my other friends would leave me as well. It has gotten better as of late, but I still feel empty and lonely.

So uh, does anyone know what to do? Should I try to ignore it, and try to forget? I've been trying but to no avail. It's hard to reach out to her for an answer, as she blocked me on Instagram and Whatsapp, and I deleted her Snap, but I don't think she blocked my number. Should I try to talk to her to get an answer, or let her be? Anyone had any similar experiences? If you have any questions, please ask, I'll provide details if needed. Please, I want to move on so badly...
