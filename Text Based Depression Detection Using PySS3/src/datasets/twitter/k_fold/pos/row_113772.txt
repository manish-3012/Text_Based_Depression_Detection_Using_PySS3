15 YEARS FREE OF SELF HARM! Yo Iâ€™ve never inflicted harm upon myself, cool huh? But in all honesty I wanna say Iâ€™m sorry for anyone who feels the need to hurt themselves. You are all so valuable. Iâ€™d also like to so congrats to those who have been able to quit self harm and I hope you guys continue to go strong. I honestly donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like but I wanna just say I care about you all. Happy Valentineâ€™s Day everyone ðŸ’›
