A story for yâ€™all For this story I must introduce to you my baby brother. At just five years old heâ€™s all smiles, innocence, cuddles, and couldnâ€™t do anything wrong even if we was the reincarnation of hitler himself. I love the kid. 

But yesterday I walked through the front door after checking the mail, and what am I met with but.... a big hug! Noice. Not the story though.

Later that day he was putting on his favorite Spider-Man shoes and shrieked like he just witnessed a gruesome murder, and what did I find in his shoe? A poo. Yes, our dog pooped in his Spider-Man shoe, and he was mortified! He took the other shoe, and chased the dog, attempting to beat him for his crimes! I restrained the kid, and after catching his breath he screeched, â€œHe pooped in my shoe!! That dog did! He needs to go to jail!â€ Everyone had their laugh, we cleaned up, and moved on. I asked him later if he wanted to put on a different pair of shoes to go ride bikes with and he said, â€œYes! I was sad, but not anymore. Sometimes you find toys in your mouth and sometimes you find poop in your socks, thatâ€™s life.â€ An I swear to god Iâ€™ve never heard such a sentence from a five year old before. He never speaks more then two sentences max, heâ€™s really quiet and has always had issues communicating, but that was the last thing I expected lmao 

Also to put things in perspective I have four little siblings and an older sister, and soon two younger step-siblings.
