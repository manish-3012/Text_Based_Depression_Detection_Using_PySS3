I heard â€˜Gen Zâ€™ is trying to cancel Eminem now? Iâ€™m (unfortunately or not) part of GenZ and listen to a lot of Eminemâ€™s music. I can take a joke, my dark humor is not racism because I genuinely have no dark humor. I sit in my room and play video games the whole day. I respect peoplesâ€™ pronouns and genders but iâ€™m not someone who gets offended on other peopleâ€™s behalf. There are several other GenZ like me who are â€˜chillâ€™ (?) and I, on our behalf would like to apologize to all those who have a negative image about us. Some of us are just overwhelmed with all the positivity and support regarding our sexuality and gender so with given time I hope others voice an opinion when required for the right reasons (for example, the violence faced against Johnny Depp.
