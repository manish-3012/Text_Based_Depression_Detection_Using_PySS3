I just got trolled real hard by a girl I was in school today, i was sitting on my phone listening to some music, a classmate comes to me.
I take off my headphones to find out what she wants.
She said that she really likes me for a while and asks me if we could hang out sometimes. 
I got excited because the last compliment i got was from a girl was in 6th grade. And i ask "Realy?", that was the first thing that came to my mind. She said "yeah, im not joking"

Turns out she was and everything was for a tiktok...

Why do people like this exist?!
Is it really woth it just for some likes. Please dont do stuff like this. It really sucks
