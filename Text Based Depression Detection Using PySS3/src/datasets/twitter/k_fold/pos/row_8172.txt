My battle against demons (Sorry for any mistakes during the post, Iâ€™m on mobile)

I used to date this girl who was amazing. She was depressed because of her family, but she was also the sweetest, kindest person Iâ€™ve ever met. She had walls. She didnâ€™t let people into her life but eventually she opened up her doors and let me in. She was great and was probably the best thing in my life, but we broke up because she ended up moving to North Carolina, which is far away from me. We tried long distance but it didnâ€™t work. 

On December of 2018, my sophomore year, my ex girlfriend called me, but I didnâ€™t answer because I thought she just wanted to wish me a merry Christmas. I was wrong.

The next day she ended it all and because of that, I almost ended my life as well once I heard the news. It was an uphill battle against my own depression and anxiety, but I feel better now. Iâ€™m not worried. And while yes I think about her a lot, I feel like Iâ€™m ready to truly get better. Tomorrow I start my senior year of highschool. After that I start college. 

I want to thank you all. Iâ€™m not active on this sub but I read posts about how people are dealing with their own demons and it inspires me to be better. Thank you
