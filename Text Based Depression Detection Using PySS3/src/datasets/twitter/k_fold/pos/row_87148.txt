SOMEONE HELP MEEE So I've been snapping my crush back and forth for a couple of days (yk like sending pictures back and forth) and I really want to tell her and ask her out, but my parents won't let me go on a date. Someone pls tell me what to do. I'm afraid if I wait to long I'll miss my chance because I think she might like me too.
