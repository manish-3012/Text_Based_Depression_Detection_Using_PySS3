I have weird dreams man so im gonna tell u my dream So, i woke up with a person explaining some stuff (i wasn't paying attention) and then that person was just gone its ok i didn't missed him, so then theres this boat i was with almost my whole class in there so we entered the really small boat and i went on the captain cabin just to check it out.
Then we noticed another boat at our side and we were trying to guess what that boat does so then we discovered it bla bla bla, and i gotted out of the boat to see something and when i turned arround there were T-90s inside some things on the boat and the doors to those things were open so i entered the captain cabin to try and close them but i just messed around with some lights and i saw a radio and i said something (i don't remember what) then suddenly we wore on the sea like actually in the ocean and i was driving it dam it was good to drive it. So i needed to go in one canal and then stop the boat in the canal easy.
We were approaching the canal so i yelled on the radio "GET READY" i genuinely thought that i couldn't do it XD, so we gotted in but i couldn't stop accelerating my body didn't obey me so i decided to cut the fuel to the engine witch shut down the engine and we stopped!
And then i woke up unfortunately, i was actually liking my dream well hope u liked my dream now im gonna go sleep.
