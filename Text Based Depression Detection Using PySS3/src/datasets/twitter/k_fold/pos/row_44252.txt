Later skaters As the Prophet once said, "my time has come" and that prophecy has come to pass.

My time in this sub is coming to an end. The 26th of January is my 20th birthday and I'll be leaving.

I remember back when that guy got his dick stuck in a shampoo bottle, and the mild rebellion that occurred. But you guys have always been here for a laugh and have always put a smile on my face.

Some words of wisdom that I've come to learn recently which will apply to you are to take everything in your stride and don't let anything bring you down.

Godspeed idiots,
Peace
