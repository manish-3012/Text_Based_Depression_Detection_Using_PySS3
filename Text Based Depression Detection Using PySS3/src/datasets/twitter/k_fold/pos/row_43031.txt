Jesus fucking Christ Why the fuck can't people in the UK understand the fucking covid regulations. Yeah, we get you have two kids with you and it's hard to watch them, doesn't give you a fucking excuse to let them run away into another family. Then there's the fucking entitled people who think that they don't have to wear a mask like everyone else and think they are exceptions to the regulations, and dumb people who don't understand why a mask is important and why you shouldn't fucking take it off indoors
