I dont feel okay, I just wanna be loved Someone special to me told me they dont love me, tho they did a day ago... they lied to me. I just want to be loved and comforted... I just wanna be told by someone that I'm loved, maybe given a cute nick name, and complemented. I wanna be able to love them back...
