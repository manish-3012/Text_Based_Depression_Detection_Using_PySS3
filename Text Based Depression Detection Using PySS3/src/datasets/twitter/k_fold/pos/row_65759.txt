me streaming, coughing with a bruised lung, having to stop mid-sentence to grab my side in pain: â€œuhhh sorryâ€ Often I am upset

That I cannot fall in love

But I guess

This avoids the stress of falling out of it

Are you tired of me yet?

I'm a little sick right now

But I swear

When I'm ready I will fly us out of here

I'll cut my hair

To make you stare

I'll hide my chest and I'll

Figure out a way to get us out of here

Turn off your porcelain face

I can't really think right now in this place

There's too many colours

Enough to drive all of us insane
