No one will see this but it might be important So my life was kinda boring in 2019, so after going to bed on NYE (technically day), I prayed for an eventful decade, to spice life up a bit. So overall, for all the lost loved ones to COVID, for the thing in Lebanon, the riots, the killer hornets, etc. I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, my bad.
