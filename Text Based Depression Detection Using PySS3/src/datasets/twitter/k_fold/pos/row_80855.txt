What happened with tiktok? My fyp mainly consists of anime, lgbt, gen z memes, and mental health stuff. I donâ€™t get toxic videos, but I get people duetting them telling them how toxic theyâ€™re being. (Like â€œwtf is wrong you dude thatâ€™s wrongâ€) So I still see what everyoneâ€™s talking about but... how did this even happen? How did an app that started off with cosplaying and small dances end up like this.
