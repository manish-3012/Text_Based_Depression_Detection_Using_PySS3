Hey olaaaaaa#7507 it's been 2 weeks since you've disappeared, if you use reddit please respond to me [LOOKING FOR MY LOST FRIEND] Hey olaaaaa, it's been 2 weeks, my concerns for you are becoming more serious and serious with each passing day, where are you pal, I miss you, and please don't commit suicide, please don't.

You've closed your discord dms and I'm thinking you committed suicide, please don't, if you are olaa please, please dm me, 

To anyone confused this is a follow up post, I lost my friend over 2 weeks ago and I fear it's the worst, I don't know maybe he will look at this and come back idk

May god, or anyone be with you, olaaaaa
