Cut her off or confront her? Context: Had a crush on a girl exactly one year ago. Sang a love song to her on Valentine's Day, she rejected my offer to sit next to her on the senior trip, then tricked me into thinking she liked me back before blocking me on Snapchat and getting a boyfriend. Now we both go to seperate schools and have seperate jobs. What should I do?

1. Confront her and ask her why she blocked me

2. Remove her on all social media profiles

I need to do something to provide some sense of closure and enhance my self improvement.
