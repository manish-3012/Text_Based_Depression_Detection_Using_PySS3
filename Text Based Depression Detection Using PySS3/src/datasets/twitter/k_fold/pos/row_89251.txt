I passed a test with only studying the day before 4pm: i get back from school and start studying 
10pm: i should fake getting some sleep else my dad isn't gonna like
1:30am:the fake sleep worked a little too well
4:30am:stop studying as I know everything 
6:50am:time to go to school
11:35am:get the test paper,read it quickly,i think I can answer all the question
Days later: fucking 17/20 i don't know how i pulled that one
