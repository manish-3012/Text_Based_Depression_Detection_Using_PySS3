A small rant about everything ranging from school parents and my future! Alright so here's my problem, i have been garbage at math since the dawn of time, and since 6th grade i have failed everytime there's been a test. But i excel at english and every other classes, yet for some reason mmy parents just seem to ignore that from almost every time. And now that i'm 1 1/2 years away from starting high school (which i need to have the lowest acceptable grade to be allowed to go to high school) i am starting to panic slowly but surely each day, and it doesn't help with pressure from teachers and parents. Here's the thing though, all i have ever wanted was to work in my country's armed forces all because my father did it, but since most of my family told him i hated him which i obv don't. Either way imma try my hardest to be able to go to high school. Thanks for reading!
