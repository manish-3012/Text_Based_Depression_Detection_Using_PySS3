You know, I need to move my ass a bit I literally haven't done any irl interesting science experience since a while, and I want to grow bacteria (paramecium, E.coli and such) at home but it takes 3-7 days and I wanna use my microscope now :( plus  I have online deliveries and irl shopping to do and I'm so far behind everything :( .
