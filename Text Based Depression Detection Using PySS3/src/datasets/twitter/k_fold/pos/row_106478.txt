My mom just SCOLDED me for defending BIDEN. My mom was looking at a Biden meme that said something about whether or not you would let Biden be the pilot for your airplane. And I said, â€œI wouldnâ€™t even let Trump be a pilot for my plane. No one except a certified pilot.â€  And she goes on this huge rant about how the democrats are socialists and communists - that the dems are trying to turn the US into other socialist countries in Europe like Switzerland and Germany. And how the US will become communists. My mom has a friend who fled Venezuela and my mom was talking about how they had guns to protect themselves, they didnâ€™t have enough food, etc. and how this will become the US if Biden gets elected. 

(Btw weâ€™re upper middle class) 

She said the US are true capitalists and that other countries like Australia, Canada, U.K., Sweden are all socialists. Then she goes, â€œWhy would you support that?â€  And I said, â€œUniversal healthcare.â€  And she goes, â€œThatâ€™s why we have insurance!  If you want healthcare, get a f*cking job!  I have no sympathy for the poor. Why should I pay for other peopleâ€™s healthcare?  Itâ€™s coming out of our taxes!  Why should I pay for other kidâ€™s college?  The poor need to get a f*cking job. Get a job, get an education, get married, go to church.â€  And Iâ€™m like, â€œIf we have universal healthcare, then thereâ€™s no need for insurance. And if you donâ€™t want to pay for other people, why are you paying for public school?â€  And she goes, â€œBecause my kids are in public school.â€  And I go, â€œWhat about when your kids go off on their own and need healthcare.â€  And sheâ€™s like, â€œWell my kids are gonna have a JOB!  Canadians come to the US for healthcare because they have to wait years for cancer treatment.  In the US, you get it right away.â€  Then I give her the scenario that goes along the lines of this: Letâ€™s say you get cancer or a heart attack one day and you have to pay millions for the hospital visit. Wouldnâ€™t you rather pay a few thousand through taxes instead of paying hundreds of thousands out of your pocket?â€  And she goes, â€œIâ€™m not gonna pay a few thousand because I have insurance to pay for it.â€  

Now she wants to take me out of public school and put me in a private one to get me away then â€œwashing my brain out.â€  And then she was like, â€œMaybe you should skip the first 2 years of college and get a real job so you know what itâ€™s like.â€  And in my head, Iâ€™m kinda considering it. Iâ€™ve never had a job because â€œSchool and swimming are my jobs.â€  Plus, I wanna be a police officer which means after the two years of work, Iâ€™ll be 20 almost 21 and I wonâ€™t even have to go to college anyway. 

Am I wrong here for the political aspect and my mom is right?  What are your thoughts?
