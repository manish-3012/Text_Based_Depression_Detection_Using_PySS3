Why gay people are some of the best people I know: 
Okay so I donâ€™t get how some people canâ€™t like gay guys, I mean they literally increase ur chances of getting a gf because not only are they not being competition they also take another guy with them. So technically they are the ultimate wingmen. 

And itâ€™s the same for girls, let lesbians take other girls out of the competition for you it increases ur chances for a bf. 


Last thing, I know for a FACT that the majority of boys in this subreddit have looked at yuri at least once. So you might as well be cool with it at this point ;)
