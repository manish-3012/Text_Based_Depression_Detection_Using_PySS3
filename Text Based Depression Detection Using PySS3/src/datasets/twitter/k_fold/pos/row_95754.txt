I have my first day of school tomorrow I've never been more nervously excited in my entire life. I know exactly what outfit im wearing, from hair to my nail polish. It's just, a few days or a week or so after we got yeeted out of school in march, I cut all my permed hair 




I'm so scared bc my friends probably forgot that I chopped my hair off and imma walk in there looking like an alien bc my permed hair used to go to my shoulders â˜ . And none of my old classmates know either. 



Also, I'm going from 8th to 9th grade so it'll be my first day in high school! Oi, lord help me ðŸ˜¨
