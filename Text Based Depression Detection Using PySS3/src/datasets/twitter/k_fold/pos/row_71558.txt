[US Politics] I didn't know where else to post this, but I'm glad that we can all agree that both our options for president right now are stupid. Any of you who watched the full debate today, I commend you. I listened to MAYBE 30 seconds of it, and I have a headache now. What is this country coming to? I can't believe it all; it's just SAD now. It's not "Oh we should be good soon, right?" \*nope\*. Now it's just sad that we did such a terrible job as a country.
