dudes, why would a guy friend be mean to you? itâ€™s so weird; I hung out with him and another friend a few days ago but he kept on telling me to shut up. he just kept on making negative comments/remarks and his behaviour didnâ€™t really change throughout the whole day. even when I was in a bikini and i think he got a little bit hard. 

it was so weird? does that mean he wants me to back off?
