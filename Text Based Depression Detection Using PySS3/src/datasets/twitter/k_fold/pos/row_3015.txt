Am i the only one who has this? It's sorta like an Automatic Crush Prevention System.  


It's been in my head since i was in 7th grade.  


So if i see a Pretty or Cute Girl or something similar, the first thing that comes to my head are like these:  


"You Don't have a Chance with her. Move on with your life."  


"She probably has another Crush or a Boyfriend. Please Move on with your life."  


"You're too Ugly for that. Move on with your life."  


"That's none for our business."  


"We are too busy for that."  


  
I dunno why is this. It's really Automatic. Even if i just did a very short glance something above or similar will come up from my mind. Then i just move on or do something else.
