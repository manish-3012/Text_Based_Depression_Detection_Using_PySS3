I had the best night ever So last night I was walking up and down my neighbourhood and listening to my book and music. It was a full moon and lots of stars out. I also threw out a lot of the social distancing signs because fuck that. Then I met up with my brother so we just did that together. I hate seeing those ugly signs scattered around parks.
