My Mom Just Said She Wasnâ€™t Proud of Me Iâ€™ve just spent the past week and weekend working so hard on my studies. I spent the first quarter of the school year in hospital and still maintained a 4.2 GPA.

I speak 3 languages in America of all places to do so, I was president of school band for 2 years before my medical situation forced me to drop it.

I came downstairs today and all she had to ask was â€œAre you caught up on schoolworkâ€.

I answered, thinking that my hard work through all of this would make her smile and maybe give an encouraging word

â€œYeah, I have a 96% in Chem, and As in my other classesâ€

She didnâ€™t even respond.

I had to ask what she thought asked if she was proud.

She didnâ€™t even look up and said no.
