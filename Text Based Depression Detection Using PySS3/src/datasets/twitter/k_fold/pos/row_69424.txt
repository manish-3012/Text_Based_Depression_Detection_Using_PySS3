I'm actually gonna try this time, I'm taking tennis classes, and I kinda suck. I didn't try very much throughout the summer, and everyone in the class is already very good, and I am not athletic one bit. But for some reason, I think I'm gonna try to get better. 

I think it's gonna be worth it. I don't know why, but I'm gonna try. I may be a weak loser and can't even grip the racket right, and don't have enough social skills to ask the coach for help, but IM GONNA TRY.
