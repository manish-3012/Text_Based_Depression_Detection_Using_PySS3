How much sleep have you averaged over the past couple of years? I am 16 and for about the past 3 or so years I have averaged around 4-5 hours on school nights (luckily I get plenty of sleep on non school nights) and Iâ€™m working on trying to improve my sleep because it has not been beneficial for me at all.
