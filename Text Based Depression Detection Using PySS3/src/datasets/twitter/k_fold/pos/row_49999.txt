I just got ghosted by someone I know I shouldnâ€™t let some random person online affect me this much but it still hurts, if this person were to tell me what I did wrong or if I made her feel uncomfortable I would have respected her decision and left her alone. I donâ€™t even know what I did wrong. It maybe sounds like Iâ€™m being too dramatic but I just feel that we couldnâ€™t talked it out first and then if she wanted to block me she couldâ€™ve.
