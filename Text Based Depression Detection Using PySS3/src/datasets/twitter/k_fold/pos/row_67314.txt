Anyone wanna play among us with proximity chat? I just downloaded the mod but none of my friends can get it to work. I can add you on discord and give you the code to the lobby.

If you don't have it, [here's the link](https://github.com/ottomated/CrewLink/releases). Just download the .exe file and open it, then you should get crew link on your desktop. Just open it and click open game, then you should be good to go
