I did an oopsie So today I found something sharp enough to cut myself with (yes I know self-harming is bad). But next week I return to school and I realised something. On Friday's we do art, like painting and stuff like that. But for painting you have to pull up your sleeves. But I cut myself there. So what do I do!?
