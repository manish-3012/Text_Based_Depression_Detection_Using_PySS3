What should I get for a former student of mine who just got a full ride to her dream school? Hello young people,

I'm a middle school teacher working in a large urban district. One of my former students, who is brilliant, hardworking, and kind, just got a full ride to a very competitive university. We've stayed in touch over the years, and she'd occasionally check in when she needed help with something or just to say hi. When she told me she was accepted, I was ecstatic for her and congratulated her.

I asked if I could share the news with our school's staff, since we always love to hear about our former students' successes, and she told me that she's feeling like she may have made a mistake. She says she's feeling some serious imposter syndrome (she's a POC, and this school is largely white and affluent), and she's worried she can't hack it. I told her that she can definitely hack it, and we talked for a while, but it still seemed at the end like she's feeling more than what I'd say is the "normal" amount of anxiety about a life transition.

I'm just thinking about my experience (as a privileged white dude) in college and how hard it was, and I'd like to get some of our staff to chip in to buy her something nice as a reassurance that she can, in fact, thrive there.

So my question for the younger folks here is: what should we get her? Her family doesn't have a ton of money, so I was thinking maybe a laptop would be nice, or gift cards, or...what? I haven't been to college since before Facebook was a thing, so I don't want to arrange to get her something that won't be useful.

Anyway, thanks in advance!
