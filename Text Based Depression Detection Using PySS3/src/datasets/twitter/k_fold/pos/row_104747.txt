How do I cope Hey guys 
So I just reached grade 10 and my parents went absolutely insane (I'm from Asia) and took away absolutely everything I used to do to have fun like 
Gaming and phone browsing etc and I'm slowly going insane coz I have nothing to release my frustrations through 
How can I cope with this 
Any advice is sincerely appreciated 
Also I'm a male
