OMG I ALMOST DIED JUST NOW! AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE WORST WAY POSSIBLE! 
Having a near death experience isn't a very nice feeling. I literally thought I was gonna die. I was walking on the sidewalk and a Cement  truck almost lost control. It literally hit my sleeve, missing my body by about an inch! (don't worry the truck got control back nobody was hurt). 

Enjoy life! We don't know when we're gonna die so moral of the story, always delete your browser history because you don't know when you'll die and it would be awkward if someone browsed through your phone with your history still there.
