Day 17 of posting quotes from We Know The Devil until I get some fucking garlic bread. â™€: I feel like I shouldn't get mad though.

â™€: Like, you're supposed to turn the other cheek.

â™†: Ever think people who love to say that just love slapping people?



P.S. I got tired of the Bible so I decided to switch over to my favorite game. Hopefully this will be more enjoyable for me now. Some of these are gonna be dialouges like this one btw. The symbols represent different characters.
