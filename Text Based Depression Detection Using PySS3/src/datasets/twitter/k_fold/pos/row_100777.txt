Okay hear me out Fnaf has chance to get into smash, not only cause fucking steve is in, like what! there is a chance it is a big voice in it's genre, and we need a horror character. On the other hand, a tf2 character is more likely that game MADE 6v6 and has would be just rad to play as heavy. on my third hand crash or spyro has to get in. who do you think would get in?
