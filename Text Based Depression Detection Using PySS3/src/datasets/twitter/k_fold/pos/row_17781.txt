I don't understand what is so "great" about life. This is something that has been bothering me for over a year now.

Here's a timeline of pretty much everyone's life:

0-13 years old: Fun, and full of no worries.

13-18 years old: Full of raging hormones and a ton of dumb and immature decisions that could affect you later in life.

19-23 years old: 4-6 years of nothing but studying and misery so you can get a job.

24-70 years old: Go to work 5 days a week, same routine every day, life is overall just overwhelmingly boring and exhausting.

70 years old until death: Your body falls apart and you live in physical pain.


What's supposed to be so "awesome" about life?
