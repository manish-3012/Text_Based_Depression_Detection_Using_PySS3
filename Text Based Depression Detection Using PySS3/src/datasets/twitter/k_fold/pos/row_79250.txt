I wish my boyfriend would be on his phone less. I love him with all of my heart, let me be clear to start with.

But whenever we are at a social gathering or a party or hanging out, he immediately goes to his phone. I try to start conversations but he returns to his phone after a one sentence answer.

I want to tell him that I want him to be more open but I donâ€™t know how.
