Boy advice plz So I liked this guy in 11th grade but we were always just rly good friends and he thought I liked someone else. I didnâ€™t talk to him since school shutdown and like four days ago he texts me about how he misses me and he can easily let go of others but not me and he isnâ€™t sure why but he â€œneeds meâ€ so I was like Lolol ty and we started talking again. Since like yesterday heâ€™s been texting one liners and responding every like 8 hours and idk what it means if it means even anything at all.
