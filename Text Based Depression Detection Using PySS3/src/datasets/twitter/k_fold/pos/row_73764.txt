Hey Guys and Girls. I quite like myself some good music. I like heavy metal, and lots of different types of rock, but not so much pop, etc. Heres a link to my Playlist, so if you have any suggestions of songs to add that I might like, please let me know. I'm looking for more songs to listen to so my top songs of 2021 isn't just TOOL.
