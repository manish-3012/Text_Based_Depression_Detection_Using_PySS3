Help me My friend sent me [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/i0txrn/share_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) so I went to that account to report it. I wanted to watch the videos to see how bad it was. Iâ€™m seriously shaken up. They poured boiling water on the cat and the cat was screaming. The fucking caption said â€œthey probably deserved it anywayâ€. What the fuck? Iâ€™m seriously crying rn. I donâ€™t think anybody deserves to have boiling water poured on them, with the exception of this person (and anybody else who poured boiling water on someone on porpose). I wouldnâ€™t do this to a murderer.  It the owner dosnâ€™t get arrested I hope those cats and dogs die. I really do. They donâ€™t deserve any of the shit this shithole of a person did. They deserve to actually live a life, not be toys for a psychopath. Now Iâ€™m off to hug my cat for eternity.
