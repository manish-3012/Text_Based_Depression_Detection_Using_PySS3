I donâ€™t feel anything Well actually I do, I feel gross I donâ€™t know why. Everything is gross, everything is disgusting. I canâ€™t get horny (tmi srry), youâ€™d think that be a productive thing but I donâ€™t know what my sexuality is cause I find it gross. Iâ€™m disgusted of my friends, Iâ€™m disgusted by food, Iâ€™m disgusted by the clothes in my closet, Iâ€™m disgusted by the light emitting off my phone, Iâ€™m disgusted of life ig

Iâ€™m sitting in a chair in the middle of my room trying to imagine what happy feels like and I canâ€™t. Canâ€™t imagine what sad feels like. No anxiety for me either, which is so different

I feel like I need an adrenaline rush and I donâ€™t know where to get one, like I really want to go on a rollercoaster, just to feel something. I wanna speed in a 35, maybe crash into a tree so my body can wake up and realize Iâ€™m not immortal, bring my paranoia back or sumn 

I feel weird for not feeling anything cause Iâ€™m so used to being controlled by intrusive thoughts. Itâ€™s almost like I want them back. It sounds dumb but I get excited(?) for my weekly injection thing cause I get to stab myself and feeling the needle inside me makes me anxious. It makes me feel alive

Imma go rub ice on my face so my hands can burn
