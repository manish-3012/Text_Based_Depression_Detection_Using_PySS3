I'm an adult, but because I'm trans and closeted living with my parents, basically I feel like child who has no rights. Can't wear any feminine clothes I want to. Which means I'm not only stuck with boy clothes, but old shitty boy clothes because I don't really want to buy new clothes that I still hate.

Can't really have any friends because I can't feel comfortable and confident enough to be around people presenting as a male.

Can't even be called by the name I want to. Which sucks the most I really feel like every person in the world deserves to have a name they like, wether you are a terrible person or whatever, that is a basic human right.

Can't do anything to make me like my body at all and I hate myself. 

It really sucks
