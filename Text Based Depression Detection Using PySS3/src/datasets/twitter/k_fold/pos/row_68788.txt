College Fund  

There's a golf course near my house, people lose golf balls very easily. Also many practice grounds near my house.

One day I will go to the golf course and sell them for half their price at a stand.

Or maybe 75% off.

I find them in the wilderness often, there's also a tennis court where I find golf balls in spiky plants.

I have a collection of golf balls.

I will be sad to see them go, I'll probably keep one of each color/colour as a memento.

I've spent fucking YEARS collecting these golf balls.

I have NEVER paid for a golf ball in my entire FUCKING life.

But yeah, I'll probably use the money I get from selling them to pay for college.
