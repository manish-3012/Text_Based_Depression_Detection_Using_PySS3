[Rant] I hate politics so much. It's like, I can either be consumed by everything or be completely numb, and you know what? I don't want either of those things. BUT ME BEING A FREAKIN SIXTEEN YEAR OLD I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I'm either angry or numb to everything that goes on in the world. It's miserable. I just don't know how to fix it. In the USA, supposedly "The people hold the power" but we've done so good at making sure that it's only the \*majority\* people have power, whereas the individual has like, literally no power at all. People in the USA don't want to be doing their own work, they want the government to just \*hand\* them money, which would turn the country into a craphole of lazy, unemployed, a-holes.  How am I supposed to not be angry at everything? Because the only ways I can interact with things are by being concerned about them, which if I'm concerned about everything, I'm just miserable or angry, and if I'm not, I'm numb to everything. And I'm also called a lazy bum for not caring about anything. But I \*can't\* care about anything, because that just makes me angry. Do you see the problem here?
