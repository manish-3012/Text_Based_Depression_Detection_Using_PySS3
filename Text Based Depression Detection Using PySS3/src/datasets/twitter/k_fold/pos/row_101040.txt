Fellow teenagers, I have been influenced by the hip hop of the 90â€™s and hip hop jazz for awhile. I have just started to listen to... Kendrick Lamar, lil uzi vert, playboi carti. I really like them. Give me some song recommendations from them and maybe some artist recommendations too. I would prefer recommendations of newer popular rappers similar to playboi carti and uzi
