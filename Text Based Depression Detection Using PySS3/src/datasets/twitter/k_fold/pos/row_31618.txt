My dad erased more than 4 yrs+ worth of game data on the PlayStation. My dad was fucking drunk and told me to come home ( I stay at my grandparents apartment right below us when he's drunk) and when I said no HE DELETED ALL OF MY DATA AND PROGRESS ON THE PLAYSTATION. Nothing remained and now I'm fucking pissed at my sorry excuse of a father. I can't believe I lost everything I don't want to do all of it again.......
