I'm so fucking tired of trying I fucking hate school. A lot of people do the only difference with me, is that it's the only fucking thing I'm good at. I have a 4.6 GPA and go to a Top 10 Highschool in the United States and I seriously don't give a fuck. I'm so tired. I hate school I hate how It's the only thing I'm good at I hate myself for never stopping and always pushing myself to do better at it, and always striving for more because maybe if I had cut myself some slack I wouldn't be so tired and stressed. If my Grammar seems shitty I don't care I'm so tired of familial pressure I'm sick of feeling like If I don't give my all, all the time I will be a waste of fucking potential. I feel trapped to become some researcher or some "important shit" because I know that's what I should do because I simply can. I just. I just hate how I'm so dependent on school. I learned a year ago I'm more than my intelligence but I'm nothing without it in terms of what I have to say for myself. Everyone else Is "I can draw, I can cook, I can dunk, I can make music, I can take photos." I tried all of that and still fucking sucked.
I'm just a depressed Mexican student who made it out of the ghetto and now has to compete with white kids that had about a billion advantages over me. and that's not me projecting, I didn't have those advantages and I'm still here. What set this rant off was. I'm currently struggling in my Junior Year because I took 3 AP Classes and 4 honors WITHOUT the knowledge that there would be a Global Pandemic going on. I seriously rather go to school in person every day with a mask ofc to actually get the support I need because I can't fucking do this on my own. I want to disappear for a long time and come back later :)
