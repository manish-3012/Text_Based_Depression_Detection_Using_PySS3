Am I an outcast or just plain weird? I'm 15 and I just feel lonely all the time, I have friends but I don't feel like I belong there. I tried so much to fit in but in the end they just left me. In the end It's always just me in the corner. I'm not an introvert, I'm not shy so I don't know what's wrong with me.
