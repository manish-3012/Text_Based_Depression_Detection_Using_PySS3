Y'all parents ever say "What are you even gonna be in the future?" To you? It's like they think I'm hopeless and would end up jobless in the future lmao

Well idk that yet but is that rlly smtg you gotta say to your kids?I think that just makes me even more discouraged.like,I want them to be expectant of me and not think of me as some kind of dissapointment.

Like it rlly isnt a nice feeling yk being sad and depressed bcs of constant negative remarks 

on the other hand I should rlly do my assignments lol pray for me bois but I'll srsly make an effort to finish all of them,I rlly want to.
