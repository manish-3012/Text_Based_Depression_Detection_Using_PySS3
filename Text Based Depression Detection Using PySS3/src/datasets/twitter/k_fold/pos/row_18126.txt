Im just going to spill all my thoughts because I just cried and I need someone to read this and tell me what they think I just cried from anxiety for the first time and now I'm going through this whole thing so please read this and give me advice. Also please don't mind any typos because I'm writing this at 1 am.

So I have started thinking that I am doing things just so I can show off. I think its gotten so far that I do it out of instinct. I will do things just so I can show it off to people without even thinking about it. Its hard to explain but thats the best way to put it. I realized this a while ago before this whole breakdown  so I just told myself "your only doing this for attention" or something like that. I don't even know if this reddit post is about me trying to find myself or me just looking for attention. Now I'm crying and trying to decide if I'm really going through something or I'm just looking for attention. I've been crying for a good 10 minutes and even as I'm writing this I'm thinking of putting 30 minutes just to show off telling myself "oh no one will know and its just rounding up the number." I don't know anymore whether I'm just attention hungry or I need like a therapist. One part of me says that they want attention and that you should go and cry in front of your parents so that they care for you. Another part of me says that I should feel bad for doing that and you should not tell them because thats not your real feelings. Your real feelings are greedy. The other part of me says that neither of them are true and that all this is real and I need help and that I should express my feelings. I know it sounds obvious to just share my feelings but thats harder than it sounds. All these voices in my head are yelling at each other. "You should go to your parents" "no your not really sad" "yes I am sad." I don't even know if I am pushing down my feelings to write this or if I am just staging a play where I'm catering to an audience that doesn't exist.

Another big part is that I like to live in my own reality. What I mean by that is I have countless fantasies about my future. The I have been living in currently is me being a famous manga artist. A couple other ones include creating famous video games, being a musician, etc. I know it sounds stupid and that it isn't an issue but please let me explain. I really feel like all these would exist. Like am really going to do this and that if I let time take its course, then I really will be this famous person. I think because of this its created this false ego of mine. Its hard to explain but I feel like I'm living another life in the future, not in the present. I don't know if these are real feelings but I think I haven't been living in the present as much. Days sometimes for me pass by so quickly. I end up pacing in my room thinking about all these things, sometimes for an hour at most. It doesn't sound like a lot but thats 1/12 of my day gone from just staying in my mind. I tend to talk to myself in the third person and now whenever I do it I just slap myself in the head but now I feel like its a real problem with all this. Again, I know it sounds stupid but now it feels like I disconnect myself from reality and now I have nothing I do. I realize I spend so much time just in my own head that I have so much free time. This isn't actually the reason I started crying. I just happened to spend a good few minutes once I began crying to try and find myself.

I started crying because I have been failing a class for the first time ever. I've never been a top notch student but I was a fine student. I had descent grades and I only ever had one C before this, but with this whole pandemic going on, I got lazy. I'm not trying to blame the pandemic completely. I became unproductive on my own, but it was a big factor. I realize now that I need school and just general discipline or else I end up being lazy. Now I end up just not doing work and failing tests. I cheat using google and I don't care. I think the main root of the crying was that I not only had a test at 7:45, I also had to show my dad my grades. I had been putting it off for the entire weekend but he basically demanded it. My dad is actually pretty cool and it had been my fault. I still don't know how I'm going to tell him and its given me a lot of anxiety. I knew it would come, and all that anxiety had been building up for so long that I guess I just burst and that led to this whole self discovery thing.

I spent half an hour writing this and I feel much better. I stopped crying and having all my thoughts in front of me cleared my mind. These problems are still very much around and I honestly don't know if I am posting this for attention or if I really do have a problem. My brain is still telling me that I am making all this up for attention online, but theres no hurt in putting my feelings out there. I think what really sparked this up is the fact I finished the show erased today and its very sad and depressing and makes you think about how short life is. And I just took all those emotions to bed. Please give me advice on how to deal with this though. I would really appreciate this as a 14 year old.
