Please shut up. All of you. You heard me. (Almost) Every single one of you are annoying. The good (sad) posts of people needing help or talking about normal stuff is few and far between. The complaining is... excessive. We get it. This sub is shitty, but moaning and whining like a little bitch won't help. So to the people who make this place shitty, and to those who complain about it, please please please shut up. And to those who are sick of everyone's shit and to those who just don't give a shit: Bababooey. 

Also side rant: SCREW AUTOMODERATOR. ALL MY HOMIES HATE AUTOMODERATOR. I CAN'T EVEN TELL SOMEONE TO **** (I can't say it because this could be taken down). I CAN'T EVEN BASICALLY INSULT SOMEONE WITHOUT IT BEING REMOVED.  IT'S NOT EVEN GOOD INSULTS AS WELL.
