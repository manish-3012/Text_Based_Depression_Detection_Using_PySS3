I have no one to tell this to, but I'm super proud of myself. So today we were doing are presentations for are passion project, and I chose reenacting. I was really nervous that it was going to be to bad or I might start getting a bad voice while I was speaking, but indid super well, and I could tell the teachers really liked it. It made my day, and now its keeping me awake just thinking about it
