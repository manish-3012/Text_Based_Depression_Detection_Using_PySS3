End of year School freaking awards So Iâ€™m in year 9 which means Iâ€™ve been in high school for 3 years and every year we have academic awards and things like that and Iâ€™m a good student but I havenâ€™t gotten a award the whole time Iâ€™ve been here which makes me feel like Iâ€™m just not good at school. On top of that... my parents, every year I have to come home and say I didnâ€™t get an award only to be given â€œmaybe just try harder next yearâ€ and itâ€™s not like only some people get these awards, there usually only 10 people that donâ€™t get one so :/ 

Our school makes such a big deal about it as well, we have rehearsals and itâ€™s obvious who doesnâ€™t get an award because everyone that dose get an award leaves the years sitting position to go on stage leaving the others just sitting there like :( 

And the teacher, god the teachers like a week before hand are like â€œwe got to respect everyone that got an award and tried really hardâ€ like bitch people that donâ€™t try get awards and at this point Iâ€™ve just accepted that Iâ€™m fucking invisible to the whole school and I will be nothing more then a disappointment
