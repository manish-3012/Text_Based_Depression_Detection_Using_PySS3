The infraction point system is trash and needs an overhaul It doesn't make a whole lot of sense that 8 minor infractions leads to a permanent ban in the same way 8 more serious infractions do. The amount of points should be based on the severity of the rule break, and the cap should be higher to compensate. Posting memes that are considered "unrelated" or saying "m\*ds gay" as a joke should not give the same punishment as posting NSFW, doxing or minor harassment. Seriously, it's a poorly thought out and even more poorly executed system
