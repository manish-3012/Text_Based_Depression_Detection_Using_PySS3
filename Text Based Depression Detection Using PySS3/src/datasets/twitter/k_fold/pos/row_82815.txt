Hello! Radish is an artist/gamer! Reddit won't let me post photos or videos anymore and it's been bothering me. I've been trying to expand my reach and introduce people to who I am and my dreams. 

Since Reddit won't let me upload the images here is my introduction to you. I hope you will read it for a few seconds: 

I am Radish The Viceroy, please call me Radish! I am a young artist who aspires to be an author. I have been working on developing my main series since I was eight years old and I am excited for when I get it published. I work hard on my art, but I am still learning (it still kind of sucks, but I try my hardest). I am also learning how to animate so I can animate scenes from my book. 

I would appreciate support whether it be a follow on my social medias, or some basic encouragement in the comments. I really think that I can make it as an author/artist and I plan to put as much work as possible in for it.
