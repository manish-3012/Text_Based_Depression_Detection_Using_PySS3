Need some advice Me (m16) and my gf (f15) have been dating for 8 months but I think I'm starting to get attracted to somone else but at the same time I also feel like that might just be me not having seen anyone my age let alone a different girl since March I just wanted to see if you guys could help. Like I mean im noticing things like her eyes that I just dont notice with my girl like thid other girls eyes are like a really pretty blue green but my girlfriends are brown but for some reason I cant find anything attractive about my girlfriends eyes (I'm just using eyes as an example).
