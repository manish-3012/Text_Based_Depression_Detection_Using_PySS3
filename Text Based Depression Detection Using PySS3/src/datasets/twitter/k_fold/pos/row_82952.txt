Growing up Is anyone at that stage of being a teenager where your given a ton of responsibilities, are doing several â€œadultingâ€ tasks and are already feeling some of the stress of â€œadultingâ€? Cuz Iâ€™m definitely feeling it and when I went to talk to my parents about it, they told me â€œItâ€™s part of life called growing up and it sucks. You donâ€™t always get to do what you want, so suck it up.â€ Kinda wish theyâ€™d be a little more empathetic, but itâ€™s alright. Anyone else having this problem cuz I know I canâ€™t be the only one.
