I just had to go into a store without a mask. So my whole family (myself included) hate masks. Thatâ€™s whatever, not many people like them. But today my mom took it to an extreme.

We were getting out of the car, and my brothers grabbed their masks, and my mom said â€œput them away, you donâ€™t need them.â€ I happened to snag mine without them seeing, and we walked into the store. When we walked in, I put mine up, and the rest of my family walked in without a mask. 

Immediately we started getting some weird stares. One of the biggest reasons I put mine on was because I hate being judged. Iâ€™m also not tryna catch anything. When my mom saw that I had my mask on, she took it from me and I had to walk around the store with no mask on, while everyone else had one on. I was so embarrassed because I hate being stared at. I understand, weâ€™ve had to wear them since March, and youâ€™re sick of them mom. Iâ€™m sick of them too, but we werenâ€™t even in there that long. Now I feel like thatâ€™s how itâ€™s going to be every time I walk into a store. Iâ€™m not making this up either. I donâ€™t know what to do.
