The Office S3:E1 is golden SPOILERS:

I just started watching this show, and I swear the ending with Dwight had my rolling that shit was so funny. But it also leaves you questioning about the future and builds up good character development. The show focuses more on our main peeps having wacky times,  so when you switch over to Jim's new office, you really get a feel for how he feels. It's an amazing episode!
