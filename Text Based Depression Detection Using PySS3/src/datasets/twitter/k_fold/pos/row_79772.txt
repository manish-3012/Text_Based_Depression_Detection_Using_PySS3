I was told by a friend that reddit is a good place to get advice. I am disappointed. Iâ€™ve posting about this once or twice a day for the past few days, in hope of someone giving me some useful advice. No one has the smort. 

My problem is about a girl that I want to ask out. She is one of my friends and has told me that she likes me, right before I said I like her. This was last Saturday evening on a zoom call with some friends, when we were playing a game called hate mate or date. I havenâ€™t had a moment alone with her since I realised I like her. I donâ€™t wanna ask over text, or in front of others. 

And please donâ€™t say you donâ€™t have any advice (or just give bad advice). Research shows that the best relationship advice comes from single people.
