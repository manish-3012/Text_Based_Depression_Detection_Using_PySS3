Asking my crush for... My school's graduation day will be on the coming friday 25th Sept. Where I come from, we graduate before we take our national exams, meaning we won't have to attend school anymore, and i may only see my crush only during the exams.

Apparently I've been told that she already knows I'm into her and clearly it ain't gonna work out but I just want one thing. A hug. Yes, from her. And i really want to do it not because of anything sexual/inappropriate, but I've had difficulty expressing courage and finding friends and I figured if there was one time, I would overcome that fear, I want it to be the most memorable time of my school life. 

But I've not been able to sleep on the fact that, how, just how, am I going to ask her. It's such a weird and probably sudden request that I could never imagine myself asking. I'm hoping I could get some advice on how I'm gonna execute this, or whether I should even do it at all. To clarify, we're both 16.
