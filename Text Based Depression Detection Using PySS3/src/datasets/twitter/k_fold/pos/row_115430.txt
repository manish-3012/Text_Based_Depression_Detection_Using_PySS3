Mega sad haha I'm facing the consequences of my own actions and as a result I have lost all my friends, Ive been thinking about ending it because at this point I don't trust anyone. But I know if I do commit then people will think it's their fault, and might be a bit messed up because of it. I just don't want people to miss me, I would like it if they could forget who I am so I can easily leave.
