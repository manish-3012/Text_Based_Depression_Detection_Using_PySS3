I have a story to share and I hope it relates or helps some of you Today is my birthday and this is like the first time that my family just forgot for a bit. I have 2 great parents and sister and theyâ€™re the best, we always enjoy each otherâ€™s birthday and will say happy bday at midnight then do something special during the day. It turned midnight and for almost 10 minutes they just forgot. I know it sounds like Iâ€™m being a bit of a brat but, it just really resonates with how my life is.

I have a great life and I know I can take that for granted sometimes. My parents arenâ€™t close to rich but we can get what we need and I have many things in my life that I am grateful for. I have a better life than most when it comes to home and family and Iâ€™m very fortunate, but really every other aspect of my life has the same message, Iâ€™m alright but never good enough. Thereâ€™s always something beyond me in everything where I always just barely short. I am decent at things like video games, my instruments, other skills, but not good at them or great at them. In school I get good grades but always fall short to someone, when I graduated from middle school I wasnâ€™t valedictorian cuz I was half a point overall grade off from an A, and I wasnâ€™t salutatorian because no joke, the people who ran it forgot about me and two others were salutatorian even though we had the same GPA. In my social life, Iâ€™m an introvert who really wants to make friends and just have nice talks with people, but I havenâ€™t been like that my whole life and never got the skills or know how to do it. So for so long Iâ€™ve been the quiet kid no one notices, even though I see so much in the background. In every part of my life, I am so close to being the best or at least good, but thereâ€™s always someone better, or I can never reach my expectation for myself.

I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s ever been a time that my family has forgotten each otherâ€™s birthday at midnight, but if it were to happen, it wouldâ€™ve happened to me, which it did. I donâ€™t want to ask for pity, I donâ€™t want people to feel bad because honestly you really shouldnâ€™t, I just donâ€™t want this to happen to any of you.

Probably no one has read this or gotten this far, but I have just a bit more to say if ur still here. A very important saying is Comparison is the thief of joy, or something like that, and if anyone relates to anything Iâ€™ve said, please listen to that saying. Iâ€™ve been in situations where I couldâ€™ve got or accomplished something but didnâ€™t do it cuz of how I am and someone else got the prize. It shouldâ€™ve been me, I would think. But the older I get, the more I realize that even tho my life can suck when your not good enough at anything, it just motivates you to grow more and more as a person. Just do what makes you happy in life, for me thatâ€™s being happy with family, improving in playing the guitar and saxophone, and other stuff. I know that I have a skill ceiling in all things in life that will always make me the worst of the best, and Iâ€™m okay with that. Just always strive to be a better you, have a good mindset because you can do so much more when you have a good mindset. Be happy and donâ€™t let other people take that away from you. Life can suck, and at the moment Iâ€™m writing it, ngl, life sucks rn. But tomorrow it will be better again. Iâ€™m gonna cry myself to sleep because I donâ€™t get to express my emotion often, which is why keeping a little mood journal like I do is really nice. And once I cry myself to sleep and get mad and sad and have regrets about myself and my life, itâ€™ll be okay. 

Please just enjoy life, youâ€™ll get through anything with a mindset to keep going, things you enjoy, and if you ever need someone to talk to, I may be antisocial irl but I could really use a friend. Good night and good day if even just one person decided to read this, stay safe, enjoy life, be happy
