Does anyone else with pets think this: So my dog is laying on me right now and licking me and yknow, just loving me like dogs do. But I always suddenly become depressed because I know one day this little pup is gonna die, and ive experienced pets dying before and it fucking sucks. This feeling is the only bad part about being a pet owner

Also in my religion we dont believe dogs pass on to the afterlife, so it sucks even more. Cause like when a family member dies, atleast I can be like "I'll meet you again one day", but when my pets die its not like that.
