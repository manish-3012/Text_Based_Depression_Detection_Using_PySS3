Is wearing an African national football (soccer) team jersey racist? Feeling really self-conscious about wearing the new Nigeria home kit, as myself is not Nigerian nor African. I really donâ€™t want to  come off as culturally inappropriate, I just really like their kit/jersey and is a huge football (soccer) fanatic. 

The kit if your interested :)
