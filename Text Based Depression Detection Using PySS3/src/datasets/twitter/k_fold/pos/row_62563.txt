I am going to see my crush for the first time in 8 months tommorow. How should I go about the conversation with her? I haven't seen her since March, and have had a crush on her since the end of my sophomore year (I'm now a Senior.) I'm probably going to get really nervous seeing her for the first time in so long, and want to make sure it's not a super awkward moment that leads to the end of any chances I had asking her out.
