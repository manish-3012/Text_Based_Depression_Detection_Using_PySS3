My gf wants me to unfollow instagram girls Hey so, I recently got together with my girlfriend and now she's seen that I follow a bunch of girls on ig. Not girls from our school that I know but like "instagram models". I do follow a lot of them and my timeline is full with pics of girls in bikinis lol. I understand that she's upset about that but I also think she's kinda overreacting. What should I tell her?
