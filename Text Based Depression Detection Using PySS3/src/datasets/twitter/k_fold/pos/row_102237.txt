What happened? I was just doing my French homework (I hate French) and listening to my music. And suddenly I got really angry and punched myself in the side of the head. Then a few minutes later I got really stressed and had to pause my music and take my headphones off. And I started breathing really heavily and shakily and felt like I was trapped in a small box. I started sweating loads so I pushed my chair all the way back and just breathed a lot. And now I'm crying out of nowhere. Does anyone know what happened? And does this happen do anyone else?
