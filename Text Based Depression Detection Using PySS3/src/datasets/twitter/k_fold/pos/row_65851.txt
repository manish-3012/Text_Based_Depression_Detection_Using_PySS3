Things I've learned from my first relationship (and why you should take them into account) So uh, hi everyone. I've been really thinking about this for a while now, and I'm feeling like I should share this with you guys, not only as a means of helping me get over this, but because you people would probably benefit from some (or all) of the information in here. TL;DR is at the end of the post if you don't like listening to stories (which is understandable). I apologize in advance for this being so long; all I can say is buckle in. Anyways, let's get into this.

I'll start by providing context first. I won't be mentioning names or places to save them from harassment. Last weekend, I was visiting and working at a local event in my town, and a girl came up to me and asked me for my number. At the time, I was pursuing another girl but hadn't really made any moves yet. So, I happily provided it (which was a mistake). I was kind of flattered, and I was excited to finally have a girlfriend because of course, I had never had one before. Little did I know...

At first, I was happy. We talked on the phone and texted for hours on end. Over the next few days, the happiness faded. She had told me some things that she did that I didn't think were the smartest choices. For example, she vapes... at 13, and that's a *huge* dealbreaker to me.  
Eventually, I ran into a mental block. Although she was nice, and I enjoyed the lunch she took me out on, I learned that her personality and mine don't really go that well together, and we began to run out of things to run about. Our conversations went around in circles, and I went to bed at night disappointed.

And I kept feeling disappointed and depressed. She was taking up my free time that I could've used for learning guitar, or not failing my math paper (which is uncommon for me). I wanted to get out of it and just live my life as nothing happened because I wasn't happy with the relationship. Eventually, I just fell out of talking and texting her. 

**All within the span of** ***7 days.***

Now, it wasn't anything she did, it's just that I should've thought about it before I told her. **I made an impulse decision. I should've thought it through before telling her that I wanted a relationship.**

Today my mom talked and stepdad talked to me about it, because they noticed that I wasn't acting how I usually act. They had asked another parent about her, and she basically told me some information about my girlfriend and her friend group that I basically found really weird and disturbing. Apparently, they *all* vape THC, which is illegal in my state. If I had stayed with her, I could've possibly been exposed, and if they got caught with it, I would've got in serious trouble when I'm innocent. After they told me that, they said I should think about what I really want in a girl, and to consider rethinking my relationship with her.

This evening I think I'm going to break it off and tell her that I don't really want a relationship right now. Unfortunately, this is going to be hard for me because I'm nice to everyone. I'm just going to be direct and honest, and I'll stand my ground. I'll also allow myself some emotional "healing" time before I decide I get into another relationship.

Ultimately, what I learned from this experience (and what you should take away from this post if anything) is that **I should've weighed the pros and cons**, and thought about it for a minute before diving right in. I should've compiled a list of dealbreakers and requirements she *must* meet (a big one of those for me is loving animals).

I've lived and learned, and I'll know better next time.

**TL;DR:**

* Know what you want from a relationship before diving in.
* Decide if she's really the one; do a quick evaluation.
* If you're not happy, just be direct.

Remember, just live a little, have fun, and don't be afraid to be happy, whether that's getting into (or out of) a relationship.

Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read this if you did, and I hope you have a nice day. :)
