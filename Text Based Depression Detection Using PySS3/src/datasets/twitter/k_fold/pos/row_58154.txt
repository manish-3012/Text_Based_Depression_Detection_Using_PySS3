My ears are bleeding I'm in online class, and my bio teacher is yelling so loudly while teaching. When I turn the volume down I can't understand what she's saying and my parents said I have to keep my headphones on since my little sister also has online school and my mom doesn't want her to get distracted from hearing my teacher, I typed that she's too loud in the chat but she didn't see it, and we're required to keep our mics and cams off so I can't say anything, send help aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhbb
