Birth Control Question Tell me if this fits better in another subreddit, for context I live in California.
So where I live, in 7th grade a, what they call, â€œpregnancy support and teenage pregnancy preventionâ€ group comes and gives us a presentation about sex, how it works, pregnancy, various methods of birth control, gender identity ya da ya da. Anyway so they tell us that we can receive birth control (all types, they had that highlighted in their presentation because I dig and found it in my old google drive) at any age because they want us to be safe right? Ok so an actual friend of mine (not myself I swear) is a senior in high school. She and her five year boyfriend decided they wanted to have sex but safely. So she emailed them and asked how she could receive birth control. They emailed her back and said a few things
1. She is a minor and can not receive any form of birth control including condoms
2. They gave her a big spiel about how dangerous unmarried sex can be for her mental health with some few choice words and phrases that came out as offensive.
3. They told her she shouldnâ€™t be having sex under aged but she still can not receive any form of contraceptives.
What the heck!? So they want to eliminate teenage pregnancy... but you have to be over 18 to receive their services even though on their website and commercials and presentation they say you just have to be at least 13. What can she do here? This doesnâ€™t seem right. She has a very strict family so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m posting this instead of her because she isnâ€™t allowed to have reddit.
Thanks yâ€™all in advance.
