this is weird thing to ask but i'm curious and bored if you're comfortable with it, leave your gender, age and sexuality along with a broad list of standards you have for the other gender. if you only care about personality, idk what to tell you. same goes for bi people. make two lists maybe?

here's mine

15m, straight

hair length/color: long hair/black  
personality traits: smart, cute, funny, sweet  
height: 5'6 or shorter  
any other preferences: small eyes (idk whats wrong with me)
