Iâ€™m thinking about transferring schools. My mom forced me to go to a private school that I never wanted to attend. Ripping me away from all my friends, except for one, but sheâ€™s kind of toxic. All of my old friends go to another school, and I want to transfer there. But I cant because my parents would never allow me, and Iâ€™m not sure how to feel about moving schools in sophomore year. I feel so sad and I miss my friends, I hate it here. Please give me some advice.
