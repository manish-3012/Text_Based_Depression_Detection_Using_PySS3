whyâ€™s the stray dog a stray cuz heâ€™s so alone like me 

I always liked you A, I donâ€™t know what to do. You sending the first text everyday before I text was significant for me. Itâ€™s all my fault I mixed up things thinking to myself that I love you. I donâ€™t deserve to be happy. Did I, A? You canâ€™t really fix depression with videos or books, people need different coping like I do. I donâ€™t see anything of this fun seeing you if itâ€™s going to hurt me. 

This will be my last post for the night before I head to sleep. I know I didnâ€™t matter to her that much, it didnâ€™t matter a lot from the start. She deserves someone better than me, a better friend.  I donâ€™t see myself being loved these days. 

You can see me as another of those depressed teenagers on here or see the real me. The real me would attach to someone for months and months before they left, except this one didnâ€™t.

I donâ€™t deserve to have anybody. My last words for this midnight is, your words and actions can have an impact on somebody whether it would be good or bad. Theyâ€™ll always remember it. 

Itâ€™s going to take time for me.
