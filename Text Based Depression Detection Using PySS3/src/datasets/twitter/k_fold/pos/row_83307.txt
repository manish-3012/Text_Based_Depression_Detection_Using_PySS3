Casual misogyny is fun âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨ It actually can be, just say something against men back and boom you have a riled up dumb dumb


Joking misogyny can be funny when done right, like in a discord server Iâ€™m on, people will joke around and itâ€™s funny, like the boys will say somn, the girls will say somn back just back and forth (as a joke) and itâ€™s funny 

Sometimes it can be just plain creepy and weird tho

So donâ€™t be misogynistic, and if you plan to do it in a joking manner just make sure the gals are okay with it and itâ€™s actually funny, otherwise youâ€™re weird and rude 

But normal misogyny icky and creepy and rude so donâ€™t do that, thatâ€™s a no-no

So basically, donâ€™t be misogynistic, unless youâ€™re making a joke and itâ€™s actually funny and people are okay with it

Same goes for the other way around, idk what â€œman-hateâ€ or whatever is actually called so my bad, but yea, same goes for the other way around
