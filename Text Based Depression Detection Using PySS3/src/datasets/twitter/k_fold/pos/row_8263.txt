My Bf and I (18) are both concerned about having sex Basically what the title says, we're both noobs in the matter. He has 0 experience on sex, whereas I already had it with a girl in the past. As you may guess, I never had to really worry about having children or following my cycle eagerly(I mean, fingers dont do miracles?) ). Tho now is different...

Apart from the obvious (Using condoms), we want to know other means of protection we can use to avoid accidents. Any suggestions, tips? like, maybe a list of stuff we should check before having sex...
