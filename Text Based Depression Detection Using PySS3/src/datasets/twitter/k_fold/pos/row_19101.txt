That's what you get for being a butthole ig So there's this girl in my English class, who I was in several classes with in jr high. She was so mean, to other kids and Laughed at people, and was disrespectfully loud and she is still like this. Somehow Even with this she was popular with students and teachers loved her. Anyways, today she said something (I didn't hear, I'm guessing it was something about someone else or the assignment) but the teacher did not like it, so at the end of the class the teacher called the girl up and whispered to her something, I only heard snippets, but she kinda called her out. Honestly this is probably the first time a teacher called her out, she's normally loved by teachers. Anyways, I she walked past my desk and her face was like ðŸ˜³. I honestly don't feel bad for her, to be honest it was about time that she'd get called out for her rudeness
