i think quarantine really has shown if people actually value you or not, and it has become abundantly clear to me that nobody at school did. i â€œknewâ€ a fair amount of people, but none as friends i guess.

whenever i try to reach out to somebody, i get ghosted or one word responses. typically along the lines of:

â€œhey how are youâ€

â€œgoodâ€

â€œiâ€™m glad! what have you been up to?â€

â€œsorry i gotta get back to workâ€

even if itâ€™s like 11 pm lmao. only notifications i get on my phone anymore is iOS begging me to update and a girl from a class in spring quarter asking for help for summer classes. i thought i had people who cared, but everybody just went into the ghosting deep end. i considered one guy to be a good friend, but then he went and shared deeply personal information i trusted him with with multiple people, so. ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸

not really feelin the school solidarity rn tbh ðŸ˜”
