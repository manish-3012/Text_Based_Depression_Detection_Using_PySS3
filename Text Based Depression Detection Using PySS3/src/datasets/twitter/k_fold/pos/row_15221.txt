Anyone feel different I feel different and like I don't fit in with others around me. 
I come from a family of 6 kids, I have done two overseas language exchanges both for 6 months, I was home schooled. I play too many instruments. Does anyone else feel this sense of standing out and never fitting in with the crowd.
