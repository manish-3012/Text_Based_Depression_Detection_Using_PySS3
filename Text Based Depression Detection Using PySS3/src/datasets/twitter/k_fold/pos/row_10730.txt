I need help I've been trying to find it for about 15 minutes now. It's a picture/meme of a guy from some animated movie walking kind of towards the camera. He's wearing a black suit and has a relatively tiny head for his almost square body. I'm pretty sure it's a saturated image. Does anyone know the title of this image? It's on the tip of my tongue but I just can't grasp it. Can anyone help me?
