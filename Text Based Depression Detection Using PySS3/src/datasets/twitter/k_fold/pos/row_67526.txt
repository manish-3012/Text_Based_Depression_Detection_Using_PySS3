Unreciprocated feelings hurt more when they like you as a person At least to me it does. I guess my thought process is:

**They donâ€™t return your feelings, they donâ€™t like you as a person:** Guess our personalities just arenâ€™t compatible, oh well, it is what it is 

**They donâ€™t return your feelings, they do like you as a person:** well guess Iâ€™m just unattractive in their eyes lol

Like, when everything else fits but they still donâ€™t like you that just feels really bad because youâ€™re just not attractive in their eyes to an extent that it negates everything else. Idk lol
