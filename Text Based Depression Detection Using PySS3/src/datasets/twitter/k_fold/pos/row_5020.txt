Omg my dad's new car is so fucking satisfying It's a brand new Porsche 718 gt4, and he let me drive it in a parking lot today.

Despite the steering wheel being fly by wire basically, it had so much road feel, like I could feel bumps in the road through the wheel even.

The transmission is so great. It snaps into place, and instead of like moving at an angle it moves more linearly. It also has autoblip which is just really satisfying and cool sounding.
