It's crazy how fast my friends change my mood Like I was kinda down this weekend and I didn't go out. Today I went to school and my whole mood changed after I met them. Even now, I'm home and I feel so much better than yesterday. I don't even know what I would do without them. It sounds kinda corny to say but it's so true.
