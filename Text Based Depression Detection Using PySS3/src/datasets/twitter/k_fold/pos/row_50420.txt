So, I kinda need help with a drawing Ok so Iâ€™m doing the git-commit-die drawing (donâ€™t summon them theyâ€™re probably busy and I donâ€™t want to bother them) and theyâ€™re holding a cat and there are 3 options: 

1/ Cat is normal


2/Cat is biting git-commit-die arm (though I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to this one because maybe cats like git-commit-die? Iâ€™m not really sure)


3/Cat biting the drawstring



Edit:No one really answered my question (except one person) so Iâ€™m just going to do 1 and 3 but not 2 because maybe cats like them (they probably do)
