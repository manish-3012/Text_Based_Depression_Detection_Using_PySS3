I want to go to a magnet high school, do my grades in 7th grade affect my chances of getting accepted if I have all Aâ€™s in 8th? In 7th grade, letâ€™s just say, I had really shitty grades. Especially when we switched to online schooling. This year Iâ€™m doing much better and am getting all Aâ€™s. I want to get into a magnet high school and was wondering since my 7th grade grades were shit am I probably not gonna get accepted? Decided this was the best place to ask since almost everyone here goes to high school.
