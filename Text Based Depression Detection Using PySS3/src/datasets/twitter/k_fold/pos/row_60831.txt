Let's learn text culture !!! So I've been in this app almost 10months now and I've seen many time when talking to people here and I or them sense that the conversation is a little bit dry we just leave and ghost that conversation...I think that ghosting is wrong and it is true that we don't have to say goodbye when we are in the internet but 
By not ending a conversation your making the other person feel unwanted and I think that even when a conversation is dry and you want leave it saying that it's dry and you don't want to talk anymore is much better than just leavingðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™
