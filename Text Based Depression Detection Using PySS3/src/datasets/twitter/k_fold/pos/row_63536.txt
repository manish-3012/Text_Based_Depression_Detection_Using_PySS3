Fun facts until I kill myself #2 We all know the stereotype about Semitic languages like arabic aramiac and Hebrew, they are all written from right to left because it was easier to do that when righting on stone or mud or whatever, right?, well there are 3 exceptions to this rule, for the first one we go to the island of Malta in Italy of all places, malta people speak a daughter language of Tunisie called maltese that share around 40 to 50 % of words between arabic and Italian, to find the second we go to Africa, where u will find a language called Amharic, it's non cursive and written from left to right, well whats the 3rd one then, well this one is complicated, to find this one we should go to the Levant, specifically Lebanon, u see lebanon uses the normale arabic fusha alphabet Ø£Ø¨Ø¬Ø¯ÙŠØ© but the lebanese people made a new alphabet to write using keyboards, it has many names like arabzi or loghat el whatsapp, but the most used name is karshounÃ© witch means gibrish in lebanese, it the normal French alphabet but using numbers to add the sounds used in lebanese that isn't found in French, it looks like this : "Mar7aba ya 5ayyÃ© ilna zamÃ©n manna shÃ©yfinak wen kil hal 8aybÃ© w2Ã©r" making lebanese the 3rd Semitic language to be written from left to right and one of the only modern languages to have 2 alphabets one is from right to left and the other in lef to right
