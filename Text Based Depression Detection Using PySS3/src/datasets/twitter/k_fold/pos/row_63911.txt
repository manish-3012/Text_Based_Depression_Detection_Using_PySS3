My best friend FaceTimed me crying in the middle of the night... I just hung up the phone. My best friend texted me in the middle of the night and asked me if I could FaceTime with him before he did something stupid. I panicked and told him to call me immediately.

His ex girlfriend fucked him over so bad. You have breakups where you're better after a week, then you have breakups where you feel a part of you was stolen by the other person, and no matter how hard you try you will never get that part back. You feel like someone shot you in the gut 17 times, and got finished you off by them pounding your heart with a bat until there's just nothing but a bloody mess.

He was sobbing uncontrollably, and I have never wanted to hug anyone so tightly before in my life. It made me sick to my stomach to think about what that girl did to him, something I just can't address here. It made my heart drop to look at him like that.

How, just how can you ever console someone in that state of grief? I listened to everything he had to say, but it came a time where I had to give him something, and I tried, I really did, but what am I supposed to say? What do you say? What are the words people in that state want to hear?
