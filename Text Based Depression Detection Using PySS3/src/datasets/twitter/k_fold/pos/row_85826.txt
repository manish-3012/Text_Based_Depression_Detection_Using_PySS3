You know, I'm a little jealous of my best friend. He's already got a girlfriend at 15, and here I am, 16, never even having one girl (that was in my state, short ldr when I was twelve, story for another time) actually like me back. I'm not envious of him. I'm just a bit jealous. I need someone I can share my feelings with and have them listen. As guys, if we ever share feelings, we immediately try to fix the problem rather than listen. I mean, I can barely share my feelings about things with my own family, much less friends. I'm just lonely too.
