my english teacher is gonna start streaming his gameplay of walden every friday iâ€™m way too excited. if you donâ€™t know, walden is a geographically accurate recreation of the lake on ralph waldo emersonâ€™s property, where henry davis thoreau stayed. you basically just walk around and look at the landscape and talk to people to collect pieces of the walden essay. itâ€™s a very peaceful game and i think itâ€™ll be a much needed break. have any of your teachers done anything like this?
