I just made a YouTube channel aimed at aiding beginner artists like me with their art journey :) I made this channel mainly to help beginner artists like me.   
When I started searching up and getting interested in digital around 1 month ago, I found myself spending dozens of hours just looking at art tablets, software, tips, and tricks, blah blah. I found these videos extremely time-consuming. Many of the videos had repeating tips and the YouTuber would elaborate on the same tip in 10 different ways. Very irritating as I realized later. Thus, I made this channel.   
Beginners can probably relate with me in their skill level and perhaps see the rate of growth of my skill across a time span. I plan on uploading a video every 2 weeks to keep it consistent so that the few viewers who want to join me can follow my progress.

The reason I am posting this on here is for suggestions on the video itself. I uploaded my first video today aimed at a small introduction and a sketch from my favorite webtoon in the BG. I hope people are critical about the video.

P.S I am aware the volume of the video is very low. I will improve it next time around.
