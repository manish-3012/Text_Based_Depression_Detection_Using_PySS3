Me and a friend are on a quest to bring together teens from as many walks of life as possible to chill out and make friends over the seven seas via discord So the other day I put a post on reddit asking for someone to talk to, and it turns out I made a friend on the other side of the world to me. This got me thinking. Could I create a discord server and try and get a small community of people from all walks of life together? Well that's what I did. If you're going through trying times and need someone to talk to or if you just want a place to mess around, send me a private msg and drop me ur discord for an invite!
