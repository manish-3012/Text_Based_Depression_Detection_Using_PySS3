Seems I was wrong when I thought my crush would like me back. Very wrong... I feel like shit now. Then again, what was I expecting? A positive reaction? Never heard one from a girl and probably never will.

Basically, my friend told my crush I like her for me. They did yell it across the classroom and then I started getting stressed because my past experiences with girls left me a but weary of females in general. Basically, every girl at my previous school (apart from my bff obvs) hated me like hell when I told them. They wouldn't even look at me without giving me a bitchy look. Still makes me shitty when I think about it. 

So, back to my current crush. Later, my friend said something like "it wasn't a joke". My crush cut them off mid sentence and said she didn't care.

I don't know how, but those 3 words stuck with me since yesterday.
