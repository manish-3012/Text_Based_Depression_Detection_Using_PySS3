I make fun of simps but I was a simp Basically Iâ€™m going to tell you guys the part of my life that I was a simp but first I have to tell you guys that my English is not good, this starts I think when the quarantine started, In Discord I found a girl that was a mod that said in a message "I donâ€™t feel very well, I think that I have to go to sleep" or something like that I donâ€™t remember very well, I asked her in the DMs if she is well or ok, she didnâ€™t responded, next day she responded saying that yeah she is well but he cut some wrists, I was a little bit angry at her for that but we talked and there a friendship started, days later she told me that she needed help to make her homework I helped her cause I wanted to make her donâ€™t have so many homework, and then weeks after that she asked me to buy her Black Mesa, i told her that I donâ€™t have money, in that point he started to chat with me less than other days and then abandon me, she came back days laters to then told me that she needs more help with the homework and then she blocked me for then days laters to told me she abandoned her Discord server because she had to go to therapy, then minutes later told me that she got shoot like 3 times to then the next day a member of her Discord told me that she killed herself and today, this fucking day I found her online in Steam, god fucking dammit I didnâ€™t wanted a pussy or a girlfriend I only wanted a friend that is a girl

And if this get posted in a cringe subreddit I want to say hello, just that
