I have an important announcement to make: Birds aren't government drones. We're absolutely innocent, and we're definitely not spying on citizens who violate code 011. We're just minding our own business, and our shit isn't laced with cyanide to collect subjects for project p32. 

We're birdsâ„¢, not drones.
