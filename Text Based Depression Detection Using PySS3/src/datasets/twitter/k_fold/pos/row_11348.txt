Is it weird to have a massive crush on a teacher? Whenever I see her, my perception of time slows down. She is just amazing in every capacity. She made me look forward to Spanish class. Spainish class! I dont have her class this year, but I chose to take a harder Spanish class this year so I'll be able to take her class next year. 

Not seeing her for a long time makes me depressed honestly but when I do see her, shes all I can think about for the rest of the day.
