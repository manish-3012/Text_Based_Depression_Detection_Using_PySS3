Hunter x Hunter has way to many Anti-LGBT fans for being like one of the biggest mainstream animes with gay and transgender characters in it Like literally any fan theory and people accept the possibility of it. EXCEPT if you mention the possibility of Gon and Killua being gay/bisexual then they will freak out and say they're 100% straight, and they're too young to know what being gay is (but they can know they're straight ðŸ˜).

And there's literally so many clues that suggest it's possible that they are in love more than just friends. Plus it's just fucking cute to think about it, like if someone wants to ship them and make their fan stories about them then like wtf why not.

And the fact they never have a problem with shipping male + female characters who weren't canonically in love. But then there's a problem if they're gay. That's pure homophobia.
