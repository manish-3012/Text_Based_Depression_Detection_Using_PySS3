I spent a week in a suicidal prevention hospital. Hello fellow teenagers. I just wanted to let you know if times are tough they can get better. I just got out of a week in the hospital. Not the hospital where if you get hurt but the one where you go if it's intentional. I went through the toughest part of my life I've ever gone through. I was suicidal. It was bad. I spent months pretending I was ok and that I was fine. Then a breaking point for me happened as I'm sure some of you know from my post history. I was already in a bad place and my breakup made it worse. This is not here for a sob story this is here to encourage. I was gone without my phone or without any contact for a week besides a phone. It was great. I made friends laughed legitimately for the first time in a while. Got on medicine that actually helps me. So here's my advice to all of you. If you are having thoughts get help tell loved ones. It helps. If you ignore it like I did for so long it makes it worse. It takes strength believe me I know it. But I believe in you if no one else does. PM me if you need someone to talk to. If you are feeling suicidal take action I believe in you. You are worth being here!
