Iâ€™m feeling very anxious and would love some advice &lt;3 Okay, so I have a friend. We were friends for a semester and then she stopped talking to me. We were best friends. Then this summer she contacted me again. I was super excited to have her back and accepted her back in. Months later sheâ€™s starting to diss me again. I respect her decision but this is very hard on me.

My mom is an alcoholic. So when I was little, Iâ€™d always believe that she was going to quit when she said so. But every time she would relapse and it would really fuck with me. It caused me to have some trust issues, but Iâ€™ve actually moved on from this. But with recent events, Iâ€™m starting to feel like Iâ€™ve made no progress with my mental health. My friend promised she was going to stay but for the second time she walked away. I donâ€™t know what to do. Sheâ€™s my only friend and Iâ€™m crying about it. It feels like Iâ€™m dealing with my mom all over again.
