Any advice to start doing ab/upper body strength workouts? Iâ€™m turning 17 soon and Iâ€™m happy with my height, but not so much with weight and strength. I have a few days where i feel really weak sometimes. Any tips on where to really begin and how much time should i put everyday to these workouts? (I know of no local gyms open in my area).
