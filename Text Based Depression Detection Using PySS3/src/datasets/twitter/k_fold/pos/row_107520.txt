So there's this new crypto currency It's called Pi, and it's apparently made by the teachers in Stanford. Idk how true this is but it costs nothing to mine (maybe other than your personal data). If you, for some reason, trust this you can download the app on your phone, it's called "Pi Network", you will need an invitation code and for that i have three codes (one is mine and the other two are my friend's codes) : swch,  AlexLupu258 ,  Cosmin111101. If you already know about this feel free to add any information you have. I have no idea if this is a scam so proceed at your own risk.
