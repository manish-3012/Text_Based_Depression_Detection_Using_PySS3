Why do they stop book fairs after middle school?? In elementary and middle school every year there were book fairs. And I donâ€™t want to assume but thatâ€™s when none of us had any money! We always had to ask but never always got money from our parents. But now as high schoolers most of us have jobs and extra money to spend on books or whatever they had at the book fair!

THEY NEED TO START BRINGING BOOK FAIRS TO HIGH SCHOOLS!!!
