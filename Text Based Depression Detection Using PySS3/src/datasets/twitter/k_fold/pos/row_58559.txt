You wanna know what really sucks? That I can write tests and good scores without having to study much for it. It doesnt sound very bad but thing is; I know I could do so much better on my tests if I just studied on time. But I procrastinate and put things off and end up having to mug up whatever I can in that last night. And i still get good marks but that causes me not to work hard for the next test cos I'm getting good scores anyway
 
Ok please ignore this. thank you :).
