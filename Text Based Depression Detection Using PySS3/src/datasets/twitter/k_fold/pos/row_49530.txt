Damn I miss elementary school Elementary school:

*  teachers actually cared about us
* we were happy
* we got snack time
* valentine's day wasn't a reminder of how single you were, you got candy and cards from your classmates
* grades didnt matter

Middle and High:

* teachers dont care about you
* we are depressed
* only lunch
* valentines day you see couples and just are alone
* grades matter
