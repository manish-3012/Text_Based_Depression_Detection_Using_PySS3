Why is America so dumb I was just at an outdoor restaurant and all the employees have masks but take them off to talk to you. Like the masks are there so I donâ€™t get coronavirus when you talk so whatâ€™s the point of having it on in the first place. Itâ€™s like have your seatbelts in an airplane on during a smooth flight but then the pilot says that they are gonna have an crash landing and then you take off your seatbelt so you can feel more comfortable in your seat.
