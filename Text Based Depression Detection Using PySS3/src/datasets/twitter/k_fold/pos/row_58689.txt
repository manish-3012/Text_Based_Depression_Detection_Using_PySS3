Just a funny poem i found in my old textbook One bright day in the middle of the night

two dead soldiers got up to fight 

back to back they faced each other 

drew their swords and shot each other

a deaf policeman heard the voice 

and ran to save the two dead boys

if you don't believe this story is true

ask the blind man he saw it too.
