The seemingly impossible story of dorothy eady Reincarnation doesn't seem possible in a scientific perspective, but come on, I'm talking consciousness here. The story of dorothy eady involves Her, as a child, falling down a stairway. A doctor pronounced Her dead, and she soon got up like nothing happened. She started have fascinations about ancient Egypt. She even went to a museum one time and literally could not resist this photo of the temple of seti I, claiming: "that's my home". She would later describe her past life In ancient Egypt. Now this part is the most shocking: She claimed to know where some garden used to be. It was buried underground, and it actually was under the ground, where She said it was. This is only 1 of many claims of past life
