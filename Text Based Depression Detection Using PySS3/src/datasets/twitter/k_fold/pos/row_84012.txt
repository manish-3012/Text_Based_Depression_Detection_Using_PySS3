Im unsure about my future Im confused about my future goals, and im thinking im wasting my time in the present, right now ive decide learn to unravel my artistic skills, but im fearing im wasting my time with art, and i should spend more time learning things that help my career, ive decided i wanted to study robotics and related science, my life goal was to build robots that do harsh unpaid and boring job instead of humans, build machines that do jobs like mining, farming, fishing, building and the kind of jobs no one wants to do unless they have no money, However i started asking myself if i should do it rather than if i can do it, I know if im enough perseverant i could do it, but is ethic to do it?. Is ok to replace works poor people need to survive. Perhaps some one alredy did it before and im wasting my time, Perhaps i should dedicate to invent other stuff or find other thing, like a way to make high specs computers less expensive of build, buy, and produce. Or perhaps i should dedicate to other thing that is not science. like art, or sports, I dont know.
