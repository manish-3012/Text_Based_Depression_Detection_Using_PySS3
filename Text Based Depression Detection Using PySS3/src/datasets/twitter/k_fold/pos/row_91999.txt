Join the navy No one dies in the navy unless it involves someone deciding to jump off a ship for no reason. Along with that you get most of the benefits and you get the hear airplanes go vroom vroom and thatâ€™s very very cool. To be fair there is a downside of you getting fucked in the ass but other than that the navy is perfect for you.
