Posting everyday until I get a girlfriend. Day: 27 The only thing thatâ€™s getting my mind off of my whole situation is a damn biology exam tomorrow that flows into my final graduation grade. And thatâ€™s not exactly a good distraction either. 
And itâ€™s always in the evenings that I feel even worse about everything.
