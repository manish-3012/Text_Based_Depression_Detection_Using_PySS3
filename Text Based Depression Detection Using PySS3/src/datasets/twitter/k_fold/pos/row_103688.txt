I saw on twitter a post about kendall jenner and her tequila and... The comments were straight up bullshit. How can people be so dumb. Things ive seen there:

-â€œdont buy from her especially not from white owned businessâ€

-â€œif ur white ur not allowed to participate in other culturesâ€

-â€œanother white vultureâ€

-â€œcolonizerâ€

-â€œwhite people like her shoudl donate their profitâ€

Whats with the hate against white people, like i dont give a shit about that plastic doll but why do some people hate white people.

Fuck is wrong with some...
