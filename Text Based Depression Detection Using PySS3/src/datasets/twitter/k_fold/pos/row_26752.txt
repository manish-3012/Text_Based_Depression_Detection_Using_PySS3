I feel like i canâ€™t fall in love with a person. is this feeling normal?  Okay Iâ€™m almost 20 and I just started college. So basically I have liked guys attractive and have liked guys from afar like celebrities or people I have never talked too but I have never liked someone for their personality in a romantic way. Like the guys I would have crushes on, I had this fake idea of who they were and I thought I was in love with their perosnality but I just ended up making up who I thought they were. I just donâ€™t understand what it feels like to fall in love with someoneâ€™s personality I guess. Iâ€™m gay and in the closet so Iâ€™ve never dated but Iâ€™m just scared Iâ€™ll never be in a true relationship because I feel like Iâ€™m incapable for falling in love with someone. The relationship would just end up feeling like a friendship. Does anyone have any advice?
