guys, i just realized something... hey y'all, this post isnt really important and may waste ur time... anyways, moving on...

i just realized something...

i was watching tik tok's (yeah, ik, make fun of me all u want) and i was watching the most saddest shit, like school bullying stories. now, im autistic and i get really emotional easily. when i was watching this sad shit, it made me feel really sad. thats when the truth in my head came into play...

i realized... that im lucky to have what i have. i used to be bullied too, but not as severely as other people have been. im actually lucky to still be here and be pushing strong.

so, all i have to say is, for those that're being bullied, just keep pushing forward.
