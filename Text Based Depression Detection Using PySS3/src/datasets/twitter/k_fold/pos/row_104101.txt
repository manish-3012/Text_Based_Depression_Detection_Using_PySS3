I thought i got fat but it is my length So this morning i weighed myself and it was 6kg more than half a year ago but if i look at myself i wouldnt say i got fatter its just my length because this morning i grabbed a shirt again that i bought some months ago and at that time is was a normal fit shirt and its way too short now.

And i do weightlifting so that will also add some weight. Idk how much i grew ill check later today. I was 6â€™3 i guess im like 6â€™4 now
