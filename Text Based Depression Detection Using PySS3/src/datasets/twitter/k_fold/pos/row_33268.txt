Fuck reposts It's 2:20 am where I live and instead of sleeping I'm browsing reddit, and what do I see ONLY Reposts, just fucking stop stealing other people's posts for fucks sake, just be creative and make a new meme yourself.
I know that I should go to sleep but I can't for some reason, I guess I'll try to sleep.
Tl;dr: fuck reposts especially past midnight, and good night
