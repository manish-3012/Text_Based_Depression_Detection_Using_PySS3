Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 15: George Patton Patton was one of the great generals of World War Two and one of the few generals who had the respect of who he was fighting. However, being a general can't be done by being nice, so he has a bit if a history.

Like most of the great American generals, he went to Westpoint, but he sucked at it. He failed mathematics in his first year and had to repeat the whole year.

In the interwar period, he submitted a plan to the Army to make tankmen wear golden football helmets and what was essentially boy scout uniforms. It was regected.

In Italy, Patton slapped two of his soldiers with PTSD. The event was controversial and caused him to be relieved of command and he was used as a decoy commander up until after the invasion of France.

I should also add that despite being a hero if 2 World Wars, he was killed in a minor car crash in Germany.
