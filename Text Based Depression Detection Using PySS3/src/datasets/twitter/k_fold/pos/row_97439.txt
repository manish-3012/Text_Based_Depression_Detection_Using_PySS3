The bot is fucking broken. I try to make to make a meme, but then the bot says itâ€™s â€œslight modification of an older postâ€. Most of the time, I didnâ€™t even KNEW about the post until clicking the link the bot provided, and usually these older posts are over 100 days old. This, as you can imagine is one of the exact reasons why I donâ€™t usually upload memes onto the subreddit, it restricts me to post anything that can be completely new and original.
