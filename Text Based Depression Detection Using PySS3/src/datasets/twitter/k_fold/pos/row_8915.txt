How do I motivate myself? Im in the middle of class right now, with 3 hours left. I don't know why but I feel like complete shit. My dysphoria is acting up a bit. Even though I feel exhausted, every sense is heightened and anxious. Everything just feels so... insane. I'm not sure how Im supposed to deal with the rest of school-
