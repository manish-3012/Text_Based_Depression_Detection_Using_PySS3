Some self-help advice I desperately wish I had known and taken seriously 4 years ago when I started feeling depressed. Please, listen to me just for a minute. I know everyone's different, but these are the things that worked for me.  


Consistently drink more water in general. Do a few pushups, situps, jumping jacks, whatever. But drink water before and after, a whole glass.   


For me, pacing around my room or looking out a window breaks my train of thought. It gets it off the depressing shit I'm thinking about for a bit.  


If you think you're a piece of shit, you'll always feel like a piece of shit. Not because you are, but because you convinced yourself you are. You need to compliment and be more forgiving to yourself. Tell yourself you're 'not that bad', 'not a total piece of shit', and it slowly gets better.  


Go on walks outside, if you're able. Hell, go on a bike ride if you can. Just spend more time outside in general.  


I sincerely hope this helps at least a little bit.
