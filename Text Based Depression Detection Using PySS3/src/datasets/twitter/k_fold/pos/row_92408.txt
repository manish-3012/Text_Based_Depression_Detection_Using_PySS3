Fuck me, guys.... So I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but alot of girls in school like me this year. I met this one girl who I really like, and when I have my eyes set on someone I go for her. Well, we were gonna go to the movies today. but she just told me she wants to stay friends because, get this, HER FRIEND LIKES ME. So I cant go out and possibly date the girl I like because a friend of hers likes me. I'm not even gonna date her friend! I wanna date HER! I haven't been with anyone for a second because my last relationship fucked me up, and the second I find someone, ITS FUCKING RUINED... I just worked my ass of to get some extra cash for us today, and now this happens. I wanna fucking die....
