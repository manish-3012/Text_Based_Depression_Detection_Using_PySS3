Oh look another day of waking up and questioning my sexuality Iâ€™m straight, I mostly always like guys but I also occasionally like girls and non binary people. I liked this one girl a lot last year, one of the bigger crushes tbh but didnâ€™t do anything about it because I was scared and didnâ€™t wanna accept the fact I might not be straight. I still donâ€™t even know what I am!!! Like Iâ€™m so fucking basic white girl if I said I was bi or something everyone would think I was just the girl doing it for attention. I got blonde hair blue eyes and basic highschool girl look going, I genuinely would have no one believe me and no girl would even wanna date me. And I donâ€™t even know if I am gay!!!! But I would totally kiss a girl, would totally date a girl, would totally eat some pussy, and even tho I hate marriage I theoretically would marry a girl. And that shit is confusing!!!! Because majority I like guys but occasionally I really do like a girl. And I feel bad because even Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s just admiration and Iâ€™m not actually gay or if itâ€™s real. Because it feels real I get butterflyâ€™s in my stomach and think about girls romantically but I also feel like no one would believe it. So idk. I cant really do shit about it.
