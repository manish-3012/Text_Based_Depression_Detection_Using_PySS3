BLM is stupid Preface: What happened to George Floyd was definitely awful and fuelled by racism. And yes black lives obviously matter. Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m not racist but I almost certainly will be called racist anyway so whatâ€™s the point. Ok letâ€™s say we have a theoretical racist copper named Hank. Now Hank sees these riots and Hank sees looting (Iâ€™m not saying all the looting and rioting was BLM, Iâ€™m also not saying there were no peaceful protests) but all this isnâ€™t going to make Hank less racist. In fact itâ€™s just throwing fuel on the fire. He might start blaming black people for all of this and become even more racist. I just honestly donâ€™t see what good the BLM campaign is doing.
