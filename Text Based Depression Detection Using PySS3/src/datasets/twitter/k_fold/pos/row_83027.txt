My school is fucked up This happened a long time ago but nevertheless I wanna share it.

Two years ago a kid at my school committed suicide due to being cyber bullied for being gay. A tragedy of course, but this kid was popular among the theater kids and though I had never heard of him till after he died I could tell he had been popular. So eventually it reached a point where all the 9th graders had an assembly and the upper staff expressed their sympathies and given the typical "bully bad" speech. That wasn't the fucked up bit. That came when my vice principal casually dropped that two other kids committed suicide that year and never brought it up again. That was the third suicide, that, year. And almost no one knew, I guessed. I dont know if it was his popularity or the outcry that he committed suicide for being homosexual that triggered the meeting, probably both. But I can just imagine those two other kids, thinking that when they die no one would notice or care, and actually being right... why did my school not call an assembly or at least send out a schoolcast for the other two? Its almost like they only addressed it to get everyone to shut up about his death. Just goes to show how much my school actually cares about us.

Going on 100 covid cases out of the 2000 at my school, on blended learning, full PPE and sanitation measures, and we were in school for 3 weeks... and we go back to 5 days a week on the 22nd...
