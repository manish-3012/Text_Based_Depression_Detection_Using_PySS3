I broke up with my girlfriend and my aunt is critically injured. The odds that she makes it are slim. And my girlfriend is now lesbian. Not the best week for me. Even though she's not my blood relative, and she's been divorced from my uncle since I was born but it's always felt like she was a part of our family.
