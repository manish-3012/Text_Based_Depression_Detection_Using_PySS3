Is it me or the whole world is turning slower perhaps is that im not looking enough for it but i think that there is nothing truly happening on the world. everytime i open any social media in search for something midly intersting that i havent seen there is no other thing that is not politics and covid. Im bored. For now ive decided to try to dive into old things i have never truly been into before. Or deep dive into things i alredy know but rarely participate. But answer me. Is it me or nothing funny is going on right now?
