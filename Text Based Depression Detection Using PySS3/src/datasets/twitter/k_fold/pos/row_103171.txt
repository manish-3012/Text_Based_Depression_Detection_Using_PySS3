My parents make feel suicidal I feel sick to my stomach and my mom yells at me like I'm lying and then continues to say that she loves me not even five minutes later she calls me  "a crying liar just like my father" and that actually makes want to go live with my father instead because I don't get yelled at for standing up for myself. I was up until 3AM with a stomach bug feeling like I would throw up any moment and woke up at 7:30 not even 5 hours of sleep no joke I wake up and not even about 20 minutes later not even a chance for me to make coffee I have two people in a mid life crisis yell at me at once to pick up sticks around the yard. When people say spend a day in my shoes it usually would be coming from me and get yelled at by every adult in the house. They say that they will take away my power chord for my Xbox but I have several spares. They aren't the smartest, the next thing you know when they find me hanging from the ceiling they'll say "it was because of that videogame"...

If there's anything wrong with my post I'll remove it and type about my issue elsewhere. Thank you r/teenagers you make my day!
