I just made my teacher die inside by drinking milk Background - My school went full remote due to the recent snowstorm in the new york area. My history teacher likes teacher to people instead of to our profile pics. I was exposed to covid and am currently quarantined, and have drinks in a cooler in my room, one of which is milk.

Class started with the teacher begging us in class to turn on our cameras. Eventually one of my classmates randomly asked in the Google meets chat if we liked milk. This sparked discussion about how glorious milk is until our teacher jokingly threatened to take points off for talking about milk (he's a pretty chill dude but I wouldn't put it past him to actually do it).

I remembered that I had milk in my cooler so I grabbed some, took a swig straight out of the jug, and my teacher proceeds to die inside.
