I'm a bloody centrist who hates the left and right. If you talked to me you'd probably say I leaned right but no. Fuck both sides. I don't like politics but I keep myself informed as to not get lost in society. No side is better than the other; they're all terrible the same. Horseshoe theory? More like a bobby pin.
