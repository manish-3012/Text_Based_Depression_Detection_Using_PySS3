I remember the first time I did acid I took a piss and the pee in the toilet bowl was moving around like waves in the ocean I stared at my own pee and watched it swish around for god knows how long. Then I laid in my bed and watched a mini, neon amusement park operate before my eyes, and that was the exact moment I felt love for the first time in almost a decade.
