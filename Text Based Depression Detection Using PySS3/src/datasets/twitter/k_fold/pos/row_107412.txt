Avoid V Shred at all costs!   

The other day I found something out that is rather disturbing.

According to the CEO, V Shred is on track to do **$220 MILLION** in sales!

Despite being shunned by the fitness community the company now has **200+ employees** and its only getting bigger and bigger.

This is crazy to think given all the controversial things the company does:

* Spreading misinformation
* Teaching dangerous exercises
* Selling snake oil supplements
* Plagiarising content
* Selling overpriced, poorly written programs
* Allegedly fake transformation pictures and reviews

You may be wandering, how on earth do they get away with this?

**MARKETING**

Now there is one thing this company is good at and that is marketing.

Essentially what they do, is create hundreds of different ads, full of pseudo-science and outright lies and then target these to the most vulnerable people; beginners who do not know any better.

While I cannot find an exact number for their marketing spend, the predictions that I have seen are in the millions and this worries me because their whole operation is clearly working.

At one point in a V Shred webinar, Vince even tried to suggest that his pre-workout supplement burn was more 'scientifically supported' than diet and exercise!

Unfortunately, there are people who actually believe this.

The fact is Vince is just a puppet on strings, doing whatever he is told by a bunch of internet marketers who clearly lack morals.

As a lot of you are probably just getting into the gym/ fitness I'm sure (if you are not already getting them) you will be bombarded with V-Shred ads.

Please take the advice of the top fitness youtubers such as:

* Athlean-X
* Sean Nalewanyj
* Greg Doucette
* Simon Miller
* Layne Norton
* Shredded Sports Science
* And pretty much every V Shred YouTube review

**AND AVOID V SHRED AT ALL COSTS!**

It really upsets me to see people fall into the traps laid by unauthentic people such as V-Shred, so much so that I put 100+ hours into making a video on the topic which I hope will prevent a lot of people falling for the companies shady advertising, if at all you have ever been tempted by a V-Shred ad, and this post has not put you off of the company, please watch this video:
