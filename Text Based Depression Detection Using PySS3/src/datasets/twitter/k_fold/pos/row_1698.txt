School and two casual jobs? Ok I'm 16 and was just wondering if it would be reasonable to take on two casual jobs despite doing full-time school? I was thinking maybe working on the weekend for one and weekdays for the other. Does anyone think this would be ok? Or would it be too much? Btw I'm Aussie so we do have yearlys this year (year 10), but if they're casual jobs I'm thinking I could just ask for time off for a while for my exams?

Thanks in advance, y'all!
