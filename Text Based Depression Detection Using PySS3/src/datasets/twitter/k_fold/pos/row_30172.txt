Probably the worst community to ask... But girls usually snap me first. Iâ€™m tall, attractive enough, have some money basically every single thing that you hear girls like I have to some degree. But non of that shit matters cause I canâ€™t fucking talk to them. Conversations usually go like this: 

-Hey &lt;â€” girl
-Whatâ€™s up? &lt;â€” me
-nothing, you?
-Just watching some YouTube
-cool
-yeah, howâ€™s your day been?
-good
-mines been good too, do u know if we have any homework btw?
-no
-ah ok
*end of conversation*
