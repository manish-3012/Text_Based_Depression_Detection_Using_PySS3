Posting fun mobile games until I run out of games or forget [Day 2] Again, like I said in my last post, these posts are meant to give light to not so famous games that are incredibly unique. 

Summary at the last paragraph.

**Random Dice : PvP Defense**

This game is really simple. Itâ€™s essentially a tower defense multiplayer game. Thatâ€™s not very unique since thereâ€™s a TON of tower defense games. What sets this game apart is that itâ€™s essentially all random. You pick 5 dice before starting a game (you can buy more in the shop, but you always choose 5) and those are the dice that are randomized. Whenever you buy a dice, it gives you a random dice on a random part of the board. You can merge two dice of the same color/type (doubles the attack rate of the dice) and itâ€™ll even randomize which dice it turns into. Thereâ€™s dice that do random damage, too. The game is pretty fast-paced and usually each round lasts for a few minutes, depending on the game mode. Thereâ€™s a trophy road where you can earn rewards and itâ€™s one of those games where if you watch ads, youâ€™ll get a lot of coins and other stuff (though the upside is that there are no forced ads). Itâ€™s a great game thatâ€™s easy to understand. It may seem like it at first, but this game is definitely not pay to win. Thereâ€™s different game modes that include, but not limited to, 1v1, Co-Op, and tournament.

As always, I will be listing the bad parts of the game to stay unbiased as I can even though I love this game. Connection errors. There are pretty bad servers and sometimes youâ€™ll be kicked out of a game from lag, but it doesnâ€™t happen very often so it isnâ€™t that big of a deal. There are a decent amount of hackers, although the mods do a good job at banning them. Very hard for new players. A lot of new players donâ€™t really know the strategies and then they lose a bunch of games and end up deleting the app. Iâ€™d say, if youâ€™re having troubles, go to the subreddit ( r/randomdice ) and ask for their help. Thereâ€™s also some videos. They essentially copied the home screen for Clash Royale, although the two games arenâ€™t similar in the slightest.

Although this game is pretty well known, most of you probably donâ€™t know about it. Itâ€™s a great tower defense game where you versus others (and can work with them) that is all about luck and strategy. There are some connection issues, but overall it works completely normal. Very unique game. **7/10**.
