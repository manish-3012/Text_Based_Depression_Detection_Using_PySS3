oh am I lucky... yesterday me and my girlfriend who have been together for like a week had the best time last night. 

so I set up a cute little thing so we could watch a Halloween movie then hopefully fall asleep together or something.

we went skating first which was nice because the leaves are changing

we get to my room and start kissing for some reason she stops smiles at me then we start again like damn the butterflyâ€™s I got were incredible. (then I gave her a hicky but thatâ€™s not important)

after all that she asked me to slow dance which was so cute

then to top it all off we fell asleep together on the couch like jeez am I lucky 

also quick reminder to not feel lonely by this post I guarantee you will find someone (if I did you will)
