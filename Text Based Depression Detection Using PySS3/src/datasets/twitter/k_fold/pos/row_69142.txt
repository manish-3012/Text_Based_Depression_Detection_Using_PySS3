Online school is making me perpetually stressed and unhappy. We have two days a week in person and 3 remote they keep handing out tons of work and I donâ€™t have time to do it all because my dad doesnâ€™t let me do homework on weekends, I am always stressed about school and have just been guessing my way through homework because I donâ€™t have time to sit down and watch 8 videos for every class to teach myself every topic, thatâ€™s right we donâ€™t even learn in person itâ€™s all self taught now at least in most classes.
