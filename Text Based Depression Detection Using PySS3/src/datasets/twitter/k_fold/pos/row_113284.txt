How Should I Ask Her Out? (Me: 17M/Her: 16F - Both Juniors in HS) Thereâ€™s this girl that Iâ€™ve known since Freshman year in my Earth Science class and I didnâ€™t really know her too well. But we started talking because we both sat next to each other. and I got to know her better. There were also two other friends we had so it was a bit of small friend group. Long story short, she invited me to her Discord server along with her two other friends and we talked some more there and more about stuff non-school related like memes, TV shows, movies, and games.


Onto Sophomore year, I think weâ€™ve become pretty good friends. Weâ€™ve also happened to be in the same Science class in the second year in a row coincidentally. Weâ€™d make each other laugh often and had fun. I started to have feelings for her and she seemed to be interested in me as well and sheâ€™d start the conversations first through text with me sometimes. Sometimes sheâ€™d also have these problems outside of school about her family and her feeling sad in general, and Iâ€™d talk to her about it since we knew each other well enough and we were both comfortable talking about it. She seemed to really appreciate my advice whenever something was seriously concerning her and from that, we got closer to each other. Though, I didnâ€™t have ask her out yet at that point because I wasnâ€™t confident enough.

Now weâ€™re both Juniors, and weâ€™ve still talked even though weâ€™ve been doing online school, weâ€™ve last spoken to each other about a month and a half ago about a new guitar hobby she picked up and she came to message me about it and asked me for advice since I knew a thing or two about playing those instruments. Since recently, Iâ€™ve been thinking about her a lot and Iâ€™ve really been contemplating about asking her out since I feel a lot more confident in myself now (Iâ€™ve even had dreams about it too), though I canâ€™t exactly figure out how I should do it. With the whole pandemic going on, and CA on lockdown, Iâ€™m not too sure about asking her out in person and if I should text her instead (or if texting her is even a good option). I just want to know whatâ€™s the best way to ask her out, whether how I should do it or what I should say. Any advice would be appreciated
