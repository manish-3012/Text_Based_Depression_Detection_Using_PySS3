Why do parents do this?(at least my mom) I donâ€™t know if this was posted before but Idc. Ok so my mom usually is like joking about me having a girlfriend and then starts listing off dumbass names that it could be to get me to smile and if I smile on one of the dumb ass names she goes and then says that what ever the fuck that name is is my gfâ€™s name. Then my sister who is 7 always does the same thing. The depressing thing about this is I donâ€™t have a gf and no matter how many times I tell them that they donâ€™t listen and do it more. I donâ€™t know if that is supposed to make me feel better about it but it sure isnâ€™t working.
