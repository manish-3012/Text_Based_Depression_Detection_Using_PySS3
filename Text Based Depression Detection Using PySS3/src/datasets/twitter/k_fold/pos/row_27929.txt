I fucking hate school Everything is difficult. Every time I see one problem I donâ€™t know the answer to no matter how many times I look it up in a book, rewrite the problem every way possible and keep getting different answers, or just see a certain person in the halls I want to run to a bathroom stall or just out of the fucking school and cry and/or scream about how much everything frustrates me and makes me want to not exist.
