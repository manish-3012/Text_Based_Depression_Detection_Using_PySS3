How do I tell my dad I donâ€™t give a fuck if he gets sick? I am trying to do a student exchange program in Edmonton, CA. My family lives in South Carolina and we are all from Sweden. I really want to go there, and Iâ€™ve studied about, I can, I just canâ€™t visit them in America. My dad keeps saying â€œif we get sick, or you get sick, what will you do if you canâ€™t visit us?â€ And, Iâ€™m not quite sure how Iâ€™m supposed to tell him what I think, which is â€œI donâ€™t give a fuck if you get sick, and I canâ€™t visit you, there is FaceTime.â€ I tried explaining to him, but Iâ€™m not quite sure how to tell him that if we get sick, we get sick, thereâ€™s nothing we can do about it, itâ€™s not like anyone in our family is a fucking doctor anyway.
