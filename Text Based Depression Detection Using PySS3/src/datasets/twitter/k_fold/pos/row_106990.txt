Looking for people to be friends with So, a little background about me. I'm 17, from India, and I'm into art, music , cooking and memes. I also really like dogs. Most people I befriend online end up not talking to me bc of the horrid difference in time zones. So yeah. Some friends would be good. Ehhh I really don't know what else to add here. Bye.
