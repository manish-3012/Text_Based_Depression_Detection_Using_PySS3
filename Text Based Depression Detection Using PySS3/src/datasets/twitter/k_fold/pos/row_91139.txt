is it weird to listen to breakup songs and feel emotional by them even though Iâ€™m in a relationship? I was jamming to Mr. Loverman by Ricky Montgomery which helped me a lot through my last breakup. Iâ€™m in a happy relationship now yet the song still makes me sad. I still feel this way with a lot of songs but theyâ€™re still so good.

Am I â€œwrongâ€ for listening to sad breakup songs even though Iâ€™m in a happy relationship with a lovely person???
