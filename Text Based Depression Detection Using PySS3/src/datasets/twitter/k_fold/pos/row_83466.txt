Anyone know how to doanload Genshin Impact on a school laptop? I got a laptop from my school that can run Genshin but I can't download it because I need to enter an admin user and password every time I want to download a program that makes changes to the device.  I'm not sure if this applies to all programs though because I can download Discord Canary just fine.
