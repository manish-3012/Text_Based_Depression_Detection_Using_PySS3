I don't know if I can do this anymore. I want to give up so bad. Today I was meant to go on a date with this girl, my first ever date of my life mind you, and she had to cancel because "her dad couldn't get home until late". I believed her. Once again, first EVER date, she seemed interested in me and we hit it off. I talk to her about an hour later, and guess what? We're just friends. And she got a boyfriend. I was *so* fucking close to my first date after YEARS of trying things. I don't know if I can fucking do this anymore, it's so god damn tiring and I just want to embrace someone else's love, and all I get is.. this. I want to give up. So god damn bad.
