My best friend started dating my crush when he knows Iâ€™ve liked her for 3 years, what do I do? Sheâ€™s been a reason that Iâ€™ve mentally made it through middle school and part of highschool and my best friend who said that Iâ€™m like a brother to him started dating her a few days before I asked her out. The thing is that he knows Iâ€™ve liked her for years and I donâ€™t know what to do
