Im moving and im really sad tbh So my dad got transferred to a new job by the bank that he works for.Its kinda the same job but completely different at the same time. Its is in a different location so that means we have to move soon.That also means im moving schools. im really sad (not depressed but sad) bc of that.all my family and friends are here. :\\

just wanted to say this bc writing abt it is waaaaaaay to cheesy for me.

pls dont hate tho
