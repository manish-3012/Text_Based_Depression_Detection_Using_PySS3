Never had a irl girlfriend I've never had a irl girlfriend (im 16M)... I seem to get along with girls in general pretty easily, and i play with alot of girls online and we all can just chill and have fun, but idk what it is... If im afraid of getting rejected irl or just cant find anyone im willing to take the risk for... Is it just me?
