I finally did it!!! After a couple of days (about 3 hours) I finally am able to throw cards consistently. I know a lot of people can, and I canâ€™t do it super fast, BUT I STILL CAN HAHAH!!! Anyways moral of the story after watching gambit from a young age Iâ€™ve always wanted to throw cards, and hard work pays off. (Thanks people of new for listening)
