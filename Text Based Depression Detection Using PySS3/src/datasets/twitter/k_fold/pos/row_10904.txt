My birthdays are starting to get unenjoyable Today is my 16th birthday, which means my parents will finally start letting me date (didn't stop me before lol). However, now that the day has come, I'm not excited. Same with my 15th birthday. It just wasn't a good day, and neither is today. I miss when birthdays were interesting and fun
