good idea that may or may not end up with me not being able to sleep okay so tell me if you think this is a good idea or not 


ever since i was like 10 ive been extremely afraid of that one super old advertisement video- â€œlittle babyâ€™s ice creamâ€ on youtube...

i used to not be able to look at it without crying but lately iâ€™ve been trying to get over my fear 

since iâ€™m very into painting portraits i was thinking i should paint the guy in the video in order to get over my fear

however in order to do that i would need to watch it again which might give me a panic attack maybe 

what do yâ€™all think
