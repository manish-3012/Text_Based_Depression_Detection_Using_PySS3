Made an alt just so you guys would take this seriously So two weeks ago my mom told me that someone I know/knew had sexually assaulted a child. I wanted to know who it was, but she wouldn't tell me, and gave me a long talk about ever getting touched and if I had ever wanted to do that to someone else to come to her and get help.

Last week, she got new information saying that \[Perpetrator\] had done it to multiple children ages 7-10/11 (at the time of the assault). This has been happening since he was 9 or so (I'm not sure exactly), and we do not currently know if the 10/11 y.o. was a victim or perpetrator. She then told me who it was to make sure that he had not done anything to me and if I had ever noticed anything. He was a very good friend of mine's brother that I had not spoken to in a year or so. He was always crazy/energetic, but I never expected anything. But then again, it started many years ago, and I don't have the best memory. His victims ranged from close family to distant friends.

If you EVER, expect anything or see strange behavior in someone, PLEASE tell someone. If YOU ever get these bad urges, tell someone. Don't be ashamed, you will be much more ashamed if you are labeled as a sex offender for the rest of your life for something you did as a kid. You can get help, and if you do not trust your family, tell a guidance counselor or a trusted adult. I am never going to think of this person the same way again, don't make that the case for you or someone else.

^(And \[friend involved because this is very specific\] if you somehow see this, you can talk to me about it, LH, and no one is blaming you.)
