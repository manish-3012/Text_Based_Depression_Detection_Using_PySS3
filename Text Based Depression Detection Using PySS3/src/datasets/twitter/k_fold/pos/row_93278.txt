The tragic but for me hilarious story of my first love! So I was thirteen years old and started to have a crush on an older guy. We had some type of strange friendship so we had a conversation from time to time. In one conversation I brought up my two metres tall, perfect blond cousin and he started to crush on my cousin openly, while he knew about my feelings for him...

So, I told my cousin who is homophobic about the fact that the guy I liked was openly crushing on him... Whahaha, the result was hilarious sadly no one got beaten up.
