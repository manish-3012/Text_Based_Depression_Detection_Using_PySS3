Im in love w floofy haired boys Ok i hate this, im on my lovely period and i watched tiktok. A super cute guy with floofy hair and dimples were on my fyp and i started crying bc hes prob too old for me and lives 4834384783 miles away from me. I ended up watching couples being cute and cuddle my pillow and i basicly pretended that my pillow was that one floofy haired tiktok boy. I kissed my pillow the entire night- 

anyways today i took a bath and watched youtube, THE HOE I WATCHED STARTED KISSING HER BOYFRIEND AND I GOT SO MAD I THREW MY PHONE, in the toilet. hows ur day been?
