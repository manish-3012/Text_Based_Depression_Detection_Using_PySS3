No real friends and never thought of by anyone I get so depressed seeing how much fun everyone is having on sc and it makes me feel horrible that I haven't been texted by a single person in lock down unless they wanted something. I don't know what to do, I don't think I'm ugly and I think I'm likeable but I always seem to be ignored and none of my peers seem to give a damn about me. Don't want to seem like a downer or anything but would like someone to talk to
