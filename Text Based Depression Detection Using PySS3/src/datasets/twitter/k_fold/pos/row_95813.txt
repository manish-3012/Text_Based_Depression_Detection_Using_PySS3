Y'all say tiktok is dry and lame (y'all still may think it's lame but just read) Well there is a trans girl who is in a bit of a pickle currently because she agreed to do a promo for one of her fans songs (there are screenshots and money changed hands) and she didn't do it. Well the musician came out and showed his proof and the video went viral. Now this girl is posting like she nothing is happening and people are flooding the comment section of her videos saying stuff like "we ain't forget", "you're a thief", "this you ðŸ¤¡" etc etc.


Well I was scrolling the comments as one does and someone commented, "we all know what you did in November". Implying... well... Read between the lines, I don't want to say it.
