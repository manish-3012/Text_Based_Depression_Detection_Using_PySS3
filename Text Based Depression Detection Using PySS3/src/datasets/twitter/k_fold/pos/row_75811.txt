Oh God, my English Teacher is evolving. We were in School today. In English, weâ€™re doing the poetry unit and analysing the meaning behind each line.

Thatâ€™s when it happened.

When he read one line to the class, he said verbatim, â€œWhen you write your analysis later on you should avoid this line, I donâ€™t think it has any meaning.â€

I was blown away, I though English teachers had a meaning for everything even for the most benign sentences.

How is this possible?
How has he mustered the raw power to defy the  laws of the universe?
