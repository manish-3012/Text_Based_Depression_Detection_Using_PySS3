So I have a student generated assignment and have no idea what to do for it. Basically for humanities Iâ€™m doing an assignment for the Cold War, and we get to choose what to do for the assignment. For example, last time I did an SGA, I did a Minecraft video. Any ideas on what I should do? Iâ€™m kinda stuck on it because my parents wonâ€™t let me do the Minecraft thing again
