Valentine's Day was good Me and my gf are in a long distance relationship 315 miles to be exact so I was nervous about valentine's Day.

Turns out it went brilliant she stayed up really late at night for me on the morning of valentine's Day which was really sweet and then she woke up early for me which was adorable.

We talked for a bit then I gave her my valentine's gift which was a video of me going to all the places I would love to take her for valentine's Day and what we would do their.

She loved it and said it was perfect which I just got so happy about then we watched a movie together while texting a while after which was amazing.

She had one of her episodes and went silent for the rest of the night and started saying she ruined my valentine's though I got sad she thought that.

It was absolutely amazing though I couldn't ask for a better valentine's Day it was just amazing!

I hope everyone else had a great valentine's Day
