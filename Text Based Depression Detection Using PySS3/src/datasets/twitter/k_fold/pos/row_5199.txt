I survived my first day of school! I know it's Saturday...(possibly Friday or Sunday for others) but I am in hybrid and went to school for Thursday and Friday. It's was surprisingly fun for both days. They gave food at the end of the day in a blue bag which did have CHOCCY MILK in it. Thursday was the best because I came home with choccy milk and chicken nugs so that was great. Soooooo....how are y'all
