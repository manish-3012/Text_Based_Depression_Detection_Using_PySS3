Messed up w/ a girl So this is more of a question and not for advice but I messed up. In short, thereâ€™s a girl that I like and she likes me back and we text back and forth all the time. She texts me and I donâ€™t answer on purpose to look cool I guess?? Eventually I text her back and so on. I never text her first she always sends the first text. Soooo, she sends me a text and per usual I donâ€™t respond. This time I forgot to respond at all. So Iâ€™m like well sheâ€™ll text me eventually right? Nope. Itâ€™s been three weeks.

I have OCD like a mf and thereâ€™s a notification on the messages icon that reminds me I have an unread message. This is on iOS btw and I have read receipts disabled. Like I said itâ€™s been three weeks and I donâ€™t want to open her message and she sees that I just now decided to open her text after three weeks. That would be pretty weird. Iâ€™m stressed out because I think about that one notification every hour of every day since Iâ€™ve received it and I left it unopen for this long like a true idiot. On one hand I want to open it to get rid of it but I want to be absolutely sure she doesnâ€™t see that I read her message after so long.

My question is: does having read receipts disabled actually work on iOS? Like if she has hers enabled, will she see that I read her message or will it only show delivered for her?
