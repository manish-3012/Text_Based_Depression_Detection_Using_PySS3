Is it my turn :) Okay so this is how the story goes. 

Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for at least 5 months now and sheâ€™s literally so cool we have so much in common and we share many interests. 

But today she gave me my annual compliment as a male and it made me feel so special bc as a guy I never get compliments but she gave me one and she said youâ€™re welcome. 

So I went to answer her back but bc Iâ€™m not on good WiFi at the moment it didnâ€™t go through and she sent me a sad face snapchat and I was really confused until I realized what had happened. 

Upon realizing my reply never went through I immediately started replying with Iâ€™m sorry my WiFi at this house is no good so on and so forth. 

She had reassured me everything was fine and that thereâ€™s nothing to worry about. But then I explained to her that itâ€™s annoying for me because I really like her. (She didnâ€™t know this at all at the time.) but she said she liked me back! I was so excited. But then I asked it if was for Tik tok and she said no so maybe dis is legit :)
