My parents have been a little... off, lately. I just bought a 2006 MacBook for $15 at a thrift store. Amazing price for a computer like it (they said it didn't charge and that's why they lowballed it. the battery was expanded and completely shot). I said I'd pay for it myself, but my mom paid for it. I had money. Then I needed to buy a battery for it. Ironically the battery is more expensive than the computer at a whopping $22. They paid for it. 

like wtf I literally have 2 fifty dollar bills and a 20 dollar bill.
