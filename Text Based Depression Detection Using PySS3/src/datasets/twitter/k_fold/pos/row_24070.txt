Fortnite single handedly ruined the gaming industry and heres why: Now before you fortnite players get mad, I play it too with my friends, ok so basically fortnite isnt bad, but it was too successful so instead of interesting singleplayer games every company wants to copy fortnites success. This means there arent any new good games on the market but battle royales. Fuckin ell good job fortnite you were ***too*** successful and fucked the gaming industry for atleast 4 years
