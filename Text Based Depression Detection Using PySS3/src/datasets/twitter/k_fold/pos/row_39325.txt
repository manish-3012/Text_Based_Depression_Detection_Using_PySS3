I have a wild one for you so, one day I wanted to buy another ps4 controller to play with my brother. I looked it up on the internet and I found one quite cheap but what really grabbed my attention is that the seller mentioned a 2 weeks warranty. It was a bit far but when I got there the seller was a teenager selling it from his house. he told me it just needed a charge. Then when I got home, surprise surprise, its a scam and the controllet is not working. I called him, he said it was working before I took it. I was feeling sad, mad and stupid. After about two weeks I couldn't handle the regret and asked my friends and went on to sell it. there are small indie markets that would repair and sell games and controllers. me and my friends went to almost every single store they all refused or they would take it for the cheapest price possible. But thank god, one man accepted to take it as scrap parts and exchange it with me for one game. I picked uncharted 4 and I'm having a blast with it.

thank you very much for reading all of that. I really appreciate it.

and the moral of this story is: never give up, and do not accept the loss. Search for other ways out of any trouble.
