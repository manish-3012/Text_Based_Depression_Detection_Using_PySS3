What value girls n guys bring to the table pt 2 - girls During the upperclassmen years, after high school, in college, and then the real world this is how dating is 

This is basically what girls want from guys and what guys want from girls. You should train yourself now to be a good mate for ur future partner 

WET ASS PUSSY:
Yes we want some guts. Not just that tho. Know that men are designed to spread the seed with as many women as possible. We Naturally hoes. So when u want a man to be faithful to u ur basically saying â€œreverse ur own nature. 
So when men do this understand u have to keep up with that sex drive the man has. 

Submission / agreeability:
Nobody wants a women who has a problem with everything.
Obviously donâ€™t just blindly follow a mans lead, but submit to him. Allow him to lead the relationship. Obviously donâ€™t do anything you donâ€™t want to. But most men want to lead, and most women want to be lead, thatâ€™s just human nature.

Support:
Be a supporter of his dreams. If ur not a fan of what he does donâ€™t be w him. 

Home skills:
Yes we want yâ€™all to know how to cook and clean. Most of yâ€™all say you donâ€™t wanna work after having kids, this means you want the man to provide. If heâ€™s providing he canâ€™t take care of the home as he is not fuckin Superman. And the home skills is not even just for us men, it shows you can nurture a family in the future.

Attractiveness-
Sorry but as a woman your looks matter a lot more than a guys does. This is how it is. 

Character:
Nobody wants a bland bitch. Live life have fun be funny. Unlike boring guys, a boring girl could get a bunch of guys. But Iâ€™m telling you nobody is gonna stay with that in the long run
