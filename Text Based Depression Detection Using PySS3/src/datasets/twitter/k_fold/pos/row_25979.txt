Iâ€™m so fucking sick of this shit I just want to be normal. No meltdowns, no issues with my digestive system (acid reflux, etc.), no sinus issues, no mucus and shit in my throat. I guess the autism is okay but the meltdowns are shit. I want to do bloody music as a career but the reflux, along with the mucus and saliva make it difficult to do it well. I can kinda rap but Iâ€™d have to pause for the reflux. Itâ€™s fucking constant. I donâ€™t like being an asshole to people, I just want to control it. Fuck anger issues. I have so much fucking school work to do because I didnâ€™t go to school because of the fucking pandemic, so Iâ€™ve been working my ass off to do that. And back to reflux, Iâ€™m not sure if my medication helps. Iâ€™ve tried a decent amount of medication, but it still comes up. I want to lay in bed and not sit up because o it. Iâ€™m fucking sick of it. I want all my physical issues to go away at some point. I wish I didnâ€™t want to do it as a career, I wish I didnâ€™t wanna do shows too. Before anyone starts to worry that I might be suicidal, Iâ€™m not... just doubtful. Iâ€™ll try to keep up hope for the future but I just want the fucking doctors to find a solution so I wonâ€™t have to deal with any of this shit. Iâ€™d say their judgement is a lot better than mine (obviously), but still. Why isnâ€™t life fair? Why was I dealt the wrong fucking cards? I just wish I was normal. I donâ€™t wanna die like this :(
