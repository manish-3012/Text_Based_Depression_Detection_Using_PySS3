School is fr stupid after like 6th grade.. â€¢Math: Have never and will never use y=Mx+b. And people are gonna say â€œWell itâ€™s useful for people who want to work with physics.â€. Alright weâ€™ll then just teach that shit in college.

â€¢History: Deadass nobody cares. Whatâ€™s done is done. Like some stuff can be interesting but I donâ€™t think anybody really cares about shit that happened hundreds of years ago. 

â€¢Science: Interesting at first until you just start learning the same shit over and over. Also how come we go from doing cool shit like dissecting frogs to just doing experiments with bubbles lmao.

â€¢Language arts/reading: Again I feel like itâ€™s important for a while and then all you do is just write essays and shit. And essays wouldnâ€™t be to bad if there werenâ€™t so many limitations on how they could be done.

I feel like imma get a lot of hate for this but then again itâ€™s just how I feel. Also maybe itâ€™s just my school in general that makes shit so boring but I still feel the same way about it. 














I wanna die.
