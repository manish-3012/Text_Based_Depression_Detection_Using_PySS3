No, your zodiac sign doesn't say anything about you. Downvote me to oblivion if you want but no, your day and month of birth do not define your actions nor your character. I'm so sick of people literally trying to excuse their behavior by saying they're A or B. Or even comparing one to another. Feeling superior because of the day they were born. Don't even get me started on "compatibility". It's just plain nonsense. It's just a reason for trying to feel special. It's not.
