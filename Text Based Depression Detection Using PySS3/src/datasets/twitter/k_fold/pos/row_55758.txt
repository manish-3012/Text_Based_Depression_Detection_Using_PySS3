I came out to my parents as Heterosexual I (M17) and my close friend also M17 had a sleep over and got kinda drunk in my parents house. Everythingâ€™s totally fine and cool, we sleep in the same bed cause the spare bed is trash and also weâ€™re pretty pissed. 

Next morning when he leaves my parents come into my room to say â€œwe love you and support your sexuality no matter what it is and if youâ€™re gay thats okâ€. I have absolutely nothing against Gay or Bi relationships but it is to an extent mortifying to have your parents assume youâ€™re in a gay relationship with your best friend. 

They then said they assumed that I was like that because I hang out with my friend so much and we slept in the same bed. 

I had to then convince them that I was into girls and not into my friend who it is now kinda awkward to talk with now. 

IG its just a sign of the times that I had to expressly come out to my parents that I was Heterosexual. 

I have absolutely no idea how to go about making my parents believe Iâ€™m not gay ( i have nothing against that just being pinned down as smth Iâ€™m not is just kinda weird for me).
