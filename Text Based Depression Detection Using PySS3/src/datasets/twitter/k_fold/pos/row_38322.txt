crying because i failed a test &amp; i hate online school :) I have ADHD and adapting to online school is very hard for me, also because i hate doing everything online. 


We were timed for this quiz that i barley knew how to do because the teacher does youtube videos on how to do the math. The problem is that he does it on a white board &amp; films it with old ass dell laptop so i donâ€™t watch it.Even in zoom calls the quality is so trash.

I got a 60 on the test when i spent 47 mins on it ( we only get 48) &amp; iâ€™m just so overwhelmed and tired of online school.Im just at my breaking point &amp; i canâ€™t do it anymore. Hopefully my parents let me do in person next grading period.
