What can teachers do to make learning better for students during COVID? So I am currently finishing up my senior year at a 4 year university and doing my internship at a local high school. I am an Agriscience Education major and it has been extremely hard not being able to get out in the shop at all this semester. Hands on is an essential part of our curriculum. So Iâ€™ve had to do powerpoints, videos, virtual tours, etc in order to teach in student classes and online classes simultaneously. Itâ€™s been awful. Iâ€™ve asked my students multiple times on what I could do to improve and even when I do what they suggest it doesnâ€™t seem to help. Any ideas or thoughts youâ€™ve got throw it at me
