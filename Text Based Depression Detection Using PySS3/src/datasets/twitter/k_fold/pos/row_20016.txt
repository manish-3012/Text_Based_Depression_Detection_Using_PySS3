I think I might be trans (MtF) I guess recently Iâ€™d been looking at some LGBTQIA+ meme subreddits (Iâ€™m bisexual) and saw a lot of trans-related memes. Some of the memes I related to a lot, mainly about gender dysphoria, so I was thinking *hey, I might be trans.* But at the same time, some parts of me always feel cis. I donâ€™t feel comfortable with who I am, and am wondering if anyone has any advice related to the whole thing.
