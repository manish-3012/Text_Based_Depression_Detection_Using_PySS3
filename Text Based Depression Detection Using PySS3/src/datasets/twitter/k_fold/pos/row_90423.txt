whats the best way to find a gay relationship I feel like its very hard for a teen (17 y/o)M to find a homosexual relationship given that hetero is the default orientation, and I just turned 17 a little over a month ago and I really want to get into a relationship but I don't want to go on a dating site and lie about my age, how should I start looking for a relationship when it seems so hard to find someone like me?
