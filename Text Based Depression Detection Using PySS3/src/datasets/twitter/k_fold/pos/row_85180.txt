I'm so lonely for of this I feel sad I'm a very reserved person and unsiciable, Im an introvert in the greatest gorgeous colors. My communication with my parents is very rare and can be wary. In the spring I've moved to another city(PA) I decided to try to change my life at least a little and open up to people, I believed that this would help me change because I began to notice that I just began to miss communication, I can't speak to anyone or discuss anything  
In the past city, I had several friends with whom I could communicate a little, but now there's no such opportunity and I've stopped communicating with most of my last classmates  
My expectations were disappointing..At new school I was unable to establish contact with almost anybody...I only talk with 2 or 3 classmates, but this communication is very fickle, after school we don't communicate ughh  
Soon my school was transferred to online study, it hit me even harder, I began to think about stopping it all...I keep a lot to myself, I felt very bad because of loneliness  
When online study was canceled, a new girl came to our class, she's Asian, I became interested in this cuz I like Asian countries and I'd like to live there I nevertheless decided to ask where she was from, she replied that she was local and her parents were visitors from Asia. I decided to continue communicating through socnet since I' wouldn't be able to communicate with her live (Im very embarrassed and nervous)  
to be honest we have a very strange communication, we communicate on socnet, but at school and after it we donâ€™t, we donâ€™t even say hi, she also constantly ignores me on social networks, saying that she doesnâ€™t have time to answer, but this isn't at all true I can understand her because it looks very strange  
Once, when we met at school in the morning, she hugged me, I was crazy about it, I really was very happy, and later we started to do it further, but our communication remained just as strange:/  
She ignores me at school but writes in great detail un socnet  
She is the only one to whom I can more or less tell about myself  
imo this communication may not last long, sooner or later she will get tired of it, and she'll stop doing it... Honestly, loneliness began to kill me and I think more and more about the bad, I stopped thinking about the future, my thoughts can be constantly about death... I almost cried in class, but I was able to bring myself to my senses  
I don't know what to do...
