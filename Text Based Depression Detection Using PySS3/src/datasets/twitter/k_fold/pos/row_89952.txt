I need some advice rn. I have this girl in my discord right. I have known her and her best friend for about like 5 months now. I started talking to her and her friends and we all easily started having fun in games like Minecraft. We chat on discord almost every night, but tonight was special. We finally exchanged Instagrams ( 2 out of the 3 of them did, and the one who does not have an insta is the brother of one of them.) After looking at their accounts, I realized that one of them is VERY VERY pretty. She is very kind, but wonâ€™t hesitate in beating someone to a pulp if they get on her bad side. Now, she is also funny, but she lives on the other side of the US. Idk if I like her in that kinda way that I would date her yet, as I JUST got the insta after 5 months of taking with them. I just got all of them to talk on discord with mics on as they were normally very shy. Should I give myself some time to think about if I like her?
