I can't figure out why i exist rn Like yesterday was my birthday and for a second it felt like something clicked and i actually had a reason to live and then click, its gone and i dont even know what it was

Like i want to do art and music and other people want me to too but its fucking pointless. Like if i want dopamine why dont i just binge eat or some shit?

Even if it did matter its not like anyone gives a fuck, nobody would see my art next to anyone elses and pick mine.

Nobody is ever gonna buy commissions from me or read my comics even if i finalky make them so what's the fucking point...

My music is shit and i cant even record cause my house is constantly filled with noise.

Sports are just... Sports, no reason to put effort in its just an excuse to make people exercise. Shit shit shit shit shit

School... Dont even start its pretty much all bullshit.

Why do i want a job? I can just go stsrve on the streets cause like why should i not starve? Why am i supposwd to not want to starve?

Idfk what tp do woth myself rn.

Edit: i have just as little reason to die as i do to live both are fucking depressing son don't even worry.
