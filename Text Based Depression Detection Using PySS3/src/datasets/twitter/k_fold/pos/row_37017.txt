My 8 year old sister keeps twerking and doing very inappropriate dances on tikok in a swimsuit and my parents arenâ€™t doing anything (I know tiktok bad is getting old but hear me out)

I donâ€™t think she realizes how bad these things are. Sheâ€™s probably on tiktok 3 hours a day copying these influencers and their sexual dances. My parents say that itâ€™s a private account and that only her friends can see it, but I think this is just setting a really bad example for her. It just sucks because thereâ€™s nothing I can do.
