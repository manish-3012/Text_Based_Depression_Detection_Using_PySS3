How do I get a girlfriend? I am in a pickle with my life. I am 17, about to be 18, without a job, living in the middle of nowhere with my parents.
Iâ€™ve been looking for girlfriend to just hang out with so I can just be myself, and that I can have financial help with an apartment to get out of my parents house.
Help.
