Big sad moments Hey guys some person who Iâ€™m not gonna mention so you definitely know they exist is like rly sad rn. The person is my best friends neighbors dogs cousin and theyâ€™re goin through a tough time rn. My best friends neighbors dogs cousin has covid and fell into a nuclear power plant is about to die.
Please if you wann help give me online pity points and tell me how sorry you feel so I can get social validation for feeling bad for them.

Edit: man how dare you tell me to go do something about it?! Do you even no how insensitive that is? IM going through a really tough time rn, now shut up and hand over your karma!



For real though, not calling out any posts specifically. But through my whole time on here Iâ€™ve seen so many posts that are just â€œfeel bad for me postsâ€. Itâ€™s just attention seeking, and itâ€™s even worse when they use other peoples legitimate problems as karma farming
