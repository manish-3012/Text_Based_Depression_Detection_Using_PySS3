I miss this guy Like a month and a bit ago I met this guy. He was a huge drunkard and just *that type* like with his all leather outfit wannabe anarchist looking ass but he was cool and it was really fun to just listen to him drunkenly rant about stuff. I haven't seen him since then and apparently he got way too drunk the next day and collapsed or some shit and idk what happened to him
