The us is a pretty great place to live My country is first world country the government isn't oppressing anyone women aren't oppressed here whether we're the best country is questionable but don't say our country isn't pretty good to live in I'm a united stated and I'm happy I didn't live in a place that's third world and no I'm not saying it's the best place to live but it's not as bad as people say it is because we really do have at least enough freedoms and we added things so what happens to places like Russia couldn't happen to us that's why our country is honestly laughed at a lot but saying it's a bad place to live is really innacurate.
