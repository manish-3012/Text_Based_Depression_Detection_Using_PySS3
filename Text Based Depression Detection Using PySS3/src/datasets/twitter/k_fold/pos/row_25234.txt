Classmate who is a Redditor of 5ish years got pissy at me since I have more karma than him. He looked throughout my profile and he saw how I had a younger Reddit account than his and I had 10x more karma. 

He got so mad he screamed at me at the top of his lungs about how I â€œcheated the karmaâ€ and he was sent to the office because this apparently wasnâ€™t the *first time*.
