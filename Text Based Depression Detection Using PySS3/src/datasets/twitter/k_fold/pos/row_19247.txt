So, I happen to be pansexual and the girl I think I might like is straight and the other girl I might like see's me as a friend. So the one girl I think I like is bi but since we are childhood friends she see's me like a sister.

The other girl just said today in google meets that she has a boyfriend so she is most likely straight. 

then everyone else started talking about their girlfriends or boyfriends and I just sat their left out. 

It not a huge deal tho cuz I do not have a huge crush. still low key burns tho
