So, we got "Dont post such and such" wars going on. What's the point of complaining? It's just the r/teenagers cycle. We always go through similar trends, someone always gets annoyed, and then it changes. 




Supposedly, nobody cares, yet, the posts get upv0tes (this rule sucks) and aw4rds (this rule sucks). Once people actually don't care, people will move on to whatever is popular next. 



The people in this sub complain about problems that they cause. Seriously, you can't make a pist calling other people k4rma (does the bot allow me to say this word? Not taking any risks) farmers and then think that you're the good guy. There is no justified complaint here, everyone, and I mean everyone (except lurkers who don't comment) is a part of this problem. 


We *can't* change the cycle, all we can do is accept it.




I mean, this post isn't gonna get anything done either. Doesn't matter how many aw4rds (this rule sucks) and upv0tes (this rule sucks)  I get.





tldr: Here in Soviet Russia WE are the problem, and we cannot solve ourselves.
