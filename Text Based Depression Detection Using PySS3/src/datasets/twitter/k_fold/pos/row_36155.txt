Is what Iâ€™m doing safe? Weight loss/kinda of a problemâ€¦ question Is it safe that Iâ€™m skipping breakfest and eating lunch maybe around 1000-1500 calories maybe sometimes rarely 2000 calories and thatâ€™s all? Sex: male age: 15 weight : 95 to 85kgs (maybe a bit less than 85kgs) height : 5.7ft  I dropped around 10kgs maybe more in a short Period of time Iâ€™m not seeing my body change that much maybe a slight slight change tho only the scale is changing. Is that safe? I am kinda concerned and Iâ€™m not reallyâ€¦. What do you guys think?
