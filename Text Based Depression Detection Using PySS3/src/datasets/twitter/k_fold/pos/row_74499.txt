Someone I used to play baseball with committed suicide He was pronounced dead an hour ago from him being in critical condition for 9 hours, this should be taken seriously as mental health is serious. Go on the suicide hotline, get help there, you put pain on others when you take your life, no father or mother should have to bury their son.
