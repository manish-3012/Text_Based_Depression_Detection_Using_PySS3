I canâ€™t stand very well I fucking need help Iâ€™m on holiday with my dad in London and weâ€™re meant to be walking around but Iâ€™m having some prolonged anxiety attack where when I stand itâ€™s so fucking  hard 

My legs are jelly, my stomach is all sicky and I feel disconnected and alone 

But I donâ€™t wanna tell him cause I dont wanna spoil his holiday
