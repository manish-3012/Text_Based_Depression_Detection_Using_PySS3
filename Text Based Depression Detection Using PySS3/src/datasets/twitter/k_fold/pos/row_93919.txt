Just spent the last hour crying fml and wanted to remind the boys that it's okay to cry bros and no one of any worth is judging you Today I've had to pack up my entire life into boxes and throw the majority of it away because I'm like semi homeless now. It was fucking heartbreaking to do and I've been crying for most of it remembering every little memory of each item or book and the happy times I had back then. Moral of the story is, lads, it's totally okay to cry and anyone that says otherwise is a prick
