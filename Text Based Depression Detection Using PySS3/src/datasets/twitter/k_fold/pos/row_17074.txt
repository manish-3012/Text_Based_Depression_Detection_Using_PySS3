Anyone else despise but also love HS? Iâ€™m barley passing my classes even though Iâ€™m trying super ducking hard but Iâ€™m still crawling  around with 50-60% and it stresses me out cause I want to do better but canâ€™t seem to. Weekends are too ducking short to actually allow me to step back and breathe for a moment. But I also love going cause of the people. I go everyday and just canâ€™t wait to see my friends and people I care about because itâ€™s what helps me get through the day. Anyone else, or just me?
