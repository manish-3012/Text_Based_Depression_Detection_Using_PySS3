I have a question. So, I am writing a fantasy story. It is a story based (very very slightly) off of real events, containg u/s of my friends, who have given me permission. Now, Before you judge, hear me out. See, in my opinion, when I write a story, I am the creator of the story. Just like if you all writed stories, you would all be the creators of the stories. So, I asked my friend what role I should have in the lore, and he said I should be emperor. So I just went with it. I asked everyone else what they thought, and they all seemed to be cool with it as well, because this is a fantasy world with kingdoms instead of subreddits (confusing, I know). So, again, just to clarify, I checked in with everyone. But this one person says me being the emperor is self centered. He seems to be following me around as well. So, my question. Is it self centered? There are other people with a similar role in the story, and other main characters. I feel like I kinda get why it would be called self centered, but literally everyone else I checked in with was fine with it. Sorry for bad formatting.
