idk if this is an unpopular opinion or not but downvote farmers are weird thereâ€™s the ones like wesley ford that say ridiculous shit thatâ€™s *obviously* a joke and arenâ€™t offensive or mean about it, theyâ€™re okay. but then thereâ€™s the ones that say homophobic/racist/sexist/transphobic and straight up mean shit without a hint of irony or sarcasm, and they only do that to get downvoted and make people mad? what enjoyment do people get out of that? iâ€™m not one to judge but thatâ€™s weird imo, like do you not have anything better to do lmao
