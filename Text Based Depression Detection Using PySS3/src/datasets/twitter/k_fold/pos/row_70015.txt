Ok this is kinda sus So I have been going back to school since September and the teachers have apparently been putting all the homework online and iv made it through the first part of the school year not knowing this somehow because we have never been told by anyone that the homework is online and even some of the stuff thatâ€™s been up their since September and is 20000 years past itâ€™s due date none of the teachers have pulled me over and said you havenâ€™t done your homework so after this a teacher told my parents I wasnâ€™t doing the homework I had no reason to even know existed and their mad at me for not doing any and itâ€™s apparently MY RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND THE HOMEWORK WHEN I NEVER KNEW IT EXISTED and ITS NOT THE TEACHERS JOB TO TELL THE CLASS THERE IS HOMEWORK wtf am i supposed to do now
