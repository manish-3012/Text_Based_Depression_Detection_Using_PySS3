Eye of the Storm (111) Put yourself directly in the middle of the storm. Give yourself time. Know its all for something greater. Pull yourself out by connecting with your faith.

Life is radical. There is no book. There is no rules. There is no right way of living, acting, being. There is only 1 way and thats **YOURS.** 

The emotions of heartbreak, the emotions of sadness, the emotions of pain, the emotions of the wound being opened again, when I thought the wound was already healed has been something that has been prominent at the surface for the past 3 or 4 days. I am here in the middle of the storm. **Grateful**. Even if I hurt. Even if I want things to be differently, but things were never meant to be that way, cluster fuck of emotion, am I right? LOL.

By being true to how we are feeling, by speaking, writing, painting, sharing, being present with how we are feeling, we heal. There is strength and power with feeling hurt. There is strength and power with feeling anxiety. There is strength and power with feeling depression. It takes time. I am grateful for the time its taken and it will continue to take. I don't have everything figured out, nor do I really want to. If you think about it, whats fun with having everything figured out? Where is learning with having everything figured out? Where is growth with having everything figured out? **Exactly. Its all by being present in the eye of the storm.**

**Stay in the eye of the storm until the ladder comes from above and you can climb your way out into glory. Into happiness. Into peace.** 

**I love you.**
