After being diagnosed with insomnia After being diagnosed with insomnia by my therapist a few years ago, I have felt better knowing that itâ€™s not because Iâ€™m lazy, or just â€˜staying up on my phoneâ€™ like my parents say. 

Itâ€™s annoying though to get told â€œIâ€™m sure you arenâ€™t different than every other 7 billion people on earth, get to sleep.â€ - my dad. 

Wish I could get more sleeping meds, those were nice. I also want back into therapy, but canâ€™t do much until October.
