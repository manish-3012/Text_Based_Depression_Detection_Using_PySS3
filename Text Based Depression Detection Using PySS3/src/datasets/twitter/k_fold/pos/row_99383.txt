I donâ€™t want to move today. Iâ€™m sorry for the amount of fkn posting in recent hours but i need to get shit off my chest. Last night i was crying into the early hours of the morning because of an anxiety attack that i had trouble capming down from. I woke up feeling dperessed and once again, crying. I just donâ€™t have the motivation or emotion to go to school or anything. Yeah, i want to see my friends and stuff but i just donâ€™t like myself much at the minute. I just need to cheer up and become in a better mood before school starts because knowing this, iâ€™ll have to go.
