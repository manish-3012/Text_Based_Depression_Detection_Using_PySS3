Can we stop acting like therapy is a godsend that fixes everything? Whenever somebody on Reddit has a problem, people do nothing but shout "therapy" or "counseling". Well, guess what? These things are not godsends that will fix somebody's issue, and a lot of the time they make shit worse. Don't get people on antidepressants, that's medicine fucks up the brain, and should not even be legal. Also, most people can't just afford to get counseling or therapy or whenever. You people need to stop living on the internet and get into reality. Stop treating these things like they are just the solution to everything. They arent.

Also, you idiots also love to tell people to get a divorce all the time. Stop that
