Online Songwriting Lessons Hi everyone! 

My name is Mia. I recently started teaching songwriting online, and I'm looking to connect with kids &amp; teens interested in songwriting! If you have any questions, please let me know. :) And please help me spread the word to anyone who might be interested!

* I offer private lessons, as well as group lessons. The private lessons option is super individualized. The class option involves weekly live classes, workshops, discussions, and activities; we use a combination of Google Classroom and Discord. 
* In terms of my background / relevant experience: I've been writing songs since middle school. I'm a verified artist on Spotify, Apple Music, and other platforms. I also work as a freelance singer-songwriter; I've worked with over 100 clients, and I've never gotten a review less than 5 stars. I'm also finishing up a certificate in Lyric Writing from Berklee School of Music online.
* You can DM me with any questions, or visit my website [MiaStegner.com](https://MiaStegner.com) &amp; check out the "Songwriting Lessons" page for more info. Please note that pricing is flexible depending on what your family can afford, and you can live anywhere since it's all online. :)

I'm pretty sure this post is within the rules for this subreddit; that said, I realize this isn't the usual type of content posted here, so I want to thank you all for understanding! :) I'm just getting started, and I'm looking to connect with people wherever I can.
