My parents already think of me as a slut just because I've fallen for someone for the first time Yep, u read that right. I've always had small crushes on a few guys and my parents never knew compared to my brothers who tell them every single girl they ever liked. My whole family thought i was lesbian because they never seen me or heard me saying "I like this guy in my class" and other stuff because i just wanted to die single.

But now I finally found someone who made me feel safe and comfortable even tho we're LDR. He traveled thousands of miles just to see me for 4 days before going back to his home, And for the first time i was deep in love and i was so happy. i told my parents about our little so-called relationship that lasted a year. 

And Instead of them being happy about it, they now think that i flirt and fall for every guy i meet, my mom specifically mentioned that i might even get pregnant at an early age because she thinks i would just give my virginity to every guy i would find attractive. It might not be much for u guys but for me, It hurts. Alot.
