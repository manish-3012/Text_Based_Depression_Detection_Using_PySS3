Dating advice. If you want/need advice on dating, crushes, looking good or anything, feel free to dm me, or comment.

But as a general rule of thumb, I'll give some small things.

1: Pursue within your means.

2: Most people look good with some nice clothes and a good haircut.

3: Exentuate what you have, don't cover up what you don't.

4: If you truly think you have nothing to offer in terms of looks, be an interesting person/have some interesting hobbies.

But the most important one:

5: Have a good personality.
