My post didn't age too well... In my previous post I said I feel really sad and down ext. And the only thing making me happy rn is my gf but there was a covid outbreak in my bothers school that was announced about a hr ago but my brother still has to go to school cause "It wasn't hiss class that got infected" so anyway I can't go out with her tomorrow for my birthday like I planned and probably not until schools are closed again and cases go down hopefully, and I can't ft her bc of her living situation rn.
Anyway fuck schools and the education system for this.
School is legit waiting for everyone to get infected and making everyone depresed and then blaming other things for it.
