I see a lot of people on this sub complain about math. As someone who loves math, and has taken a lot and done pretty well, I thought I might be of assistance. Iâ€™m currently a junior, and I have taken everything through geometry, trig, and algebra 2. If you need help with anything at that level, or below, you can message me on reddit or on discord, at texer#9296. Math can be explained terribly by teachers, I agree, so I think sometimes someone else explaining it can help!
