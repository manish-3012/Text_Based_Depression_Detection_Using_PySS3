I have a serious phobia of fish I seriously hate *(live)* fish. I think I genuinely need help. My parents took time off and planned a vacation to a really nice beach and once everything worked out, my scared ass gave them a very hard time because I saw some tiny fish swimming close to shore. Don't get me wrong, I like eating most seafood and I love most marine animals (Dolphins, Octopuses, Whales, heck even cute sharks) but I despise tiny fish. I could never go near a fish tank without being very uncomfortable and sometimes screaming my ass off. My parents are very considerate when it comes to this issue but it's starting to bother me personally. That's it, thanks for reading.
