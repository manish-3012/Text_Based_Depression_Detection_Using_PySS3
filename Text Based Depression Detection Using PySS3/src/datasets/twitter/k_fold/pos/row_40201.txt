Met a Karen for the first time This happened a week ago. My mom asked me to get some groceries . 
I entered the store when the Karen was already being confronted by people and also was being asked to leave .
This was the first time for me to see such a thing . I just stood there watching the scene instead of buying the groceries . The Karen was just blasting off on the employees on how they are taking her god given right to breath and all those bullshit I was standing right there witnessing this dumbness. Suddenly from the a customer started the argument with the Karen on how she doesn't believe anything she doesn't see the argument even went to her claiming that the Earth is flat . This was an ultimate karen . The argument got heated and she said anyone who believes in Corona and the earth is not flat are the messengers of Satan. Yes she  somehow included the earth being flat theory too. Her only reason for doing so was because she hasn't seen them to which I do not know how my body it just automatically came out of me "What about god then?".
There was a complete silence for a second I looked towards the guy who was arguing with karen even he was staring at me . Long story short karen was thrown out , I bought my groceries and went home said it to no one at home . This is my first time sharing it.
