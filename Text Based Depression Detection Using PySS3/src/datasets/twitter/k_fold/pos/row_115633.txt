FIshing for compliments? Nah I prefer fishing for insults You see any compliment is a good compliment for the fact that it is a compliment while getting a first-rate insult is a bizarre and notable occurrence because well most insults are downright awful. My proof of this that ever since I started growing my hair out almost 2 years ago the only insults I've heard have been "cut your hair" and more recently since i've began tying it back is "ha gay" while I never cared about these insults nor did they bother me as they became a daily occurrence in my life. Now it had gotten to the point where I figured that most people were just unoriginal idiots who think that they're great and a master of insults and that I was never gonna hear an original insult which I was correct on for the most part this was until I was forced into a video call with my great aunt in a family gathering last year. In this video call she said to me at first sight was "is the barber on strike" now this made me die laughing as it was an actually original and funny insult. Hearing this holy grail of an insult made me think to myself "maybe if I do other stuff I'll hear better insults" so I've decided to put this theory into motion by dying my hair pink and wear pink "girly" if you will clothes to see if I can get a single insult from my peers that isn't "cut your hair" or "ha gay" and I hope to report back with results once my country decides to grow a brain cell and learn to wear a mask correctly or even at all.
