I wish Karens and Dinklebergs would just be gone Not murdered or anything but like everybody goes to sleep at the same time and when we wake up, there are no Karens or Dinklebergs on the face of the Earth, as if it all was just a bad dream. Like that episode of Spongebob where Bikini Bottom is empty and itâ€™s just Spongebob.
