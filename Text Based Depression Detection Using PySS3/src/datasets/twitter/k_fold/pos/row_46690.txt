I had a crush on a girl in my school then i got over her and now it got back because my friend has a crush on her So i had a crush on this girl in my class like 3 months ago. I tolde her how i felt and she said that she liked me as a friend and that she has  a boyfriend and ye. I understood that and moved on. Now one of my friends told het he liked her and she (even tho she has a bf) said that she also likes him. This for some reason made me really really really jealous. I kinda feel bad for the bf cuz he is a nice guy and all.
I just had to tell this to someone i trust so here ya go reddit
