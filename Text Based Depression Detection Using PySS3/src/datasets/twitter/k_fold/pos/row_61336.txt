I'm sad... Me and the boys are sad too. I went to school for the first time in months to get my leaver's form
Met the boys
Hang out with the boys
Realized it may have been my last time with the boys ðŸ˜”

I've been with them since I was 9 years old, man. Now we're all going our seperate ways. I'll fucking miss them.
