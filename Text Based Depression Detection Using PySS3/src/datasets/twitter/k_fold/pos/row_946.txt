Ones Around (98) We start at 0. We all start at ground zero. We all start with one goal, one focus, one passion. Someone telling you can't do it? Keep quiet and show them you can. Release the need to live for others expectations and what they want you to do, **you know what you want to do.**

Grind, Hustle, put every living breath into what the **FUCK** you want to do, **FUCK** the noise. Remember, just because you are losing at half, doesn't mean you won't win by the end of the game. Game forever. Marathon Focused. Remember that we are all on our own highways. One lane highway. Focus on what **YOU** love to do &amp; **YOU ONLY.**

If it isn't working for you? Pivot. Try something new. Don't quit, don't give up, whats the point of that? We have 1 life, many opportunities, many chances, so what you failed? so what you tried and it didn't go the way you wanted? so what? Is that **GOING TO STOP YOU?** Better Not. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off and lets get to it. **NOW.**

I believe in you, I believe in trying, trying and then after that? You got it, Trying again. Failures are only failures if there is nothing learned from the situation. **TRY AGAIN.** It will all work out, stay focused on what **YOU** are passionate about. Put your everything into, blood, sweat, tears, pain, joy, **EVERYTHING.** 

**Get to it.** The world is counting on you.

I love you.
