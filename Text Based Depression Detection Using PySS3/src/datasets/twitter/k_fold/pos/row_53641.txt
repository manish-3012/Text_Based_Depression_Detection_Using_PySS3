My alarm didnâ€™t go off (day 14) Itâ€™s been a full 2 weeks.... cool


I dunno, nothing much happened today, I went to school, I had to read in Spanish in front of my entire school (~~1500 people) and I started to âœ¨stutterâœ¨, so thatâ€™s not cool, thatâ€™s about how my day went, itâ€™s ok I guess

My days have been getting better lately so thatâ€™s cool

Anyways, Seeya cuties later, and goodnight 

Stay alive :D
