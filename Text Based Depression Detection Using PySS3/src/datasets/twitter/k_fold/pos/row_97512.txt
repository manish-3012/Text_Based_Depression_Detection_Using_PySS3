This is not fun. One time I was having a party home alone with my friens then while we were eating one of my friend said he saw a bug Like the size of two chickpeas. me and my other friend were scared to death and climbed to my bed. My other friend got the back scratcher on my desk smashed the bug to death while me and my other friend were still up my bed. he came with the bug and it was all rolled up and it was disgusting. My friend thought it was a cockroach. I still cant forget that party...
