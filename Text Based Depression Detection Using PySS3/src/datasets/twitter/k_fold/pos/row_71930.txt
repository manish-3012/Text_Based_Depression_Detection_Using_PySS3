Day #4 Trying to get a girl (Missed dat #3) Sorta normal day went skiing for a little and then finished the day off with a 7-hour shift I might be falling for one of my Ex's that's also a co-worker and I think she is too I don't know if I should text her and tell her how I feel now... But I'm thinking let it play itself out
