Don't take your privacy for granted So my mom just forced me to put parental controls on my phone. My blood is boiling with rage. I literally have no privacy now. I cant delete my browser history much less  open a incognito tab ( if you know you know ). She does have good intentions and only wants to know my location in case of a emergency. But its going to become so much more. My dad is sus of me because i was heavily against it. Guys listen very close. NEVER EVER take your privacy for granted. Enjoy every minute of porn, enjoy every incognito tab you open, enjoy every text you send. Because one day it might all come crashing down. This is my first and probably my last post on this sub. So please, heed my advice
