Catholic and gay?? I was wondering if there was anybody else here whoâ€™s catholic and gay/trans. Iâ€™m having trouble finding a community of faithful LGBT. 
Iâ€™m firmly of the belief that God loves everyone, and that bible verses often cited as anti-homosexual are interpreted out of context of the translation and time period. I think God condones and encourages all kinds of love. Problem is every time I think Iâ€™ve found a subreddit or discord for faithful LGBT folks, it turns out to be some sorta â€œim gay but I suppress my homosexual feelings because gay is sinâ€ bs. Anyone here in the same boat as me or know a place I can go to? 

Iâ€™m going to bed but Iâ€™ll respond to any comments in the mornin, thanks for any help in advance! :)
