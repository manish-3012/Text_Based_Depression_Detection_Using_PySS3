How do I bring up my mental health with my parents? Hi- 

I've been having a really hard time with my mental health, and it's just gotten worse over the years since I started to notice problems. It's literally gotten to the point where I'm shivering and shaking and my family is laughing at me for it?

I brought the problem up with my mom before- but she kinda just told me I was fine and moved on with her life.

I'm having a really hard time and need some help. How do I ask them to help me? 

Guess I'm just scared they'd be mad at me lol
