Hereâ€™s two quotes I think everyone needs to hear right now: 
â€œPeace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.â€
~ Albert Einstein

â€œDarkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.â€ ~ Martin Luther King, Jr.
