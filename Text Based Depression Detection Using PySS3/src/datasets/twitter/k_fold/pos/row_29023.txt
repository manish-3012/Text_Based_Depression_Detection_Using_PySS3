restarting on yt is the best thing ever imo ok so i decided to restart on youtube yesterday so did and i made my new channel yesterday [(hereâ€™s the link for the simps)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyL36vTXVf7BBv63ACLZjIw) and like iâ€™m lowkey happy with how it turned out. iâ€™ve moved on from my cringy ass content that i used to make and how iâ€™m just shitposting. probably will stop shitposting once my mom gets a new laptop so iâ€™ll be able to have her old one and make actual decent content
