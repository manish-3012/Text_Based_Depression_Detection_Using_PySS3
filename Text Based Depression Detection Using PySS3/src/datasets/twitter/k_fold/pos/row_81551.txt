Where the fuck were the mods during u/a-burner- drama  

# 

y'all cant even verify a post claiming someone's suicide, that post got like 10k upv\*tes and there was no verification by the mods side at all ?? mods over at AMA verified a incest relationship and y'all cant even verify this ? not even as much as to go through [u/a-burner-](https://www.reddit.com/user/a-burner-) 's post history ?

some other guy made a post calling him out, [u/firedragon641](https://www.reddit.com/user/firedragon641), where the fuck are the mods isnt this kinda your job ?

  
as of me ? i call bullshit on that post. your life's love dies and hours later you make a reddit post about it ? oh you wanted to vent ? why did you post it in [r/teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers) ? you want a bunch of  teenagers to console you ? any articles ? again, i could be totally wrong, you still have my condolences. IF you wanna clear your name, post some proof, and no, dont make people dm you for the proof, post it directly on reddit.

and idk but lying about your age as 22 to get nudes from older women and then your gf's suicide vent story just shouldnt be posted on the same fucking account.
