I hate this feeling. usually nothing bad happens but this worry hurts so much and i can't think about anything else. in short, my mom went out with a friend to some horse farm place to put her artwork on display and she said they would probably come back some time after 18:00. Now I know it could be any time after 18 but IT'S 23:19 NOW!!!! 



I sent my mom a message like 2 hours ago asking where they are and she hasn't answered or even checked it. Now I tried to call her but it went to voicemail after 30 seconds. this sucks so much. We share google maps locations but for some reason it won't refresh and shows the place she was in 7 hours ago.



I know adults can do what they want and they'll be fine, but my mom is deaf and blind and usually very responsible with reading and replying to messages. sure, she's got a friend with her BUT SHE HAS THE SAME DISABILITY AS MY MOM THEY ARE BOTH DEAF AND BLIND AND IT'S DARK OUTSIDE!!



What do i do, i am dying of worry. I live in a very safe country but why didn't she even answer my call? why is google maps not working? I was so excited to tell her about my near perfect score on my history exam but now i'm just so afraid. I can't even distract myself because if something happened to my mom, I would hate myself forever knowing i tried to focus on a movie that time.
