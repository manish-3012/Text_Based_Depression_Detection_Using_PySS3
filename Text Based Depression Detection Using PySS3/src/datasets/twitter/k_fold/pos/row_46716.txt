The first date howling it goes well 

I finally got a girl friend well not really but a date is happening and she seems to like me back quite a lot days her friend of 13 years. I just hope I donâ€™t ruin it Iâ€™m only nervous about when it comes time to kiss tho I doubt it will happen on the first date I donâ€™t really know if I will have the courage to lean in for a kiss. I might just have to wait for her to make a move.
