Rest In Peace My ex-girlfriend's mother passed away today, due to the coronavirus. I dont know how to console her, as she lives in Canads and im in NYC, but ive tried my best so far. I didnt know her, and she didnt know i existed, but even though most of what i was told about her was bad, she really tried her hardest for u/spitxie
