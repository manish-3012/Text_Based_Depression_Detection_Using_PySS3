Advice on losing a loved one. So, some weeks ago, my grandfather died, and he lived in another country so when he was in a not so good status we couldnt visit him, and it took a big toll on me. I've tried to think of the good memories with him when I think of him, but I can only think about how I didnt give attention to me when he visited us, and thinking of how badly he would've think of me. It also happened that when my parents requested his "girlfriend"(like a date) to see on what he had, she refused and it's most likely that she's going to try and keep it for herself. I feel like I'm a mess and I honestly dont know what to do.
