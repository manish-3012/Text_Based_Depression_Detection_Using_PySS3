Does anyone else think itâ€™s weird how weâ€™re perceived differently by different people? I know this is obvious, I just wanna talk about it a little. Honestly I have a really small idea of self and sometimes what people say about me comes as a shock. Iâ€™ve been called annoying, quiet, shy, outgoing, funny, unfunny, enigmatic, cool, smart, stupid, and weird. I have no fucking clue what I am and it really makes me have some sort of a crisis hearing all these contradictory stuff about me. Is this normal?? I would think it is... of course a very talkative person might think youâ€™re quiet in comparison to themselves but a quiet person might say youâ€™re talkative since they donâ€™t talk much
