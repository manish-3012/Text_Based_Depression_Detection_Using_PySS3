I lost my 35 year old bird today and need to tell you guys something important. Today I lost my 35 year old Alexandrine parrot. He was the best bird ever, always laughing, playing and being a total king. I've even posted pictures of him on this subreddit before. We tend to take our pets for granted sometimes because we get so caught up in our stressful lives. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you guys have pets, go give them a hug right now, and tell them how much you love them and need them. Animals are awesome, they're always ready to love us and listen to us. I'll miss my boy, but he's in a happier place now. Love your pets guys, take care of them and make sure they're happy. Life is whack and they could be gone the next minute. Treat them right for they deserve it.
