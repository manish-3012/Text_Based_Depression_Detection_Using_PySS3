To all the people who relate to sucking in something you thought you where good at I've always thought I was a good singer (still do) and when I look at famous singers I feel like I could do that to...
But there's always that one moment before I let people know I can sing when I doubt myself and think I'm  not "that" good so I back off.
Am I the only one that feels like this????

TL;DR: 
Everytime I think I'm better than someone famous, I back off before I show everyone.
