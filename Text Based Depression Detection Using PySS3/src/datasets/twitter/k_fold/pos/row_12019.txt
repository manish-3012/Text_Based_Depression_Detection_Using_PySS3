The way androids react to the Xenomorph in Alien Isolation is hilarious. So the robot android guys in Alien Isolation donâ€™t get attacked by the Alien because he knows theyâ€™re not fleshy.

So the robots just look at the Alien as it looks around and say shit in their monotone voice:

â€œWhat are you?â€

â€œUnidentified species.â€

Hazard containment breach logged.â€
