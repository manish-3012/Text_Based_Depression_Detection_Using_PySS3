Can people please stop being so dumb about Americans and Imperial Measurements? Like the amount of ignorace non-Americans have about Americans using the system is just annoying. Like seriously people, Americans, firsr, DO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM. We all learn it in school and for things like science class and whatnot. And then, it is almost exclusively used in certain fields, like science, etc, where the precision is needed. So pleasr, can we stop using "It's bad for science" as an offense against it, we already know and don't care. The system is made for everyday simple use, that's why it has things like a base-12 system that can be devided much more than a base-10, and why we have odd stuff like yards. Most measurements are made to fit a specific need and do so pretty well (think Inch small, Foot medium, Yard large, and mile for massive distance). And yes, we know these measurements seem kinda dumb, but we are USED to them and just understand them well after being around them our whole lives. People outside the US find them much worse because they haven't used them their entire lives. There are way to many memes and crap floating around that are absolutely ignorant to the real realities of the US measuring systems and I really wish people would stop with it.
