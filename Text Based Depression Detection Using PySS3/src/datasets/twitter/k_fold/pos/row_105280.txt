Well now I know whoâ€™s the favorite child So as all parents say, my parents donâ€™t have a favorite. Well that was disproved as a few days ago my mother came home with a few gifts for my sister and I. She gave my sister a humidifier that was about $30.00 and gave me a $.99  package of tea bags. Also last week my father, my sister, and I went to target to get some things. My sister got a two jugs of coffee, two things of creamer, three bags of chips, and some face oils while I got some shampoo and body wash and a thing of French onion dip. My father said to me â€œHey doesnâ€™t that seem like a lot? I donâ€™t want you having the French onion dipâ€ They say they donâ€™t have favorites.
