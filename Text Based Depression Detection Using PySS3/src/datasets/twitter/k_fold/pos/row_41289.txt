Alright so I think Iâ€™m screwed. Highschool freshman here, been straight for 13 years and now Im thinking a tiny little side of me is BI, never jacked off to a guy or anything like that but some of the more feminine dudes in my school are seeming like a viable option.

Bad news is my traditional mom told me to â€œstay awayâ€ from her if Iâ€™m gay.

Her boyfriend is the cherry on top, telling me that schools telling kids itâ€™s ok to be gay is â€œhitler likeâ€...

So, Iâ€™ll wish to stay on the XX side when it stays to dating, and hope Iâ€™ll smutch that bi side of me out, wish me luck.
