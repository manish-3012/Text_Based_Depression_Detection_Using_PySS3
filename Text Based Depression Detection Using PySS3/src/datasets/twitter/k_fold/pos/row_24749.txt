I know most of you donâ€™t care but Iâ€™m happy... Minor Tw: self harm
I just had a doctors appointment that I didnâ€™t know about till yesterday and I was freaking out because I have cuts on my wrists. I wore a long sleeve shirt, got a shot in my opposite arm and they didnâ€™t see them. I thought it was all fucking over but Iâ€™m fine and holy shit thank god.
