I don't like when someone is standing too close to me, even when i know them I saw a post that got me thinking, that everytime if someone got too close to me, i felt very uncomfortable. And this is a problem even with my best friend. 

It was worse when i was younger, now it's a bit better

Also i don't really have a reason for this feeling. I don't have a single memory that could make me react to this the way i do. 

Anyone else experiencing this?
