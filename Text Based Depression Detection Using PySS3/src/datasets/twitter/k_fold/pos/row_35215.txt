All my friends are having a surprise party for another friend. I am not invited and my best friend aka the only one who seems to want to include me wasn't allowed to bring his phone. It's my best friend's girlfriend's birthday today. We get along really well usually but I always get the feeling the others have sth against me without telling me what it is.

Long story short, my best friend is FtM trans, his parents don't know and went totally insane. He is going to be 20 in a few days, but his parents have a tracking app installed on his phone and don't allow him to see his gf, so he has to leave his phone at another friend's home.

He went over to this friend and they drove over to his gf. I live on the way and wasn't even asked if I wanted to come. And I can't even text my best friend. Feeling fcking lonely rn.
