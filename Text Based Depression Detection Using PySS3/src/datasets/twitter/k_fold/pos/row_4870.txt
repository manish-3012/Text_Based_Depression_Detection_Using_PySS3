Why is love so annoying and hard to come by? What do I do in this situation This is just my situation but Iâ€™ve been talking to this guy for awhile, we are polar opposites yet we still vibe well.  

Iâ€™ve been worried he just wants to use me for like hookups and nothing genuine like I want, so I confronted him about it. He says thereâ€™s feelings there but he takes awhile to commit due to his past relationships, and I understand that...

My issue is, is it even worth to stay and wait if he doesnâ€™t seem very set on having anything genuine?? I donâ€™t want to be used for my body I think thereâ€™s more great attributes I have other than that and want an actual connection. I just donâ€™t wanna be stuck on someone thatâ€™s not even gonna like give a straight up answer?? I want something genuine.
