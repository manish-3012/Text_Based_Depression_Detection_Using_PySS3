I can't seem to be able to find a girl who I like Now I am attracted to a lot of the girls at my school, as we all are. But if I had to choose someone at my school to have a relationship with, I can't think of anyone.

All I want is for a girl to be at least 5'4" (my ex was 5'2" and it was really awkward to hug/kiss because I'm 6') and play GTA on the Xbox.

Like I wanna be able to smooch and play GTA because honestly I couldn't give a shit about sex or anything I just want someone to love and play games with.

Like sure, I've got the homies but I don't have the wife. Nobody can let me go fishing, I don't need permission. It's sad.

Shut up.

Anyways I need advice on how to go about potentially locating the mystical being that is a girl who plays GTA
