Today, 19 Years ago, the deadliest Sniper in Military History (Simo HÃ¤yhÃ¤) died... Sadly  Why do I keep forgetting this? He was one of the best Snipers ever!



Backstory of Simo HÃ¤yhÃ¤: Simo HÃ¤yhÃ¤ was a Sniper born on December 17th, 1905 in RautjÃ¤rvi, Finnland.

He started his 1 Year Military Service in 1925. During that Time Period, he became a national Guard (Suojeluskunta as it is known in Finnland), before he became a Soldier in the Winter War between Finnland and the Soviet Union (1939 untill 1940).

After his Convocation, HÃ¤yhÃ¤ was allocated an Infantry as a Sniper and served in the 6th Company of the Infantry Regiment 34. At that Time, him and his Regiment were involed in the Battle of Kollaa against Parts 9 and 14 of the Soviet Army. It is thanks to the Fact that the Finns held this Section of the front until the end of the Winter War that the Soldiers deployed there are regarded as particularly heroic.

HÃ¤yhÃ¤ has killed 505 Soviet Soldiers that were confirmed, and he has 37 unconfirmed kills. He has also shot an additional 200 Soviet Soldiers with a Suomi M-31 Machine Pistol, bringing the Total up to about 705 confirmed hits. The 505 Kills were done with a Mosin Nagant M/28, which the the finnish Version of the Mosin Nagant.

At some Point during the Winter War, HÃ¤yhÃ¤ was hit by an exploding Bullet and up until his death had the bottom left Side of his Face deformed. You can see it in a lot of Pictures of him.

He died on April 1st 2002, making him 96 Years old. That's pretty impressive for someone who got hit in the Face by a Bullet.
