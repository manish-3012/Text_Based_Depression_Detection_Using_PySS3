Roblox is a madhouse I was getting wiped in an FPS game, and then somebody out of the blue starts ranting about how George Floyd was an addict and how an overdose killed him, like he would have survived being choked for nine minutes anyways. 

And the entire time Iâ€™m trying to snipe somebody on the other side of the map. It was surreal.
