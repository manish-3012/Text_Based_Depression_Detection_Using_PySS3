God the school stress just hit me all at once I feel like shit I donâ€™t know how to survive finals and everything I feel like Iâ€™m doing bad and I keep having nightmares about failing like I canâ€™t sleep and when I do I wake up in a cold sweat 

I just feel like if I get a bad gpa now itâ€™ll follow me all throughout college and I wonâ€™t be able to join any societies or internships or whatever and uuuuugghh


I have too many assignments to do and not enough time and deadlines that are coming up too fast and I donâ€™t know any of the answers 

I want to lay down and go to sleep and not wake up for a long time I just canâ€™t deal with any of this anymore thereâ€™s nothing good left
