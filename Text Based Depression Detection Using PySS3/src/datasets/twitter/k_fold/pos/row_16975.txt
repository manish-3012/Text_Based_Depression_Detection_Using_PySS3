I feel bad when people are not with me. Title isn't clear about what I mean, because I actually have no idea how to express my problem, so im just going to describe.

I met a guy on this discord, we are basically brothers. We treat each other like it, we love each other and we even met irl when we found out we're from the same country. But here's the thing:

He got a new PC, and started to get into the PCMR comunity, spending all day playing games (and working when he has to) and talking and laughing with his friends, and doesn't give me any attention (or rather, rarely does so.)

I really feel sad because we used to be so close and now I feel like I'm less important than a random ass game. As well as his friends. I'm supposed to be his closest friend and brother, yet he spends more time with other people (that are his friends).

I really feel like I did something wrong even though he says I didn't, I really miss the times where we'd meet and talk everyday all day, instead of me messaging him "Morning!" (he doesn't live with me) and him just being already awake for 2 hours playing games with his friends and me waiting 5 hours until he takes a break just for a "Hello"

"Why don't you play games with him?"

Whenever I invite him, he just DM's me in game "sry im with friends"

I know I am also wrong. He has a life, a stressful one indeed, and games are his "escape". But before his PC, ***I*** used to be his escape, and I really mis those times... I also get extremely angry and have a mix of feelings I can't describe when he's with someone else other than me.

And that specifically is what I want to fix about myself... Anyone that had this problem can tell me how they worked it out? I don't feel like this mix of bad feelings I get is not good, at all.

PS: If you could give me tips on how to work around this relationship I'd also appreciate it!
