I just had sleep paralysis for the second time in my life and it was a lot more terrifying this time First off, I thought sleep paralysis only occurred during REM sleep but I fell asleep around 3am. Just woke up a few minutes ago from the experience.

I was in the middle of my dream and I had just killed a bunch of dudes cause I guess I was in a video game? But the dream changed afterwards to this lady telling me to get ready for my interview.

She said â€œWeâ€™re turning off the cameras so itâ€™ll only be audio. Just confess you have a problemâ€ and I said â€œwhat problem?â€ 

She leaped on to me and thatâ€™s when I woke up to her on my chest looking at me face to face and screaming â€œconfessâ€ in a raspy voice. Her tongue was hanging out and I was scared it was gonna go down my throat. 

Her face had morphed into this weird monstrous thing. She looked like that old lady from spongebob that wanted chocolate but she was bigger and fatter and slimy?

Iâ€™m too scared to go back to sleep.
