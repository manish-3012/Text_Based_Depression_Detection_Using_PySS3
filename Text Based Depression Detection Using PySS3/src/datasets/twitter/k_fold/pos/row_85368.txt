r/tiktokcringe is just tik tok for people who say they hate tik tok Stop saying â€œtik tok cringe!â€ 

The only valid reason to not use it would be the privacy policy. Which is eons better than reddit, Facebook, Twitter or pretty much most other social media. 

Please grow the fuck up and stop lying to yourself. You look like an egotistical asshat who canâ€™t bare not using reddit or Twitter because you said that tik tok is bad.
