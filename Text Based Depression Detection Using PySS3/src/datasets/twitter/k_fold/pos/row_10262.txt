Working up the courage to ask out a former classmate of mine Been crushing on her for a while now. We both graduated high school this year and since I'm moving to a different city in a couple of days I wanna shoot my shot before I leave, or else I know I'll regret it later. Still difficult to overcome the anxiety of texting her and thinking of what I could possibly write to not scare her off. Last gf I had broke up harshly with me back when the March lockdown hit and sent me into a deep dark hole

Yeah if someone had some words of encouragement or advice that'd be great
