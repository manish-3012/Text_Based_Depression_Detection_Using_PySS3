To those who have lost people in their lives. My condolences to those who have lost family, friends, pets, anyone. 

Iâ€™m so sorry, I know internet points and awards wonâ€™t do anything to help with your grief. 

I wish I could give hugs to those who need one right now. 

I wish I could help, but I donâ€™t know how to. 

Iâ€™ve seen so many posts in the last few days about death, and it breaks my heart. Please know that we are here to support you. 

Losing a loved one is tough and it isnâ€™t easy whatsoever. 

If you guys need people, I would recommend a therapist but sometimes people just need a friend to turn to. 

Have a nice day.
