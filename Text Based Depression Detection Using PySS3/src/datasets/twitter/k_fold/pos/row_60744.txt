Idk why i keep posting about the same thing over and over expecting something to change If youve missed other posts ive lost the person I thought was my best friend, not lost in the traditional way but idek who she is anymore, she barely wants to talk ever even in the new and "improved" "light chill friendship" mode, somehow im the one thats on a different level for being worried like no im just trying to be there for you because youre the one that came to me and asked for help in the first place, she said she doesn't think our friendship is gonna last that long but then she just like forces me away like shes trying to rush along the ending, she lied to me about me being helpful and a good friend and not being annoying and all that and instead just was mean and pushed me away with no context and that went on two weeks before last night when she finally told me she just doesnt want me to be a close friend while i was already having a mental breakdown, she may see this but oh well heres the truest purest form of how i feel on the situation and how i took it, dont say sorry its my fault for getting so close to a person online anyways i shouldve figured from the beginning you wouldnt have wanted that and just not.


Woops a pretty long rant input is accepted if you feel like it
