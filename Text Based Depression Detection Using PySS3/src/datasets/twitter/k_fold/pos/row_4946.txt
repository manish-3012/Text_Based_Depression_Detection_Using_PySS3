Iâ€™m at a crossroads and I need some help So I wanna buy a gaming PC and it will be about $2.370 AUD. I noticed a 1440p monitor for $379 AUD. If I by both Iâ€™ll have about 1.5k left over and I should be getting like 6k for a car sometime soon.

But itâ€™s a big investment and idk what to dooo. I really want a PC but itâ€™s a lot of money. (I worked for it btw)
