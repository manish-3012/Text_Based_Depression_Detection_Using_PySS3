So truth or dare got me a gf! The title is somehow correct. Well I had a girl bestfriend and like how those go I caught feelings. We both did and yet we never told each other because we were both scared. I had other friends in this friend group, and we all played truth or dare and somehow we both got the same question "Do you have feelings for someone in the game" We both avoiding the question and we came back to it later. We both learned our true feelings for each other, and we were shy and awkward around each other. We don't share feelings around or we don't talk about it, so we had no idea what to do.

so you can see this going smoothly lol
