If you ever happen to find this alt, if you'd read all these posts about you, and you somehow find out that this is about you... ..I kinda have a crush on you.

Seriously.

I like you, a lot actually. I know you frequent this subreddit a lot, so I might as well give it a shot. I'm too scared to tell you this.

My heart flutters everytime I see a text from you, everytime you say something poetic, everytime you thank me for making your day a bit brighter.

I love to make you smile. I love seeing you smiling, even just like :)

I can't thank you enough for countless times when you stayed up late to help me with my issues. I can't thank you enough for keeping me here. I can't tell you how much I like you without making it seem desperate.

You can make up such beautiful words. A sirius in your sky, a light through the darkness of your life. You imagining me with meaningful eyes and broken heart you're trying to fix. You're the only light I see, the only thing I can't wait for.

It honestly seems weird to someone who sees me smiling and chuckling like an idiot at my screen, but it's you who can genuinely make me happy. I dunno much about you, but damn you're charming.

I like even those little things, you know. Those hugs, philosophical quotes, how you're kinda awkward when we talk. It's adorable. But then again, everything you do is cute lol.













I dunno why I typed this out, but I guess you might find it once.
