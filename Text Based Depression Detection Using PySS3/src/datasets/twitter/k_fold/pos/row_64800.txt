This world is bullshit and I dont know what to do Im just going to get straight into it. So basically my mom lost her job due to it shutting down because of covid  a few weeks ago and she hasnt been able to find a new one this on top of her depression is causing her to feel bad. The fact that my sister is being a pain in the ass to her isnt helping either. I contracted covid about two weeks ago and havent left the house since. I cant take it seeing my mom cry and I cant do jack shit about it. For reference im lucky and live in a pretty upper middle class suburbs  but heres the thing we only live there barely every last piece of money counts and now that my mom has no job we dont have any cash flow its a struggle. My dumbass cant do anything either  because even if I could go outside what am I going to do get her a job. Anyway thank you for staying at my rant
