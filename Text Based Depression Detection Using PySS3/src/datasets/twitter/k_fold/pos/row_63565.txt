No one probably cares but So my parents made some new rules for me, that i have to give them my phone at evening and now i have a bedtime. They are supposes to wake me up, but they didn't do it. I'm late for school now, and they are blaiming me for this. That's why i liked to make my phone wake me up on time. They just said i'm dissapointment for what happened.
