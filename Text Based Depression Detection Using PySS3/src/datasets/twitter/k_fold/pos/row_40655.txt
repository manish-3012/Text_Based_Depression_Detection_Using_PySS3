I didnâ€™t want her to leave me Have a sick feeling in my chest again. Iâ€™m sorry for these posts today and in January.

Everything is all my fault. Loved her then it stopped because of me. Iâ€™m not a good person. I fucking hate myself so much. Thinking I feel dead, at least thatâ€™s what it feels like right now still. if she just knew how much it would affect me

Iâ€™m able to talk if anyone wants to direct message me.
