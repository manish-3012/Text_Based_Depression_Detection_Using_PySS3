I think my friend is g e n d e r f l u i d Because sometimes they say they're a girl and refer to themselves with she/her pronouns and is ok with her deadname

And then other times they say they're a guy, refers to themselves with he/him pronouns and will correct the shit outta you if you use their deadname or she/her

Then sometimes they say they're non-binary, don't really care about pronouns and don't really care if you use their deadname

Sometimes they'll wear a binder, sometimes they'll wear a bra

But they ALWAYS complain about gender dysphoria no matter what

Definitely genderfluid
