I finished an assignment at 10:00 at night I made a vow to myself when I started high school. To never stay up overly late to finish schoolwork. And now, my English teacher planned the assignment terribly turning 2 weeks into a single weekend (which I had to film on with a friend for the assignment btw).

Itâ€™s school policy to give students 2 weeks notice on assignments and she did, but only actually gave us what we needed for the weekend before (keep in mind we have 5 other assignments due afterwards) 

So yeah, Iâ€™m peeved, not gonna get enough sleep, didnâ€™t get any exercise done this weekend (even though I promised myself I would this weekend and the one before (but assignments were like no u))

Just needed a place to vent without my friends thinking Iâ€™m all anger. Have a good day reddit
