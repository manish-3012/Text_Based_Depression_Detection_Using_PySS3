i think i have anxiety and idk what to do I wouldn't consider myself a depressed person at all im easy to get along with but gets mad real quick and my emotions are easily shaken like anger etc, the last two months i've been having anxiety where i'd get real sweaty and my heart would beat fast and sometimes just skip beats while breathing heavily and grasping for air sometimes, my mental health has not been a concern for my parents growing up so they'd think im just tired while this keeps happening constantly and i don't fucking know what to do,who tf do i talk to? how do i get rid of it? this really sucks
