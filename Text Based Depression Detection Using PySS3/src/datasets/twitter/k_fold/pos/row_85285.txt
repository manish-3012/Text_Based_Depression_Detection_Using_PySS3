So I just got 19/25 over a very easy quiz pretty sure my other classmates will perfect it I didnâ€™t check my answers.Iâ€™m very devastated.I donâ€™t feel like doing anything.I convinced myself that Itâ€™s just 6 wrongs but my brain is saying that It will be hard to make up for that.Iâ€™m being very sensitive lol.
