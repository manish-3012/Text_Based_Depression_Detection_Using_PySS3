I dont have anyone to share this with so now you get to hear it. I love my parents, but like all people they make mistakes!

Namely taking a newly fourth grade child to twin peaks. (If you dont know what that is, it's Hooters but with literal bikinis and underwear with fishnets) I'm not sure if a straight person would be that embarrassed, I looked at the table the entire time and I ended up with a stiff neck. They had good burgers, neither of my parents knew what it was either.
