Sometimes I wish I could use a time machine to show off my current life to some of my medieval european ancestors could you imagine Bjorn the Navigator walking through my kitchen like "You can afford bread *and* fresh fruits and vegetables *and* beef? In the middle of winter? That's amazing!"

And I'm like "yeah" and then Bjorn probably robs me blind because I forgot that Bjorn is a viking and vikings steal stuff
