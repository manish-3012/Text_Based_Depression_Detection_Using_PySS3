should i skip school tomorrow? So - once again - I'm pretty fucked. Tomorrow I have a test and two assignments (ofc haven't done anything) and now It's 1am and I'm pretty damn stressed.

Should I skip tomorrow in exchange for an absence or should I just close my eyes and go for it?

Any advice appreciated!
