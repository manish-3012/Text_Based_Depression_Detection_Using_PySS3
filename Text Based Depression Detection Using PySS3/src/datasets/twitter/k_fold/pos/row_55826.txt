For all my fellow seniors stressing over college applications I literally got accepted into a school's honors program for writing about how I named my buttcheeks. Y'all will be fine.

EDIT: realizing my post history has [this](https://imgur.com/a/KLgsn4Q) so thought I'd clarify, there were about 4 essays on various things you had to do, one of them was about the buttcheeks, one was about that.
