Stop saying NNN was cancelled ^(I think it's very cringy and annoying too tbh)

If you're gonna hype up NNN like it's the third coming of fucking Jesus, at least don't cancel it a day in because of "COVID". Don't use lockdown as an excuse for touching yourself a couple of days into November. Admit that you can't control how horny you are and say you failed. Don't be a pussy.
