I'm going to be 18 tomorrow, but in quarantine... I always planned my (18M) eighteenth birthday.The fact is that I live in Italy and at the moment we are quarantined so i can party wirh my mom and grandma only (family) and there is some tension between them which doesn't help a lot. Not to add that I recevied my gifts today and I didn't even feel that nice surprise suspense. Other than that for me it's the first year when it's rainy on my birthday and honestly it's pretty demoralizing. 

The 18 years old mark was always very important for me but as you can see it isn't what I was hoping it would be at all...

I actually posted this to get some of the weight off my chest.

Thank you for reading!
