First day on zoom Me - me
B - kid
Teacher - teacher

So, our first day of zoom and it is me, B, and teacher. No one else cared to either show up, or speak up through the meeting. I ended up getting to know B very well. But, I sometimes tell people I meet online I can barley hear them and to speak up, and I usually get them to yell or shout through every conversation. I did this to B, and soon enough B is screaming at the teacher. The teacher gave us a little cool down question, and she told us NOT to send the answer in the public chat or say it out loud. B, completely mis hearing her i guess, SCREAMED the answer at the top of his lungs. I had to turn off my video and mic because I was laughing so hard. 

Have a good night.
