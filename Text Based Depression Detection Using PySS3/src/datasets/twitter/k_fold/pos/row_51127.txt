Last school year First some background me=me Alice= jerk 

So Alice is this very cute Asian girl bin some of my classes at school and is very nice, so obviously I have a huge crush on her. After 2 weeks of working up the balls to ask her out. I get rejected no biggie. But then she tells all the girls at the school that I harassed her and that they should all ignore me and then she became a huge jerk to only me. luckily her story permeated only the kids that give a shit about popularity. and i hang out  with the crowd who doesn't stick to the status quo and doesn't even seem to know it exists.
