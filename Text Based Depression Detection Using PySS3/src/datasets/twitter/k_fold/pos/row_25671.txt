I figured out what I'm going to do with my incel friend Context: I've been at the very least acquainted with (I'm going to refer to him as Ã¦ from now on) for about two years. We haven't talked in a while, but he recently downloaded a videogame(kept anonymous because he frequents this subreddit, although it's probably not that hard to find out) and we've been playing together quite frequently, this has resulted in a re-kindling of our friendship. I found his reddit because it's the same name as his skype. Ã†'s reddit account is filled with incel related posts. I made a post a couple of days ago asking for help. And that's the situation as of now.

Ive decided to tell his parents through a text message filled with evidence of these actions, instructions on how to get him into counseling, and thing not to do (such as ground and/or yell at Ã¦). And how to comfort him through this hard time.

Just though I'd let all of you 5 people who remotely care

Oh and another thing: please don't insult icels most of them think their incredibly ugly and are depressed.
