Iâ€™ll probbably cringe at this in a month but This girl asked me out. I said a nice no and she got sad (understandable). She leaves and then her friend starts harrasing me saying that a girl finally likes me and I should have said yes. I tell her that itâ€™s my choice and then proceeds to call me ugly and gay. 

I donâ€™t understand why. Also idk if the woman which asked me out told her friend to call me names.
