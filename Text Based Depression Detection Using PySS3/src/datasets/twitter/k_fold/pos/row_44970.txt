so apparently light is actually good for you so for like the past month iâ€™ve been waking up tired, staying tired and sleepy all day as well as getting headaches..

today i decided to open my black out curtains and let light into my room for the first time in forever, and uh iâ€™m cured i think

donâ€™t stay in a dark room 24/7 guys
