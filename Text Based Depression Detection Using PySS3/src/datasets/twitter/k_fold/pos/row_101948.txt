I got press on nails from Walmart... (I'm a girl if that matters to anyone)


And holy shit I can't type or frankly function for ANYTHING. I literally emailed my teacher and explained that these stupid claws are the reason my assignment is going to be late. I got mad at it so I'm just gonna go to bed and take the L because I can't take them off right now either because they are basically super glued to my nail plate... This was a very bad idea and the amount of autocorrect that I've had to use while typing this is ridiculous.
