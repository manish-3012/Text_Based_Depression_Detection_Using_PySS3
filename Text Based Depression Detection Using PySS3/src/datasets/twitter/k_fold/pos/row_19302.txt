I wish I was skinny so fuckint bad (TW) Iâ€™d do anything to be. Iâ€™m gonna try out pills but I workout and barely eat a whole lot, my calorie intake is lower than what Iâ€™m burning. Iâ€™m so beyond frustrated and confused. I cut myself because I feel so bad bc of my weight. I barely want to go to school and honestly if I were thin Iâ€™d probably be happy to go.
