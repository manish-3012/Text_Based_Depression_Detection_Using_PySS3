Crush left me on seen So I finally confessed to my crush after a long ass time of just talking. I haven't confessed yo a girl in a good 4 or 5 years and finally just last night I got the courage to do it. And I got left on fucking seen. All the confidence I had built up gone instantly. At first I was fine. A little hurt and I knew the odds of her rejecting me were not in my favor so it didn't hurt much, plus she hadn't seen it. Then I checked and she had been online just 4 minutes before i had checked. Later on at about 5 PM she read it and just left it there. No response. Nothing. After that I was just kinda mad. But now it just hurts. And I've been told all the typical stuff by now. "You win some you lose some" "There's plenty of fish in the sea" etc. Honestly none of that helps. Because honestly she was just for me at least once in a lifetime. Like I know everyone says that but she was legitimately perfect. And now I'm just fucking distraught. Like I was expecting atleast to be rejected gently. Even then I would've preferred a harsher rejection rather than just being ignored.
