Update: Itâ€™s COVID This is an update on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/l0pqm9/my_father_fell_ill/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) post.

So, my father just received a call from the lab he went to do the testing, it came out positive for COVID. 

It may not come as a surprise, but well, I had thought we made all great in terms of protecting us.

Luckily it seems he is ok, for now, he gets 37 degree fevers in the mornings but recovers to 36.5 after a short time, so thatâ€™s great, he is just weak.

And another thing, my sister, my mother and me have no symptoms, yet, but we were exposed so we are surely infected. 

If anything important happens I will update.

And yes, this is completely real, I donâ€™t like karmawhoring.
