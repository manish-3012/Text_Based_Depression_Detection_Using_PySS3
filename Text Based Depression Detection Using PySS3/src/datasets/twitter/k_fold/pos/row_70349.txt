My childhood dog died 2 months ago (not in minecraft) I lost my dog on the 27th of June and itâ€™s already been 2 months which seems insane. We had him for my entire life or at least for as long as I can remember. Losing him was too difficult. Today we had to take a dog because she wasnâ€™t being treated right and she now is really scared of people and right now kinda only trusts me and my mum which is cute lol. Sheâ€™s so nervous and gets scared of people walking in. I canâ€™t post picture right now so I guess use this link... https://imgur.com/gallery/dt3pIEf
