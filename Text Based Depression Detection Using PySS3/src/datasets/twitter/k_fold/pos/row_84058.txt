Is it wrong that I am 9 months older than my partner? I've been teased at school for a while (pre-corona) for having a partner who is almost a year younger. I've been even called a pedophile and other mean things. I'm 14 atm. Idk if they were right and there is something wrong with this relationship. What are your thoughts?
