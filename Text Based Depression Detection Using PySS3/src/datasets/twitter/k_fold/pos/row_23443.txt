I have been out side for the past few hours smoking 2 racks of ribs, finally seems as tho i only have to wait 30 minutes until I pull them off and have lunch. Itâ€™s always worth it but it takes way to much time if Iâ€™m being completely honest. But nothing will beat it other than maybe some burnt ends and brisket.
