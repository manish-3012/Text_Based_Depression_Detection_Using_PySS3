Oof, i dont like it like this I have been kinda down recently, i havent talked to my friend, my brother is kinda good??? But usually mean. I have nothing to do. In my city skipling classess is close to impossible for some reasons, and now due to the virus i of course am not able to. Su i cant focus on my school life, social life? Dont really have that either. Any things to do? I am also not good at anything, when i try to draw, you can tell who the charachter is, but it is very ugly. So any hobbies?
