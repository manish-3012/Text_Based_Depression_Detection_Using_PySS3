Ugh (2nd attempt, because of some stupid reason)  

So i had bought a new gun (toy) with my own money, but since my grandmother doesn't really care about me having my own fun, I had to hide it for a day. A few minutes ago she was knocking on my door, so i put it under my bed. She then walked in, and asked what was going on. I told her nothing, because I didn't want her to know. She then realized this was an opportunity to get me in trouble, so then she changed the subject to what I had on my computer. I had just recently restarted it, so I was opening all my tabs again, Including Part 2 of a Marvel's Avengers playthrough. I clicked away from it because I hate how they can't give me privacy, always asking what I'm watching, Like please shut up. She thought I was "talking to someone i wasn't supposed to" because the guy had a facecam. I had to tell her It was a video, and I couldn't talk to a video. At this point I'm pissed because she always does this. My grandfather then got involved, and since i can somewhat trust him, I told him i had to hide the gun, he then understood, and the situation died down. But he did threaten "I'm going to make sure your father goes through your history!" like really? (That was before told him about the gun)

I hate this house so much...
