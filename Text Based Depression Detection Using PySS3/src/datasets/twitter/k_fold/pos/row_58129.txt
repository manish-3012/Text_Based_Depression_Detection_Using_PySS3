I am in a bit of a social dilemma I donâ€™t know how but one girl decided to create a group chat and invite only one guy: me. We all talked for a while one day and then I had to get off of the chat. After I had to get off do do some work around my house, the chat went dead silent. Then I realized something: the chat was about me. I am guessing that one of the girls likes/liked me and the one girl that created the group was trying to help the other one out. What do you guys think and should I try breaking the silence on the chat
