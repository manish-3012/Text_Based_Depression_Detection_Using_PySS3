Is it normal to have parents who don't respect the normal behaviour of a teen? I'm now 17, and my parents are still constantly on my back for the most stupid things. Below are just a few rules that seem to pop up quite frequently.

* Can't have my door closed when doing homework
* No earphones when doing homework or just pretty much in general and my device volume has to be 100
* Talking with friends online (voice chatting with irl friends that they know) for more than a couple minutes is a waste of my time
* Talking back to my dad in English (he's Chinese with limited English speaking skills and I was born in English speaking country) automatically translates to me agreeing with him which is frustrating because if i try to say it in Chinese it gets misunderstood and he starts picking on that
* Can't stay up past 11:30 even on weekends, my devices get taken away at night too

My main issue is that these rules seem to pop up at the most random times. I'll be chatting with some mates, then my dad will open the door and order me to unplug my earphones. If I ask why then he'll start layering more and more rules. The occasional time he tries to add reasoning he just spews what I believe to be bullshit about everything being done for my sake and my future and that all parents are like this blah blah you know what I mean. My mum also just tends to pretend it doesn't happen and just tells me to not hold grudges against him. He also doesn't listen when I try to explain myself and takes it as a chance to make me look more like the bad person ;-;

I'm definitely not saying that I have it bad, because compared to some of the things I've seen people go through and apart from these little issues, my life is relatively decent. I'm lucky to have supportive friends and a financially stable family so please don't take this as me just being an ungrateful whiny child.

Honestly this is probably just my lame excuse to be petty and rant about my minor inconveniences but  boy does it feel good to get off my chest.
