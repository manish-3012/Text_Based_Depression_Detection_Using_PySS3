Just a weird question... I am depressed as frick, I fell like i cant help myself and want to... Hurt myself. I am getting bullied by a teacher as well, but i cant do anything about it cuz he will not be here for long. I kinda want to go to detail, but i want help. How can I find enough time to learn myself the things my teacher wont and still feel like i have enough time for myself after i helped my mother and father,)(who are ill)?
