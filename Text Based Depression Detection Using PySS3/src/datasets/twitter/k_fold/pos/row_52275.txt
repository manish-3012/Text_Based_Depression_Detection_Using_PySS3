Not doing this again. Ok. Due to all my friends saying to talk to a therapist or smth, I did.
I don't know how to feel towards this, but I contacted the SH text line... And they weren't much help at all, lol

1: They're too professional. I'm more comfortable/interested in a personal approach

2: They keep saying "we're proud of you for contacting us" or "this must have tooken a lot of courage". Like these are seriously the least things I want to hear.

3: They're too "nice". Like "wow that amazing, you sound like an extraordinary person" or "you seem intelligence and very self aware". Like com'on. I'm used to more nutural people rather that the "hyper positives" ones. 

Now that's done and my options are set hopefully my friends will drop the "get help part". And yes ik this isn't exactly real help, but Ik what it's like tho.
