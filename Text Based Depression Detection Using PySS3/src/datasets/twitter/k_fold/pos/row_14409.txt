They sedated me and I started laughing Today I went to have a gastroscopy, they sedated me and immediately after waking up I started laughing unconsciously, however, the fact and that I remember laughing for no reason.  the nurses were there wondering what I was laughing about but the fact is that I don't know. Thats was pretty weird
