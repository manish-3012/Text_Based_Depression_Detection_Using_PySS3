YouTube rewind 2020 could be one of the worst rewinds yet. If Youtube pulls a 2018 rewind and decides to get all  ad friendly with their "so proud of this community" bullshit then we'll probably be looking at one of the worst rewinds.

TBH, corporations only follow trends so that they can sell more products. They use patho to lure people in to buy or use their product. For example: Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream made a post about how to defund police using ice cream scoops, which attracted much people to the post *and* their product.

With everything that has gone wrong this year (Covid-19, Police Brutality, Wild Fires, Financial Crisis), YouTube will probably focus more on the events that happen this year then the actual creators themselves. YouTube wants to look good for investors and advertisers so that they can earn more money.

YouTube rewind is about the creators, not events outside the site. There aren't any real significant events like last year, but there is still enough to make a rewind focused on the site.

I know it's still September, but I'm calling it here and now.

TL;DR: it's going to be more focused on events that happen this year outside of YouTube instead of the creators and what happen on the site.
