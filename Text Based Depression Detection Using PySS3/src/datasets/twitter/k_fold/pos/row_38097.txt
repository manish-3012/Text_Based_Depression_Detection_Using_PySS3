I donâ€™t mean to sound Sexist or anything but, Why are Male teachers more laid back and chill than female teachers? 
All male teachers Iâ€™ve had were honestly pretty cool ppl and more fun than any female teachers Iâ€™ve had.

Nearly all female teachers Iâ€™ve had were either Assholes, boring, or just angry all the time.

Iâ€™ve only had 3 cool female teachers and one asshole male teacher.
