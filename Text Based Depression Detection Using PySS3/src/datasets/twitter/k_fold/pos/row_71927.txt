Update on my abusive father This is an update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/kwohr9/i_just_called_the_police_on_my_abusive_father) post. So the police came (mind you I'm in Poland so things may be different than in the US) they spoke to my mother  and my... I can't call him that anymore. They spoke to my mother and the other fool that's around in the house, but nothing really happened. It was downplayed to an argument without anything more happening, but that's just not true. She was beaten, but she denies that. Of course the police can't do anything because apparently, according to my mother there was no violence. There will be a policemen coming 'for a talk' to us, I don't know what's he called in English but basically a guy that "guards" our area (our district, according to Google translate) The police told me he will talk to me too so maybe he will take my words more seriously. Besides that there's nothing more to say, he didn't say sorry, he didn't say ANYTHING to anyone, he went to sleep. Sweet dreams mf-er. I'm proud of myself nonetheless, I will do all I can to see him be held accountable for what he did. And I don't say that out of hatred, (well maybe a little) but I just want to see justice win at least once in my life.
