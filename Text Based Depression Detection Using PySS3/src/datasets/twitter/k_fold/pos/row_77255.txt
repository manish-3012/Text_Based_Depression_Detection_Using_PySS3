The Coronavirus pandemic isn't that serious or dangerous- CHANGE MY MIND I'm in a mood to argue and I don't think the "pandemic" is dangerous enough to justify the lockdowns and i think they should have ended a long time ago. The lockdown is cousing much more damage then the virus ever could. 

Btw. I'm not American, im from Poland soo keep that in mind (but i think that the lockdown in the US is equally unnecessary) 

I'm expecting a civil conversetion not a shitshow if that's okay
