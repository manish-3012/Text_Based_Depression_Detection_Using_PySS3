A finland fact for every day #48 This one is not so much of a fact but a... Thing...

I was talking to my dad who lived during the soviet union and he told me that when he was a child/teen, the commies were a serious threat. Yea yea we beat em in the winter war but they would not make the same mistakes again.
The fear was that the soviets would one day incade finland and turn it into communist crap.

But that was not the main fear? At least for my dad.
The thing was, that that time was the cold war. Since Finland would be such a perfect and relatively easy target they might attack any day. Which wouldve meant that the USA would have taken it as an offense and started a nuclear war AKA big booms all ded.
