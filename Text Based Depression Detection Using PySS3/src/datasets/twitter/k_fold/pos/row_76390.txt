Guys I need help. Can someone please lend me money. Please listen to me. So there's a Reddit user who somehow got into my phone and is blackmailing me. He threatens if I don't give him money he will reset and delete all my data on my phone even my sd card. He's done this before. He's asking for Â£25 Google gift card and I would give it to him if my birthday wasn't coming up. I asked my parents for money and they said wait for your birthday. So if anyone gives me the money I promise I'll give it back to you on the 20th of September. Thank you
