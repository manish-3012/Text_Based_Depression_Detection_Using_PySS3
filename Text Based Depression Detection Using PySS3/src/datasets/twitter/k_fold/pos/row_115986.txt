How in the fuck should I go about coming out to my friends? So basically I've had the suspicion that I may be trans for like 5 years or something and I have been keeping it to myself for this entire time in case I regret it or something but at this point I think that is complete bullshit and just my brain keeping me from getting happiness and skirts.  I wanna tell someone about it so my life could be easier, but how should I go about doing it?  With a question, meme, or just flat out saying it.
