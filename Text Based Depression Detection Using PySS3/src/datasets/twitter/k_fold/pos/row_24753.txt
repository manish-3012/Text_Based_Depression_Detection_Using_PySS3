Girl of my dreams asked me out So there's this girl in my class who I've liked since the start of the year and I knew she had some feelings for me awhile ago but I could never pluck up the courage to ask her on a date. Last night we were on a call and we started talking about how she used too like me and then she just asked me out. So now we're meeting tmrw and I think I'm gonna kiss her
