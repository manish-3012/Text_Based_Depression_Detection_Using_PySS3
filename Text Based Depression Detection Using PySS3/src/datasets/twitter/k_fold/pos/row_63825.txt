Life = Stalemate = Indifference 	You ever feel like youâ€™ve met a dip where youâ€™re not doing enough to give your life purpose...I do. I feel as though I try be being an outgoingâ€”forward looking *person* but itâ€™s like the opportunity doesnâ€™t present itself. As if it doesnâ€™t even exist. As I witness fellow citizens mandare and accomplish so much (On Social Media). Itâ€™s enough for me to force myself to be active in the community. (Which I Am) I engage with everyone. I help my family. I help others. I push myself day in and day out to maintain a sharp image! Unfortunately, that doesnâ€™t feel like enough...so under the pressure of guilt I work harder. Harder and harder, but I donâ€™t see the next step. 

	Whereâ€™s my next step? College? Business? Job? Connections? Family? Death? I want to be seen, not shrouded in a layer of *normal*. I want more...much more than a happy life. I feel as if I need to leave a *mark* but I canâ€™t. Yet you see thousands of videos where people become instantly famous without preparation or determination. They do not leave a *mark*. They leave a trail of injudiciousness, imprudence, and obtuse absurdity that people gobble up on the daily. Not saying I want to be famous but a humble human being that has accumulated his success through his humility. I just want to be able to use my success to help others...philanthropy if you must put name to it. But itâ€™s much more than that...

	I grew up wanting something bigger and better. (Life) It sickens me that many fall into a lax state. Now I feel I have fallen too....

(*Depression*) Itâ€™s a word I donâ€™t use. I choose to believe it doesnâ€™t exist. I am the rock and others lean on me. I donâ€™t show signs of weakness. I AM bold and can solve otherâ€™s problems. But why canâ€™t I solve my own. Then that same word (*Depression*) appears. I canâ€™t help but notice it seems to cast a shadow upon me. 

(Life) It doesnâ€™t give you pointers in the right direction. It doesnâ€™t give directions or guidance...so I always feel lost in a abyss of simplicity and continuity. 

Whereâ€™s my light to shine upon this world? 
Where can I accomplish my dreams?
Why canâ€™t I make my opportunity?
Where is my opportunity?
Where is my time?
Where is life?
What am I?
Why?
