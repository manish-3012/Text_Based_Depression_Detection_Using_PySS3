I probably need help Iâ€™m sitting on my bed crying and seriously contemplating hanging myself today. Iâ€™m a lonely, toxic, worthless, and pathetic person whoâ€™s better off dead. All I need to do is overcome the fear of killing myself and Iâ€™ll be gone. I even went as low as walking through my town to find a place to jump on December 2, but unfortunately couldnâ€™t find anywhere good. Thereâ€™s literally nothing I can do at this point other than committing suicide.
