Cuties Can't Be a Sign of Things to Come The upcoming netflix movie Cuties is downright terrifying. It's not a horror film; it's a film glorifying the production of CP. From watching the trailer it seems like the film is painting the opposers of the main character (an 11 year old girl) doing sexually explicit acts as hardcore conservative religious extremists. If this sort of thing becomes normalised it can lead to something very dangerous for minors. If this movie is released and others like it are made, the rate of minors getting molested or raped could go way up as the public may begin to think that this sort of shit is okay.
