Why tf can't you make post history private? It's so damn annoying. Every time I post someone looks at my history and thinks I'm an asshole because of my personal views that has nothing to do with my post, so they reply with unhelpful BS. Tbh you guys are probably gonna check my post history and judge too lol. Like why tf can't it be private
