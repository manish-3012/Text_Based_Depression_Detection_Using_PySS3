My brother just smashed my laptop I (15F) have an annoying older brother (16M) who I will call "donkey"

Donkey wanted me to do his essay and I refused and yelled at Donkey for telling me to do it. Donkey yelled at me for heading to my friends house instead of doing it. I called Donkey a donkey, and he got really pissed and grabbed my laptop and smashed it.

Anyway, I wanted to talk to my friend, so, I finished Donkey's fucking 1000 word essay just so Donkey would let me use his laptop. (Note: After crying for like an hour.)

So, in conclusion: Fuck you.

My dad said he's getting me a new laptop if I stay quiet about it for ten minutes which I fucking did. So HA!
