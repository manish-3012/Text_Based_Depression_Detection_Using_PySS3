Iâ€™m in pain Iâ€™m in pain

I was literally crying and shaking,I could barely breath

It all started by my mum forcing me to open the door while I bath,I told her I feel insecure and want her to close the door,but she insisted to watch me bath,after that I told her that I want to talk to someone about it because I donâ€™t feel good ,and then she ignores my reason and just shout at me at a really loud way,people six blocks over can hear her,after that I was crying really hard,and then I started to cry more and started to shake when my dad said some really hurtful things and I barely can breathe when my mum said that she want my dad to bring me back to China and that she doesnâ€™t want to see me.I could speak for more than ten minutesï¼Œand she blamed all the bad things to me and think she did nothing wrong at all


I feel really unhappy
