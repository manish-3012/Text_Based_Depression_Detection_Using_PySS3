Iâ€™m a 18 year old who tried to be financial independent So hereâ€™s the thing, Iâ€™ll start college from December and I tried to be financially independent before starting my college. Iâ€™ve been getting straight Aâ€™s and I love studying mathematics so I thought about tutoring children mathematics for a low fee. 
The thing is, I canâ€™t get a lot of students and all I have are 3 students right now. 
Can anyone tell me what to do to get more students?
I give online tuitions so location issue isnâ€™t there.
