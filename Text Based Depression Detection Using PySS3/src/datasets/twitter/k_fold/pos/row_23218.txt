Hey, quick question about girls: If a girl you barely know texts you and says she thinks you're cute and really funny, is she into you or is she just being nice and complimenting you? 

Edit: weather it's a troll or she's doing it for a tiktok was the first thing that came to my head and I asked her, she said she was serious but idk I'm still kinda skeptical

Cus I've just received my first compliment in months and I can't tell if she's just being nice or if she's into me because I'm ugly af and posted like 2 mediocre photos of myself.
