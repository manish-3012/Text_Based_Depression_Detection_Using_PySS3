To my fellow UK teenagers Today, some of you will be getting your GCSE results. I wish you all the best and I hope you get the results that you wanted. However, if you didn't, don't let a sheet of paper with some numbers on it define what you do with your life. As long as you have the willpower to do whatever you want, you can be whatever you want. 

I'm also recieving one of my results today, as I was meant to sit my English Literature back in May (my school does early entry, so all year 10's would have sat it this year that's just been) 

Again, I wish you all the best!
