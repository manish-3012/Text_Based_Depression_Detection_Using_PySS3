My sisterâ€™s boyfriend had the chance to assassinate Donald Trump a few years ago Heâ€™s a chef. A little before his presidency began he visited the restaurant he worked at and got a meal there. He literally made jokes about poisoning him back then and heâ€™s probably regretting a lot right now ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
