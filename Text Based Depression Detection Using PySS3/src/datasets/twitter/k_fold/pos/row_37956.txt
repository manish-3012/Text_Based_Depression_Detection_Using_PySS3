Why does it seem like when everything is good going for humans God has to intervene and fuck everything up I've been reading Genesis and Holy shit. Adam and Eve finally become smart, as punishment: banishment, childbirth pains, and loss of immortality. 
Everyone around the world collaborates together to create the greatest structure of all time. God: fuck that, I'm going to confuse their languages and cultures so they can be a great division, slowing the process of human progression, which will allow racism and xenophobia. 

Then a bunch of angels or who ever the "Sons of God" are fuck a bunch of hot chicks and conceive Giants. "God, how will you handle this?" God: "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth." Can't even control your own kids so know you take it out on us. #1 Dad in all of the eternity folks.

Honestly, I'm starting think that Lucifer is the hero and god is the villain.
