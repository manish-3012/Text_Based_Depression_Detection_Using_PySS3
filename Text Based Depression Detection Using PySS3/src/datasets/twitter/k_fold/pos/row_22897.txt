Ugh why do older people do this  I love my grandma but sometimes she is a bit racist. So Iâ€™m mixed half black and Mexican. (My grandma is black) 

And she complains so much that the problem with America is that they are giving away so much stuff to foreigners. 

A nice Asian woman bought the house in front of my grandmas house and my grandma isnâ€™t a fan of Asian people. She refers to the woman as a â€œjapâ€ and â€œwitchâ€ and it pisses me off so much. 

A lot of older people do stuff like this and itâ€™s so annoying.
