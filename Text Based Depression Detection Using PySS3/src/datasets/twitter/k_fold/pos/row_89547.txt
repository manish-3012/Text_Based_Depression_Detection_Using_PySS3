What a fucking fatty. There is a cat who lives in my apartment, he comes at our door everyday and asks for food. Today i came back from school and saw him trying to hunt a sparrow. When the sparrow was on the ground he tried to catch it but the sparrow flew away and landed on a tree and instead of chasing after it, the fat ass cat sat there until it noticed me. The cat then approached me and started following me and meowing at me probably asking me for food.
