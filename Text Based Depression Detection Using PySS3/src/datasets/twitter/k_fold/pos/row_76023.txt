My mom is watching me through cameras So the other day my mom bought a bunch of cameras for â€œsecurity reasonsâ€, but they are literally pointed at me and my siblings desk, none of them are facing outside or on the doors. I complained about it, and she said â€œif you donâ€™t have anything to hide, it shouldnâ€™t be a problem.â€ Now, I donâ€™t have anything to hide, but I do value my privacy. The good news is, we just finished reading 1984 in English class, so Iâ€™m gonna be armed with seminar questions when I go for round 2 with my mom. Wish me luck!
