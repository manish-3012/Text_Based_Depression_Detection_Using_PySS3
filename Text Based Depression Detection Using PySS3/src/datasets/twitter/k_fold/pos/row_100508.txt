Girls genuinely confuse me So I asked a girl out about a year ago, sadly she rejected.

I am all over that and now every time I don't give her attention she starts kind of flirting with me, But she clearly told me she was not into me on the romance level, now shes sliding in my dm's and I am confused as hell.
