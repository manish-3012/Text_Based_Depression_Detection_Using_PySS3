Can I wear a durag, or not. I have my last cross country race of the season on Saturday, the guys want to do something so we all matched. And they landed on Durags. The only issue with this is Iâ€™m a white guys whoâ€™s hair isnâ€™t nearly curly enough to need it. Iâ€™m familiar with the history behind it and the last thing I want to be doing is offending people, I know obviously my teammates are chill about it. But I need a outside view because I donâ€™t know if I should.
