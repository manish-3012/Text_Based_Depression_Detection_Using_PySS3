This is very epic So today in health we were all talking in the back of the classroom and my crush pulled up snap and said and showed me half way across the room: â€œYou look cute (My name).â€ Her friend then said the same thing basically but I just brushed it off because I had never been complimented by a girl in my school. And the first one to FRICKIN DO IT WAS MY CRUSH!!!!!!!!! I just realized how awesome this was!!!!!!!!
