Cried for the first time in years ðŸ˜Ž School has been pretty stressful especially cause the school system isnâ€™t respecting my accommodations for my dyslexia and adhd, basically the school just saw me, an attention deficit dyslexic student with a history of anxiety disorders and was just like â€œsuffer lmaoâ€ so I had a small breakdown, talked to my mom and I feel better now, like who knew talking about how you feel can improve your mood somehow that shits crazy man.
