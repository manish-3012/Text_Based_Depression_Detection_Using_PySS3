Just a quick reminder: Not everything you see on the internet is true I want to remind you all not everything in the internet is 100% true,common or objebtive. Many things you see around here are just jokes taken out of hand, half truths,a pesimist side of the storie or plain lies. 

For example, because i read somewhere on internet jokes about how all anime fans were unhealty lonesome losers lusting for a fictional character i grew hating anime. I tought that if i got into it i would end like these sick illmen, reason why i sticked to wester animation a lot. Wich is not true, yes there are plenty of people like that, but not every anime fan is like them. There are just wired people wich happen to be anime fans. thats all. 

other example. here on reddit ive heard lots and lots of pessimist borderline madness ideas and points, that try to prove we as an species will probably go extint in this century. things like, alarmant polution graphics, the mass extincion of certain animals, problematic politics, etc. things that made concerned for our world. Luckly they were just bad news.  I found many more news and points of view and those previous news were just pesimistic.
