HELP, MY GIRLFRIEND IS MOVING AWAY!!! So, Since almost 2 months I have a girlfriend, I was(still am) really happy to be with her.

1 week ago I heared some really depressing news, MY GIRLFRIEND IS MOVING AWAY!! 
She is moving to a (sort Off) big city 90 km away and that isnt a Nice distance because its 6 hours of biking.

Teenagers of reddit pls help me, im desperate!!
