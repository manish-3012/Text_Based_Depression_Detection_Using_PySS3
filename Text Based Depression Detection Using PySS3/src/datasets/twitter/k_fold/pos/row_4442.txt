This is the kind of stuff that pisses me off So me and my mom were out to lunch today with my momâ€™s friend and my momâ€™s friendâ€™s son (not my choice, it was for my momâ€™s friendâ€™s sonâ€™s birthday) and went to this pub because it had outdoor seating and thatâ€™s safer and all. It wasnâ€™t terrible, besides that there was a ton of bugs, and towards the end me and my mom started overhearing the table next to us (solid 5-6 feet away) because they were talking pretty loud. Thereâ€™s this little kid, maybe 5-6, that was complaining that his baseball team was bad, he was in a jersey so he must have just played a game with his little league, and he was upset because his team wasnâ€™t contributing. The dad (dad I think?) had to explain to him that it was okay, etc etc etc. I was cracking jokes at our table about how â€œI was so used to this conversation because Iâ€™m the best at everythingâ€ and â€œIâ€™ve heard it all beforeâ€. Anyways I wish I hadnâ€™t. At the end right before we left, my mom hears the dad (I think the dad. She told me what she heard but I donâ€™t remember who she said said it) say â€œI hope the kid who tested positive wasnâ€™t the really good playerâ€. Come the fuck again? First off, stop being a whiny ass bitch that your team is bad when one of your teammates caught the fucking virus. Be happy youâ€™re not on a ventilator. Second, to the adults at the table, why the fuck, **why the fuck**, are you eating out in public, around people, when you fucking know someone who tested positive. Why the fuck are you not quarantining, why are you out where youâ€™re touching plates and within feet of waiters and waitresses when you know damn well you might be carriers. I donâ€™t know if this mystery kid was at a game when he was positive. He may have caught it early. The kid may not have it. They may not have it. They probably didnâ€™t give it to us, we were distanced. But take fucking precaution. Just because you may not care about getting it, you clearly donâ€™t if youâ€™re more upset your bitch ass baseball team sucking than having a life threatening virus, doesnâ€™t mean others donâ€™t. Stay home if you were potentially in contact or proximity. I wish death upon no one but these are the kind of people that I wouldnâ€™t be upset if they caught the virus. Maybe that would teach them to be humble and have priorities. People like this are why the pandemic isnâ€™t ending
