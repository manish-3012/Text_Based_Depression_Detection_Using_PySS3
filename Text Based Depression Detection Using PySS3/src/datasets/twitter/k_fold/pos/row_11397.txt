I just wanted to post before it was too late. (And a question about social stuff.) I am currently 16, 17 in june. I have seen this subreddit in many youtube videos and always wanted to post here. But considering that being 19 is going to come not too far from now, i got panicky. 

Now I'm unsure how the rules work. Maybe im worried about nothing. I know this post might get deleted by an automated bot because by technicalities i am breaking rule 2, but i genuinely didn't know what else to put here except this minor rant and the question below. Sorry.

But, if you wanted a proper(-ish) post, here's a genuine question: any advice for real life social interaction? Online i'm fine, but outside is hard-ish. I've sorta been a shut-in due to both Aspergers and Bullying and i wanted to do more. Last year i was going to start interacting with people, but.. well. yea. Hopefully by the time i do reach adulthood, i'll be able to socially interact by myself. 

Many thanks to those willing to actually respond.
