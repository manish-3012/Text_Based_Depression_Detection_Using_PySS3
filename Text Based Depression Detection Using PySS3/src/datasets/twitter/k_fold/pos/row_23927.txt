R/teensagers I need your Help! Hello r/teenagers, my name is OldManJacan and I need your support in a very very serious upcoming election. You see in my discord Server I created the role of President Weeb and I am now under attack from those I considered friends!
It all started as a joke when I named myself that as I set up several anime watch nights for the server, the other day however I was challenged and what started as a joke has turned to a very serious election within our server and so I am now asking you to show me your support! You may just ignore this and if you do you are fools! 

Democracy and Anime are the 2 most important things in this world and my opponent is no weeb, and not a worthy one to lead our server! With myself and my VP we commit to keeping the weeb culture in this server alive and well! 

(As of now voting is limited to those on our server but Iâ€™m working with the election manager, which is an actual role on our server now, to potentially allow more to vote after we hold our debate)
