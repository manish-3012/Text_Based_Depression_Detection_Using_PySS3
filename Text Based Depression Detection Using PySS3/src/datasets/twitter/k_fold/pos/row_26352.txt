I freaking hate acellus. Now if you don't know what acellus is the consider yourself a lucky because back in August I was given a choice do online school or go back to school I wanted to do online school because I don't want to go back to school and so they told me I would be doing it acellus. I ended up going back to school for my second semester why because I wanted to go back to school. Here's why I hated the program let's say there's a test you watch the video and do the test if you get a low score then you have to watch the video again and if you got a high score but miss one question you have to watch the video if you mess up again you have to rewatch the video. and I had to do that two to three times a day because I would mess up. And there's also another problem with it let's say you power on your Chromebook and you log into acellus. All of a sudden it wouldn't log you in so of course you would restart the Chromebook and yet it still wouldn't sign you in. 

Now I'm back in school I have to wear a face mask because covid why else would have to wear a face mask. and I love going back to school I don't know why I didn't go back to school in the first place.
