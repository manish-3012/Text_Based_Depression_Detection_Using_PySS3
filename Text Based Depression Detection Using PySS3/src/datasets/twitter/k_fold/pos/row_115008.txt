I need advice because My cat caused a flea infestation Hello. I really need some advice on this. I found this kitten in my backyard one day and we kept it in our house. After a while fleas came and caused a lot of marks and itching and tomorrow and my parents are going to drop him off at the animal shelter tomorrow. This cat has been the best thing that has happened since Covid started for me. Is there any advice that anyone could give me so we can keep him. Anything helps
