Hey guys, my little sister made a YouTube channel and is super proud of it. She is recording a video for it right now and she said she even wrote a script. I'm not asking that you watch and like all of her videos, (honestly i dont think she looks at those), but maybe consider subscribing. She has never been so exited about something ever before.. thanks guys and gals. (She can't figure out what she named the channel so I will post the link when we find out.)
