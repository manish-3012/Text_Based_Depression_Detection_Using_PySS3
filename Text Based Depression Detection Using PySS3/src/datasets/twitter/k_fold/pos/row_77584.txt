Got out of a huge family debt and now my dad might have cancer. My family just got out of a huge debt which my father had for more than a decade. Debt is due to some family drama. My father is the greatest guy I've ever seen. He never says no to things, even if he don't have money he will get hold of some cash. The best father I ever could have.

Recently my mom decided to sell of all her jewelleries to clear the debt (My dad is very bad with money that's why we have the debt in the first place). Pretty much all the money we get every month was spend on Interest and we had little to none. When we finally pay off everyone my dad felt sick and we went to the hospital. He had a kidney stone and he might be having a blood cancer. The doctor said that if something in his blood increases (I don't remember what it was) he will be diagnosed with blood cancer and its highly likely that he will.

I saw happiness in my mum's eyes in a long time when the debt was paid off but now she's back to sad. Life was becoming better and it decided to punch us in the guts. 

Please pray for my dad.
