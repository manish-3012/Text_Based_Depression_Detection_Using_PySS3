McDonalds Messed up my order, so I wrote this as a complaint. I think it's funny, But I'll let you be the judge of that. Cast your mind back to Tuesday evening, if your inept cronies are even capable of that (They can't even get a burger order correct, but I'm getting ahead of myself here)

For my Brothers birthday, I ordered a Grand Mac Bacon from this location.

And I am here to tell you right here, right now that I did not get that Grand Mac Bacon.

I got the "Homestyle Crispy Chicken".

I want those responsible to know this.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be able to provide evidence in the form of a photograph with:

&amp;#x200B;

The offending/imposter sandwich and

The receipt which lists both the fallen big mac and a distinct lack of "Homestyle Crispy Chicken".

&amp;#x200B;

However your incompetent web designers have not allowed me to attach it. So sad. So terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

The disappointment I experienced as I eagerly tore open the bag like a child on Christmas day, waiting to find the glorious, double-layered and bacon ridden monolith to western consumption that is the Grand Mac Bacon, entombed under many layers of fries and shareboxes, and instead found the depressing, bleak and frankly soul crushing "Homestyle Crispy Chicken" in its pathetic little box cannot be expressed by the English language.

&amp;#x200B;

Shakespeare. Leo Tolstoy. Bob Dylan - They would all fail to find the words to describe my dejection and sheer misery.

&amp;#x200B;

This level of disappointment will only be surpassed when I inform my parents how long this took to write.

&amp;#x200B;

"But Louis" - You yell from your sad little office, wearing your sad little suit, having driven there in your sad little car, "It's only a burger, it is not that big of an issue, you're overreacting" - as flecks of reconstituted chicken nuggets fly onto your monitor from your gaping mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

Ordering food from a fast-food restaurant is ( and I say this with great emphasis) not a matter I take lightly.

&amp;#x200B;

 I hope you get some lessons in grace and decorum because you have all the grace of a reversing dump truck without any tyres on.

&amp;#x200B;

I demand reparations.

&amp;#x200B;

Also a 2000 character limit is so idiotic, why do you need so ma-

&amp;#x200B;

At that point, I reached the character point.
