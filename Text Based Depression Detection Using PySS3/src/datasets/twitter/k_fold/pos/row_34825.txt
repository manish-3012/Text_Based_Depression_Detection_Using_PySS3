I have thicc thighs and I don't like them. As from the title you can say that I don't like my thicc thighs. I also have a big butt and they clap with each other every single time I walk, anywhere I go. It makes a lot of noise and people around me are always scolding me about it. I can't even go to the local library because of this stupid reason. This is why I think thicc thighs and big butts are overrated and not that great when you have them yourself. For reference, I am a fourteen year old male.
