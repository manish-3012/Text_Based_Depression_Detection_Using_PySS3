I seeked for treatment. So if you look at my last post a week ago, u will know that my arms, both, were broken during an accident

Well after the accident 1 day, my parents took me to the hospital. There were good news and bad news.

The good news is, my arms werent broken, my wrists does. The left one cracked quite a lot, the right one kinda uhhh deshaped? (idk thats a word or not, basically its shape is not normal). The doctor said I would be fine since those injuries are not serious and they would heal fast, around 1 month or so.

The bad news is, I cannot do basic tasks, including holding a book or writing, so my progress in school will be very, *very* slow.

But hey! On the bright side, i didnt die, and those are minor injuries i guess

I will update more about this
