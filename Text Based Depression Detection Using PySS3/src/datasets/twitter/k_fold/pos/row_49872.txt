TFW you expose a creep TLDR: I called out a Roblox Youtuber with 300k subscribers months ago, and the document is finally getting popular

He's getting a lot of negative attention and is deleting comments from his channel regarding the situation as well as constantly running away from making a response despite the fact he's been called out for this since 2016

Most people know I wrote the document and I can't handle the attention if I'm honest but I'm glad it's getting biggerðŸ¥´
