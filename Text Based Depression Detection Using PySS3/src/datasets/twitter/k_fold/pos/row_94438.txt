I just lost my child...I donâ€™t know what to do Hello. I have a girlfriend and we had a kid together. He was 1 year old. Yesterday I went to check on him in his crib... he wasnâ€™t moving. I checked his pulse and he didnâ€™t have one. I called 911 and the ambulance took him to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. Iâ€™ve been crying nonstop since then and I donâ€™t know what to do. He was my everything.
