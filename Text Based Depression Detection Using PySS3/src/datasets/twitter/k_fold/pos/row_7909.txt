I just.. I just lost my friend of 10 years.. I really am just at a loss- Iâ€™m a female, heâ€™s a male and I just- I put so much effort into making it work, I truly did- I moved this past year and I tried texting him at least once a month to make sure he was okay, then he literally gave me an anxiety attack because of his immaturity and giving me a prank call that some girl saw my number in his phone and I freaked out and he kept telling me to chill, he had been kinda mean to me before, not taking into account my feelings, but only him. Then this past week, another prank call about how I should vote for trump, which is coincidental how he had gotten into an argument with my very RESPECTFUL democratic friend. Heâ€™s just so shallow- and after I told him to stop prank calling me, once again, he denied it along with a â€œyou always make such a big deal out of everythingâ€ and saying how since I moved, I wasnâ€™t his problem anymore. I tried so hard- I always put him first as I had toxic friends my whole life, but he- he WAS different and he gave me the nicest compliments anyone has ever said to me, not just basic ones. I loved him, and not like that, but as a friend, a real one. I hate that I let him have this power over me. I hate that I let it get this far, I donâ€™t know what to do now.
