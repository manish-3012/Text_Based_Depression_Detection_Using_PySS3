Imagine kicking someone out of a chat because they arenâ€™t â€œpopularâ€... Like damn bruh all I want to do is find some people to talk to and yâ€™all had to kick me out of the discord cuz I donâ€™t have enough reddit karma? I though this stuff doesnâ€™t exist cuz of how childish it seems, but it does.
