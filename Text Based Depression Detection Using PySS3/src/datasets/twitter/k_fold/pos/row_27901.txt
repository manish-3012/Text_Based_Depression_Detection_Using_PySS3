I just want my friend to be happy My friends been through a lot of stuff and thus have some mental health issues that affect them greatly. I really just want to see them happy, I saw them on their 18th and they were so happy because they made it and it made me cry because itâ€™s what I want for them. And every time is see them sad it breaks my heart, they mean so much to me and it hurts me to see them in pain. I wanna help them but I canâ€™t understand what they go through and just yeah thereâ€™s only so much I can do
