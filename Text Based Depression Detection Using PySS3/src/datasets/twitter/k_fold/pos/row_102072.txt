In school today my teacher showed my class a video about chastity after someone asked if birds are lesbian. Yes i go to a Catholic school lol.

Basically the video was like 45 minutes of people explaining how women should be modest and save themselves for marriage and if they don't its a grave sin. They also discussed a little about single dating and how getting sexually aroused and pornography is also a big no no. 

Also don't ask me how this relates to lesbian birds because I have no clue.
