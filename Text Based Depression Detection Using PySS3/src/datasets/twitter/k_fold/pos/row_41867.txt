My dog died today He was a Spanish water dog named Odin and someone hit him with a fucking car. I donâ€™t know what to do now..he was the best dog Iâ€™ve ever had and he was such a good fucking boy. I would sit outside every day after school with him for hours and just spend time with him. I miss him so much already..

If anyone has words of advice they would be appreciated, I hope you all have a much better day than I have.
