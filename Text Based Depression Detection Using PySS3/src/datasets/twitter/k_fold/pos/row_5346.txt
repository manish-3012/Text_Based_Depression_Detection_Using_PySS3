The next time I hear a chick say why cant I find a nice guy the immediately later make fun of guys for being simps im gonna lose it. A chick I know complained that she can never find a nice guy to go out with and has bad luck with men. She just wants some guy who will listen to her and communicate and stuff. Then immediately goes and hooks up with some immature dude who turns out to be emotionally abusive to her. Like what did you expect, you walked right into that one for the fourth time in a row. Like you serriously didnt see that coming from a mile away? You make fun of any guy whos actually being nice to you by calling them a simp.

Being nice to someone is seen as creepy or obsessive and I dont know why. Being obsessive about someone is creepy and obsessive. If a guy comments something nice about you thats not creepy. If a guy comments some detail about you that you dont understand how he knows about thats creepy. If a guy walks up to you and says your hair looks cute thats not creepy. If a guy walks up to you and sticks his nose in your hair then says your hair smells nice thats creepy.
