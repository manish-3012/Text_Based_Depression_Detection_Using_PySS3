Things I am grateful for today. My Friend who was there when no one else was

Music the closest friend I have

My family for helping me and understanding 

Dance the one outlet I have to let my emotions go

Medication the reason I still can handle myself

The lady who held the ladder and prevented me from jumping off it

My therapist

My passion and heart that lives on inside me 

The warm weather today

When the days seem hard, when I miss someone I can't see anymore, or I spiral I remind myself it's alright. I just need to be grateful for the good things. 

Thanks for reading.
