Iâ€™m happy and confused So today I was planning to ask for my crushâ€™s number. And I did. I walk up to them and ask and they say, â€œOh I already have it, I asked (friend) for it. Iâ€™ll text you.â€ Iâ€™m pretty happy about this and soon enough she does. We talk for a few hours and itâ€™s going good. 
Then her friend (also my friend), tells me that said crush doesnâ€™t like me that way. I should have been really sad but I wasnâ€™t, cause honestly they just moved here and thereâ€™s tons of time. 
However in a group chat my crush also called me â€œdryâ€ so Iâ€™m really confused.
 Any advice?
