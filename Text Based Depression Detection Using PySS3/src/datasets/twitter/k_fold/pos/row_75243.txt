i opened up to a girl she didnt feel the same way I told her that i dont feel like that anymore and i just wanted to say it cause i would regret not telling it late

She said she loves me as a friend and that im the only person she likes talking to

it hurts everytime i talk to her cause ive been crazy about her for months and now we are just going to be friends...
 
any advice?
