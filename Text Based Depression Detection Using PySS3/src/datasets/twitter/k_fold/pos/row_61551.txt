From a bisexual, disabled, religious teenager living in 2021... I feel like we get offended too easily. We're trying so hard to not step on other people's toes, and it's becoming a hinderance to everyday life. You don't want to offend someone, I get it. But problems arise when we try to avoid offending even a single person. Idrc if you offend me, I'll get over it. Just don't give up your humanity to make me more comfortable.
