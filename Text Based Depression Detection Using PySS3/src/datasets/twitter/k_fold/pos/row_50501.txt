I'm sick of doubting myself Idk I guess because of Quarantine I've been having somewhat of a difficult time lately, I won't say 'm depressed just down and my anxiety's been pretty bad lately. I don't have too many close friends irl, especially in school, and because of COVID I really have only seen one girl once and I went to my youth group thing once but I have a hard time in social situations and I'm not super close to anybody there so I was just really anxious most of the time. I have been going to a different youth group (old one wasn't taking restrictions seriously so I had to stop going), but it's taking me a while to get to know people and stuff so I honestly barely know anyone from there either. I have a lot of online friends and I talk to my irl friends a lot through text and call too which I'm really grateful for but it's not the same and I suppose it's getting to me. Besides that, it's like I'm in this cycle of having every little thing I think I've done wrong remind me that I'm this way and idk. I just feel really mentally tired. I need to get a job but every time I try to look into it I start thinking about all the things that make me anxious about it. I don't understand why especially lately so many things are making me anxious. And I feel lazy cause I'm so tired and I spend waaay too much time on my whole I'm literally addicted. I really enjoy talking to my online friends but I think I've just started to make my phone my entire life and it's really unhealthy. I don't know what to do because my irl friends are busy or afraid of the virus still or whatever so no one can hang out really. I've been trying to plan something with my best friend and finally we might get to see each other in a few weeks and also my other friend wants to get together soon but idk how that will work cause he's always so stressed and busy.
