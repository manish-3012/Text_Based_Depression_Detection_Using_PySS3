Someone who I thought was one of my bestfriends just left me :( The last thing they said was "yessss unphased like i expected goodbye dont come back." They told me this in class, and I started crying. I've tried fighting for our friendship before, but apparently it didn't work. I couldn't tell him how I felt, because he would've called me manipulative. I feel so sad but I can't fix what happened :(
