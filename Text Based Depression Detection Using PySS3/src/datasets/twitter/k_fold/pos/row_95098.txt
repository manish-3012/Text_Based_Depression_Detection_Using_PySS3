I hate my actions Sure, call me stupid.

On friday, my friend was being a complete dick. I yelled â€œare you FUCKING STUPIDâ€. My science teacher overheard. He said heâ€™d call my parents and to stay after class, and naturally I said if he calls my parents Iâ€™d kill myself because my life would be over of course. It turns out he just called the front office to get my parents numbers. I now vouch to NEVER say anything other than â€œshut up, Joeyâ€ or in a more serious time â€œshut the hell up, Joeyâ€ to said friend to not raise any anxiety or whatever the hell caused me to say that.
