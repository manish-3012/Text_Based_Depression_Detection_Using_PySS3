I have a feeling my mother still has the "man = money / woman = house and kids" type of mindset Like that I have to be successful because I am a man, and that if I was a woman, I wouldn't have to be successful, because I can then marry a man to give me money.

I hate it, it makes me so angry and dissappointed
