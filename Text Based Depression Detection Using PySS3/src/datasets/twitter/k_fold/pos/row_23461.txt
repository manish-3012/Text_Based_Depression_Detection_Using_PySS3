Have your parents been outgoing my racist around you(excluding racist jokes or anything they didnâ€™t mean)?      Iâ€™m Chinese and I used to get made fun of a lot in school, it wasnâ€™t that it hurt my feelings it was just super annoying and pretty fucked up. Obviously being racist is a learned behavior, I donâ€™t believe people can just be born with hate in their heart. Today I met the parents of one of my racist schoolmates. Thatâ€™s what brought me to this question. Have any of you had parents that were racist for no reason? How has that affected you if you have?
