Question for Online Students who have the option for in school learning. Does it seem like your school is trying to make you become a in person learner? Because my school seems like itâ€™s trying to do that. Now classes are giving more and harder work than they give to in school, and a smaller due date. And now even if you fail one class they make you come in school to learn. I just wanted to see if this was just happening to me :/
