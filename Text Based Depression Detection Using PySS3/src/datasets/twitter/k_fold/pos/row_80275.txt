idk where else to ask this question but what should us guys do to take better spicy pics? i know this is weird but if u have a better sub for me to put this pls lmk. anyway, i feel like guys get a lot of slander for taking horrible dick pics so i was wondering if the girls or the gays had any tips on how us guys can take better noods or just spicy pics in general?
