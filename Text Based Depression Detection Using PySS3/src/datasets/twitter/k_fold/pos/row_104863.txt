maybe this is common knowledge but I didn't know until today idk if I'm just stupid for not knowing but in the uk the police cant speak to you without an adult present unless you're over 17 and I always assumed that would have to be parents/guardians but it doesnt. literally anyone over 18 that you know is fine like my friends mum was with me earlier so if youre ever in a situation where you wouldn't want your parents knowing for whatever reason but it's a bit dodgy or something just bare that in mind !! dont do stupid shit like me though :)
