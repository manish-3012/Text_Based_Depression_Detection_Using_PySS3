Finally broke the 50km mark with cycling Ive been cycling for a long time, but never really long distances. On a school day i would cycle for 20 km in total, at decent speeds. Recently, because of the lockdown I decided to try and cycle a bit more than 10 km. I got just a little bit carried away and i cycled 45 km... But yeah considering that i have asthma and didnt completely die during the ride, it was a pretty big deal.

Fast forward to today, my dumbass stood up this morning and was like: alr i dont care what weather it is i'll cycle for 50 km or more. And the weather was reasonable... Sort of... It was 1Â°C, and very windy. Well the first half went fine, had the wind in my back, until i turned around to head back home. Oh my god was it COLD. i was wearing skinny asf jogging pants, turned out that isnt a good idea with almost freezing temperatures. I got through pretty good until i was like 15 km from home. My energy ran out, the wind got even stronger, and it was cold. It took me a while but i got home, cold, tired but proud. Broke the 50km mark, it was 56.85km total! Got an average speed of 19 kmp/h, isnt that impressive at all, but for me it's pretty good yknow.. And top speed? 44.6 kmp/h. I don't know how.
