I wanna get a book but I donâ€™t think my parents will let me I donâ€™t read often. I never have. My parents know this. I want to get into it more so I can spend less time on my phone. I like geek mythology stories and what not. I saw a lot of people talking about a book called â€œThe Song of Achilles.â€ It sounds really good and people said it made them cry. Iâ€™ll buy it with my own money. Itâ€™s just my parents like to make little remarks such as â€œlike youll ever finish that bookâ€ or â€œyou donâ€™t even read. youâ€™re wasting your money.â€ I think Iâ€™m just gonna wait until my drivers test on Nov. 4th and if I pass Iâ€™ll go get it myself. Iâ€™m nervous tho.
