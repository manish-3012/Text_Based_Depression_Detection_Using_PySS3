Bruh finding a job is so hard. I just moved from OH to NC and there are literally no jobs here. Like, back home I had so many connections. And I went on indeed for 2 days and got 5 jobs. Here, I have no connections and was on indeed for 2 months and literally got one job. And this job canâ€™t pay for anything. Like, I got bills bruh. And Iâ€™m looking for trades and stuff I can go into, but thereâ€™s nobody training. Itâ€™s straight up like, â€œyou gotta have an associates in thisâ€ or â€œ5 years of experience in thisâ€ and Iâ€™m like bruhhhhhh Iâ€™m literally 18. How tf am I supposed to make sumn of myself if I literally canâ€™t cause thereâ€™s no starting points.
