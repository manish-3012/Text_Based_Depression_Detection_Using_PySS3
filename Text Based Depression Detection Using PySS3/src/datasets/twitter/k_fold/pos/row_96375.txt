My Simp friend Jayden's story  Everyone has that guy in their friends group right? The king of simp that can't control his actions whenever they sense estrogen. I have him too. His name is Jayden. Jayden Lee

 Jayden is a pretty chill dude when he's with the bois. He acts normal and is a nice dude to be with. But then, the moment a girl approaches him, he turns into a simp. Now a girl doesn't even have to talk or look at him. She just has to be within a 10 meter radius. If a girl is watching him play basketball, you can expect a 10 percent performance boost from him. Simple.

 Now Jayden and I have a mutual female friend. Yes, a female friend. Now you might be able to guess what Jayden does to her. He SIMPS HARD via text. Every text he sends her becomes an evidence for my anti-Jayden-simp movement. 

 Thankfully my mutual female friend screenshots and reports every simp stuff Mr.J does to me. I'll be listing what he did.

"Your adorable cutie Jayden has arrived~~^^â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸"

*Send his selfie video trying to look handsome except he looks ridiculous

*Calling her cute names

Now we've probably only scratched the surface here and my investigation will need more sources. Who knows what other simp things he's done.

Now if you've read this far, please comment "Stop simping Jayden" so he can stop. I'll screenshot your every comment and send it to him.

Let's end this simp.
