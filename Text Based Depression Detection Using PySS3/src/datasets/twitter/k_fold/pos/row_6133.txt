I have a mental illness Turns out I have extreme social anxiety disorder or a phobia of being social which sounds crazy ik but Ever since i was like in the 3rd grade i was scared to make friends even tho when I was a very young kid i used to love being with people, and well this just ruined my life so basically I canâ€™t talk to people without feeling like I need to throw up or zone out. I have failed so many classes bc I couldnâ€™t present and i fucking hate it, I literally donâ€™t have friends and the people i talk to are just there when they donâ€™t have someone to talk to, I feel like my future isnâ€™t going to be good bc literally I want to be a business person but then I have to go to meetings and act like a role model, idk I sometimes get suicidal thoughts but I also think about my family, I suck at everything Iâ€™m the definition of useless I wish I wasnâ€™t born honestly life is a shithole and I hate it I think Iâ€™m getting close to death everyday and my parents yell at me for the disorder but oh well, this just a rant I needed to get off my chest.
