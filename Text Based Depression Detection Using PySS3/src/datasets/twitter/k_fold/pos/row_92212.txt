Do I stay up until I wanna slam my head into a wall learning python? My current plan:

Caffeine amount = y e s

Slap a bunch of tutorials videos in a playlist

 ^cry

Try to un-fuck python 3.9

Find more tutorials because Iâ€™m a dumbass

Cry again

Procrastinate

 *it is now Wednesday forever*

Thatâ€™s interesting

End up sleeping at 6:12 am

Why am I doing this
