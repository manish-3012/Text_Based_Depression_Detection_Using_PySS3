Group Chat Paranoia So to put it plainly, I have these people in my American Government class and we made a gc. Theres 4 people in it including myself and we use it for work in the class, talking in general, etc. There isnt a lot of activity  in general but if someone asks something they get a reply within 30 seconds but when I ask its 5-10 minutes. And whenever I try to be social and stuff they just act like I didnt say anything and ask a question about the class of change the subject. Not to mention theres like 10 messages a day regularly. Now thats not a lot to go off of but Im afraid Im being excluded from a smaller gc. Just tell me your thoughts and please let me know if im just being paranoid. 
TL:DR- My 4 friend gc is really dry and no one talks, I feel like im being excluded from a different gc.
