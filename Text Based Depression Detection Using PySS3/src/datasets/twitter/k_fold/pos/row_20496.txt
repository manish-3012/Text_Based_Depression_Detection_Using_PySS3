Why is this sub so deprived of interhuman contact? Now this is a  serious post,
I just scrolled through the wastelands which we call "hot" and i watched
4 posts about girls telling me how to get a girlfriend and 3 posts about how to get a boyfriend. Also i saw 2 posts about guys who asked their crush out and 5 posts about how someone feels lonly.
The important posts about problems which require help, and the funny trashposts completely get lost in the lower part. I also see a bunch of "this is going to get downvoted a lot but [insert popular opinion here]" Posts.
I get that you guys need potential attention, which is natural,  but please search for something new and inovative, otherwise this sub will just look like Donald Trumps twittertimeline with the same and same over and over again.
And yes i am a runting a little, but i needed to tell yall what i think about these kind of anoying posts.
