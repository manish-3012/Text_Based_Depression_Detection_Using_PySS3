Everyone says to live a crazy, exciting teenage life but mine has been chill and now Iâ€™m wondering if I did it wrong? Iâ€™m 19 so Iâ€™m about to finish with the teen years. Iâ€™ve seen threads recently and all these people are saying stuff along the lines of â€œgo wild, youâ€™ll never get these years backâ€.

The truth is, Iâ€™ve spent these years mostly playing Minecraft and jacking off (not at the same time). I didnâ€™t really bother to do the typical rebellious teenage stuff like go to parties, do drugs and have sex.

Did I do it wrong? Are you guys living this ideal teenage life?
