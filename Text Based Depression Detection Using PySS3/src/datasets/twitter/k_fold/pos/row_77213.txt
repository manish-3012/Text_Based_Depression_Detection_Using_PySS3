Frick Corona I just broke up with my girlfriend because she lives in another country and I canâ€™t visit her because of corona. Last time I saw her was in December. I just lost interest in her. Well she is perfect, beautiful and an absolutely wonderful person but after a while it just felt unreal. It is almost impossible to have a long distance relationship without it crashing. 
I broke up with her in a good way but it still made her really sad (understandable) and I feel like shit. 

I really hope we can talk to each other in the future. Iâ€™m so so sorry. 

Sorry bad English.
