My bully died My middle school bully who beat the shit out of me and harassed me in middle school just died. I hated him but I know others didnâ€™t. He was a dick to everyone but when he got diagnosed with cancer everyone changed. It was you can beat this and 600 people showed up to cheer him on. He relapsed and died a few days ago. People who Iâ€™m friends with are upset about it because he was a friend to them but he made me suicidal. I was ready to off my self in middle school. Am I just a asshole for saying I donâ€™t really care? He tormented me. He even met a pronfl player because he had cancer. I donâ€™t wish cancer upon anyone Iâ€™ve seen it destroy people I love. I donâ€™t wish death upon anyone. I have ptsd, anxiety, and depression. Most of these are linked to bullying in school and I still get nightmares of being defenseless and being beat up.
