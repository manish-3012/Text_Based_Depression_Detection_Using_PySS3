Is this how turning bi works? I wanna know if my brain is bullshitting me.

So, I got high and text this kid, my age, best friend of two years, that I love him. So we start talking, and after something serious I won't say happens, I tell him I love him again, but this time I realize I mean it.

We keep chatting and I realize more and more that I do genuinely love this man. It all happened so suddenly, me realizing I loved him in the span of a few hours. I've always thought I would be straight but, I might not be.

Anybody who isn't straight, is this how it works??? That I suddenly realize I want this dude to cuddle with me both of us wearing oversized shirts and pants as he hugs me and softly tells me everything is going to be okay in my ear?
