The worst way to ask anyone out. So theres a girl ive been crushing on. We're great friends, and i consider her my closest friend since i moved. Well, ive been wanting to ask her out. We're both into pokemon, so I decided to trade her one named 'willubemygf' or something along those lines. She has black and i have diamond, so she's pretty much stuck with it until I get a copy of white. I have deemed this the worst way to ask out a girl, but i'm doing it anyways. Wish me luck!
