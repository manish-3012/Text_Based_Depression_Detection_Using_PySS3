i love april first haha gotcha this sad excuse of a holiday is why im a total recluse, id rather relive my father's suicide then have to deal with this day every year! every april 1st morning i get to open my eyes and remember today is the day everyone no matter how good they are at actual comedy becomes UNFUNNY
