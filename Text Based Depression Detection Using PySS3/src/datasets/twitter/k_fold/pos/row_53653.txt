My dog got attacked by a pit bull today So we were on a hike out in the woods, when this UNLEASHED and UNCOLLARED pit bull came up to us. Our dog is pretty skittish because of her past so when the pit bull came up and sniffed her butt, (as dogs do) my dog tried to run away and the pit bull started trying to bite our dog. Now our dog is pretty fast and strong but this thing was up to my thighs. Our dog bit it in the neck (not hard at all) as a warning but this thing went OFF. My mom grabbed our dog and the pit bull was jumping up on her, so we started to swat at it because if this thing got ahold of our dog, she would not come out in one piece. The owners of the pit bull show up and see whatâ€™s going on so they grab their dog and  basically hold it back and cuddle it. The husband? Boyfriend? Whatever got in my dads face about how we should put down our dog because it bit their dog and they were going to call the police because we were trying to hit it. The police show up and (thank the FREAKIN lord) my brother got most of it on camera. The police officers gave the other people a ticket for not having their dog on a leash and one for not having identification either. The trail we were walking on had those exact rules.

Tl;dr: our dog got attacked by a pit bull, owners called police, got $500+ worth of tickets and their dog has to be put down. (poor thing)
