I tried to help my classmate but I was scolded for it So my friend wanted my help in math hw. He told me he wanted to check it
. I sent the homework to him because he is weak in math. But he copied each and every step. Since my method was different from the others. The sir personally called him and asked him if he had copied. He then lied that I sent him the hw even though he did not ask for it so he copied. My teacher accepted his shitty excuse and started shouting at me. He called my parents and complained about it even though the other guy copied my work. My parents just listened to him and completely ignored my remarks Now I am not allowed to play Minecraft or any other game for 2 weeks . :(
