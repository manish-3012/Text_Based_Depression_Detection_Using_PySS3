I got rick rolled today The title says it all. This morning I was in my P.E class inside (we donâ€™t go to the gym, we stay in homeroom), and my teacher had a giant playlist with tons of different genres of music. We were listening to 2010â€™s pop music, and then all of a sudden I hear Never Gonna Give You Up blasting through the speakers. It seemed surreal, it was a weird song to transition to, and I had never gotten rickrolled before without knowing that it was a rickroll coming up. It felt nice, since I was in one my my most stressful classes.
