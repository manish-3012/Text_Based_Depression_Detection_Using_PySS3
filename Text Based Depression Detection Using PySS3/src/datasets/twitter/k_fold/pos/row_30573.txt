broke up with my girlfriend today and i'm extremely sad :c pls help a fellow bro It's so sad I genuinely thought (well I still think) that she was the love of my life and I don't know she was the only person I *truly* loved, like the people who i've liked in the past, sure I liked them and genuinely had a shot with them...

But nobody really compared to her. And I just can't believe it and have been crying ever since she told me. I can't believe that she just left me so suddenly... :c

I don't know if I can or want to move on... part of me is clinging to the hope that we will get back together, and the other part of my is trying to accept that it's never gonna happen.
