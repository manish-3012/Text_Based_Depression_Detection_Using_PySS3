Iâ€™m not the only one who thinks this. So I got a baby cousin, 5 months old, she is the cutest baby right after me when I was a baby 17 years ago. She has huge soft baby cheeks on her face,and when I kiss her on the cheek my mouth sinks in. Then I thought I JUST WANNA GIVE A GENTLE LITTLE NIBBLE. Have you been in my situation?
