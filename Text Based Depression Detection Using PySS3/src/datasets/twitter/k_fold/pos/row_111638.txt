Reddit isn't a community, it's more like a family We have fun together. We laugh, joke and support anyone who needs us. Like every family, we fight and then make up. There might be some bad seeds but every family has bad seeds, so we just ignore them and keep on vibing with each other. We take lonely, depressed people and force them to vibe with us and in the process help them rediscover their will to live. We live in a harmony that no one except us can understand and love.

I love every single one of you. The entirety of Reddit loves every single one of you. If that isn't enough to keep y'all going, nothing ever will be.
