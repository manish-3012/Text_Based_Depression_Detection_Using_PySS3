My Girlfriend is cutting herself This is my first real post on reddit. I really don't know what to do and need help. My girlfriend who I am deeply in love with told me she cuts herself. I told her not to do it of course but she said that my pleases don't help her. She has a bad family situation so talking to her parents isn't an option. She wanted to keep it a secret so she had only told it 4 people including me. I told her that cutting herself doesn't help and it just makes things worse but she disagrees and says that it helps her. She cuts herself on her wrist I've never seen her do it (she does it alone) and don't know how deep or how much she cuts. But I'm just scared that one day she will go too deep and she'll bleed out. I don't want to lose her and I'm afraid she doesn't see how much she means to me. We are both pretty young but she says that there is no hope for her and she wants to die. We live in Germany we have 2 week holidays now so I can't even come to her and comfort her (hug her) or do anything the only thing I can do is talk to her text her.

I'm really sorry this might be hard to read. And sorry for all the language mistakes. I hope someone can help me and most importantly my girlfriend. Thank you.
