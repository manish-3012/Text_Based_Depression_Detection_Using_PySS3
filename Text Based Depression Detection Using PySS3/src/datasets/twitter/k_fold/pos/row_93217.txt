My biggest bruh moment so far I just remembered back in 7th grade me and this girl had a crush on each other and one time while after school hanging around I asked her if she did, you could kinda tell she did because of the way she acted, and she paused for a second before saying no (just brushing it off) and my dumbass was going to say "okay cool" but I accidentally said "okay good", she doesn't like me anymore and I didn't notice until like a month later about what I said, were still on good terms buuuttttt...... I still cringe at it to this day
