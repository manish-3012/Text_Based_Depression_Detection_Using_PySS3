yo who tf trusts a teenager to make sure they don't drown?? Now I need to get a job this summer really badly. I'm pretty darn athletic I run cross country and track year around and I swam in the winter and summer a few times so I'm a strong. I'm about to get a lifeguard certificate which seems easy enough to get however trusting a teenager to make sure you don't drown seems absurd to me even. I plan on guarding for a small local pool in my area that there's only been one instance where any lifeguard has even had to get save a kid. what do you guys think? is it an appropriate job for me?
