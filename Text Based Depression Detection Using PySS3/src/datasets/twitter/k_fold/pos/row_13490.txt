The CORRECT way to propose The social media and films nowadays are saturated with people proposing to their SO in a public place(most likely a restaurant) and getting down on one knee in front of an audience taking out the ring. The thing is every single one of us is well aware of this method and thinks its "romantic" and the perfect way to do it, While its not. It causes alot of issues for the person proposing where they have to put themselves in the spotlight and do something bold, publicly which isnt something most people are comfortable with making them fall down the rabbit hole of procrastination and hesitation. For the person being proposed to, it puts them into a massive dilemma where even if they dont want to get married they are afraid of rejecting the person publicly and causing a lot of repercussion for both of them in the relationship.  
So in some situations, the person accepts the ring, making the person proposing very hopeful but later rejects, the idea of marriage which shatters them OR in most situations they just reject them publicly causing their relationship to end then and there.  
Ever since i met my SO ive talked about this with them casually  
And expressed the fact that i was against such an act and if it ever came to it  
i would propose somewhere private  
or if we are somewhere public I just give her the ring casually and tell her that she can take as much time as she wants to think about it.  
and my S/O was extremely in favour of the idea saying that's how it should be  
and that's how it should be for everyone   
This saves us from a lot of abrupt and toxic ends to a good and healthy relationship.  
(First bit may sound weird as i tried my best to make this gender-neutral)
