I wonder what ITER became I wonder what ITER became (French nuclear fusion reactor in construction) I don't really see anything about it

If you don't know what it is,it's basically a nuclear reactor except we use fusion instead of fission,that prevents it from exploding and can be easily fueled (uses molecules that can be find in the water) if I'm not wrong. 

I know there are other projects like this in other countries like Russia and the USA and I don't remember their name and don't know anything recent about it. I guess it may be because of the pandemic but if you guys are a bit of tech nerds or idk sure let's talk in the comments or idk

Why am I writing this at 3 am
