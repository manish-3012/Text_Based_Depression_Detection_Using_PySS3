Does anyone have any advice? I don't think i can lie anymore. Yk people irl expect me to feel sorry for them when something goes wrong in their life and when something happens in mine i can't find any sympathy or anything. I legitimately feel numb inside. I don't feel anger or sadness or happyness or fear. I feel.. nothing and idk why. Just wondering if i should worry or see a shrink or just leave it like it is.
