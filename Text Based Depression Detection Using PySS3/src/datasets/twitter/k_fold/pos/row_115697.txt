I feel like I fucked things up So me and my crush had gotten really close really quickly. And I thought everything was going amazing. I won't share many details but it looked like I had finally found the person that made me happy. But one day I texted. Told the usual good morning and how are you doing. And she said she had to tell me something. She said she was sorry if she was leading me on but she didn't have feelings for me. I was devastated. For the first time ever I started sobbing and it was awhile before I could do anything else. She told me she was sorry a lot and I told her it was fine. I can't control what she does and I don't Wan to make her feel like she has to be with me. I acted like I was OK with it but I couldn't stop crying. Then I jist acted like nothing happened and talked to her normally. The next couple days I was really busy with renovations on my house so I didn't have time to talk to her. But when I got back things felt cold. I don't if she thinks I had just stopped talking to her because I didn't want to anymore or if she just didn't want to talk to me but it didn't feel the same. Like a different person was talking to me. I still haven't had the chance to ask her what's wrong but I feel like I fucked up big time. Like I took things to fast. Like I gave her too much space at the wrong time. Like no matter what I do from here I've ruined everything, again. I've failed in the past. Made huge mistakes that have haunted me for ages. But nothing has hurt as bad as this. And there is no mending this wound.
