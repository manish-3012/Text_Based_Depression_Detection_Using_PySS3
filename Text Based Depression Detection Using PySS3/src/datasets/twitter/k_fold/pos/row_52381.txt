Someone said â€œTell me one time where the conservatives were the good guysâ€ I mean thereâ€™s not very many instances I have of that because conservatives are often the bad guys but here I go.

The Ming dynasty in China took over the Mongolian led Empire in China. The Mongolian Empire in China was very progressive and changing culture, tradition, and the economy in China. When the Ming took over, they restored much of Chinaâ€™s culture which was lost through generations of being ruled by Mongols. They also re-established much of the Chinese economy and drove the brutish Mongols out. The Ming dynasty could easily be considered a golden age in China.

Other than that though, youâ€™ll have a hard time finding times when conservatives were right.

Also, for some of the dipshits, conservative is a Universal term. Iâ€™m saying this because too many people think that Conservative is an American term. Conservatism and the Republican party are two different things.
