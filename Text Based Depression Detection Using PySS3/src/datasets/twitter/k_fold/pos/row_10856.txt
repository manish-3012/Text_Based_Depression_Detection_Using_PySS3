Iâ€™m scared to talk to my best friend now :( So I have social anxiety, and it keeps getting worse. The other day I starved because I was too afraid to leave my room to talk to my grandparents (I live with them), that used to happen every now and again but now it happens almost regularly. Iâ€™m starting to get panic attacks even talking to the closes people to me. And after a few months of being too scared to text my best friend, I finally managed to do it. 

It seems like me and her both went though some shit during these few months. But she wanted to have a sleepover and our parents said it was okay, but I feel so scared, like, I get panic attacks thinking of her being here. I just want this nightmare of a mental illness to go away:(
