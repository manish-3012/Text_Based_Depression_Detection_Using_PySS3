Should i change my current school? I currently go to a private high school that has a very good reputation. I have even heard a few times how some call it more difficult and supposedly the children at this school are more intelligent. I don't believe it, but the school has had students who have achieved a lot in their lives (some of them have Wikipedia entries about them) and the school does well in competitions.

I have a few friends in my class but they are not friends.I have often tried to talk to students but it has never really clicked with one.I am not happy to go to school in the morning,I even get sad.During classes I count every minute because I just want to go home.I have the feeling that I am withdrawing more and more and my self-confidence is also sinking.

In every school I was in before, I had friends but for whatever reason it doesn't work in this one.The teachers at this school are great and I can't complain.

I miss having friends and without my internet friends I would probably be so sad now maybe even depressed.

I don't know what to do, should I change to another high school or stay? I am always stopped by the thought that this school has a good reputation and I only have to endure 3 more years and then I will have my degree in my pocket.

Can someone please give me some advice?

What would you do or have I already had a similar problem and how did you solve it?
