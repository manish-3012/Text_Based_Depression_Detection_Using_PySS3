I have Gen Z and don't want to live through it There's a viral video on TikTok right know of an 11 year-old saying that he hopes everyone who is related to a cop dies. 

I mean yeah fuck the cops, they're assholes, but what the fuck is wrong with people

And this isn't just some Xbox 360 Modern Warfare "I hope your whole fucking family dies" type of joke. People genuinely want this to happen.
