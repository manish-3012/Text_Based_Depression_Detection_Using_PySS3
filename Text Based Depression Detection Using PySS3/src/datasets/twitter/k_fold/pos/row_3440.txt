iâ€™m still coping with the fact my pc is slower than a ps5 my gpu (my phone wanted to autocorrect that to house) is like 1-5% slower, and my cpu far worse, itâ€™s a ryzen 2600

my pc does have more storage (thatâ€™s slower), and 8gb of dedicated video memory, and 16gb of system memory. and i have an nvidia card so the ray tracing is better on my pc
