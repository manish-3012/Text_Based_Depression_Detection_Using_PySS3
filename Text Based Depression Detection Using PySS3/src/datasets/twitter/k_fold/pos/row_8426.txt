so today I got my new road bike and holy shit omfg I love the bike so fuckin much, I mean like I used the most shitty $70 mountain bike that was the heaviest shit ever, my new bike? it's the lightest shit ever, and the brakes actually work, I am so happy and ecstatic and I can't wait to use it more in the future
