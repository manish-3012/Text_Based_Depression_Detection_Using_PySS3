How do I know if my crush likes me? We talk a lot on discord, and we have spent time playing minecraft together. I don't know whether it's just me being biased about it all and hoping that she does. But I think she likes me. How do I make sure?

Ps. Going to sleep now won't replay for about 12 hrs. Thanks in advance.
