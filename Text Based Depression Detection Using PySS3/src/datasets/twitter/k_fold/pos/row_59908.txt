Christmas Blues? For the past 3 or 4 years now, I've always felt my mental health dip significantly during the Christmas period. I don't really know what causes or triggers it but I usually find myself going through frequent breakdowns and relapses during this time. I've heard people throw around "Christmas Blues" a lot and they often tell me it's normal but is it really though? It's slowly starting to affect how I act during Christmas these past few years and I think it's also starting to affect my relationship with family members and close friends (as I often find myself being closed-off and toxic which leads to me pushing them away). What should I do?
