My dad just threatened to cut me out of his will Yeah. My dad got an email from my geography teacher saying that I haven't been doing all of my homework and that I'm in a detention. In the car ride to the train station he starts yelling at me telling me that I've lied and he's gonna stop telling me when we need to leave for the train station and I'm gonna get expelled and hes gonna fucking cut me out of his will because I am doing bad in school. He says one more time and you'll not get anything from me when I die. So I'm pissed off.
