Traveling in Europe as a Minor Hi all. This post will be done under the assumption that the question of covid is taken out of the equation.

I'm doing a high school travel abroad program during the month of June in Berlin. However, once I'm done my family and I agree that it'd be good to go around some other parts of Europe. I'm thinking of doing Malaga and Granada in Spain. What would you all suggest for this and what do you think about how I should navigate the system with hostels and age restrictions?
