Why do parents favor younger siblings? My mom just flipped out at me for â€œnot askingâ€ my brother to have a bite of his cookie. I asked him, he said yes, then he proceeded to throw a fit about me â€œstealing his cookie.â€ MY MOM FUCKING GOES OFF AT ME FOR STEALING IT WITHOUT EVEN LISTENING TO MY SIDE. I brushed it off because this is a regular thing around my house and Iâ€™ve learned to live with it. 

Fast forward three days. I brought home some snacks from my friends house and put them in the cupboard. My brother saw me do this, and I told him they were mine. I come back downstairs an hour later to find him sneaking my snacks. I immediately tell my mom about it and expect her to handle him the same way she handled me three days earlier. 

Did she? OF FUCKING COURSE NOT

She got mad at ME for not letting him have any. First of all, when he had the cookie I asked permission and my brother lied and said I didnâ€™t. Now when he stole my food he didnâ€™t ask permission, and said I had let him have it. My mom takes him side (surprise surprise), and now Iâ€™m grounded for â€œLYINGâ€ to her about my brother stealing snacks.
