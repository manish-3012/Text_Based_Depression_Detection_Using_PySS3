All the things I wish somebody told me when I was a teenager # 1) If you have a crush, DO NOT spam them with messages.

Play it cool, do your own thing and spend time off your phone. If they don't reply to you, don't follow it up with another message to try and get them to respond. They're either busy or not in the mood to chat - accept it. Let them come to you. If you play it well and take your time to reply, it can get somebody to like you.

# 2) If somebody is making fun of you, don't give them a reaction

When I saw people getting bullied, they all had one thing in common: They reacted. 

People who freak out when you call them names are much more likely to get picked on, and people who take things too seriously are less likeable.

It's better if you're able to make fun of yourself. You can have the fattest, weirdest looking kid in school, but if they can laugh and make fun of themselves and they handle "banter" well, then they're likeable.

There's two kinds of "bullying", heres how to handle each:

* Banter: The person doesn't have bad intentions and is just poking fun. Usually they will be smiling as they say things. This can still be hurtful, but the best thing to do is to add something to it and poke fun at yourself. At the minimum, just smile or laugh, but the laugh can't seem fake.
* Bullying: Usually done by the kid with a bad home life. He wants to hurt your feelings, and will say stuff to try and upset you. The solution here is to just scoff at them and walk away. If you think they're dangerous, just try avoiding them and walking away. Don't show fear.

# 3) If somebody invites you somewhere, GO

This one is pretty self explanatory. Going to parties and engaging with people can help you meet others. Even if you don't really feel like going, sometimes it can be worth it and it can make you glad you went. This can help you become more popular.

# 4) Don't try too hard

Don't focus on becoming popular. The people who become popular are the people who don't try, the ones who don't care about popularity whatsoever. It's best to just *be yourself*. I know that advice is clichÃ© as fuck so I'm sorry, but if you are confident in yourself and aren't trying to fit in, you will be accepted. Don't try and talk in every single situation, just let yourself be quiet sometimes. Nobody likes it when a person just waits to say whatever they want to say instead of listening to the person speaking and respinding.

# 5) Don't pretend to like stuff that you don't really like.

Even many adults do this, and it's pretty easy to spot. When somebody they want to get closer to names a hobby of theirs, they will pretend to like it too just to get closer to them. It's okay to relate to people if you know about the conversation topic, but make sure you say "I'm not the biggest fan of X, but I like X". You want to be open about your true preferences, even if it doesn't match your friends/crushes. If they're into you, they will listen about your passion even if it isn't a passion of theirs.

&amp;#x200B;

# And above all, honesty is key. 

Honesty is scientifically proven to make you a more likeable, trustable person. Stay honest and truthful, say what's on your mind if you're upset, and tell people when you have a crush on them. It might backfire, but you miss 100% of the shots you don't take (another clichÃ© im rly sorry).
