I so badly want a nose job Idc if it's a turn off for people, itll make me so much happier I just can't wait to get one. My happiness comes first and it really will make me feel better.. so I mean if anyone wants plastic surgery don't avoid it because of people saying it's fake and nasty, do what you want :)
