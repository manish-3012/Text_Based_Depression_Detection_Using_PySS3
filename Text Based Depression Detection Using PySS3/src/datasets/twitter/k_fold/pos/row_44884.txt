Life passing like street lights on a Friday night. Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be just like moments, passing, in front of me. I know my destination,but Iâ€™m just not there. So I hop in a cab pay the fare. But Iâ€™m still not there. Lifeâ€™s just not fair. Do I have still have time to grow?
