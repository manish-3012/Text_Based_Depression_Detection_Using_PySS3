My parents keep telling me I should hang out with friends when I clearly don't want to and neither them My parents want me to hang out with my friends when clearly neither of them want to hang out with me, they think I don't get out of the house just to play video games in my pc, but that isn't the reason, I love staying at my house, and I don't really like being outside, how I can make my parents see that I'm kinda introvert and interior person?
