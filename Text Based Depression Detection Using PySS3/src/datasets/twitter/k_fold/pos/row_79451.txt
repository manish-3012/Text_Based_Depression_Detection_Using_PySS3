Friends I've grown apart from Ive grown apart from many friends this last year.  I think covid/ lock downs had made me realize how many people want to stay in my life rather then just be seeing them forcefully on a daily basis due to school. Some are just acquaintances and some were people that I thought were my actual friends. Most of it was just stupid things that I wish weren't the reason of growing apart.  I wish I could talk to those friends again and maybe put things back together. I'll just have to wait a little longer I guess.
