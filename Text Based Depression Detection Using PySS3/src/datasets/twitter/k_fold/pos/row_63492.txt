Anecdote on how my dog died 2 years ago Ok so i was going to school, and somehow my dog scaped from my house, and we didn't realized until the next day, we saw her entering the house, but something was wrong with her, she had a huge scar on her stomache, inmediatly we brought her to the veterinary, the veterinarian did his best to save her, but he couldn't because the guy who hurted her kicked her in the area of the liver, and either she died, or they restore her liver (which was extremely painful) my mom decided to end her suffering, and the veterinarian put her to sleep, so she dies in a less painful way.
But hey at leasy there is a good side of the coin,a few months later, that guy hurted/killed a few more dogs, and one of those dogs, was a dog from a drug dealer, keep in mind that the place where i live the drug dealers are preety powerful, and once the drug dealer noticed that the guy hurted his dog, he beat him up so hard that the guy didn't hurt dog anymore, so atleast me and the others got the good ending.

Note: this history is real, and i wanted to share it with ya'll, mostly because people are shareing stories about their dogs, (no i'm not a karmahore, i really wanted to share this story with someone).
Have a nice day ;)
