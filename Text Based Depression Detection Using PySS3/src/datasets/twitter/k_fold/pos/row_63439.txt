I need a bit of advice. Bear with me here cause this will be a long-ish post

So when I was 7 my parents bought me a PC cause that's all I asked for however we never got around to setting it up and it sat in my room for a while, then me and my dad tried to set it up. Turns out its running a version of windows that is no longer supported and we can't activate it and for the past 7 years my dad has been telling me "I'll get you the running program you need just wait." Recently I started getting into the idea of making a gaming channel on youtube but I figured I can't do that off of my crappy little laptop so I start searching for running programs, come to find out I can't directly upgrade windows vista to windows 10 and I'll have to get a new PC. I went to google and searched for "budget gaming PCs" and found one that I really like, catch is it's $680 dollars which is not something my dad is gonna spend on me and, as an unemployed 14 year old, I have NO money. So I need a way to earn around 700 dollars, probably more cause I'll need a new monitor, without a job. I understand if there isn't any way because I've already come to the conclusion that I'll never get anything like this.

Thanks for your time stranger!!
