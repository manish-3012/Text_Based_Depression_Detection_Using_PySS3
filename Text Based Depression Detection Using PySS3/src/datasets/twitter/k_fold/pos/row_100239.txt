So, my crush was just playing with me. Some months ago I met this girl, she was beautiful and had the same tasts as I, so I started to feel something to her. 

Then, I knew she had a boyfriend, soy I decided to not tell her and just be friends.

But she started to tell me that her bf was begining to forbid her to upload photos, so I inmediately knew that guy was a toxic man. I told her buecause I helped a friend with these things. She understood and left the bf.

That was real good to me, because then of that she started to say I love you, and I was in a cloud.

Then, she said she wanted to return with her bf,,,

I told her about toxic relationships and that stuff, but she won't understand this time.

Then I went to my dad's place 15 days (he won't let me use my phone so I couldn't talk with her).

After those 15 days I messaged her, she said she hated her bf.

She finally left him, but the bf kept sending long ass love texts to her. Hopefully she didn't come back with him. Then of her leaving her bf, she started to tell me I love you again. And after a month, she told me she was in love with me. I told her I was so. 2 months of a ""relationship"". 

Yesterday she told me she wanted to come back with her bf,,, I was like: That toxic shit?

We had an argue and she told me we were nothing,,,,, but even we weren't nothing, she kept sending nudes, and saying I love you and more romantic stuff. Now I'm hella depressed because:

1. She was playing with me for like 3 months.
2. She prolly will come back with her bf and he is going to be harmful to her.

Thanks for reading.
