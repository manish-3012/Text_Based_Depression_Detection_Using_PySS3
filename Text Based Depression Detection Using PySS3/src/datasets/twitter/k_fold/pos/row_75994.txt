MY ALBUM IS DROPPING SOON! Hey guys. Iâ€™ve had a super rough past year and a half and Iâ€™ve put it all into my music. Iâ€™ve really just been trying to get through it and I think itâ€™s really good! Iâ€™m 16 years old itâ€™s gonna be all self produced and I was wondering if you guys could help me promote it when itâ€™s done. If you guys PM me Iâ€™ll even send some songs! I donâ€™t have too many friends and this sub keeps me company a lot. Anyways thanks for listening to this rant hopefully a few read it lol
