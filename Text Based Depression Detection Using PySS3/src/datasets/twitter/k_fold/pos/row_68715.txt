Why can I select a race for an emoji? Pretty stupid. Isn't the whole purpose of an emoji to show emotion or symbolise an object? What's the actual difference of a thumbs up, between a yellow emoji ðŸ‘a black ðŸ‘ðŸ¿ or a white ðŸ‘ðŸ» one? They're the same fucking thing, aren't they?

Can someone explain why this is a thing?
