Homie, fuck dating Man, I just need to fucking vent. So Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for, like, a week now. Barely knew her before, sisterâ€™s friend. Tbh, I kinda started talking to her as a way to cope when my friend found out I had a crush on her. She rejected me (obviously, her bf is one of my oldest friends, which is why I didnâ€™t tell her anything). So I started talking to her like a week later.

Things were cool for a while. The texts were certainly were flirtatious. The bullshit started today, when I asked her to hang out. Long story fucking short, I found out she has a boyfriend. For like, a week, before we started texting. Honestly, thank god I found out. If sheâ€™s texting another guy behind her boyfriendâ€™s back, sheâ€™ll do it again. Iâ€™m not re-entering dating until I leave high school ffs.
