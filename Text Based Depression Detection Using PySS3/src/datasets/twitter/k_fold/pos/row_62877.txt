To The Company Verizon. Fuck You Verizon has put me though hell ever since covid started . first it started with the throttling. i had to use my phone as a hotspot for virtual learning and they limited that to such a slow speed. then text messages never went though and when i would call them to get this fixed they ignored it. Fuck You Verizon
