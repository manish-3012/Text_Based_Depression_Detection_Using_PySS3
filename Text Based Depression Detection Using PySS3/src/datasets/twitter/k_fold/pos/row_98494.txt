I wanna dance to the sound of your heavy breathing I canâ€™t do school work anymore. I used to make good grades in math but Iâ€™m failing. It reminded me of 5th grade. I hope I do better. 

Everyday itâ€™s the same thing over and over again. No matter where I go it just sucks me back to where I began. Ighhm

I wanted to go to bed because of I was tired but my mom questioned me and blamed her self again. Started stressing out because she said Okay I guess I need to split/leave. She said this always when theirs is a problem even if itâ€™s unrelated to family. 

It stresses me out. 

You know that jolting thing you do when your crying in bed? Trying not to make noise. The feeling of warm sadness leave your eyes? 

I donâ€™t know what to think.
