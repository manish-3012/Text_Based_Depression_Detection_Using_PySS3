I LEGALLY RECEIVED THE N WORD PASS!!!! 
        So I was at a Baseball game and this guy (provider of the pass) and his girlfriend are sitting in front of me. They both get up and it looked like they were leaving, possibly for the rest of the game, and I noticed that his girlfriend's phone fell out of her pocket and it was on the seat. So being the *amazing, kind samaritan* that I am, I lean across to get his attention and hand him her phone.

He's more thankful than I was expecting and he offers to buy me a beer, but I thought he was joking cause I'm pretty obviously not of age lol. But I go to get a refill on my soda and apparently he actually bought my parents a beer so uh, thanks I guess sir. He turns around to thank us again and it was at this moment my life changed forever. 

He turns to me, and he says: *"THIS IS MY N WORD RIGHT HERE"*

It was magical. I hadn't quite realized what had happened until a minute later. I had the pass! I felt so God damn powerful. The best of both worlds, the power only few have had the fortunate opportunity to experience. It was a feeling beyond fathoming- as if I could feel myself drawing power from all the fellow N words near me, despite my difference. I could FINALLY say the N Word.

So yeah, I guess I have the pass now. Thanks for coming to my ted talk!
