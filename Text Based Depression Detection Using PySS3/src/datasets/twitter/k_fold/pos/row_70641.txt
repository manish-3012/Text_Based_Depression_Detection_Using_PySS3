Iâ€™ve made a break through in the Shrek fandom So to cut to the chase I figured out how much of donkeys sperm is needed in order to have a chance at impregnating donkey. So I came to the conclusion I did the math donâ€™t ask for proof cuz there are a lot of numbers but I can to the conclusion that they would need 7-8, 2liter sized soda bottles filled with donkeys sperm. And not only that they would of have to have impregnating technology during that era of Shrek and technology to preserve sperm, I say this because they would of been able to get her pregnant and preserve the sperm other then them having that. So I think I made a break through in science if you think I am wrong please tell me why
