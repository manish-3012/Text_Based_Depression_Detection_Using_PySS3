How do I tell if people want to be my friend or if theyâ€™re just being nice? Iâ€™m trying to get closer to the people my age at my youth group but idk if they are just being nice. Weâ€™ve shared laughs and hung out at church events, but Iâ€™ve also seen them do those exact things with other people but the talk behind their backs saying stuff like â€œcanâ€™t u see Iâ€™m just being nice ? , I donâ€™t want to be ur friend.â€ How can I tell that theyâ€™re not doing that to me?
