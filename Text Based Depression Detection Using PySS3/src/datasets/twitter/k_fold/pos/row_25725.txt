Question about flirting So I saw a post about non-consensual advances and it seemed like the way they described them was â€œany conversation that would lead to a romantic relationshipâ€. It goes on to say things like â€œany comment on the physical appearance, personality, or demeanor of the personâ€. I always want to be respectful so should I just not talk to girls except platonically?
