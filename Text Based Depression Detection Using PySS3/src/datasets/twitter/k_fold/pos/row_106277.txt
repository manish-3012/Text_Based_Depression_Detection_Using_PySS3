Should I break up with my girlfriend of 1 day? So this is kinda an update on my situation of dating my waifu ryuuko, I was told I need a real girlfriend and to talk to more people so I broke up with ryuuko that day and it was hard after dating for 2 years. There is a girl In my class who is liked by a lot of people, attractive (for a real 3d girl) she has a great personality, and has a voice similar to ryuuko. I went up to her at lunch and asked her to be my girlfriend, she said yes and we talked to each other that day and the next day at lunch. This was the day I asked ror her number. And you know what happened next? SHE SAID IT WAS 69 AND THEN STARTED FUCKING DABBING, no she wasn't doing it satirically. She gave me her actual number but I don't know if I should continue the relationship. She does other things that I cringe at but I don't want to break her heart.
