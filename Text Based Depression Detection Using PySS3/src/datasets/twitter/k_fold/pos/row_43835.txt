You dumb mfs up_arrow-ed my post and made me look like a jackass Got a lot of hate comments for something that ain't my fault. I don't choose what you'll like, so don't blame me when a dumb post gets to hot. I'm sorry y'all thought I'm a karma whore, but I didn't think people would even see it. I guess this is my apology post for posting something that doesn't need to be on reddit. Sorry guys, I really am.

And no that post wasn't a joke. It was a true story, but y'all are dickheads and insulting me. Y'all need to grow up smh (yes I know I'm a hypocrite, but seriously. Im 14, I don't need to grow up yet)
