I just... really need to vent. I feel wrong about everything I do. Thereâ€™s all these â€œwhat ifâ€™sâ€ and possibilities and Iâ€™m so fucking stupid and I always think the best is never enough but I canâ€™t even reach halfway to the best option and it hurts and I just feel guilty about how it couldâ€™ve hurt others and how me caring about myself is making everything worse and it all sucks Iâ€™m sorry if you read this Iâ€™m so sorry Iâ€™m just done with this shit
