she makes me want to die That wicked woman.My aunt.She says nothing but insults to me,every morning she yells at me to wake up,tells me to do all the chores around the house,I get that,but she doesnt do that to my other siblings just because they're guys and they dont need to do it cuz girls are supposed to do all the work in the house and I fucking hate that.

Right,ik that isnt that much to hate her about it.Okay hear me out she calls me stupid,dumb,incompetent,lazy,slow,incapable,and she looks at me like I'm trash,she fucking hates my guts!I didnt ask to be born as your fucking niece I wish I was never related to her...she makes me want to commit suicide,every time I see her I want to gauge out my eyeballs and literally run off and run away from this horrible place,I hate living under the same roof as her,I wanna fucking die she makes me so miserable,I utterly despise her.

I try so fucking hard to make things work and she just says all the negative things to me and she hates me so much.Does it make sense that complete strangers care about me much more than my own family?She makes me so depressed.Im literally still hanging on and she makes everything worse.I despise her.

I cant say that I want her to die since that would be cruel but I wish to disappear,I wish to be away from her,I dont want anything to do with her.She's so abusive..she's been like this to me since I was 11 and she never does it to my brothers obv she favours them over me.When I was around 12 she barged into my room and started screaming so loud and threw the things on my table at me and she repeatedly slapped me on the arm and pulled on my ears.

I bore with it.I gritted my teeth with tears in my eyes bcs if I ever said smtg back she would tell me its rude and DISRESPECTFUL.

She's old and apparently she has a weak immune body or smtg and she always victimises herself saying things like 'oh so you want me to do the chores around the house?what am I to you?A lowly maid?' And she has the most annoying voice ever tell you,I'm not even exaggerating.She's so loud she has horrible big eyes that glare at me even when I did nothing wrong.

She always finds something to blame me for she always finds a way to make me sad and mad she just cant leave me alone and I hate that.I wanna be away from her but that's not possible.

Do you know how it feels to be called stupid every day?It makes me feel like shit.It makes me feel worthless.
