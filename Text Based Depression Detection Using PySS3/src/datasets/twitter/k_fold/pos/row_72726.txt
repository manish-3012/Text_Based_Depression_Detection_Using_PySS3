I broke up with my GF, I donâ€™t know if I regret it.. I was in a online relationship with a girl. She was sweet and kind at first but over time she had bursts of anger at me. However I didnâ€™t blame her as she had several mental health problems. These health problems slowly made me think I was responsible if anything bad happened to her. I kept thinking I had to help her or something would go wrong. I canâ€™t deny I enjoyed spending time with her and it really filled me with joy but stress over exams and the constant need to have to talk with her and spend time on my exams was too much. I said farewell to her saying to take care but I still felt as if I was an asshole for doing it. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this.. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s me venting or me just writing to take my mind off it and think more positively. All I can say is that. I canâ€™t reverse it.
