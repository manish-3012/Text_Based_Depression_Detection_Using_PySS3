Does anyone else think it's funny when people add "filler filler filler?" Like, they'd be talking something serious as shit then have to do fillers.

"My pet died, I've had him for 14 years

filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler"

Remind me of this clip for some reason, https://youtu.be/1Za8BtLgKv8?t=362

Why? &gt;!because Kevin has to slowly close the window after screaming at someone, kinda like the filler!&lt;
