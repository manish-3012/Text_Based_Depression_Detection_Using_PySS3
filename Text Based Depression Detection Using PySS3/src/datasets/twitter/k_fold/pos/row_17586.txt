Struggling to sleep, wrote a short poem to help keep my mind away from existential dread and all that I feel the harsh touch of the wind,

As it throws me left and right,

I'm dancing out of time,

Running from the growth of grime

I've been stuck in this frenzy,

All fucking night



Not sure it makes sense but it kept me from my head for a while
