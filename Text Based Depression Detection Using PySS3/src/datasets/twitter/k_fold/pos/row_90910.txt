I need a friends or at least a life Hi strangers on the internet! Does anyone else get really depressed at night. I donâ€™t know why but I always get really sad at night and my heart kinda just aches.

I only have really one person to rant to and donâ€™t want to bother them cuz I feel bad so I decided to rant to some random people.

I have really bad trust issues because Iâ€™ve been betray by many of my ex friends and cheated on by my ex girlfriend (by the way Iâ€™m only 13). Plus I try to trust my parents but they always expose me to some of my â€œfriendsâ€ parents.

I also get my fun for my height and weight and Iâ€™m very insecure about that since Iâ€™m literally 7 inches taller then the average height for my age and 20 pounds light. I try to avoid people except for my small group of friends on my swim team for that reason.

Also follow up on my girlfriend cheating on me, she made out with another guy that I thought was one of my friends at a party AND cheated on me with a different boy when I had my phone taken away for a month.

I often get made fun of for that but some girls actually trust me and talk to me about there problems but itâ€™s most likely only because they know I have no one to tell.

If anyone has any advice that would be great! Thank you.
