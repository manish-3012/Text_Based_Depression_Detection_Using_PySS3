I think my "friends" are toxic. Hi, I have this so-called "friends" for over 6-7 years I think? Back then, I don't excel pretty much on almost everything because I'm too shy to express myself. And then I started to fix myself by building up my confidence and have a major glow up with my appearance and I want to be more matured and focused more on my studies. I now excel in almost everything especially in class. I thought they'll support me, but they don't. When I started gaining confidence, they always say mean stuffs to me about being having it. And when I started wearing things that matches my aesthetic, they called me trying hard. They also made me feel bad about my appearance, by calling me fat, ugly, etc. Eventhough my weight are perfect for my age and height. So, I started to starve myself for days so I can be extremely thin. I really don't understand them. 
( I feel like they don't want me to change at all, because they're used to the loser version of me. )
