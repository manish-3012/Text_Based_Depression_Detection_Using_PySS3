How to make buses STOP tl;dr a rant more than a question

Hello there fellow people of the internet. In the past two days Iâ€™ve been coming back from school in the following way:

walking five minutes to the bus stop

*waiting for the bus to arrive*

getting off the bus

walking five minutes home

Woah-uh! Itâ€™s not that simple. Three buses continued driving past me while I was waiting. Every time I see the bus I need approaching I stand close to the road and wait, but they just continue, beep and point backwards (?) or let the person in-front of me get on the bus and close the door. Am I doing something wrong? Last time I waited 50 minutes in 36 degrees weather and entered the bus soaking wet (sorry).
