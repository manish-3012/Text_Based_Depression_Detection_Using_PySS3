Kids are such a snowflakes these days I talk about 8 yo kids. I learnd everything on hard way. We use to play football in summer and when older guys come, we need to move because they would kick our ball 200 meaters away and we 2-3 hours to play. But now when I am older and we come at 7(we can't go earlier because outside is like 35Â°C in summer and we watch younger siblings) and they don't want to move, they say some really bad and racist words to us, so when I kicked the ball kid called their father. I could talk to him like "Sir, we can make a deal" but he SPITTED on me and slapped a ball out my hands and said "Piss of n****" (I am white so it is wierd) and he after called the COPS. They said just to be calm and countiniue somewhere  else or play with them. So we littelary played 2 games on same time in the same spot. We were hutting ball to the goal (not aiming at the kids) at max powr so after 15 minutes they moved away.
I will never forget this  and how kids now are such a snowflakes.
