My math skills are even worse than I thought. Sorry for any grammatical errors or anything like that. English isnâ€™t my first language and Iâ€™m writing on phone.

So I saw a meme something about â€œthings that canâ€™t be calculatedâ€ or something and X devided by 0 was one of them. So I decided to try to figure out the answer so I did some math and was proud of my self to actually do some advanced math or something and I was proud for once. Decided to share my new found knowledge to my friends and my family. Turns out Iâ€™m an even bigger disappointment than I thought. Ty for reading.

TLDR: did math found out Iâ€™m more stupid than I thought.

Iâ€™m usually a lurker and I never post so please if I have done anything wrong here please tell me so I can fix it.
