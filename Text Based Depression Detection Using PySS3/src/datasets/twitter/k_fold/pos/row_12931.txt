Honestly im done with everything. I just watched [this](https://youtu.be/TOEOKc_q4e8) video and.... just wow. I'm honestly done. Just everything in this video is just crazy. I don't feel safe anymore. What is this? What is the point of anything.

Just. I can't everything from the lies to how she really died, and the tone of Walker in the calls just baffles me. And, trying my best to not type with all caps but. "She's done."

She's Done... SHEs Don- SHES DONE!?!? WHAT KIND OF FUCKIN LINE IS THAT??! SHES DONE??? LIKE SOMEKIND OF DEAD PHON- "oop welp my phone died. its don-" WHAT THE HELL. LIKE SHE WASN'T A HUMAN TO THEM. I can't just NO. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT SOME ONE DEAD.

And the fact. The god damn fact about the cops going to the wrong person. They were looking for her Ex boyfriend. HER EX GOD DAMN BOYFRIEND. HOW DUMB ARE THESE COPS THINKING THAT HER EX WAS STILL WITH HER!?!? AND WHY THE HELL DID THEY ARREST WALKER FOR ONE SHOT WHEN THEY SHOT 32 TIMES. 32 **GOD. DAMN. TIMES.** THEY DIDN'T EVEN SAY "WE ARE THE POLICE" THEY KNOCKED, STAYED SILENT, AND BARGED IN THE HOUSE LIKE WHY. AND THEY SAID "THATS UNFORTUNATE" WHEN KENNY SAID IM OK. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THIS A MISSION?!??! 

They had no drugs, nothing to hide. The cops were just trigger happy.

I swear to the god damn devil. If one of yall racists or trump supporters, come on MY post and say some bullshit. I'm going to stick a jack hammer so far up your asses, you will only sound like a broken motorcycle for the rest of your life.

I'm really startin to hate this country with a passion equal to loving my mother.

fuck this.
