Yup. I finally turned 20. Itâ€™s been a wild ride. When I was younger I thought being in my 20s would mean so much more responsibility and stress. And I thought Iâ€™d have all the money in the world, because the moment I get a bank card, I can withdraw as much money as I want.

Anyway, now that Iâ€™m actually 20, Iâ€™m slowly realising how different it is from my childhood expectations.

I like it though. I donâ€™t feel any different than I did yesterday. 

Anyway, I think Iâ€™ll still lurk around on here. I spend quite a bit of my later teen years scrolling through this subreddit. And I wanna hang around a little more till I turn into an annoying old lady.

Is there an old person flair on here?
