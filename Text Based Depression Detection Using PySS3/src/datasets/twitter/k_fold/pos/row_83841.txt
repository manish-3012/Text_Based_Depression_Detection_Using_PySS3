I canâ€™t calm down I finally told my crush that I like her, and she said she likes me too! She said she doesnâ€™t wanna go super fast with the relationship, which is fine with me. Weâ€™re gonna hang out on Sunday and my heart is racing so fast. Iâ€™m really anxious though. Iâ€™ve never done this, and Iâ€™m scared of all the ways I can mess up. I feel like maybe I was too fast in telling her I like her. I donâ€™t wanna psyche myself out, but I feel like Iâ€™m overthinking this so much. Iâ€™m so nervous.
