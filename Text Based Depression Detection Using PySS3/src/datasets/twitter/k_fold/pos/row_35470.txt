My boyfriend didnâ€™t talk to me while he cried and it just hurt me a ton He had a really bad headache and passed out because of it and woke up and started crying but he didnâ€™t talk to me and he said he didnâ€™t talk to me because he was crying so much he couldnâ€™t see his phone and it just made me feel like Iâ€™m not good enough, he normally always talks to me even when he gets the tiniest bit sad
