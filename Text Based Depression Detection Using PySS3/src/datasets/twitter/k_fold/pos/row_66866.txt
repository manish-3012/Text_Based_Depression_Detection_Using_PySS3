What stuff do you guys usually listen to and what have you listened to in quarantine? (M13 because this sub can be weird and I like my inbox) Just kinda curious what you guys enjoy. First post here too so this might be fun idk.

I discovered TPAB which is sick and everyone should at least listen to it once, Fiona Appleâ€™s Fetch the Bolt Cutters is a great alternative album with feminist themes, Swansâ€™ To Be Kind is long and I sound like fantano what am I doing, Parklife by Blur is singlehandedly the bests British album of all time and might just be on a completely different tier to everything idk just give it a listen, Lofi Hip Hop Chilledcow thing basically every day, Lonerism by Tame Impala is great for self isolation and is all about living out of touch with society and Iâ€™d recommend it to anyone who likes 60â€™s Psychedelic stuff and listened to The Less I Know The Better once and Drunk by Thundercat is like TPAB with no rap but the bass lines kick too hard like Flying Lotusâ€™ Youâ€™re Dead which I think might be the last one I talk about because itâ€™s too long dammit but itâ€™s fast drum and bass stuff with jazz and Thundercat.

So go on, what music do you enjoy?
