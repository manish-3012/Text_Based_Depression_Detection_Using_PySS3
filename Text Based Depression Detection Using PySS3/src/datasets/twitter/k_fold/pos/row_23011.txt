I'm not sure who needs to hear this, but... I love you. You may not believe me but I do. So do many others. It's okay. I'm here for you. If you ever need anything, tell me. Rant. Complain. Scream. Whatever you need to do to feel better. I'm here. 

Life has ups and downs, similar to a rollercoaster. You may be scared, and it may not be the best, but you'll look back and realize it wasn't such a bad time after all. Things get better. They always will, no matter how low you may feel. 

It's going to be okay. I promise you. Talk to me if you have nothing else. I'll be something for you to keep going. I'm here for you. 

(This was mostly for me to read to myself as if someone said it to me... I needed it. I am this person. Sorry.)
