why, teachers? why will you give me a deadline for tomorrow, make me go to sleep at 2 in the morning, then give 15 other kids an extension? do teachers find joy in trying to kill their students? yesterday I had this one assignment I needed to score really well on, so i worked on it, checked it based on the list of things we needed to include, worked again, repeated. i think i spent two hours on it.

guess what? at least 15 kids in my class received *extensions* because they were 'busy.' hello. i have a nation-wide exam coming up on the 18th, a science test that will count for 20 per-cent of my grade and a two page long essay on *monologues* coming up. if i can finish something in a deadline, so can you.
