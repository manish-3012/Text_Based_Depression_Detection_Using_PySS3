I live in some cringe love comedie I have a crash. And she likes my best friend (let's call him D) and D is bi and he is looking for a boyfriend (I do think so from what I heard). And D is trying to make my crash like me but she doesn't. I tried to take her out 3 time 3 time I failed. 
I know that she is a lesbian but and going with me never will work out but I will do like to spend some time with her .

I didn't know that she was a lesbian what I ask her out.

Edit:she's bi not lesbian just released my mistake
