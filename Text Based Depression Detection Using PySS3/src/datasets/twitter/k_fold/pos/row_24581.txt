I donâ€™t know if this is a shared sentiment, but I really wanna have kids. Iâ€™m a 16 year old dude, and Iâ€™ve always thought it would be an awesome experience to have kids. Iâ€™ve never had the thought that I hated kids and never wanted to have any. Iâ€™ve always had that thought in my mind. What do you people think?
