Advice please! There is this really pretty girl that I have in almost all of my classes. We have the exact same taste in music and sometimes go out skating(with others in our friend group). We text all the time, but I have only known her since the begging of the school year. She broke up with her bf 2 weeks ago for reasons I donâ€™t know why. What should I do. Please help.
