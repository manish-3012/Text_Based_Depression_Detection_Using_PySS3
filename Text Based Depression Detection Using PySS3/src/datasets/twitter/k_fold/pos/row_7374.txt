I thought my family wealth was from my dad's business. Actual turns out my dad had a gambling addiction but he had mad poker skills and made like $20M. My mother convinced him to get help before he lost it. He did. They bought a nice house and started a business with the money. They invested some too. And everything panned out so addiction is the reason my family is worth $100M.
