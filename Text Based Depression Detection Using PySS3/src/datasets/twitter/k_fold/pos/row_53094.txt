Im so happy I've been really depressed lately, and I didn't feel comfortable telling my therapist what was wrong. She said if it made me feel better, I could talk to my friends. I told them how sad I've been lately and they said they care about me and will always be there for me, and I'm just so glad to have amazing people in my life. I know that everything is going to be alright.
