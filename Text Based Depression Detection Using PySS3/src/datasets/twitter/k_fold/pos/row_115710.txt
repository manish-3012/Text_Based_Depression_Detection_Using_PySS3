My mom wont get my little brother the covid 19 vaccination My mom (step mom to be exact) said that my little brother will not get the covid 19 vaccination because in her own words â€œit will give him AUTISMâ€ what do I do, I donâ€™t want my little brother to infect millions and die, and since she isnâ€™t my real mother she said that I can get a shot with a tracker and die if I want but your brother isnâ€™t.
