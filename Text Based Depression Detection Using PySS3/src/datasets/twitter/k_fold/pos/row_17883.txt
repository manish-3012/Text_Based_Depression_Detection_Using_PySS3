I could really use some support This past year has not really been great for me. Not because of obvious reasons, but because of my parents situation. 

In March of 2019 I started getting suspicions that my dad was cheating on my mom, come October it turns out I was right. They stayed up all night arguing for months and when that finally stopped they announced they were getting divorced. 

Now I'm in two houses, bouncing back and forth. My mom got custody and my dad gets visitation, at first I was upset by this because I loved my dad more by a long shot, but now after a while he's proven to be unreliable, bad a keeping things clean and just not a great person in general. I get the same pizza every Wednesday/ Thursday plus every other weekend. I don't have a real mattress to use, so I've been sleeping on an air mattress.

We haven't had wifi for weeks because he won't fix it, he got rid of our refrigerator for some reason. Our. Fucking. Fridge. We don't have food there, and to make matters worse he started smoking cigars so the place reeks. 

To top it all off, my mom won't get a job so we have no money. And when they argue they make me feel like I need to take a side, and this whole thing hasn't been great for my mental health. Just in the past weeks I've had thoughts of suicide stay in my head for hours at a time. And my family doesn't really let me open up about it because I'm supposed to be the big strong man of the house. (I'm 6'4 and the oldest male out of 5 children, plus I'm only 15.)

This is the only place I have left to open up. If you've made it this far, I thank you. I really need some support, you don't have to do anything, but if you can let me know you care I would really appreciate that.

Thank you.
