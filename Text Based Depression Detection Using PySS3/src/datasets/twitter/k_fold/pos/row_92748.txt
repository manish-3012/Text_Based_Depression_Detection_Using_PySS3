Im mad cus im a sensitive lil turd So I was molested by a girl classmate when I was in primary school and I finally built up the courage to tell my current best friend(f14) what happened through whatsapp and she said "why didnt you tell me" then an angry sticker of some stickman doing giving me the finger. 

I overreacted/overthough and thought she was genuinely mad with me and I said "i tell you about the time I got molested and you get mad at me?" And ignored her texts for a day.

I came back after that one day and she explained that she wasnt mad and she just liked the sticker(she likes to mess around and spam it from time to time) and it was bad timing. I apologised for overreacting, I get emotional pretty easily and now I feel like a dumbass
