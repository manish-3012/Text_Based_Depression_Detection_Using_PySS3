Does anyone else's parents have extreme mood swings when talking about school So I submitted something, but not the exact way the teacher wanted it. So then she proceeds to claim that during the time that im working that I'm actually playing video games, I'm pretty sure she heard me listening to music and thought that was me playing games. Now she's telling me I have to do whatever I have to do next week every day. And she keeps changing the punishment, first it was no video games til 6, then it was no games ever, then it was none tonight, now it's redo that one assignment then you can play (note literally 1 minute before that one was say i should go to bed right after I'm done)

Sorry about the rant, had to get it off my chest
