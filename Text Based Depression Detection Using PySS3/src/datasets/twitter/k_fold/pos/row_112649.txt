Tricking Your Brain Into Forgetting More Than You Bargained For 
Is this possible. Iâ€™ll keep this post short and sweet. 

I used to worry a lot. Way more than average.

Thinking back, whenever my friends would talk about something I wouldnâ€™t want to bring up/talk about, seeing that saying I didnâ€™t want to talk about that thing did not work, I would lie and say I forgot. It worked for a while.

Iâ€™ve tricked myself into forgetting things I didnâ€™t want to remember. This worked.

Now, a little over a year later, Iâ€™m forgetting things I shouldnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve completely forgotten about people I went to school with for years. Mind you, this was just an conversation.

What did I do? I donâ€™t think this is normal.

My friend start talking about a person named ####. I had no recollection of this person. Apparently, Iâ€™ve went to school with her since fourth grade. What the hell?

Iâ€™m not joking. If I was, this would be a shit joke. Mind you, that was just an example.
