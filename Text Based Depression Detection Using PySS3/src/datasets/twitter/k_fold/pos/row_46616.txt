I feel old...ish I'm 17 and turn 18 in October and seeing anyone under 15 makes me feel old somehow. Its weird walking around in highschool and seeing kids who still have 4 years left there and then there's me, who leaves next year... its not even that big of an age gap and yet I feel old as hell. anyone else?
