I got suspended from the bus for a week and canâ€™t go to school now So my bus driver claims I wasnâ€™t wearing my seatbelt when there was really no way he could see my waist while driving. So instead of talking to me he immediately calls my dad and tells my dad Iâ€™m suspended for a week. Now I get home not noting this happened and my dad goes â€œCanâ€™t go to school without getting in trouble.â€ I go â€œWhat?â€ He goes â€œYou canâ€™t wear your seatbelt on the bus so now your suspended from the bus for a week and canâ€™t go to school.â€ He then proceeds to beat the living hell out of me. My neck and back hurt like hell now. I really hate this house.
