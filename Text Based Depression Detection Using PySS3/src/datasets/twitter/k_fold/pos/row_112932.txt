Is there anyone who isnâ€™t depressed? Like all my homies depressed as fuck. Yeah just is there anyone out there who donâ€™t want to die? Or just mentally ill in some way. I know so many ppl who have eating disorders or depression or anxiety just yeah. 

Like just yeah I donâ€™t understand how other ppl be fine. Like I know I act fine fine around ppl but when Iâ€™m alone time to hurt myself and cry.

So is everyone just putting on fine act or are there actual ppl who are fine? If u a fine person how tf are u fine how are u not sad and depressed and hate urself like the rest of us??
