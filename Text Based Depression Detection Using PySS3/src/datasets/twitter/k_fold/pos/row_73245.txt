totally awesome and poggers survey ok second times a charm!! didnt realize my original post title wasnt s p i c y enough.

im an ib psychology sudent in my junior year of high school and its that time of year where we need to do a super boring survey for a grade. this ones about the reliance of social media and connecting with others through technology. its super quick, probably like two minutes max, so if you could just [take this survey](https://forms.gle/nvGuVBzk2CkKySFU6) pretty please id be over the moon :) 
the only thing i ask you to not do is share your age in the free response, for the sake and sanity of my poor little soul. thank you so much :)!!
