I had fever and was forced to go to school I have a fever with a temperature of around 37.5 degrees and instead of my parents saying "Visit the clinic tmr", they told me to take painkillers. I also had a nosebleed in school

having strict Asian parents sucks


Is there anybody with strict parents out here?
