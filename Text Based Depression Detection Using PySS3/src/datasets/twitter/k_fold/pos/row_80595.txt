My parents are pressuring me to go to a college that doesnâ€™t even offer what I wanna major in Both my dad and my brother went to the same college, and now my parents are pressuring me to go to the same one (both because they did and because my dads job makes it cheaper for us).

However, I wanna major in mechanical engineering and minor in computer science, and maybe take some courses in computer engineering if I have the opportunity.

The college does not offer mechanical engineering - the thing I wanna take the most. And yet my parents insist I should still go and my moms like â€œif you pester them enough about the course theyâ€™ll have to add it inâ€.

What the fuck?!
