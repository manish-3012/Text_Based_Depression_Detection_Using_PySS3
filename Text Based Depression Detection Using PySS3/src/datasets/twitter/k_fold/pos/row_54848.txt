I canâ€™t tell if I have a sugar sensitivity or if I just over do it on sugar? Like, today I had a lot of sugar, especially when I drank a medium coke PLUS a chocolate bar which is over like 115g of sugar counting carbs 

Now I feel gross?? 

It must be my diet right? Because it really isnâ€™t very healthy??

I just am worried Iâ€™m like allergic to carbs or smth 

Iâ€™m fine with milk so itâ€™s not lactose
