And proud of myself for being responsible Almost every day i sleep in and ignore online classes because im too tired to deal with anything, but today i got a good sleep, woke up at 6:30, (school starts at 7:15)had breakfast, and im on a morning walk right now. It may seem small to you but its big to me.
