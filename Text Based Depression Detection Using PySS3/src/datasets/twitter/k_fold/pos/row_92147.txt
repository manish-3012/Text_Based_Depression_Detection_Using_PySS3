Parent help Hey guys, teen here suffering from ADHD. I was wondering how to comfront your parents about it, when they donâ€™t believe it exists. We got me medically tested a while back and since then, my parents refuse to give me medication and they tell me â€œItâ€™s not a real problemâ€ And itâ€™s starting to make me feel like a garbage pile. Any help is appreciated
