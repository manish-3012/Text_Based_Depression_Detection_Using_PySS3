The funniest (and maybe messed up) thing my school has done To set the tone, my school has a yearbook and they are selling it for about $60 dollars. Which to some kids is a ton of money. So in order to pester kids into buying it, they write on concrete using chalk, put posters up in hallways, and one of them even had dreamâ€™s face drawn on it with â€œDream asked you to buy a yearbook! AMOUNT yearbooks left!â€ The problem was so bad that the school took down some of the posters and washed the concrete every month.
