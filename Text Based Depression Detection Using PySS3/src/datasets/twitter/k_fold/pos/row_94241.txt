I managed to get an arcade machine shut down At an arcade I was at there was a crossy road game so I decided to try it because I've played the game a bunch. You only had to score 50 to win 750 tickets, and I got the jackpot 3 times. They ended up turning it off after the third jackpot because apparently the machine wasn't meant to print that many tickets even though it was advertised on the actual machine. I do feel bad though because now others can't play the game until they make it harder to win the jackpot.
