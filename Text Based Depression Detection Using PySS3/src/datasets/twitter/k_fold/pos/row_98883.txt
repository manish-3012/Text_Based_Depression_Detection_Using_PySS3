My friends just said black people cant vote for Trump So Iâ€™m in group chat with a bunch of my female friends (guy btw) and I text them saying 50 Centâ€™s ex girlfriend said he canâ€™t voy for Trump since heâ€™s black. And LO AND FUCKING BEHOLD, THEY AGREED WITH HER. And I think itâ€™s so fucking stupid that they support BLM and think black propane should have their own voice, but they tell a black man to vote for someone, and therefore not giving them what you want them to have. I lost so many fucking brain cells during this conversation.
