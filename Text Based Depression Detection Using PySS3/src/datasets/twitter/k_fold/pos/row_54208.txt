How often do ur parents text u? just curious. I know I'm about to sound like a brat, but I hate when my dad texts me every single day. It's usually to say hello or ask how I am, which I appreciate, but jesus christ I hate texting the same person everyday. My mom never texts me like that. She never texts me everyday and I love that. The only time she texts me is if it's past 11pm and I still hadn't come home yet. 

If I sound like a brat to my dad, please let me know so I can correct this.
