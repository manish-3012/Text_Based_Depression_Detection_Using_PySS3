So... Bit of a red flag in a friendship. Iâ€™ve been friends with my neighbor for years now. Was pretty great. Today he sent me a long message saying I was being aggravating, disappointing, saying I was going to ruin my ability to be happy about things, and that I was emotionally immature.

... Because I didnâ€™t want to learn how to ride a bike.
