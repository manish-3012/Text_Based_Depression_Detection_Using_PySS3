Hi guys,i just needed to say this. So,i got an anxiety attack. It was the first time that i had anxiety or better say,an anxiety attack. The doctor told me that it's a phase that everybody has to go through when he\she is a teenager. I got better but that thing hit again after one month. I would cry and overthink. But i managed to get better by going out or visiting my cousins. I really feel proud because now i feel better and i have changed my routine in order to not get an anxiety attack again(i know it is a part of our lives).
Anyway guys,i am feeling better and i really hope you are doing great out there.
(You can give an advice if you want)
