I'm not sure if I was rejected or not So I've liked this girl in my class for quite some time and we get along great. I confessed to her today and she said that she had felt bad for me. She elaborated on it by saying that she feels bad for people that like her. 
[Extra Information] After that I comforted her because she said that she felt that she wasnt worthy of being liked. She responded with this statement, reflecting on her previous relationships, "For the people I did like back, it always ended up in a shitty relationship." 
So yeah, any insight would be useful. If you have any questions that arent too personal, I'll gladly answer.
