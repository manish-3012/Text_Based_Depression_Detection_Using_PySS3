This girl and shes special to me Sheâ€™s actually my best friend, lets say i kinda like her. We arent in a relationship cus she thinks shes too young for it now.

So i know her for 4 years now cus of school, me and her were in the same class for 3 years but didnt see eachother much outside of school since we live pretty far away from eachother. She went to a different class since her grades couldnt keep up.

That means that she graduates 1 year earlier than me and we dont see eachother that much anymore...

Even tho this makes it pretty hard we promised eachother to never let go of eachother no matter what happens and stay in contact after graduating. We dont see eachother now but we make the best of it, like texting everyday.

Yes i see it, we are very close but i wont ask her to be my gf. Its fine like this too now but a relationship i wouldnt mind because thats awesome. Shes very kind to me and character wise shes just like me but then a girl.
