okay so earlier at parents teacher conference so like i was busy being roasted the shit out by my teachers yeh

my ex is in the same school, his mom is the head of admissions in the school

his mom walks past my mom and they were like â€œheyyy!â€ and i was like *how do they know each other* and his mom sits down right next to my mom and they start talking and me and my ex just kinda stared at each other in shock :) and his mom asks â€œhey have you met my son *exâ€™s name*â€ and i was like 0_0 and walked away like it felt so weird for my mom to meet my exâ€™s mom today has been weird as fuck
