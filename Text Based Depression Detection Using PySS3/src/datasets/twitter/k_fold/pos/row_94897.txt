This sub is fucking toxic So, you may or may not have seen my post about the betta fish I had recently gotten. I would first like to point out that I know what I'm doing. I have taken care of bettas before, and they lived for a long time. I got many comments saying that I was abusing the fish, and mainly that I need to get a bigger and better tank. The tank that I have is made specifically for bettas. People told me to put a heater and filter in my tank, and I have those things. They are behind the backdrop that came with it. No one seemed to consider that I *didn't show the whole tank*. I understand that some people wanted to help me, and I am grateful for that. But most people just went right to: "oh, I can't see proper equipment, this guy is abusing and hurting this fish." 

In conclusion, thank you to the people who left positive comments, and the people who just wanted to kindly help me. And to the people who I mentioned earlier, the people who just assumed I was taking bad care of it only going off of what I showed in the video, maybe don't judge a book by its cover next time.
