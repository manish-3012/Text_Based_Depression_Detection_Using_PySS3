A post about my spoiled classmate Et demands my chair after she broke ten.
Cast: 
Et: entitled teen
C1 :classmate1
C2 you get it
Cm class master
Ed you get it
Backstory: Et is a spoiled kid that she always treatens with suing you. If you touch her it calls assault, you get the idea. Also, she has 98 kilos and she is 14 and after every class calls her Ed to report. Ed is a dad that spoiles her kid with the maximum.
I was a good day in the 8th grade.i was joking with my friend. I sit in front of Et.  First class was ok, I got a ten at Geography . But in the break it was not so good. Et comes to me ( i was sitting in the other side of the room ) and got my chair. 
I said: 
Me: what are you doing?
She was in silence 
I asked again. No answer.
Me and C1 goes to her and put my hand on my chair.
She screams: WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU LITTLE S**T!
 Me: Oh, i was just getting my stuff back. 
My parent told me to stay calm in these situations so to crash their system even harder.
Me , C1 and C2 get the chair and put it back. 
Oh boy! I was not done yet.
The next day i had class with Cm. 
Et says what i hat done but in a hyperbolic touch. The witnesses, the rest 30 kids that are in my class say it is not true what said Et and give the truth. (Ed called everyday at 6 oâ€™clock in the morning to complain about minor things that happened in the classroom and classes to Cm). Cm came  with a great idea. Me and Cm put a number on the chair to identify them. 
PS: about the other 10 chairs. She broke one in a couple of weeks but she stayed after classes to switch them. 
Sorry for the bad narrating. I am not  from an English speaking country and i am not good at languages.
