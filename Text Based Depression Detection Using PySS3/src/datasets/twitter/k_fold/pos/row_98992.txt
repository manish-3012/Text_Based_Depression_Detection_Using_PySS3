I got rejected by my ex-crush about a year ago, and we played a round of Among Us yesterday when she didn't even know that I was in the lobby with her. I was the Impostor and won the game for the first round...

...and she was the first player to be murdered by me. Best part was that she left afterwards immediately.

Get fucked, Jenna!
