anyone else hate something that their body does that they canâ€™t do shit about? (no periods, random boners, genitals, or stuff like that.) For me, I hate the taste/smell of spit. not taste like that days lunch just the kinda mucessy taste/smell. you canâ€™t really taste it in your mouth but when making out with someone thatâ€™s mostly what I taste. anyone else have the same feeling about something generated by there body that they canâ€™t do shit about so they deal with it? (Again, No genitals, periods, random boners, nothing like that)
