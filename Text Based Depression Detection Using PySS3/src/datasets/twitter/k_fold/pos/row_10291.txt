How do you deal with the inevitable loss of a pet? I just found out today that my cat has kidney disease and they don't know how long he will live, he doesn't seem to be in bad shape yet and most sites say cats will live at least 1.5 years after being diagnosed but my mom and the vet kept saying the word weeks instead of months and I don't know how to or if I can handle this. just, fuck this sucks and i want him to be okay   
Any advice or anything that will let me know what to expect will be appreciated
