am i in the wrong in this situation? But the people I was working with were just standing around most of the time... They left the cart of dough out in the kitchen while they were all messing around in the office. Half the time one of them was on the shitter. When he wasnâ€™t, he was just talking to his friend. He also took a 25 minute break and constantly eats the toppings right out of the containers that we use... 

I donâ€™t think I meant for it to come out that way. 

It was just upsetting seeing all of them hardly get their work done, and by the end of the night I was just tired I guess.

Am I in the wrong?
