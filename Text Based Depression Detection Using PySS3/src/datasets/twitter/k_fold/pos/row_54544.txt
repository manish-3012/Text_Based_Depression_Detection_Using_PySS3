I think about Death every day Iâ€™m not suicidal, actually quite the opposite. Iâ€™m *terrified* of death and constantly think about how short life actually is. Iâ€™m 15 and it feels like time just flied, in another 15 years Iâ€™ll be 30. That scares me, I donâ€™t want to get old and die. I feel like Iâ€™ll be forgotten, Iâ€™ll make no difference in the world. Sometimes I get little moments of hyper awareness that make me realize how fragile we actually are and that we could die at any moment. Does anyone else feel this way?
