Do you hate your birthday? I ask this because over the years i myself dreading my birthday. I live in a poor area and situation. We live paycheck to paycheck way before covid what makes it worse is that no one can leave or we all get evicited. For yhe past two years two of my family members can't stand each other. Passive aggressive remarks run rampant, everytime all 5 of us get together they always fight and it always ends in a threat to leave. It sucks more now because of covid. Because back then we would be worried if one of them did go but leaving now, is sure death if they get covid. And i know we all care for each other but lately ive been about thinking what is best for me. I feel im at a crossroads. Stuck from choosing my family or whats best for me.
