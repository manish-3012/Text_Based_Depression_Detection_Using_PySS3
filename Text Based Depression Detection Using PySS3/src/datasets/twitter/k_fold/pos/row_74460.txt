I'm in tears I've had some bad mood swings lately and have been self riotous. I realised this on my drive into practice today. My dad and I had a few argument and I said some bad things. I thought our relationship was gonna go to shit but we sat down and talked and this is what we said 
Me, "I've been out of place lately and I'm sorry"
Dad, "I forgive you"
I held his hand for a bit than we hugged and I cried and cried because he forgave me. I'm thankful for the family I've been blessed. I bless all of you. Thank for taking your time to read this, I love all of you on this sub as long as your a teen.
