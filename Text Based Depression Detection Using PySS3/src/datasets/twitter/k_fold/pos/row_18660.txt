The gender competition Lately on this sub Iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of people complain about how hard it is to be boy and how easy it is to be a girl and people complain about how hard it is to be a girl and how easy boys have it.

I know itâ€™s hard to grasp, but both genders have it bad, and putting each other wonâ€™t help that. Making a competition out of it is what kids do in the 3rd grade. 

Doing this broadens the gap of being able to understand each other instead of making it smaller. Complaining about these things on reddit and telling each other how unfair it is, wonâ€™t change the issue. Take action, instead of making it such a pointless competition.
