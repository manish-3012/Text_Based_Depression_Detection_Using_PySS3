The downvote button should only be used if a comment on post does not contribute to the discussion, not when someone disagrees with anotherâ€™s opinion. I understand that a lot of people donâ€™t care about internet points but they can be used when giving advice etc. I personally find myself holding back my opinions on Reddit due to the fact that I could lose karma if people donâ€™t agree with it.
