Everyone make sure to give Robinhood one star on the appstore. This is absolutely fucking ridiculous. I havenâ€™t gotten too much into this but what I do know is that poor people started making money and the rich people whined about it and then Robinhood whined about it so they made it so poor people canâ€™t make money anymore. Apparently only the billionaires are allowed to make money now. Please, please give the Robinhood app 1 star.
