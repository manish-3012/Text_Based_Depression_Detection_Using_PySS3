Hey guys. I recommend leaving all negative subs. I had a fairly balanced homepage between positive subs (r/aww, r/thurstonwaffles, etc) and negatives (r/insaneparentstories, r/entitledparents, etc).
I notice that my mental health hasnâ€™t been doing so good recently so I decided to just leave the negative ones and join a lot more positive subs. I already tell that when Iâ€™m scrolling on here, I just feel more positive. I recommend you guys do the same. Stay safe, everyone.
