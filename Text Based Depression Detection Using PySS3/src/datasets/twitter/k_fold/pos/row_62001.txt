Iâ€™m thinking of joining the Canadian Military when I can Ok first, donâ€™t get mad, itâ€™s just a thought, anyways, i want to join the military as a rifleman in the infantry, I like the bond that forms between people who suffer through the same thing, I do love the feeling of adrenaline and survival, and Iâ€™d like to prove to myself that I can do it, but I also want to be an engineer, specifically a biomedical engineer, I want to make prosthetics, I really want to have the experience of college, but I also want to experience the military, I donâ€™t specifically want to join to kill people, but I have this feeling of responsibility, because soldiers fought for my freedom, why shouldnâ€™t I fight for otherâ€™s freedoms? I thought it was a phase, but itâ€™s been a year or two, and I still want to join. I dunno, I just need some advice
