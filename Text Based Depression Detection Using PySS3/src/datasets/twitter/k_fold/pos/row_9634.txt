One good thing So, about two weeks ago my best friend was raped.  It was fucking awful, even just hearing her talk about it I was crying. It took a minute but the plan b finally kicked in, and sheâ€™s not pregnant any more. Iâ€™m so happy for her, sheâ€™s been through so much and life is finally giving her a break, even if sheâ€™s still in a bad situation. This is the best Iâ€™ve felt in a long time, I canâ€™t express how much she means to me and Iâ€™m so glad that itâ€™s gonna be ok.
