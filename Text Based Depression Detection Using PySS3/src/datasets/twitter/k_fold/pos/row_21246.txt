Is blood in phlegm after a nose bleed normal? Like the title says, I'm wondering if I should be concerned because I'm going to bed and don't want to drown in my own blood in my sleep. My nose bleed is down, but every so often phlegm forms in my throat and I spit out blood mixed with mucus. I've only spat this out two times, but I just wanna know. Thanks.
