Teenagers and pranks. 
Hello fellow teenage brothers and sisters. Today we will discuss pranks. 

So as I scroll though Tik Tok, I see a lot of teenagers doing prank videos that are not even pranks, itâ€™s just straight up being an asshole. 

Somehow, these videos make a ton of likes, which is something that I donâ€™t get. Seriously, donâ€™t you all have at least a few brain cells left? Do you even need brain cells to know whatâ€™s right or wrong?

Seriously, we need to stop supporting these people. 

And no, anybody that doesnâ€™t find assholes funny is not a snowflake.
