i hate learning useless stuff at school i appreciate teachers and everything they do, but god why do they have to teach outdated stuff no one needs. more specifically in math and science. no one outside of america uses the imperial system, why are we still learning this? and then there's math that no one uses in their day to day life but still gets taught just for the hell of it. i can't think of one scenario where i've needed a pointless and long way of solving a simple equation outside of school.

school would be easier and way more helpful if we only were taught what we need in real life and got to learn useful life skills.
