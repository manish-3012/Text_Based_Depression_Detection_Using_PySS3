PM me, if you are interested in a Discord server, focused on mental health and self-improvement. Hi everyone,

The name of the server is The Lodge. One of my friends started this because our circle had a lot of people who were into making the most out of themselves. Some points of discussion include mental health, general productivity, your academic/professional career, fitness, knowledge, and relationships. The goal is to have central group chats to post resources, ask questions, and share personal experiences on the road to self-actualization.

I hope y'all will join! Have a good day!
