Hear me out Im interested in starting a podcast, I know how like "everyone is doing podcasts" but I just spent like the past hour recording one for a joke and I thoroughly enjoyed it. And my idea is to make a podcast where I read weird fan fiction, and have other times where it's just like regular stuff, idk I think this will be fun and thought I'd chuck it out there
