Quick little rant Iâ€™m in mobile so typos and formatting problems. Also Iâ€™m crying so even more typos sorry. 

Backstory- A while ago I created a year group chat for my school. Almost everyone was in it and it was on WhatsApp so I was an admin along with my two friends. One friend moved, I left the school and the other friendâ€™s mom got mad at her and made her delete whatsapp. We were still the admins other than the last friend. 

Now my friend who moved is really upset because they (my year) created a group chat without us and didnâ€™t tell her or me. Idk how she found out but she told me. 

Iâ€™m really distraught right now. I canâ€™t believe they would do this. Can they hate me that much? My friend is so upset and theyâ€™re saying itâ€™s not their fault. 

I just donâ€™t even know. I do know that itâ€™s not that bad and Iâ€™m just overreacting but i canâ€™t help it. Iâ€™m more upset that my friend is upset than at what they did.
