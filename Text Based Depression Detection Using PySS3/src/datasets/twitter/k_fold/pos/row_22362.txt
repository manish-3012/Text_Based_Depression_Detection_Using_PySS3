I'm starting school on monday I'm very anxious right now because it's been almost 6 months since the last time I went to school, I'm starting again on Monday and I just don't know how I'm going to deal with the long days and early classes, I don't remember half the things I've done last year and I'm going to meet so many new people. I hate this, I don't know how to make friends, my boyfriend isn't in my class, all my teachers are new and I'm so scared because I know some of them will go really fast with the work
