So Iâ€™m asexual and aromatic If u donâ€™t know what that means, being aromatic means I am not romantically attracted to any gender. I am also not sexually attractive to anyone which is referred to as asexually.

what I need help with is hasnâ€™t happened yet but could and probably will happen.

So what if thereâ€™s some girl who admits to me that she likes me. Should I tell her  that I am incapable of having romantic feelings? Or should I give her a chance knowing I cannot feel the same feelings sheâ€™s feeling. Or do i just tell her I donâ€™t feel the same way for her just like how a normal person would (the reason I donâ€™t want to do this is because I feel like I will give her the wrong idea of why I rejected her.)

And how I know Iâ€™m most likely asexual and aromatic is because Iâ€™m already 17 and I have felt no romantic connection or sexual desires, and that type of stuff is supposed to stop developing at least somewhat soon after in life. At least as far as I know.

If U read this then thanks for hearing me out.
