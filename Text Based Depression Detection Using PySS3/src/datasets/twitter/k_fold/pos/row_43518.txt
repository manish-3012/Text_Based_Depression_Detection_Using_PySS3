my mother is driving me to the point of suicide im writing this teary eyed on an ipad so sorry for any stupid grammar mistakes

my mother took away my phone and headphones, now i cant listen to music anymore. Music helped me calm mysekf and now, its all gone. She grounded me for i dont fucking know how long and i cant close the door to my room. im left with no privacy and she always makes those stupid comments about me when she passes my room just so i get to hear how much of a dissapointment, mistake and fucking disgrace i am to her.

not to mention that while i was writing this, my best friend came to my house to ask me if a can go hang around with him. We had a small talk when suddenly my mom sneaked up to us both. She just straight up belittled me and guilt tripped me because im failing work and school, how i should be like my best friend and all of that shit she said with a smile. After that she just said to him "You can come visist him whenever you want" again, with that ugly fucking smile of hers. why just fucking why was this necessary. Just to add salt to the wound, thats why.

i just cant take this anymore and ive planned to commit suicide in about a month or so, im just so fucking tired of being treated like that.
