Why did she act like that? Sorry for bad english

Some time ago a friend introduced us to his friend (we will call her k). After some time she started to clearly flirt with me, and she wanted to be alone with me all the time, but i wasn't sure of her feelings. Time flew and she kept flirting with me until she went in holiday for 2 weeks. While she was in holiday i took some time to think if she actually liked me or not so, after she returned home i asked her to go out with me and my friends (I wanted to see how she would react), but she said that she couldn't because her parents didn't knew us and she said that only if his friend was with us they would say yes, but he was in holiday) Time flew and here we come to last week. I asked her to go out with us once again and she said "i'll think about it" and yesterday she said no because she already had another commitment, but she was clearly making an excuse because she said about 3 different reasons and i didn't clearly understand).

My question is: why did k flirt with me if when i asked her out just to see each other she said no and  disappeared?
