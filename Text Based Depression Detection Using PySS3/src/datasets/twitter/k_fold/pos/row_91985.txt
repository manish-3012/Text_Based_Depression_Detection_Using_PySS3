How do I even become confident? So Iâ€™m a girl. Iâ€™m not like UGLY but Iâ€™m not like insanely gorgeous. Iâ€™m average. I mean I guess Iâ€™m ugly in my areas standard because Iâ€™m not short, Latina, white, and I donâ€™t have straight hair. I noticed that itâ€™s taken quite an impact to my social skills I guess. Iâ€™ve become this shell of a person and I just donâ€™t feel confident. I feel like I need to be better but Idk how to be better.
