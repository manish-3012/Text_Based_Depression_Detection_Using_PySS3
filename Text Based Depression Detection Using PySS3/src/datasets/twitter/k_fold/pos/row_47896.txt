Need help talking to girls, boys or nonbinarys, try playing the question game. The question game is pretty simple to understand. You begin by taking turns asking each other questions until the other person can't or dosent want to answer the question. The person who couldn't answer the question loses. This may seem like a simple concept but it's helped me get to know the opposite gender pretty well. I hope this can help you fellow redditors out as well. (Also cautionary advice, it's ok to lose the game if the question gets to personal or uncomfortable) . Know your boundaries and have fun.
