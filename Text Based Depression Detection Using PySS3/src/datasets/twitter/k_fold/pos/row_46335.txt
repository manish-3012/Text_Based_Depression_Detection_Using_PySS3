I wanna sleep I haven't slept in three days because of this persistent low humming noise outside my window. I feel like if I had schizophrenia, this is what it would be like the noise is so bad. Sometimes it takes me a minute to notice it but once I do it's there for good. I dunno, maybe ill just be tired enough tonight to ignore it. If you guys here from me in like five hours you'll know I wasn't.
