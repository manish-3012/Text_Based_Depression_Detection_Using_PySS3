School system is doodoo and I got big brain idea Schoolâ€™s classes should be based on every person is different but at the end of the day we are all humans. What school needs to do is have more specific classes to the individual. Letâ€™s say someone is heavy into math there classes we shift to focus on that more. More science based classes and math based classes and for English and social studies it becomes less difficult and more specific. English we only teach things like essays for these students because they do not need fiction stories. And electives should also be more common. College in this scenario would work better as a government thing to make the teaching similar enough. You could say that someone would like a subject if they had a different teacher. I think we could fix this by increasing the salary to give college grads more of a want to take that job and give better options for the teachers. We could also give job insecurity as well to make teachers have to keep on getting better to keep there job otherwise a college grad could take it. Also have right away kids going from class to class right away to have teachers be more centralized around there subject. 

TL,DR: classes based on you but keep the core classes and to prevent teachers pay increase and make the jobs more competitive by not allowing them to be safe
