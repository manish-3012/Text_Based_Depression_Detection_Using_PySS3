A'ight people hear me out. There's a lot of guys/girls here who aren't that kind while replying to people's post. Like half of the replies are stupid or people trying to bully each other.

If you think replying with shit like that or bullying people is cool, then your'e wrong on so many levels.

We're all teenagers and most of us usually come to this sub to vent. A lot of us are anxious and sad. 

So the least you can do is be kind in the replies for all you know the guy/girl might be having a hard time. Just be nice.

And bullying or making offensive jokes is NOT AT ALL COOL.
