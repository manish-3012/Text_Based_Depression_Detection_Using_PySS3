Posting every day until I get a girlfriend day 7 Bad news. The girl I like got snowed in at a ski resort and is probably still there. I didnâ€™t get to see her today. 

Good news: I see her again (hopefully) on Thursday. And we have a bit of an Among Us date tonight. 

Iâ€™m calling it a date because I want to, not because it is.
