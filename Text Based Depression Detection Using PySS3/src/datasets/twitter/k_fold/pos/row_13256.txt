I want to create a band that mixes hard funk, rock, and hip-hop influences together I could play piano, but I don't have a guitar or bass. I could have the drums chopped though. Since I've been digging into music more and more, I found so much incredible music that has inspired me and my work. Anyone who knows  willing to talk please DM me, I think I really have something that has potential here.
