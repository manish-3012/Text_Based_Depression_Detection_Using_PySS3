Unpopular opinion Instead of thinking of LGBTQ+ as a different group of people, how about we turn it to HLGBTQ+ to recognize all humans as part of the group. Most heterosexuals support the rights for people of the LGBTQ+ so everyone can be recognized as part of the group. And some assholes that are against this stuff can be excluded from humanity.
