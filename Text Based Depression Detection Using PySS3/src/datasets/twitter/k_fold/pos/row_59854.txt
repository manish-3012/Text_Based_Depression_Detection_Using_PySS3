My bad bad handwriting. Idk but my handwriting is like some sorta alien language, no one can understand it. Iâ€™ve tried improving it, but it always just comes back to this dumb handwriting, maybe itâ€™s just something wrong with my brain. I mean I got ADHD and dyslexia, but I donâ€™t think that would affect my handwriting, would it? Anyways, if you got any tips to improve handwriting, that would be much appreciated.
