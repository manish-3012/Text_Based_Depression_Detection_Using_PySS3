I think my dad and step mom just broke up. I just heard my dad yell "its over" several time while crying. They've barely gotten into any fights before abd they just went on a date earlier tonight. I don't understand why this happened. My dads car is still in the driveway and i just heard them go into their room. Hopefully I can update in the morning if I know anything more.
