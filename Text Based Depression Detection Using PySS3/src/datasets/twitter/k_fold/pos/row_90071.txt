My dad is getting rid of his truck Itâ€™s a 1993 Chevy ck 2500 and the transmission, radio and Air conditioner doesnâ€™t work (very important in Fresno), someone smashed the stearin column so he would have to get that fixed, it doesnâ€™t have airbags, and it didnâ€™t pass smog

Itâ€™s probably worth at most $600, so heâ€™s just donating it to valley public radio for some reason, itâ€™s an npr station, idk
