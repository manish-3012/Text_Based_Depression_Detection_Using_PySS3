I fucking hate having sex The other night, this guy and I decided to have sex, it wouldâ€™ve been the first time for both of us, however we didnâ€™t have any protection or anything, so I made the decision not too. We did however give each blow jobs for a little. It was going well and then we stopped for the night and went to bed. He left the next morning and weâ€™ll probably do it again this weekend or next.

Anyways, now Iâ€™m worrying about whether I have strep throat, coronavirus, or if my throat is stretching out bc his cock was THICK.

Okay have a good day fellow teens :)
