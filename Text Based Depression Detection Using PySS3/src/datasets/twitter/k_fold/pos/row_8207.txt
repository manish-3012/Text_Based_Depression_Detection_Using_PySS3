Iâ€™m not gonna be participating in â€œStop Simping Septemberâ€ The meme is cool and funny and all, but I donâ€™t feel like participating in that. Obviously I wouldnâ€™t put woman above me or men in any way at all. But I do want to be able to compliment woman whenever I feel like it. I will treat everyone around me the same. I donâ€™t wanna put woman above me or any other men, but I donâ€™t wanna put men above women either. And I will put myself first at all costs.
