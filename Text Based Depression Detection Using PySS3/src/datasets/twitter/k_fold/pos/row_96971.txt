Im kinda tired of Reddit I really donâ€™t know Im how much longer Im gonna be in Reddit. 
It was fine for the first few months I was hear but as I got deeper into the community it got more toxic and it really shows how you canâ€™t have an opinion here. I enjoy Reddit and it makes me laugh and itâ€™s nice reading storyâ€™s but after exploring other social media itâ€™s nice to be able to voice whatever you want and not get major backlash for it. People should be aloud to have opinions. 
Anyways thanks for a year on Reddit itâ€™s been fun donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll get to two years but weâ€™ll see.
