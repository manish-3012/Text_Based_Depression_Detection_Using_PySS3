A common problem I see more often than not So as of recently, Iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of posts and comments saying how much people hate this subreddit or how it has gone to complete shit or anything along those lines. 

If you donâ€™t like something, itâ€™s not going to change just because you leave it or ignore it. You have to be the change you want to see whether thatâ€™s in the real world or online.

Donâ€™t be afraid to voice your opinion because youâ€™re likely not the only one with said thoughts and opinions.

Stay hydrated my homies.
