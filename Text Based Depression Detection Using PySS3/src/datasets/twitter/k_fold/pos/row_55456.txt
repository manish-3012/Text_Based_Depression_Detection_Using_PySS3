My room is stinky It's 3 AM and I can't sleep because my room is stinky and I don't know why but I have a few guesses:

1. My sweat

2. My feet

3. My shoes

4. The clothes that are on the chair

5. The banana peel, gums, and other snacks in the trash can

6. Maybe there is a good in my backpack from last year

7. My "handmade nut milk"
