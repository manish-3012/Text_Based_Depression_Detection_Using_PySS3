Anybody wanna play some Xbox? Pretty bored last few days was wondering if anybody wanted to play some Xbox? My gamertag is Thoughtified. I got COD: Modern Warfare, Rainbow Six Siege, Red Dead Redemption 2, Dark Souls 3, For Honor, Minecraft, and Sea of Thieves. Just shoot me a DM on Reddit or Xbox if you wanna play.
