Tips for healthy lifestyle and fitness??? So I'm a 15 year old male, I'm 5 foot 5 inches (165 cm approximately) and I weigh 70 kg (approximately 154 pounds I think). I'm tired of sitting around all day on my computer and I wanna do something good with my life so I'm gonna try working out and actually adopting a healthy lifestyle and staying fit. I've already done 4 workout sessions this week, 1 yesterday and 3 today. I'd appreciate it if you guys help me and tell me some tips about staying fit.
