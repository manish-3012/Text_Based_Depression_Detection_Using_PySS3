Short bois of r/teenagers, how do you cope with it? By short I mean 5â€™7 or shorter, maybe 5â€™8 if you're in Europe.

Iâ€™m 5'6.5 and I visited a doctor and now I know my growth plates are fused forever. How do you guys deal with it

P.S: to all the tall guy who's gonna comment their height and be like â€œwhaaaat? Iâ€™m 15 but Iâ€™m 6â€™0â€, no one asks
