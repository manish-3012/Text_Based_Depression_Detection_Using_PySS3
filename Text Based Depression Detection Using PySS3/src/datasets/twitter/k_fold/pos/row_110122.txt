I know most of my posts are joke but this is serious Just now i had my first "hookup" or sexual experience with a girl now we did all kinds of shit except kissing  (we did neck kissing tho) my point being after all that i kinda rubbed one out on her leg like you rub one on your bed 

Nonetheless my other girl friend was there and it was dark so she was oblivious.

After i nuted i felt this  shame and emptiness inside me i feel like I should never do things like this like why god did you create me just to feel like shit 

And im second year highschool while she is in 2year college
