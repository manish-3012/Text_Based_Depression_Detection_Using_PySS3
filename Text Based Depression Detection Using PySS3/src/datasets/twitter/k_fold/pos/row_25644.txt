That time I got my ass saved Story time:

When I was in year 7, (6th grade) I had to do some Spanish homework, but I didnâ€™t do it. 

The teacher started walking around the classroom, checking everyoneâ€™s work, and giving detentions to people who didnâ€™t do it.

So the teacher got to my desk and asked where the homework was. I â€œlookedâ€ through my folder to find the homework that I hadnâ€™t done, claiming that â€œi definitely did it, I just canâ€™t find itâ€. The teacher then started to write my name on the detention list, when the girl sitting next to me looked inside my folder and said â€œthere it isâ€

The teacher walked away and I was detention free

But a few weeks later I got a detention anyway for hearing someone tell a joke, then laughing at it

Story time over. 
I will now take questions
