This is kinda bad idk Okay funny storry ( i guess it depends how you look at it ). So i was in music class online ofcourse and i wanted to do the rickroll meme ( old at this point but whatever ) i didnt wanna do the link cuz the teacher wouldnt look at it so i copy pasted the lyrics in the chat. It wasnt complete and i wanted space ( take notes here ) i hit enter and it got posted in the chat. The teacher saw it comented and now wants me to sing my group does to 

Lesson of the story don't hit ENTER 

I learned that the hard way
