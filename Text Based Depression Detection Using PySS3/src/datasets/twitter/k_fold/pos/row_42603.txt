Uninstalled all my social media apps except WhatsApp and Reddit Some days ago i asked out my crush. Long story short she left me on seen. I can't say i was depressed but i really was sad. At school i had to fake smiles everytime because there's only one person that knows about my story and i wasn't prepared to tell others about this. One day i saw a story from my crush in which she started smoking. I wasn't really a fan of smoking people but after that i tried to speak with her again in a normal way like sending her memes but she kept leaving me on seen. I'm a weeb so i started watching some romance/drama animes to make me feel better. I loved how Sakuta from bunnygirl senpai thrown away his smartphone to distance from people. Following his actions, yesterday i uninstalled all my social media apps except WhatsApp and Reddit to distance myself from other people. To keep myself distracted from re-installing my apps i bought some manga books to read and  find a better me.
