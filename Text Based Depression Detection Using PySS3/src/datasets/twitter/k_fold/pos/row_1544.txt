I've enjoyed covid 19 and its effects on the world so far I'm still in high school and last year due to the virus we didn't have to go to school for half a year and I made the most of that summer up until the end I'm sad that people are dying but I'd rather have it stick around for a while longer its helped the in environment a lot and I find the mask kinda comfortable it's a plus at school because I can sleep in class and the school days are shorter so I get off early I've been a bit sick lately (not covid 19) just a cold but I've been off school for a bit so that's been good idk I do want the pandemic to end it's just got some benefits all I'm saying
