Girls are so weird So for a backstory, I invited this girl that I liked over to my house for Halloween, we trick-or-treated, and then watched a movie in my living room while a party was going on downstairs. We start talking a bit until the day before Thanksgiving and then, for absolutely no reason, she blocks me on Instagram and Snapchat. This happened a couple of months ago and I've gotten over it, but I just want to know why she did that.
