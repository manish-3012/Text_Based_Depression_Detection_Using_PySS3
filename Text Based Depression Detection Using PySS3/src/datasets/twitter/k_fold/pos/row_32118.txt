me n my ex are talking now as friends, but iâ€™m worried he might see things differently? we go to the same school but only really talk after school through text, we donâ€™t flirt or anything and thereâ€™s no indication that he likes me other than simply just messaging me, and then we have a convo 

I tell him about my personal stuff and itâ€™s all good, but I just hope he doesnâ€™t expect anything from it (ie â€œif I talk to her, sheâ€™ll want to get back with meâ€) 

idk, we broke up about a month ago- i just donâ€™t want the friendship to get messy
