Teenagers CAN get tired out. Have you ever been working hard somewhere, and someone says something along the lines of "you're a teenager, you can't be tired," because I have, and it's just kind of odd. Like, I've been moving gravel for over three hours, yes, I'm tired. I don't think it's bad if someone just says to try to be funny, but what happens when they actually believe it and try to work a teen longer than they can handle? I just think it's something that could be said less, and is very much not true.
