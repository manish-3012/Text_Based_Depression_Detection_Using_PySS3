I wrote another love story, enjoy lonely redditors I go to her house to pick her up. She's wearing sweatpants and an oversized pink hoodie. She's the cutest thing I've ever seen. I try not to blush while walking to our car. We drive to the zoo on a chilly day. We go in and there is a long entrance. We go to see the monkeys first. The monkeys are swinging from branch to branch, screaming. Some of them are getting close to others so they can keep warm. Throughout the zoo, we take lots and lots of pictures. I can't stop smiling, even when my mouth is hurting. We see the elephants and hippos on a little safari trip through the outside of the zoo. We hold hands while the bumpy road is continuing. Her laugh and her smile is the best. After the ride we take her to her favorite place, the birds. She gleams. Small, big, colourful, loud birds all around us. Her voice gets high and cute when she tries to pet one. I try to help but we knock eachother down. I give her my hand, and she holds on tight as I pick her up. Another photo of giggling faces. We eat at the overpriced restaurant, and see a couple of statues. I let her feed the giraffe, and seeing his purple younger makes her laugh. Hours pass as it feels like seconds. We are back in the car, driving home. No music, just enjoying our company together. I drop her off at her house. She tells me she wants to hold my hand a little longer.

Grab my hand. Grab my whole life too. For I can't help falling in love with you.
