Imma take a break from this subreddit On a post of mine that got popular I talked about 3 SPECIFIC girls In my class and was bombarded with comments saying â€œI am a mysogninstâ€ and â€œantifeministâ€. Whatâ€™s kinda funny is if I posted about a group of boys doing the same thing no one would of said that. But some people (and by some I mean a lot) started tracking my old posts to where I live and bringing up school shootings there saying I support them. By the end I was extremely depressed and couldnâ€™t handle so many arguments at once. I will come back in a few day. 

Until then, random internet stranger.
