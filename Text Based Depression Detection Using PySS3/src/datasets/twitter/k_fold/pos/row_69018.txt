I combined Evangeline, A Tale of Acadie and The Raven to make this poetry/song lyrics (potentially). What does Reddit think? Do you hear in the forest primeval,

where the old hemlock grows,

the raven, dark and evil,

and his melancholy crows

&amp;#x200B;

As he sounds his macabre call,

hundreds others join his song

and from out this deathly throng

one word stands out from all

&amp;#x200B;

Nevermore

Can you hear it?

Nevermore

Will you heed it?

Nevermore

  
Where man once plowed the ground

all that remains is but a sound

upon your god-forsaken sanity,

May it beat, may it pound!

&amp;#x200B;

Nevermore

Thus said the raven:

Nevermore

Thus said the raven at your door

Nevermore

&amp;#x200B;

Take me to the place where one would sit to watch the birds

Take me to the place where a busy market sound was heard

Take me to the place where someone worked upon the loom

Take me to the place, where no manâ€™s met his violent doom.

&amp;#x200B;

Itâ€™s here that you will find that

Quite against your will

You gun was locked and loaded

Aimed at my head, point blank

To kill

&amp;#x200B;

So will you heed the warning

of the raven at your door

pf the raven in the forest

or will you hurt me more?
