Any Musicians on here who play like crazy?? Is there anyone here who plays Bass or Drums or even sings, Iâ€™m trying to get something together. I would love to jam and play some different places, I can play guitar and butcher sing like David Lee Roth. I'm a big fan of 80â€™s metal bands such as Van Halen and MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e so if anybody knows anybody just comment below!!!
