Can any history nerd answer this. So from what I know the FBI didnâ€™t like MLK at all. Why?? Was racism really that widespread  even inside the government agencies in America ?? Why did they fear MLK and even go to the point of sending him suicide letters.. What threat did he have against America?  Other than trying to stop racism and have civil rights. Were POC really that feared?
