I forgot my computer mouse Iâ€™m on my way to a 5 day trip to a land far far away and decided to bring my not so gaming laptop with a broken touch pad so I figured Iâ€™d bring my mouse. Only thing is that I woke up and just got in the car and forgot the mouse as itâ€™s plugged into my computer and I guess I wonâ€™t be able to play Minecraft anymore. Fml
