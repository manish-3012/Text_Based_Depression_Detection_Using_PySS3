Any other teen girl have a baby name list???? So my friends and I have lists of baby names and we compare them and everything, and mine is the â€œstrangest oneâ€ out of them all according to them. One friend only has two names, Thomas and Jackie. Another like Owen, Ava, and Tucker. There are about 9 of us the the group so I wonâ€™t post all the names they like, but whatâ€™s your opinion on my names???? Are they THAT bad?????
