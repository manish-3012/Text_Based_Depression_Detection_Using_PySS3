He's gone My grandpa has been in the hospital with covid for a week. A few minutes ago I got the news he had passed away. My mom was crying so much and I tried to be strong but I couldn't and I'm shaking and crying. It's Christmas Eve and tomorrow is my brothers birthday and we just aren't gonna feel up to celebrating. We had to cancel on everyone. My grandpa's uncle died as well earlier today, I didn't know him too well but it was still horrible. I don't know what to do I feel like I'm drowning. Everyone is so sad.
