My parents are driving me insane. help My dad says I have to go for a walk (which I do), I make a sigh (louder than I would have wanted) because I don't want to go my parents hear me, they yell at me for 2 minutes and I get banned from phone, Xbox, computer for two days and my dad just leaves without waiting literally 10 seconds for me to finish putting on my shoes and this all happened with me only saying this sentence.  
"why are you yelling at me I WILL go for a walk so you are yelling at me for no reason." Me 5 minutes ago at the time of writing this.
