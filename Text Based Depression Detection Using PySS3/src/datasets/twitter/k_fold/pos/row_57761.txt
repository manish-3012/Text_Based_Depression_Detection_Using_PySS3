My mom called me immature for not wanting to eat a salad, yelled at me for quietly declining the salad, and made me eat it anyway. We had a leftover store-bought salad, it has little cubes of ham, yellow cheese, carrot strings, and pieces of tomato. I personally do not like such a diverse salad, and especially anything with tomatoes in it. I absolutely love simple food, and if the salad had just consisted of the salad by itself, I wouldâ€™ve gone for it.

Of course, if you read the title of this post, you know how it goes. Iâ€™m in my room (doing homework because I want it done and over with so I can take a nap) and I get called down to the dining table by my mom. She asks me to eat the leftover salad and I say with a calm voice that I do not want the salad, but she insisted for me to eat it as she thinks I was being disrespectful as to not eating the salad. (Also, salad is the last thing I need, because my metabolism as a 15yo is the fastest itâ€™s ever been, and I simply lose weight by breathing.)

After declining the salad a second time, she mustâ€™ve been irritated and started raising her voice,  telling me I was being immature for not wanting to eat a simple salad. (It is NOT a simple salad, a simple salad to me is salad in a bowl. This salad was basically a mini-lunch turned into a salad.) I told her I wouldnâ€™t like it, but she said to eat it anyway.

So here I am, eating my lunch salad box and Iâ€™m just thinking about that nap I so desperately want. But now I will come to my bed with a bad taste combination of tomato, ham, cheese and carrot in my mouth. Let me know whoâ€™s in the wrong in this situation, thanks.
