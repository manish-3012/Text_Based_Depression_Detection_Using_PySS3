â€œKind Strangerâ€ has struck again... In the early hours of the morning, an anonymous Gold Award giver by the name of â€œKind Strangerâ€ gave several posts these awards with seemingly no motive. The identity of the mysterious being is unclear, and users are asked to be aware of their surroundings in these dark times. Kind Stranger could be anywhere.

This is obviously not the first time that this has happened. A series of particularly suspicious attacks took place less than a month ago, each involving a basic post being ambushed with Platinum and Gold Awards, along with all of its comments. All that we do know about the criminal is that they never give to people who beg for gifts.

Kind Stranger seems to have a suspiciously bottomless pit of coins to spend, which is why we must take them down and work out how they managed to obtain them. I and a team of willing volunteers will be monitoring posts over the next few days, hoping to catch the criminal in the act. However, if this method fails, we will not hesitate to widen our search.

We live in dark times, ladies and gentlemen.
