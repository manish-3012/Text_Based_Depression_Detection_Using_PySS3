Update on my first football clinic I did ok overall. I was probably the worst or second worst receiver at the clinic, but most of them started at their school, or played at least 3 years, and I was new. I only caught like half of the throws at the beginning cause the QBs threw it way faster than I'm used to, and they weren't that accurate, but I ended on 7 straight catches. I know literally nobody cares but I just felt like sharing
