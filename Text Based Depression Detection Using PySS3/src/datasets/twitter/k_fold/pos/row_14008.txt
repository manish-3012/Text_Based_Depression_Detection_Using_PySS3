Rant on myself being a pussy bitch I had a golden opportunity at my college. Me and my friend were just gonna hangout for the night, then some random girls call us up from their balcony at my apartment. They tell us to come up and party. So we do they were chill and wound up going to a frat party. They had arranged that I hook up with this chick. We were both fucked up and we made it back to her place and once we get there all I do is kiss her a bit then leave. I had a golden opportunity and I wasted it bc I was being a bitch. Anyways thx for coming to my TEDTalk.
