Need help with crush So this girl who im reallu into, school has been going since mid september, knew my name, no friends in common. But she also says hi to me when i walk in a room, but thats not the thing im asking about, so i was absent on monday (food poisoning) but on tuesday she said she missed while usong my name. We are pretty much acquaintances right now but im really confused if it means anything. Domt know if this matters but shes 1 grade ahead of me, Have advanced class with her (why im taking advanced classes)
