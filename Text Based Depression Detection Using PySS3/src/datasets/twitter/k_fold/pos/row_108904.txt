as an american itâ€™s fascinating to me that other countries donâ€™t have medical bills, like no medical bills at all i canâ€™t imagine walking out a doctors appointment and not getting some kind of check. that is so weird to me, and now i realize how greedy our government is holy shit, i think iâ€™ll move.
