Heart Broken Here to discuss if it's just me or if there are others out there like me. It started with my first love, Its been maybe 3-4 years since we broke up but she's still in my dreams. I still think about her sometimes. She became apart of my heart, body, mind, and soul. It's the same thing with my second gf, Its been 2 years since we broke up and Ill occasionally think about her, she hasn't infiltrated my dreams recently or that I can recall. God now my current girlfriend (longdistance) wants space and It seems to be heading into another heart break. I would never do long distance unless I knew it was right and I really really liked her. Yeah, she's definitely going to be in my head for god knows how long. I let her into my heart and now another girl has become apart of me. I can't even sleep right now because I'm thinking about her. She's also been in my dreams of late. Anyone else experience this? Like I deadass still think about my first love sometimes to considered normal and I know the same thing will happen with my current gf.
