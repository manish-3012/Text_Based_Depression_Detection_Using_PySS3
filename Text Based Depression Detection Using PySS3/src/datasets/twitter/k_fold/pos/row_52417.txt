I did it boys Iâ€™ve made it to 16 years! Iâ€™m 16 years old now, and I donâ€™t know how to feel. Iâ€™m happy that Iâ€™ve made it this far because Iâ€™ve wanted to end myself a couple times when younger. Yâ€™all probably donâ€™t really care though, to you Iâ€™m just some random stranger. Schoolâ€™s been...rough I enjoyed the beginning but now itâ€™s getting daunting. I have MANY missing assignments, and poor grades that match up to that too. 

Iâ€™m a female who just needs some words of encouragement. Iâ€™m trying to be strong, and keep my chin up but I just feel hopeless and undeserving of others affection. Iâ€™ve been put on multiple meds this past month, and my anxiety has been at an all time high. 

...I just want to feel strong again...
