Thoughts on Reddit malware So, a few years ago, someone made a self retweeting tweet, which is pretty easy to do with some programming knowledge, and Reddit allows you to put code in your comments. Is it possible to create a self-upvoting comment in the same way? I'm obviously not gonna attempt it cuz that would get me banned, but I'm just curious, is it possible? I'd love to hear your responses
