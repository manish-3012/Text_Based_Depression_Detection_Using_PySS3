Modern feminism be like Feminism means equality and as a feminist the world needs feminism and not equality. The only problem is that we feminists can't agree what feminism virtually is, conflicts we solve by not bringing them up. The most important thing is that we always speak from the perspective that's most advantageous for women in each case

I think equality is that sex doesn't matter, but at the same time I require more high position jobs for women based on their sex

I think sex segregation should be dismantled, but at the same time I support gender distribution in every society's section

I think sex is just external variable that doesn't have a real effect on an individuals attributes, but at the same time I say that it's discrimination against women to valuebso to speak masculine attributes instead of feminine attributes

Men are prejudiced againt men, but at the same time I say that feminism doesn't prejudice men

I think that feminism doesn't hate men, but at the same time I think that high position policy-makers' being male is a problem

You shouldn't discriminate based on external features, but at the same time I say that straight white men can't speak for minorities

I think that stereotyping is always wrong, but at the same time I say that straight white males are in principle always in better position

I think men are favored in recruitment, but at the same time I say that women do the same job for cheaper

I think multiculturality should be supported, but at the same time I require giving up genders roles

I think we should value individual's experiences, except when they are against feminist worldview

Western society has sexualised the female body, but ath the same time I highlight that people sexual preferences cam't be infuenced

I think everyone can freely implement their sexuality but at tge same time I criticize women in commercials

I think women experience unrealistic ideal bodies as desirable, but at the same time I think that women experiencebunrealistic ideal bodies as women degrading

The image of woman created by tge media is too one-sided, but at the same I think that the image of woman created by the media places conflicting demands

I think women have full right to choose about their sex life, but at the same time I convey that porn degrades women

I think everyone should be able to freely enjoy their own sexuality, but at the same time I think men shouldn't rate women's looks

I think that women are as sexually willing as men, but at the same time I say sexual allusion and harassment focus on particularly from men to women

I think women are equally as strong and independent as men and don't need special protection, but at the same time I say that moving at night is especially dangerous for women

I think that the importance of sex should be reduced, but at the same time I say that attention must be paid to the number of female victims in cases that are suffered from regardless of gender

I think women are have as good sense of humor as men, but at the same time I emphasize that women stereotypes shouldn't be jokes about

I think everyone should have the same rights, but at the same time I accept racist jokes only from black people and sexist jokes only from women

I think that terms referring to gender should be changed to gender neutral, but at the same time I think the term "feminism" is suitable for promoting equality between women and men

I think feminism's extreme forms don't represent feminism, but at the same time I let you know that whoring women represents anfifeminism

I think that feminism is very self-critical ideology, but at the same time argue that opponents of feminism just don't know what they're talking about and feminism is needed as long as feminism is opposed
