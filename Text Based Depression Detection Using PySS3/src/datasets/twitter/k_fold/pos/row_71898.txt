I feel lonely :( Yh ok Ik my family and friends love me and all that shit, and I know Iâ€™m fortunate to have a loving family and great friends. 

But a guy sometimes craves feminine interaction, not even in a horny way. I mean especially for me cos I go to an all boys school and havenâ€™t had a proper conversation with a girl my age since I was like 11. 

So Yh. If any girls wanna talk cos theyâ€™re similarly lonely my dms are open. You can drop by if youâ€™re a guy too, but (and I donâ€™t mean to be rude) I got plenty of guy friends so Iâ€™m not really asking for it. 

Have a good Valentineâ€™s Day everyone!
