Had a panic attack in maths because i literally didn't know anything on the test. I forgot everything I learnt for 3 weeks over a weekend, just did like 5 answers and decided to fall asleep on the desk before I throw up, came home, wanted to cut the shit out of my thigh and had a breakdown over how many cuts I have after relapsing 2 days ago, and they say school is good smh
