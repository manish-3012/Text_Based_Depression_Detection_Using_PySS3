The sophomores in my highschool's student council have gone crazy. They're playing various remixes of Baby Shark over the loudspeakers during passing periods.

As a fundraiser. For what, I don't know, and as far as I can tell nobody else knows either.

They won't stop until we donate $150.

Thanks, COVID. Love this insanity.
