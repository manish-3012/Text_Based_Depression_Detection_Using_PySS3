So apparently itâ€™s my fault that my mom lost her food card I borrowed it to get my family drinks cause somethin effed up with the water treatment, and when Iâ€™m done I put it back on her desk, and when I turns up missing itâ€™s my fault, when she could have been watching it. And it was most likely my two year old sister who messed with it, but no itâ€™s my fault, even tho all responsibility for the card fell off me the second I put it on the desk. So no, itâ€™s not my fault the card is missing, itâ€™s hers for not watching it.
