I think there might be a botting problem herw Recently a lot of posts that were posted a few days ago that used to have an average amount of likes (somewhere in the hundreds maybe even around 1k) now out of nowhere have fucking around 10k-30k likes and theyre normal posts like any other nothing special. I think mods should investigate this
