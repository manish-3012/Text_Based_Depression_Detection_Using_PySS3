guys...i think my girlfriend is losing love in me... i really love my girlfriend and she loves me too, but nowadays, i dont think she is loving me much, i think maybe she now has another boyfriend....

im just gonna cry about it for like 2 days and forget about it, but then i love her soooooo much that i dont wanna leave her... 

i just don't know what to do

her replies went from "heyyy how ya doin" to just "hi" which is kinda worrying me tbh

i just really wanna be with her.....
