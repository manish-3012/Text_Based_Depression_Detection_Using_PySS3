Posting a Bible verse everyday day 13. Romans 1:26-27: Because of this, God gave them overÂ to shameful lusts.Â Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.Â In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
