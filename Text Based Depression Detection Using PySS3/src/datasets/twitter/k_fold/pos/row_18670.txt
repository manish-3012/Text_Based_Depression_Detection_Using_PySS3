Spanish should be a required subject in the us Or at least California where nearly 40% of our population speaks Spanish and New Mexico where nearly 50% of there population speaks Spanish, itâ€™s ridiculous, we should be taught Spanish and English from the beginning of school 

Also we should be taught Latin American Spanish, not that thereâ€™s much difference but that would be kinda like teaching us British English, yeah it would be fine but American English would be more useful, even if itâ€™s mostly the same
