I discovered a Zoom glitch So I was trying to join my 2nd period when I discovered this. So if you set to join a Zoom meeting    
and while you're waiting for the teacher open chrome  
and do something. Zoom will pop up on chrome and tell you that your connecting. Click on chrome and you'll stop connecting. But it'll alert the teacher again  to let you in. And zoom will pop back up on chrome. Creating a cycle. 


Ps:thanks to the 7 people who will see this ðŸ¶
