The transition from a private Christian school to a public school is surprising I went to a private Christian school for 9 years and all the social conversations are like. Last Saturday I went to the city and had a sandwich and then I started volunteering at a homeless shelter.

I get to my new school and the first conversation I hear is. I got high with a boy and then slept with him.
