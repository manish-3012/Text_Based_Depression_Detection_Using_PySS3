I got told off for a Soviet flag. I have online school, and being the meme lord I am I put my profile picture as the Soviet flag. This went on for ablut a week or so, then as I was doing a lesson, my mum came in and said that she just got a call from the school that I have to get rid of it!

Stupid capitalists!
