I'm thinking of making a new religion (I probably put the wrong flair) 
So basically I'm thinking of making a religion that is like christianity except better, like a remaster so to speak. No extremists or anything like that. The people who are in the religion simply live their lives. They don't have to worship God (they can but it's not required) or do anything crazy like that, just be a good person and you'll be good, just like pope francis said
"You're a good person then try to be good then ok."
Totally legit pope francis quote...
I might talk about this more if people think it's a good idea
