What even is going on anymore. Save your money.

My parents are mentally abusive and manipulative pricks. I'm 19 and I was supposed to move out on the 17th of this month. Plans fell through. I also haven't much money right now. I work two jobs and my parents called me into their room for a "pep talk". They said I need a 3rd job because I have too much free time (I work every day except monday) and that I need to save up for college for next semester since I'm a lazy piece of shit who is skipping this one. I've been clear that I don't want nor need college, as my focus is a trade and I plan on moving out to pursue that trade in school. They don't give a fuck. They expect me to stay home until I finish college and then get whatever job and then if/when I make decent money to pay them for raising me. My dad "did the math" and was saying how expensive it was to raise a kid, and that after I get a good job, I owe him and my mother roughly 150k for raising me. No. That's not how it works. You chose to have a kid and to raise them. They don't owe you shit, especially when you did such a piss-poor job at it. I raised myself from 14+.
