I hate women sometimes lmao. Iâ€™m a feminist, at least I would guess that I am. I always do my best to stand up for men in unfair societal situations. And seeing fake feminists stand up for womenâ€™s expression, and bodies, and whatever the fuck, but not those same thing for men pisses me off. Itâ€™s like I know damn well if the comments on that post were in relation to a woman on the beach, shit wouldâ€™ve been so much different. I hate when women *constantly* judging menâ€™s bodies, but hate it when men judge theirs. I mean either way both are disgusting, and shouldnâ€™t happen, but shit is gonna hit you right back in the nose if youâ€™re gonna be a douche. 

tl;dr - women body shame men, and no one gives a shit, and itâ€™s so annoying cause they preach body positivity for women, and hate it men men body shame them.
