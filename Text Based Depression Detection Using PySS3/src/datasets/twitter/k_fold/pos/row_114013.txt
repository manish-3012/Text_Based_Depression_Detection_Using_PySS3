Do any of you Americans know if there is a way you can only attend one high school class if it's the only class you need to graduate? Right now, I'm stuck with English 12, but I also have to take 3 filler classes, because the US education system is a burning dumpster fire.  I'd love to know if it's possible to get rid of those 3 extra classes, because I can't stand this 2 days in person, 3 days online school week system.  It's stressing me out unnecessarily, especially since I have more than enough credits to graduate, and just need to take my last required class.  And, honestly, I don't know who decided we need to take 4 whole semesters of classes in a language that most of us are native speakers in.  I'm angry.
