Everyone hear needs to cut back their reddit usage I've been on Reddit for less than an hour everyday the past few days and it's helped so much. I don't care about karma anymore, I've become social IRL again, and I am actually making alot of progress in my Minecraft world lol. I recommend everyone should cut back their reddit usage, if not uninstall it completely.

That's all goodbye
