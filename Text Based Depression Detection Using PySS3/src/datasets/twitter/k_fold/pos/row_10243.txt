I need to talk to you all about something (trigger warning for some of you) Ok so I am 16 and recently given my life to God. So yes, I am a Christian. 
So what this post basically is about is that I want to tell all of you about God and maybe lead someone to Him. I know there's gonna be a lot of teens or young adults reading this and is gonna hate what I say or not believe it or just persecute me for this but I don't care, cause if atleast one person can read this and come to God then it'll be worth it. 

Listen you guys, life is short. You can't tell me you're still gonna be here tomorrow, next week, tonight or even the next 5 min. And I just wanna tell you there is a hell and there is a heaven. And the only way to heaven is through Jesus, nothing else. Don't think, "Well I'm a good person so God will let me into heaven one day cause I'm a good person." But that cannot be further from the truth. The only way is to have a relationship with Jesus and repent of your sins. You need to confess Jesus is Lord and God raised him from the dead. 

God sent Jesus 2000 years ago to die for us on the cross, just so that we can have a chance to be in heaven with him. The only thing you have to do is receive it. Its a free gift of salvation, not something that we deserved, but something we desperately needed. Cause he proved his love for us on the cross and proved his power when he raised from the dead 3 days later. 

If there is any question or anything you want to tell me just comment it and I'll try to answer it the best as I can. Any questions that may keep you from knowing God or questions you may have about certian things like sin or God then feel free to ask. I won't promise I'll be able to answer all of them and I know this might get lost in new but if one person comes to God then it'll be worth it. 
And remember, God loves you. Whether you're a Christian or not, he loves you.
