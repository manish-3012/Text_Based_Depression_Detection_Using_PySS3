american truck simulator is unrealistic in california the speed limit for trucks is 65-75. yes technically itâ€™s 55-65 but itâ€™s effectively the same as the cars. 

they should make it so that every indication is that the speed limit is 55-65, but all the other trucks go 65-75, and everyone fucking hates you if you go the actual truck speed limit cuz that would be realistic
