Guess who is failing every academic class? Hint: Itâ€™s me and I am a fucking mess!

I use Reddit and YouTube more than I do schoolwork, and Iâ€™m so far behind that itâ€™s near impossible to catch up, especially since the semester ends later this week! Yay! Also I barely have the willpower to get out of bed in the morning, so things are going great!
