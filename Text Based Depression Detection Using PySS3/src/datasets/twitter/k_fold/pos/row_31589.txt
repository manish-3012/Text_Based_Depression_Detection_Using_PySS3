Rescued a dog and blew a chance with 2 hot girls Hey, my nameâ€™s Philip, I live in Germany and Iâ€™m 16, and this hsppened: So I was going for a run, an hour ago from the time Iâ€™m writing this now. Then, when I was walking past the field, I saw a german shepherd howling and running around frantically probably looking for the owner. Since I have two dogs of my own, I run after it, it was scared and didnâ€™t come too close. It was running to an intersection so I sprinted in front of it, keeping it from running into the traffic. Then, as I was having a little trouble getting it to follow me from the trail to the ownerâ€™s property a mile up, a mother and her gorgeous daughter came up and asked if they could help me in any way. They had some treats and a leash which helped and we got it back home. Afterward, I went back to them and told them that everything was fine and that the dog was back home with its owner now. THEN the motherâ€™s friend shows up with her daughter who was also beautiful, and you might think: why does it suck then?
Well: After that, I said goodbye to everyone and I could have and should have asked for the daughterâ€™s infos. But my stupid socially anxious ass didnâ€™t. I feel like a dumbass and I was really into both of them, Iâ€™m an idiot, please help :( I could tell the girls were blushing but I didnâ€™t do shit
