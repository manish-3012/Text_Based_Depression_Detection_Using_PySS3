Dear neckbeards, I bet if you met your waifu youâ€™d be too scared to talk to em, or youâ€™d get rejected right away. Lonely piece of shit. If you canâ€™t talk to real girls then what makes you think you can communicate with a â€˜waifuâ€™? You think theyâ€™d like your 1 inch dick? You think theyâ€™d like your Fedora and katana collection? You think that theyâ€™d like your shite hygiene? No. They may seem cartoonish, but I bet most of them arenâ€™t dumb enough to fall for your miserable ass, just like any normal functioning human being. Go outside. Oh wait, you canâ€™t, because itâ€™s quarantine. Itâ€™s still on you (if you were a neck beard before quarantine), since you decided to live your life a goddamn hermit, and now you have to improve your social skills. I bet youâ€™re  thinking â€œwhatâ€™s the point of working out? Itâ€™s quarantine itâ€™s not like Iâ€™d go outside to talk to women lmao.â€ People go outside during quarantine, to stores and shit to buy stuff, not that youâ€™d know, youâ€™d probably never know the difference between quarantine and normal life you sad sack of shit.

I love yâ€™all and hope you can find happiness with your waifu one day â˜ºï¸ you look so cute with that photoshopped picture of you and (waifu), (name, most likely something western, like Edward)-San.
