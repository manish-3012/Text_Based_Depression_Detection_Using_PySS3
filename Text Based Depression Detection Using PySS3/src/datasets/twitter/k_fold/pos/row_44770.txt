Remember when Mineplex copying Hypixel drama was a thing back in 2015? Obviously, Mineplex has just been totally stagnating for a few years now, but do you all remember back in 2015, when people were so fucking mad about Mineplex copying Hypixel?

In retrospect, this was the most pathetic shit ever (And let's be real; Mineplex only got popular on account of CaptainSparklez playing on it), but people were taking it REALLY seriously.
