tried to help a karen today ok so i'm at work and went on lunch 


there was this lady getting food for her daughter and she was short by like 30 cents so i got out a dollar and covered it for her 

thought it would be nice but she just kinda goes like "ugh" and then takes the dollar and gives it to the cashier 

the cashier hands her the change and instead of giving it to me she fucking hands it to her daughter and says "hand this to grandma" 

hope they enjoy their fucking food i paid for
