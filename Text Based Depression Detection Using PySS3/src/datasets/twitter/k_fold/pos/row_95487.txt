I really need advice Guys this is serious and Iâ€™d really appreciate some helpful advice.

I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting, spelling etc

So I'm a really tricky situation, I guess Iâ€™m (m15) in a pretty abusive family. Me and my parents get into fight constantly and they are often pretty nasty (shouting, calling names, insulting, etc) We were going to therapy for about a year now but it just got worse, I have decided that it wasnâ€™t the thing for me after a psychiatrist told my parents to put me into a psychiatry for children and teenagers. They didnâ€™t research it at all and just forced me to go there wich ended up not being helpful at all and just made me feel uncomfortable. At one point there was physical abuse, my dad beat me up and I have also beat him up once. This has stopped and now itâ€™s mainly verbal abuse. Me insulting my dad and him constantly talking about what a failure i am even when were not fighting and laughing at me. We just got into a fight this morning and now he is threatening to take away my phone and my laptop which i really need for school unless i come up with some stupid written agreement about how i act in the family. 

I just genuinely donâ€™t know where to go with my life.

Everything except in family life is great. Iâ€™m doing really well in school, have a bunch of friends. Have a bunch of hobbies etc.

Please tell me what i could do.
