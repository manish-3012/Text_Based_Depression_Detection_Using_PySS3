My best friend came out My best friend (f) told me (m) that she is lesbian. I fully accept that and I am very proud of her coming out. I am just very â€žstroke by a lightningâ€œ if that makes sense... Tomorrow we will meet and i just don't really know what I should ask or talk about the situation. 
What are some do and don'ts or do you have any advise to not make this absolutely awkward?
Thanks in advance.
