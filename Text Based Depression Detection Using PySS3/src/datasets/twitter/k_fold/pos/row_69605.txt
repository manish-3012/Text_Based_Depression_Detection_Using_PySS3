I eat ice cream by sucking it from a hole in the bottom of the cone and I suggest you do as well, Here's why: 1. It's way more efficient than licking the ice cream making it melt in your hand

2. You will get a constant stream of ice cream in your  mouth

3. You can eat it faster than anybody else giving you the chance of getting seconds

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk :)
