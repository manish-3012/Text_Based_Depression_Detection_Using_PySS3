Need help with a physics question if anyone is smart Janet and chickens took the farmers truck for a joy ride. As they returned home, Janet wants to turn off the truck and let it coast up the hill to the front of the barn. The top of the hill is 25m vertically above the bottom, while the slope of the hill 75m long. The truck, chickens, and Janet have a total mass of 1500 kg. Determine how fast the truck must be traveling in order to coast to a stop just at the top of the hill in front of the barn.
