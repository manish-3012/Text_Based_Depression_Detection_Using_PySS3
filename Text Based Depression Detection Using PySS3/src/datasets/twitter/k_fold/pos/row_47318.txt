Thereâ€™s a place in france where the alligators dance Thereâ€™s a place in spain where they break glass panes

thereâ€™s a place in greece where they eat cheese

Thereâ€™s a place in wales where all the bread is stale

Thereâ€™s a place in Laos where people yell â€œNOWâ€

Thereâ€™s a place in space where youâ€™re voted out with grace
