I hate being always the one that have to say something first after â€œfightsâ€ I am always the person who will send a text or say something to the person I had a fight simply because I do not want the tension between us, but even if the other person is guilty, I still have to do it because I know wont do it probably because of their pride but now I'm just tired of it and F them.
