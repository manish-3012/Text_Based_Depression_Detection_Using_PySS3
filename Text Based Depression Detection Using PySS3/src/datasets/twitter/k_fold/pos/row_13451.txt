What do I do I'm kind of in a sticky situation.  


For instance, let me set up a scenario:  


Person A is starting to work on something they like. Something they're passionate about and they really like what they're doing. His first intention is doing everything alone. But the thing is, Person A wants to get his ideas and his creation out there, and make it known by a community of people. But doesn't know the best way to do it.  


Enter Person B, who says to him, "Hey, I can help you get your creation out there." So he does and he brings some of his friends to help. Person C and D. They do what they promised, and later, Person A likes what they did for him, but soon, realizes something: He wants to start doing everything alone. Like he's always wanted to do. So now Person A has to make a choice to tell Person B, C and D what he should do next:  


"Hey, I appreciate what you've done for me! But now, I want to start doing this alone. I've learned from you and I know how to get my creation out there now.  However, I want to start working alone now. i'll create a separate community and take my work with me, but still give credit to guys, since you got me started on this."  


(I'm in person A's situation)

Is that last question a dick move? Like just taking the creation you made, and making a NEW community with your own work, continuing from the people that helped you get there?
