Ok it's time for real talk Why the FUCK, do parents think every word i say is with attitude. How in the hell are we supposed to talk to them if everythings an attitude problem?? Like fucking No Karen, just because I said it actually *is* "that bad" to go 20 over the speed limit in a school zone, WHERE THERE ARE FUCKING CHILDREN,  doesn't mean i have an attitude it means you're in the wrong and slow the fuck down!

Fr why can't we call our parents on shit without them dismissing us as having attitudes??
