Does anyone else feel like their being left behind? I see a lot of people my age or younger who are way more accomplished and driven then me. And I canâ€™t help but feel like a failure. Iâ€™m someone who doesnâ€™t invest a lot of time in a hobby or have many friends. I canâ€™t be alone, does anyone else feel like this!
