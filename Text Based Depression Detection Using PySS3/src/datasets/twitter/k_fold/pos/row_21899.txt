I turned 20 today, bye teenagers! I love this sub. This is truly a great place for young adults. We get to know about many inspiring achievements and get genuine advices from people of our age. Teenage is a crazy time and hope everyone here enjoys it!! 

PS: My only meme which reached hot was in this sub :)
