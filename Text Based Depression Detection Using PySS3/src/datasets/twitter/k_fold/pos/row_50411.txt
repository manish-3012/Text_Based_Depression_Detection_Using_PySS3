My older cousin is the embodiment of what I will be when I am older. I have 3 cousins(all siblings). My youngest cousin, 23, is working a full time job that makes 70k a year, and is going to propose in December. My next cousin, 24, had a 4.8 gpa, and got perfect scores on the SATs. She also passed 3 laws. My oldest cousin, 29, is single, working 2 part time jobs, and living at home. (not bashing her, because rent is fuckin expensive). She's not doing terribly for herself, but when you look at the other two, much younger siblings, its not as impressive.
