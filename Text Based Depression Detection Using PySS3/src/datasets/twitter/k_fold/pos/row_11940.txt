I need help deciding what I should do for school. My mom works at a COVID-19 hospital. Iâ€™m supposed to decide whether I want to do hybrid school or at home school. I will be in three AP classes, and I sucked at home school last spring. I donâ€™t want to give anyone the virus if Iâ€™m carrying it but I donâ€™t want to absolutely flunk 4/15 classes in the school year (you can only fail a max of 3 classes in my school and classes are split by trimester, so 15 classes in a year). I donâ€™t want to be lonely either, I havenâ€™t seen some of my friends in person since March. What should I do?
