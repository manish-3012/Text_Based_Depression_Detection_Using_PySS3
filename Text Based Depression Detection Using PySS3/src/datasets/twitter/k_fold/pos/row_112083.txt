If someone tells you to stop doing something, maybe you should STOP. I was talking to someone, and they made an inappropriate joke. I told them to not because it makes me uncomfortable about some shit that went down a while ago. Lo and behold, they make another one not a couple of hours later. It honestly really hurt to be treated like that, even if they just "forgot". 

So if you ever get told that something makes someone uncomfortable, keep it in mind so you don't end up hurting them. And if you accidentally do end up forgetting, delete the message and apologize immediately. Even if it may not seem like that big of a deal, it really is for others.

And if you want to tell someone that you're uncomfortable, let them know. If they don't respect that, they weren't a true friend anyway.
