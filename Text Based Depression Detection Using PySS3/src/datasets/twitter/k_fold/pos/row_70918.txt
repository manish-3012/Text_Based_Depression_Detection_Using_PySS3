Why do I feel this way? Hey. I'm pretty new here, so I don't expect many of you to see this or reply. I'm a month away from turning 15.  But, I've felt very depressed lately. I don't have depression, nor do I have any symptoms. I've been very sad and I've felt like a boring person lately. And I'm freaking out because I've never felt this way before. I feel like I don't want to do anything with anyone for a while.

But, long story short, is this normal to feel this way?
