How prepared are you for an apocalyptic event? Do you have some sort of plan? How about the utilities and skills  necessary to survive in a post apocalyptic world?
I've been thinking about this the past few hours, and to be honest, I would not be able to do much if an  apocalyptic event happened. I am thinking of making some sort of survival kit and think of a plan to improve my chances of survival.
Please serious replies.
