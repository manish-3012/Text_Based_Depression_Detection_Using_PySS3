I'm so tired of online classes Maybe I'm just really slow when it comes to learning, but online classes are so stressful and I don't even know why. I don't feel like paying attention to learn about something I couldn't give two less shits about, but I'm forced to since my grades ride on these classes and I'll disappoint my parents if I fail. The teachers aren't even teaching properly, all they do is read from the textbooks without elaborating or ask us questions that even we don't know the answer to.

And it really doesn't help that my siblings are natural geniuses who can pass with straight A's without putting in any effort, and my parents now expect the same from me. That's just unfair.

I try to reward myself by telling myself that I can do the things I love during the weekends, but online classes have exhausted me out to the point where even my hobbies feel tiring and unfulfilling.

It's just so stressful. Maybe a therapist might help, but therapy is looked down upon where I live, so I don't think that option is available to me anytime soon.

Isn't there anything I can do to just feel better?
