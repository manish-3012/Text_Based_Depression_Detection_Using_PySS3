Hey guys Itâ€™s ya boi here . It has come to my attention that reddit and r/teenagers has become really bad . I donâ€™t normally make serious posts like this but the toxicity on this app is next level , I feel like I have to address it. An example of this is mentioning the app tiktok . People on here make it seem awful , as if it is a massive cringe fest- I then decided to download it to see what all the fuss is about . It is a perfectly normal app and once you find the videos and content you like itâ€™s brilliant . When you bring this up people say â€œItS StEaLiNg  YoUr DaTaâ€ and bring up things like bad trends with children involved . Itâ€™s the same with any app ( there will always be horrible stuff ), and when itâ€™s the American government stealing your data everyone is ok with it . Another thing is the bullying people for enjoying things like fortnite or personally attacking  people because of political views . such as supporting trumpet  - im not saying Iâ€™m a trump fan but people are entitled to their opinion and as long as it isnâ€™t racist , homophobic or sexist itâ€™s ok . Not saying trump isnâ€™t that but as long as they donâ€™t support his idiotic decisions itâ€™s harmless. Basically , some of you have a superiority complex about using reddit and itâ€™s just sad how blatantly entitled some of you are . Iâ€™m not saying everyone is like that - Iâ€™ve met some amazing people on here . Thanks for reading this and hope you have a good day , donâ€™t bully people for enjoying things like fortnite and scroll on :)
