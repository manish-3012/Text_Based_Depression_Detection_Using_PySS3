Idk maybe this might help someone Ok so before you call me a weeb degenerate a watched A Silent Voice. It made me look at the world a little differently. Great movie 100% you should watch it. But life is really worth living, and  there will always be petite who benefit from you not being there but there will be people that also benefit from you being here is ok to be selfish once in a while if it helps you realize that the people who want you here will be affected way more than the people who donâ€™t. Someoneâ€™s finding someone who cares about you deeply is a way to know people care about you and are willing to help. You need to be ok with asking for help even if someone canâ€™t help you directly you need to accept what they suggest. If you really want to commit suicide no one can really stop you they can try but in the end depression is a sickness, would you really want to die to a curable sickness? 


Also some things that helped me: go outside focus on making you happier with yourself that could mean anything from getting a ton of money or something simple like getting all your homework for the  week done. 


Just please keep pushing through, I believe that you can get through this sickness just like many others can, you are strong sometimes you need to find the strength within
