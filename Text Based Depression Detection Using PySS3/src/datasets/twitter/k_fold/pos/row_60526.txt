Can believe McDonaldâ€™s ad On Spotify theres an ad for McDonaldâ€™s and at the end it says, â€œtell the person at the window cactus jack sent you.â€ They are just making it hell for the workers, every 4 seconds â€œyou know what I came for! *sicko mode starts playing*â€ ugh why did the ad tell them to say cactus jack sent me everyone is already saying it  smh. Ok done with my dumb rant
