Is it a normal thing for someone to not even wanna give out the first letter of their name or the continent that they live in? So I had met this guy on a Reddit chat, and we started talking on Instagram...over conversation went something like this.

Me: Hey. So now that we're on Insta, my name is Luna, what's yours?

Him: Uh...I'd rather not say.

Me: Is there a nickname you'd rather go by?

Him: Uh...I'm not comfortable sharing that either.

Me: Fair enough. How about the first letter of your name though?

Him: This is making me incredibly uncomfortable. Can we please talk about something else?

Me: Alright. So where do you live? I live in Orlando, Florida.

Him: I'd much rather not say...

Me: You don't need to give the state or city. Just the country.

Him: I'm not comfortable sharing that either...

At that point I was getting mad...

Me: Alright...what about the CONTINENT though?

Him: Please just stop. Can we move onto something else?

Me: Alright...but just saying, you're the most paranoid fucking person I've ever met. What exactly are you trying to hide that you can't even give the first LETTER of your name or your continent?

Him: I'm sorry about my behavior. I just don't want anybody to find out who I am. I don't even wanna give small hints.
