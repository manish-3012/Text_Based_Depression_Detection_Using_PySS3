Why are people making a shitstorm about the super straight stuff? I mean, like they donâ€™t want to date trans people. Why is that a big deal? And I donâ€™t really understand how itâ€™s transphobic to not want to date trans people, itâ€™s just their preference, just like if you like blonde haired people rather than people with brown hair, yâ€™know?
