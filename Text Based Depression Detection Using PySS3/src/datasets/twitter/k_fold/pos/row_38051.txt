Some People wants to watch the world burn. It's me, my name is Some People. My life was going great. My mental health was there, I was healthy, and I was overall having a great time. I was brainstorming ideas for a project I wanted to do when all of the sudden, I accidentally flushed my earring down the toilet. One earring, not the other one. So now I'm stuck with one earring from my favorite pair to remind me of how much of a dumbass I am. I really enjoyed wearing those earrings. Ruined my whole day. Anyways how your life going?
