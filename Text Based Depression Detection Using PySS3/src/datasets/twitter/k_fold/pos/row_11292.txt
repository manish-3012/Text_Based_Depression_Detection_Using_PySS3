Schools (atleast American schools, I can't speak for others) need to start making teachers coordinate with how much work they are assigning and meeting preset limits on hw. This year has been hell and schools have just been feeding the fire with so much, but one of, if not the biggest issue is large amounts of homework. Students can't work on their social life, clubs and sports, or learning valuable skills outside of school, fit in time to focus on yourself and mental health, or even sleep a lot of the time. Our schedules and mental health are being crushed by teachers who all in all need to do little work with what they have assigned (I have seen the grading process, it isn't hard and has no mental or physical strain, it's just kind of tedious)

Not giving a generation time to work on outer life skills and hobbies like cooking, maintenance, basic plumbing, electric work, maintenance, joining the labor force and internships, killing club and extracurricular participation, and more due to large amounts of homework on top of everything that's going on right now is setting us up for failure with lack of life and social skills, and it pains me there is such a simple solution right there.

If schools would simply put a cap on homework length, they could determine it by question, pages, estimated time taken, etc. If a few teachers need to put more out they put it out there too faculty and discuss what larger assignments can be moved back or modified. I am not looking to get rid of essays and the like, but I doubt I need 7 pages of chem alone after each class period, and that's not even considering everything else.

I know I can't do all that much but I just wanted to share my thoughts. We are witnessing so many members of this generation being set up for failure in many aspects of life and it is also greatly affecting our mental health and safety, there have been 3 teen suicides in my town this month alone (descent size, under 60,000 over 30,000) I am just sick of useless faculty not considering students as human beings and just as robots that can do as much work as assigned, they work off of the equation more homework+ students = higher test scores and more money to blow on sports and I am sick of it.
