Hereâ€™s what I think they should have done about Covid and what they should do about schools reopening(USA not other countries) Instead of students taking a couple months off school for lockdown, why not take the full year then pick up where they left off? For example, if you were in Middle School and in the Freshman year of high school, and lockdown started on March 20, you would be in lockdown for the whole rest of the year until March 20, 2021 then resume Freshman year until summer vacation. Yes, you age one year and youâ€™re grad year is something different and sure itâ€™s a full year on lockdown but it would help so much with preventing COVID-19 and scheduling summer sports and extracurricular activities. The sooner we get back in schools, the more COVID cases there will be for kids and families and possibly more deaths. And schools reopening now? This is not the time we should be required to take online school or wait until next year because we will just have to take another quarantine anyway. I donâ€™t mind waiting longer or until a vaccine is out if that means that I can go to school like normal, I dont want to do any â€œhybrid learningâ€ options or full online where itâ€™s just filling out brainless paperwork and not learning at all. Kids are still going to take masks off and that kind of thing because they donâ€™t take this thing seriously, and some of the really young kids probably have no idea or can comprehend whatâ€™s happening.
