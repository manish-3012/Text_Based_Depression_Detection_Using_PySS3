(Iâ€™m Asking middle and high class youth and adolescents mainly who celebrate Christmas ) do you feel entitled to your Christmas presents? Of course you do, I mean why wouldnâ€™t we, itâ€™s natural right? But seriously if on Christmas morning you wake up, do the standard routine, but then when itâ€™s time, your parents say â€œno we didnâ€™t get anyone any presents this yearâ€ then they reveal empty cardboard boxes under the tree, what would you do? Probably something terrible. Hereâ€™s another question, what if they instead said â€œwe didnâ€™t get you anything because you were bad this year, but we got your brother all the presents he wanted because he was Goodâ€ how angry  would you be? Technically this is fair, so why would we be mad? Because we are bad people, but you could change that for youâ€™re self. If you can make peace with the possibility then you could be a way better person. Not like Iâ€™m gonna do that but just a thought, kinda cheesy I know but I sound like a pastor or something lol.
