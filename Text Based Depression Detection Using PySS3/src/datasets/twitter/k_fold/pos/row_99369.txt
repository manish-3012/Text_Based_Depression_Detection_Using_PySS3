[NEW to Guitar] Amp settings for a VT40X Vox? [NEWBIE] Amp settings for a VT40X Vox?

My dad and I share the same guitar and amp, a VT40X Vox and a 94â€™ Fender Stratocaster. Iâ€™m trying to learn Sweet Child Oâ€™ Mine as my first song on Guitar. Donâ€™t know how to really get a good sound (tone?) for the guitar though. Should I or should I not use distortion? I realized I have been playing Acoustic Guitar songs on an Electric the whole time, and was wondering on when I would start playing solos. Any tips from people who play guitar? I would like to play what one would call a riff, and someday even â€˜shredâ€™, if they arenâ€™t the same thing. Sorry if my lack of experience made you cringe lol.
