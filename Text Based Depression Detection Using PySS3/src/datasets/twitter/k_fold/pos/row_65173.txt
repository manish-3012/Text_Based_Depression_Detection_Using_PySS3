Omg, guys, my step sister just took my bed This morning she got stuck in the dryer, even though I could see, she was not really stuck, she still made me pull her out of there. Now she's on my bed saying she's scared in her room. Wtf, she's 17, and she can't be scared of ghosts or whatever. Now she saying she's got back pain and wants a massage. Wtf Sarah, I'm not your freaking doctor. I guess I'm sleeping on my chair tonight.
