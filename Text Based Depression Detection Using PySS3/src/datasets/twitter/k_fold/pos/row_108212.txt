Please help me save the game I love! Nintendo recently issued a C&amp;D to a popular Super Smash Bros. Tournament series called The Big House. This C&amp;D is mainly targeted at Super Smash Bros. Melee and itâ€™s â€œmoddedâ€ version called slippi. This was made by a small group of passionate players to allow smooth online play from home, and has become more important especially during the pandemic. This 19 year old game has defined many lives and hopefully has been apart of yours as it has been apart of mine.  If you care about this, or want to prevent big companies from taking down content made by passionate fans. Please sign this petition.

 (The Melee community has also overcome battles with Nintendo, in 2013 when Nintendo removed Melee from EVO, to then retract their statement when fans were upset.)
