I honestly think I'm wasting my time trying to get my friends to go to the movies. I suggested to a group of friends that we go see wonder woman on monday, everyone said yes, but no one seems into it after I created the group chat. I might be organizing it abit too heavily, but no one seems to be responding when I ask if we should go get something g to eat before it, or if we should go straight there. It just feels like I'm doing all the work
