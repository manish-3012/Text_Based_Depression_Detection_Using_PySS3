I love my sisters So we gave my mom her Christmas gift early it was a teddy bear with a voice recording i didn't know whos voice was recorded on it but when my mom played it thats when the tears came it was my grandma who passed away 2 years ago we haven't heard her voice since the day she passed my mom and I were bawling my mom, sisters and I were the closest to her so that hit hard all i have to say is be grateful for your family cherish and spend time with them while they're here
