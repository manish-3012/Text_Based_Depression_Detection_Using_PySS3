My dog has finally died People say God takes people because he gets lonely and wants someone new, but why my dog? He was only five years old. And the last memory we gave him was that we were bad people, and popped him in the face. I feel, honestly, terrible. It hurts a lot to have something you love taken away from you. I hope people may never feel this pain that I do. As for my dog, may he rest in peace.
