Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? â€œAre you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?â€ He whispered in my ear from behind. His gentle breathing left shivers down my spine. His soft fingers trailing along my shell. His squeaky voice seemed so silly before, but now it was as though it had total control over my mind.

He was gentle, but somehow domineering. I knew it was wrong, being his boss and all, but that just made it so much more erotic. â€œI said, are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?â€ He asked in an assertive tone. â€œYes...â€ I whimpered. Iâ€™d never known Spongebob like this. I never knew he was the type to dominate. There were so many thoughts rushing through my head. I was wondering how I was gonna act around Spongebob at work now; at the same time I wanted to fill every single one of his holes.

Iâ€™d always fantasized about Spongebob. Heâ€™d skip around in that skimpy outfit. That tie always made him look so sexy. It was always just a fantasy though, or so I thought... I never imagined this could really happen. But it is happening... right now. And I like it. â€œSpongebob... me boy...â€ I moaned. Spongebob grabbed a clean rag and shoved it in my mouth to keep me quiet. We knew Squidward could walk in at any moment, what we were doing was so dangerous

But that made it so much more enjoyable. With one more thrust, Spongebob exploded in me. I looked behind and saw his devilish smirk. I expected after this to pretend it never happened... but Spongebob didnâ€™t like that idea. For the next few weeks, we were having the time of our lives. It was fantastic. I looked forward to it every night. Going to Spongebobâ€™s house and being with him in his secret sex dungeon was exhilarating.

He truly was more grown up than I thought...
