Why am I a subpar human being Last yearâ€™s trip with my friends: the girls have a couch, they go get snacks. Another guy comes and steals a spot on one end. They come back, act all mad, and then squeeze in next to him. 

This yearâ€™s trip: I tried the same thing. Guess what? Disgusted looks, and then they spread out a bunch of blankets on the floor so I could have the whole 4 person couch to myself. 

Like geez, I know Iâ€™m not a 6â€™ dude with blond hair and rock hard pecs, but surely iâ€™m not a human shitstain either, right?

Little things like this shouldnâ€™t bother me, but somehow minute details manage to give me the Great Depression
