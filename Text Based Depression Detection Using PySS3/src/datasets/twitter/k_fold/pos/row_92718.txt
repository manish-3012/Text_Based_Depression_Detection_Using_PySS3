i just want to die at this point (was debating on posting this but i need to rant)

everythings just been going to shit, it seems like i cant keep anything that's fucking good for me.

I'm getting really fucking tired of it, no one even asks if I'm ok anymore except like one fucking person and they're like 4 hours away

my family literally doesn't give a shit about how I'm doing mentally or like physically

I'm just so fucking done
