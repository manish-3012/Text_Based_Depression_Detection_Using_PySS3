EXCUSE ME LISTEN UP IF UR UNDER 18 If ur under 18 change your email and everything the day after ur 18th birthday (bc u have to celebrate ur 18th birthday of course) just incase youve been hacked and they steal ur credit card info or your bosses cant background check you on the inappropriate things you've said when u were 13 and dumb. I'm 14 and I think my google account info was sold on the dark web but I'm not smart enough to remember a new password and when I'm 18 I'm not taking the risk of loosing everything I've got for school and I'm lazy plus I have smart lights TV and everything and I'm moving out at 18 (hopefully). this is just for your safety and background checks in the future.

oh and remember ur old email just in case like on a note pad.
