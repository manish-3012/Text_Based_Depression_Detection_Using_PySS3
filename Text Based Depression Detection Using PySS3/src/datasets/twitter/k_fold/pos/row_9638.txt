guys, i need your advice... I've lost my dad for almost 7 month now, he passed away due to sickness.
And I lost one of my grandma last week (my father's mother).

I don't know if i'm mentally strong enough now, but i'm at a point where i don't know what to do anymore with my life. I mean i'm living with my mother, i have some friends at school, i'm still in very good terms with my brother and my sister, all of this is very fine, but i'm mentally not doing good. I'm crying almost every night alone in my bed.I'm 18 and I've been single my entire life because i'm too shy, and i'm afraid to bother girls i found cute because i have too much respect for them, which kinda sucks because i'm feeling alone and that's hurting a lot, and especially when i'm seeing that all my friends are in love with someome else...

Tbh i'm That type of friend who is the funny guy at school, but when i'm at home, i'm not good at all, because i have almost no friends to talk to. I'm spending a lot of time on my computer playing video games with my best friend trying to get away from the reality, but it's not always working.

I think your telling to yourself "why don't you go speak to your family or friends" and that's true, but i don't want to do it because I don't want my Mother my brother and my sister to be worried about me because they were a lot recently for my dad, and i don't want to talk about it to my friend because i don't want to bother them with my problems, they probably have some on their side.

I rather talk about this to strangers, because i'm not getting the feeling of being judged, that's why i'm posting here.

I actually have a whole bunch of other things to say, but these are my main problems, so if you have any advice, i'll take them, thx in advance and take care :)
