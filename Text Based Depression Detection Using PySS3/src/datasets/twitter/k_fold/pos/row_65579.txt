Saying / asking for trans people's birth names is so unbelievably disgusting Like I'm not even soft you can call me a tr*nny and I don't rly care but deadnaming is so evil and sick, a lot of people hurt themselves or commit suicide over it and it's serious and you can disagree with being trans but everybody deserves the basic human right of having their name.
