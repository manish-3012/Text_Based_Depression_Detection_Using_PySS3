Someoneâ€™s flirting with me but I have a Gf and itâ€™s getting weird. So I have this one friend group right and we always get together on friday nights for game nights and to have dinner. itâ€™s consisted of a couple guys and girls. my girlfriend doesnâ€™t really like to go because sheâ€™s not too social which is fine by me. however, this one girl in this friend group recently started flirting with me and itâ€™s obvious. like iâ€™m not one to toot my own horn and say that people are into me. like everyone says that sheâ€™s flirting with me. 
I havenâ€™t mentioned it to her but Iâ€™ve talked about it with my girlfriend and she says she sees it too when she actually IS hanging out with us. 
idk this doesnâ€™t seem like a big deal written out but for me itâ€™s just weird because I donâ€™t wanna break up this friend group but i also want this girl to stop. 
anything i should say or do?
thanks guys. :)
