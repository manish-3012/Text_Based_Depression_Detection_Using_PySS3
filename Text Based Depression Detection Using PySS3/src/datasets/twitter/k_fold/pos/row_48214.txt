My thoughts on people using gay as an insult I think when people use gay as an insult or to say something is bad it's not offensive, I see it as someone saying something is sad, for example I collect Pokemon cards and someone said to me "that's pretty gay" and I said *how though, I think they're savage"


Today someone said "that's pretty sad" and you know what I said? "how though, I think they're savage"

In both situations what the said wasn't literal like the guy who said it was sad was hardly gonna burst into tears, so the guy who called it gay wasn't gonna say that I like dudes.


I'm not homophobic myself, in fact, I'm bisexual.


These are just my thoughts so feel free to disagree with me.
