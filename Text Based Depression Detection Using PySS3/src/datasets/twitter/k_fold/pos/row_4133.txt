Ugh I'm so tired and I'm done with life. I stayed up way too late talking to my boyfriend but I wish I stayed up longer cuz now I feel bad that I couldn't stay up and help him

Oh and the reason why I'm done with life is because nobody other than my boyfriend cares about me. My mom yells at me all the time because I'm a bad daughter and my friends say they wish they never have to see me again. Nobody fucking likes me but that's ok I guess.

I love you all &lt;3
