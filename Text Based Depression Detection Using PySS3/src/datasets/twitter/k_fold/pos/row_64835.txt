Beliving in lies told by the education system (Do not click on this if you are easily infuriated) Most teenagers know better than this, and it is why what I am going to say is so disappointing.  
Most of my classmates have been brainwashed to believe in anything that anybody throws, including lies, at us, and trying to talk sense into them just ends with either a food fight or an injury.

**The lies they believe in include:** (Please note that none of these are my opinions, they are things that the brainwashed people in my school blindly take as fact)  
1. Wikipedia is the #1 place of lies  
2. Child P\*\*n is OK on TikTok  
3. The district admins respect your privacy  
4. Reddit bad, TikTok good  
5. Pedophilia isn't as bad as it actually is  
6. Minecraft is so trash that Notch deserves to be killed for creating such a terrible game  
7. Adblockers are illegal  
And those are just the top 7 lies believed in this hell we call school. Who knows what other blatant lies are taken as fact
