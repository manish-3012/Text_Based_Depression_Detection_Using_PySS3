Is it weird to ask a guy in my class that I've never talked to before out? So me and this guy have never talked before but we've had some classes together. He is really cute and I just got out of a relationship so I'd really like to shoot my shot. 

I've thought about I wanna do and there's two option. One is to be friendly and tell him after class that I think he's really cool or something like that and ask him if he'd wanna hang out. The other would be to just be straight to the point and ask him if he'd like to go out with me. 

The problem is that I have mad anxiety (as probably seen in the above paragraph LMAO) and, while I can brush the fear of rejection off, I'm worried he's gonna think I'm weird for asking him out after never talking to him. 

And side note kinda relevant: I don't know how to start a conversation at all. I can easily hold one and I enjoy talking to people, but for the death of me I cannot start a convo. So any tips for that too would be appreciated :)

TLDR: Wanna ask guy out in my class, never talked to him before. Should I or is he gonna think I'm weird? If yes what should I say LOL
