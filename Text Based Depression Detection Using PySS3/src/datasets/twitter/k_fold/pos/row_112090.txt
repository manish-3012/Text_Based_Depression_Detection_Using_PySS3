I think I made a mistake I was hanging with like 7 girls and a guy (I'm a guy as well) and one of the girls was doing a beautiful matte lipstick to the others, and then she asked me "do you want me to do it on you?" And she was shocked because I answered "okay go ahead" and she said she waa surprised but happy I agreed (gay marriage is illegal here and homosexuality is unacceptable so to find a guy this comfortable with himself is near impossible) but I've come to terms with myself that some makeup or dress doesn't define who I am as a person, so I let her do it. And all the girls started screaming "omg you look so beautiful it's perfect on you" and kept complimenting me, which is cool and all but now a girl messaged me to try more shades on stuff. I don't like makeup, I want people to see the real me, and I feel that makeup alters my face from how it looked before, nothing against people who believe otherwise, also I'd probably get killed if I ever do it publicly, worst mistake is that I tried makeup in front of them, now they'll always try to tag me in whenever they do their thing
