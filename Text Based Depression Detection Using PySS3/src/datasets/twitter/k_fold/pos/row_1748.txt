Had fun today So today was damn fun! My friends and I went to the nearby park and we had fun playing the sand. Then we decided to go old school and we played catch. I was caught three times out of the three rounds we played. We then decided to go for a cycle ride around the park and to nearby areas. Then we got a bit bored then we played Among Us where I was the imposter for two times in a row. And I won both the he games. It was fun today.
