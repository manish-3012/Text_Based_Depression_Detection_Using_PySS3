I want to join the military but for selfish reasons 16 male I have alwas wanted to join the military but I really donâ€™t care about helping people I feel like the real reason is I want the adrenaline and stress and all the thing people donâ€™t want from it like I feel itâ€™s a experience that if I donâ€™t have I wonâ€™t I really donâ€™t care about the benefits or the status for some reason I just want the structure but also the anarchy is this a selfish reason for wanting to join? I also feel like itâ€™s more of a suicide thing I donâ€™t fear death it just doesnâ€™t faze me anymore I could care less if I died I just wouldnâ€™t want it to be for nothing am I selfish for this?
