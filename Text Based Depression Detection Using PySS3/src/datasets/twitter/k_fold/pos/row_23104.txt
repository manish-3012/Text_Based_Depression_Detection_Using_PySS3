I know too much about death Itâ€™s weird. Iâ€™m slightly fascinated by death as a concept. It ends everything, and everything can kill you. The only issue is that i also accept death as a natural part of life, and so people either think Iâ€™m depressed or suicidal (Iâ€™m neither) or completely insensitive because i donâ€™t fear death, whether it be mine or othersâ€™. Anyone else similar or have any questions?

I might delete this, so donâ€™t be surprised if it goes poof
