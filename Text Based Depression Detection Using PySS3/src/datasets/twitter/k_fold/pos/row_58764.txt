i saw a dog *not* shitting today: A story no one asked for but i just had to. so I'm in the park for my daily walk and there's this stray dog I see, tryna shit, so when I approach him on my way he gets nervous or whatever and runs away. Later towards the end of the end of the walk I see a bunch of dogs around the same dog from before and he's trying to shit again but the rest of them are just standing around, so he gets nervous again and goes away, later I see a black dog sniffing his little poo and then the original dogs butt. 

wierd ass dogs.
