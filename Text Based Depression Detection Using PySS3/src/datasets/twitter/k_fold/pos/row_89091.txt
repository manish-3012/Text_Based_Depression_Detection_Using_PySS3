I think iâ€™m gonna come out soon just kinda feel obligated to. i found some labels that fit me (gyne enby) so I think Iâ€™m just gonna do it. Iâ€™ve felt like not cis het for a while but i think these are the labels. I think Iâ€™m gonna distance myself from a lot of people by doing this but honestly i couldnâ€™t give two shits anymore. gotta find a new name tho, my current one isnâ€™t gender specific but i do just kinda hate it
