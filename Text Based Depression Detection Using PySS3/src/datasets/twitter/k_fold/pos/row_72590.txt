Anyone else find the â€œHey, old person hereâ€ comments on this sub a little creepy? Like Iâ€™ve seen a lot of posts with â€œHey, old person here...â€ comments on this sub and they make me feel wierd and creeped out. Yeah, most of the comments were giving advice or saying some joke but itâ€™s still wierd. This sub is for teenagers, hence the name. Like, why are you on the sub in the first place? And yeah, it could be like a users parent or like a 20 y/o which would kinda be considered â€œoldâ€ for this sub but it really wierd me out.
