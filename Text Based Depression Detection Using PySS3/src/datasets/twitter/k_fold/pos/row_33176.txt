Iâ€™m kinda mad at my mom for a stupid reason Disclaimer: English isnâ€™t my first language so if I donâ€™t know words or my grammar is not good then sorry.
A little backstory: i was quite active before quarantine, going to the gym and going to the outdoor gym (like a yard with things to workout with) with friends, and swimming. 
Now because of quarantine I became a kind of couch potato, I still swim and work out but I workout less (like once a week now) and I was really tired today and didnâ€™t feel like swimming but I still went nonetheless,  the swimming was brutal (I have a coach? Iâ€™m not I a team but he tells me what to swim) 24 laps for warm up (the pool is 25 meters or half Olympic) and after that eight times two laps which after that I almost collapsed, I could barely talk and move my hands, I went to sit and drank water my coach told me to wait because I havenâ€™t ate in five hours, so I waited and rested and when I got back I did four laps and then six laps (sorry for the long explanation I just canâ€™t stress enough how tiring it was) so when I got back my mom practically blamed me for almost collapsing, she said because I havenâ€™t worked out as regularly my body canâ€™t handle it, while she tried to lecture me I was spaced out and tired. Now Iâ€™m kinda mad at her, sorry for the long rant lol
