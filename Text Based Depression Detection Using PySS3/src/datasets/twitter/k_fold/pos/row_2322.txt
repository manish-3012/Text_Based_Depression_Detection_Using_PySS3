Fear of growing old Iâ€™m only 13 but the very thought of growing old terrifies me greatly. It isnâ€™t necessarily the fact that iâ€™ll die, but the fact that iâ€™ll be a senior with wrinkly skin and white hair one day. Trends happening now would be considered â€œold and weirdâ€, ill look back to the present thinking about my obsession over anime, wondering why i was so odd. All my precious belongings would be just memories. Iâ€™ll having trouble walking, talking and even breathing. Time will fly by and in no time i would be old ugly sick and irrelevant in my 70s. This fear is so bad that i constantly think about dying before reaching 35. And i might actually put it to action. And as i grow older, my fear becomes worse and worse. Now, looking at old people sends me into a panic. Even as i write this, iâ€™m crying. Iâ€™ve asked around if anyone else has this fear but no one i know has this. Searching on the internet only brings me few results. The most relatable result iâ€™ve found is this reddit post on the suicide watch subreddit 8 years ago:[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/s723l/chronic_fear_of_aging_is_making_me_suicidal/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_title)

i donâ€™t know what to do and nothing seems to calm me down. my parents tell me this fear is stupid and no one actually experiences this. 


anyone please help-
TIA :)
