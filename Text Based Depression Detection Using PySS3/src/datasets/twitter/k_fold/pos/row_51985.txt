I feel like I kbow insider secrets. So I was asking around on the Air Force subs and people have told me about a program at the service academy for people who want to do special operations. But the thing is, there is no public information about the program and if you search the name, nothing comes up and google doesn't know what you're talking about. So I feel like I know some insider secret that civies shouldn't know.
