I want to help a friend with what seems like a eating disorder Hey so I recently asked a friend of mine about how the fuck is he so skinny which he replied to that he doesn't do it on purpouse and he wouldn't eat at all if his parents didn't tell him to / force him to eat because he just doesn't ever really feel hungry. He isn't underweight but is on the verge of it and he told me that he's somehow barely able to gain any weight. Any ideas on what this could be? I don't want to ask him further because I know it can feel uncomfortable for him and he event sent the messages as spoilers on Discord so yea, any ideas because I'm really concerned about him would help. Thanks.
