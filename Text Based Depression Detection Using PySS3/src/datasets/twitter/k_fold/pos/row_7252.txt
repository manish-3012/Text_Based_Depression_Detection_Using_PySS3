I think one of my friends just killed himself. I've known him for months and over that time we have talked a lot. Just the other day his girlfriend left him and he lost his job. We talked about it and he was obviously sad but said he would be okay. I heard from him early this morning and he said he had drank cyanide. I've texted him multiple times and he hasn't responded or even been active since he said he had already drank it. I don't even know what to do.
