My dad broke my headphones and monitor :((( So I was done helping mom and told her I'm going to play games so I wouldn't be able to hear you. After 15  to 20 min she went out for shopping. My dad came home after a while and sat on sofa. And yelled to get water for him but I couldn't hear because I was wearing headphones. Mom wasn't home either he came into my room and broke my monitor and headphones without any warning and said my phone is next if this happened again and make sure I don't  see your room's door closed again.
I mean I never locked it, but it's ok. 
I'm sure I will have to witness yet another loud argument when my mom comes back. What should I do ?
