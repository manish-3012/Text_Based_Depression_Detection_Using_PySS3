Considering taking a break Hello, Iâ€™m considering taking a break from reddit. For the past few days Iâ€™ve been sleeping downstairs and I havenâ€™t been scrolling Reddit at night as much so my sleep schedule has improved. How would I take a break from this app? Itâ€™s like a parasite, I kinda donâ€™t want to use Reddit anymore, I havenâ€™t used it in the past few days and Iâ€™ve felt better about not being as tired but I want to be able to not think about it anymore
