When I realize just how much the college Football team where I live has affected I life Like it's easy to not even pay attention to it but once you look back over it it's incredible just how much football (American) has actually ended up affecting my life. I live around Columbus so football season is like the beating heart of this entire sector of the country and I swear when the Bucks are playing, *everyone* knows. Like, that's the time traffic practically goes down cause everyone is meeting up at people's houses and watching it together. It's really nice to think about how it actually does a good job at bringing people together. Not only that but my dad is a huge football fan and we've been to plenty of OSU games and they are some of my best memories with him. When you really look over it it's really a nice thing.
