9/11 is pretty sad but I feel as if we ignore other issues I donâ€™t mean to downplay 9/11 here, I know a lot of being that have been negatively affected you it so saying itâ€™s dumb or whatever is just idiotic. My problem is that we seem to care so much about this and ignore like every single other genocide basically. We straight up make fun of Japan for getting bombed and thousands of innocent people died there. We ignore the stuff going on in places like Syria because itâ€™s not American soil. I think we should start putting equal emphasis on other disasters too rather than just our own because it makes others people experiences seem pointless when in reality they experienced just as much of pain that some people did on 9/11
