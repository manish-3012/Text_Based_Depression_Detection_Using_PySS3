My parents are taking away my Car insurance for failing grades Iâ€™m well aware I am failing several classes as many of us are seeing incredibly low performance this school year. I acknowledge that this is entirely my fault but punishment doesnâ€™t exactly make sense. Iâ€™m a 3 sport athlete and my parents are consistently making me late when they drive and thereâ€™s tons of other things Iâ€™d like to do as a â€œyoung adultâ€ that wouldnâ€™t be possible or extremely difficult without my car. Iâ€™ve been failing classes since 6th grade, Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with ADHD but my parents have ignored it as a plausible cause to my struggles in the classroom. Itâ€™s hard to focus this year and it is incredibly difficult to find any reasonable motivation to actually accomplish work. Iâ€™m not stupid so they forced me into more difficult classes but I havenâ€™t been able to get myself to get my head in the game. They havenâ€™t been helping and literally said â€œwell you gotta just focus and find that motivationâ€ wow! Howâ€™d I not think of that??

Anyways, Iâ€™ll figure something out... I think.
