Iâ€™ve gotten a volunteer job for a studio. Recently this studio gaming studio that happens to be located in the state I live in has just told me I will be play testing a new VR game the studio is developing. I think itâ€™s called the â€œFreddy virtual experienceâ€ or something like that. Hopefully I will be able to enjoy it and have a Funtime play testing it before itâ€™s set to release.

P.S yes this is a repost deal with it.
