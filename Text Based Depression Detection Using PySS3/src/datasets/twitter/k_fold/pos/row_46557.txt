Some Redditors will be forever single The other day, I was thinking to myself that the â€œsingle guy lonelyâ€ stereotype of redditors isnâ€™t true. I have a friend, and thatâ€™s enough for me. Then I realised that no one has had a crush on my in my entire life. Same goes for an irl friend who also uses reddit.
