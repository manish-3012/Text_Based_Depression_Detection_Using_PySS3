I need advise I got quarantined before my school quarter ended and a test was had while I was gone. Now I have a 0 the next quarter and my dad wants to take my phone and no matter how many times I explain he just says there must have been something I could do. I also recently realized that my anxiety was coming from being isolated from my friends and only seeing them in school. Iâ€™m worried my anxietyâ€™s will come back but my dad really wants to take my phone tomorrow.
