I FINALLY HAVE FRIENDS TL;DR Spent many years with no friends, now i finally have friends 

Since grade six, when i changed schools, i wasnâ€™t able to make friends, but at the start of the year i made one friend, but she stole my stuff and snitched on me all the time, so I stopped talking to her, and everyone liked her so everyone stopped taking to me.

Seventh grade, i marched i to school all confident and excited to make friends and start new, then had everyone make fun of me for my personality. I still donâ€™t know what i did wrong to have everyone make me feel like absolute shit. Same thing in year 8 as well, i lost every bit of confidence after that and became really anxious around people.

Year 9 i changed to the school my primary school friends went to, but for some reason they didnâ€™t talk to me either, i guess after all those years of not seeing each other that often meant they didnâ€™t need me. Then this kid in my class bullied me constantly as well.

Now Iâ€™m at a new art school for year 10-12s, but the start was so hard i donâ€™t have the words, but basically the first week i felt so anxious to get out of bed and enter school, not knowing if I would be an outcast or get bullied again, every little crowd i was around made me feel overwhelmed and i had to quickly walk away, and this caused me to end up not making friends, and i was too late anyway because everyone else found their new friends. So i just forced myself to accept it and just sit alone every day like I always did.

Second week i stopped feeling anxious because i settled in, no one bullied me and just left me alone, so it was alright. 

Third week everything changed, i was eating my lunch alone as usual, until some kids from my class came up to me and asked me to join them. I sat with them and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Iâ€™m now included. I have a place somewhere, and theyâ€™re really fun to be around, I nearly forgot what it was like having friends, but now I finally feel like theres nothing missing in my life, i have people to talk to, people to joke around, this is really all Iâ€™ve ever wanted for so long, and i finally have it. 

Sorry this ended up being so long, just needed to get it out
