I just made out with my gf for like 15 minutes and feel like a million bucks She lives at the shore for the summer+covid+I work an 8-5+she works+ other stuff makes it really hard to see each other, much less in private.

I had family over to watch Hamilton, and she was back in town for a grad party. She met my grandparents and aunt, and watched the second act with us, and then stayed after. 

My parents and sister went to bed, and we still had time before curfew so we made out.

And I feel great so fuck yeah.

And please don't comment anything stupid, this isn't supposed to be a flex or anything, just wanted to express to the void how I feel
