if your name starts with a P and you like Steven universe and you stream and Pokemon and oh my dont want this to be a dead giveaway aaaaaa it took me a while to sit down and start writing this and ranting late in the night in r/teenagers is probably not the best way to go shoulda done this in r/unsentletters BUT thereâ€™s a higher chance of the person Iâ€™m writing this to seeing this....if thatâ€™s what I want, do I!??? 

We met on reddit (I honestly forget your username well I think I remember but every time I search it up I get nsfw accounts ðŸ—¿) about a year ago! but I havenâ€™t talked to you in almost half a year.   I think of you often. I dream of you. youâ€™re very much the last thought I fall asleep to. My first impression of you is something I so foolishly hold on to when I always knew it would never do me good. I canâ€™t help it I want your approval I want your affection. Is it selfish....perhaps. Whenever we talk I feel as if the distance between us mean nothing. yet I think thatâ€™s why not of this worked. Yet I couldnâ€™t reach you. I wanted to be enough so so bad. 

Iâ€™m really proud of us for trying to mend the friendship. It didnâ€™t work out and I donâ€™t expect it to again or that we will cross paths again and try to redo all of this. Yet I still imagine every scenario with you. We can hold hands again in them. I would hold you again my chest when you cry. I could still wake up with you. 

I still love you. I hope you still love me too.

Iâ€™m sorry itâ€™s cheesy, but theyâ€™re my honest feelings. This felt good, thank you for the space r/teenagers.
