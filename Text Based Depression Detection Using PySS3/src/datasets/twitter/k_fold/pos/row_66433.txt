someone coughed on me today i went to school today wearing a face mask, it isn't required in the uk but i wanted to regardless. anyway, i was in a graphics lesson (like art but you do photoshop and stuff like that) and this ass who doesn't care about the work was having a conversation with his friends. so i'm just on my own doing my work because i want to get a good grade and from behind me i hear him say 'excuse me' to his friends and him walking over to me. i glanced over to see him walk up to me, lean in, cough in my face and walk back to his friends.
not much but that brought down my day

but hey, on the other hand i saw a great black-back gull among all of the common gulls that infest my school, so that was pretty cool.
