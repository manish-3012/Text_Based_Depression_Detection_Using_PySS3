I'm scared for what is to come In 2 years I'm supposed to be on University.

I like to think I have everything sorted out but the mere thought of actually becoming a responsible member of society makes me anxious... "Am I good enough" is something I ask myself every day without finding an answer. I try making an answer but as I try to, I simply get distracted and keep failing to come to terms with the fact that maybe I'm not the best I could be, or that maybe I'll never be since the place and mental state that I live in, with constant fear of not living to expectations and dissapointing my parents, with my two younger siblings having to look up to me since I'm the the oldest on an ever competing family to see "who is best"... It's not the way I want to live.

I'm tired, many times I've had suicidal thoughts that I simply had to push aside since it doesn't matter what I do, I need to keep going forward even if I feel like just crying.

No, this isn't a cry for help, this is me trying to accept reality and push forward once again, like many times before...

In 2 years I'm supposed to be on University, and I don't know what to do with my life.
