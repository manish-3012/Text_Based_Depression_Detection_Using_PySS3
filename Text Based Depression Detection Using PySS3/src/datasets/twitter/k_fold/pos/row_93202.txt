So, it just was my 16th rl birthday and and i decided to make it a special one, and i made myself an objective to celebrate this one with my gf, which i hoped i will have found by that time. me, being the ugly shithead i am, of course, couldn't attract and find anyone. so, i celebrated this bday alone. of course, i didn't tell my friends about this, because then they would make fun of me. fuck me and my unrealistic aspirations, ill never find a gf
