how to get a girl to love you not clickbait: dont be a fucking creeep  
dont ask for pics  
dont ask for nudes either  
dont ask for phone number as soon as you meet her  
dont ask her out on a date when you just met her  
do not and I repeat do NOT FUCKING STALK HER   
NOR CYBERSTALK THATS FUCKING CREEPY TOO!  
If she doesnt like you respect her decision, not go full blown "yandere" or some shit thats just edgy..  


Always treat her right. do something nice to her and respect her opinions and thoughts  


maybe you'll get a girl one day, theres always the perfect one for you.  


dont say "Ill never get a girl"  
thats not true  
you will get a girl.
