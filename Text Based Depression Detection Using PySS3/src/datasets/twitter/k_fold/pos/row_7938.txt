Humans are such sad beings Imagine being an ant you donâ€™t need no friends you donâ€™t need all that bullshit of going through awkward situations and shit like that to just get a friend. Your lifeâ€™s purpose is to serve the queen, but you donâ€™t have feeling about it. You donâ€™t have anything against it. You just kinda live on and see what happens next. And then you discover what a human is and you look at him from the ground and they are so complicated, they just keep on having arguments about the moat little things. And when they do something wrong their whole world collapses and they canâ€™t do anything about it, they have too much brain lobes, they are just so dramatic about everything. 

At least i am talking about myself, i am the pathetic one here whoâ€™s life is going the best way possible but i just complain about every little thing, i canâ€™t even take a bit of a harsh joke from my friends without thinking, why am i treated like this, when i treat them the same way or even worse. I donâ€™t get enough attention and i feel like i donâ€™t matter to anyone, i am like a fragile porcelain cup that is almost broken, so when you do the smallest thing to it it just shatters.
