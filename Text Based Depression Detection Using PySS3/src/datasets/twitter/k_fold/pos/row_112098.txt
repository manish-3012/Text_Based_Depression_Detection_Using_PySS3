I think I am depressed I always put on a fake sort of personality whenever iâ€™m at school or with friends. The moment I come home iâ€™m unmotivated and stuck in bed. I try to distract myself by doing work or going to the gym but nothing seems to work. Thereâ€™s been some personal problems in my life but I really donâ€™t know how to stop all this. I have tried drinking coffee to boost productivity but that lasted about three days and now I am back to being in bed. I have a tough time opening up to people and I can never properly vent completely. 

Does anyone know any tips or ways to try to overcome this slump?
