My mum has a stupid theory about the Amazon Prime streaming service Okay so she watched one movie, then a month or two later, it became free to watch on Prime. So now my mum thinks that everytime she watches a movie, it will be free a month later. Why. Just why. There is no reason for Amazon to do that, that doesn't do anything for them! It's called a coincidence!

Sorry I just had to rant here, she keeps on saying it and it keeps on pissing me off
