Opinion: Raising minimum wage is a really bad idea In states where you get paid 7.25 before taxes thatâ€™s sucks living off those wages, especially if you live in a city.  The idea of printing more money to meet the cost of living may sounds like a good idea but by doubling wages that skyrocket the cost of living. Hereâ€™s a quick list

1. It decreases the value of the dollar, so the cost of food, rent, bills, and even owning a car becomes difficult.

2.That doesnâ€™t increase the number of jobs. If you already live in a small town where thereâ€™s not that many places hiring thatâ€™ll screw everyone up

3. Most employers canâ€™t afford to pay that over night so only places that could hire is cooperations and the federal government.

4. It would have a domino effect on every other job that pays higher wages. So if you had a shitty, salary based job like law enforcement, your salary would still be only $2-$4 above minimum wage. Fast food managers make more than that. Itâ€™s not worth it
