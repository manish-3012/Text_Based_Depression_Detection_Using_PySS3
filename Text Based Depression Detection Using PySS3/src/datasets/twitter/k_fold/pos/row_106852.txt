Yaaay! First time getting kicked out while skateboarding! I was searching for spots near my house and found a perfect parking area. I was skateboarding and suddenly a guard showed up out of nowhere and this is how out conversation went:

Guard: What are you doing?
Me: I m skateboarding.
Guard: You need to leave.
Me: Why there is no car here.
Guard: It s private property.
Me: Ok get me the owner I want to talk to him.
Guard: I m calling the cops.
Me: Ok i m leaving but i ll come back later.

The guard was a twat cause there was literarly no car in the parking area and I wasn t destroying anything.

Anyway i ll go back later i ve found my spot i will befriend the guard.
