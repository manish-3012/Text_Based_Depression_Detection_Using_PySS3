Fun for a second Thereâ€™s a little bay a bit away from house. I walked down to it today. I listened to some music and bundled up with a knitted scarf as a spent a few minutes walking. I imagined myself sitting peacefully by the water mouthing lyrics to some of my favorite songs. 

When I got there I noticed a group of people across the water. They were far away but I could still hear the echoes of conversation. I felt too weird to sit down on the bit of pavement. I wanted to just ignore the people, it should have been easy. But it wasnâ€™t. I didnâ€™t know these people and I probably never will. Yet I was still uncomfortable.

Well whatever Iâ€™ll just stand about, thatâ€™ll be fine. I did that for about 10 minutes before a couple with two dogs approached. I groaned and hoped they would make a turn. 

They didnâ€™t.

I looked away and just thought about what to do. I decided to walk away as soon as they got to where I was. I began to walk away when I heard the ring of their dogâ€™s collar get nearer. I thought the dog was right on my heel before the sound lessened. I looked back after walking a bit farther and saw they were gone. 

I walked back to the bay but at that point it wasnâ€™t special anymore. The â€˜joyâ€™ I felt was gone. I procrastinated leaving cause I didnâ€™t want to let it go. 

I walked home. 

I hope I have the courage to sit down next time. I really wanted to enjoy the moment.
