The "truth" that you were taught in church was nothing more than your pastor's personal perspectives and subjective interpretation of the Bible. Realizing this was a major turning point for me when it came to breaking down and deconstructing faith. If you think about all the Christian resources that offer to help you, from sermons, to devotionals, to workshops...etc., they are all just the opinions of other people with a "divine inspiration" label slapped on it. One pastor says something is acceptable while another condemns it. Two pastors who both claim to each know "the truth" will point to one another and call the other a false teacher. It's evident in the plethora of denominations that make up Christianity. There are as many versions of Christianity as there are Christians, it seems. It really shows that this religion was made by people and it concentrates power in the hands of the leaders and spokespeople. It just becomes a cult of personality.
