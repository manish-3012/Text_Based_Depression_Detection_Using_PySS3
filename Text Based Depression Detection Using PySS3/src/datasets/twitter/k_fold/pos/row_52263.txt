yuh i just feel useless in this quarantine. like i havenâ€™t done shit and if anything iâ€™ve actually been doing less than i was before like before quarantine i played my uke and guitar pretty regularly and the last 4/5 months iâ€™ve totally fallen off. i also tried working out and eating healthier and ive prolly gained weight. plus school is starting back again and for the month of online i did at the end of last year my grades totally dropped, and now i hafta do that for a whole year? hey maybe kill me now thanks
