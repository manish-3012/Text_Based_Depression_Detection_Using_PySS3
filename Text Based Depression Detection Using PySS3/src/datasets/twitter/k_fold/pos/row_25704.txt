Online school is somehow getting worse I made a post on this sub before about my shit grades, but school has only gotten worse to deal with. The first thing is my schedule has completely changed. I'm out of all my college classes, which wouldn't be that bad since I was failing nearly all of them, but part of the reason I chose such a hard schedule is because at least at my school, academic classes are easier than electives. We're moving to hybrid in a week, so I'm supposed to go to school, but my schedule is still fucked even after the changes, I still don't have a 3rd hour and I'm supposed to go to school with that. The school councilor told me she was emailing my dad about my schedule changes, when in reality she was telling him how fucked I am and how I'll probably have to take summer school. The funniest part is the percentage of people failing at the end of last year was more than 50%, so you'd assume they'd make some big changes, right? Maybe make schedules easier to follow, attendance more lenient, and less work, right? No, in fact they managed to do the opposite of all these things. Instead of having an alternating call schedule for every 2 classes depending on the day, you have a minimum of 30 minute call from each class every day. They're also making it so attendance must be done ten minutes after the class starts, but some classes didn't even have attendance before. And for work, no joke, I had 25 assignments in my first week back from winter break. What an absolute joke, I don't know how they get away with this.
