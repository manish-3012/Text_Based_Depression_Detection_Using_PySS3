What excuse can I give for spending $150? If thereâ€™s a reason Iâ€™ve been doing part time jobs, itâ€™s because I wanted to cosplay, but didnâ€™t have the money to do so as most of the money in my bank account was given to me by my aunt, and itâ€™s meant for learning driving.  
  
But now that I have the money to cosplay, itâ€™s just a matter of getting past my parents.  The problem is that the last part of my cosplay is a mask, something like a mascot head which costs about $150 as its custom made.  
  
The dress, boots and satin gloves were pretty cheap, so small amounts being deducted from my bank account could be easily passed off as me buying food or some in game currency.  
But for the mask, I know my parents will get suspicious once they see such a huge amount of money being deducted. And I donâ€™t want another lecture from them on wasting money.  
 
What solid excuses can I give them if they ask me why thereâ€™s such a huge drop?
