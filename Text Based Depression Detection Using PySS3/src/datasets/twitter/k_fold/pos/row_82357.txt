I lost my good mate on Sunday Last Sunday my mate died in a car crash. I still can't figure out if this is real or not, I've physically accepted it but mentally he's just been busy the last few days and hasn't had the time to hang out. Don't really know why I'm posting this, I guess I'm just trying to search for ways to make this real for me, so that I might be able to help out my friends and be able to help them through this too. Idk, I guess this is another attempt, I just need to say it in a neutral place like here instead of talking to my mates or my family.
