Hello GAMERS Hi there, i know this isnt the best subreddit to ask  this ,but i dont useally use reddit on pc and i cant find a good pc building/ help sub especially with my 8gb of ddr3 ram not helping and loading slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

So i wanted to build a pc for a while now but im broke so the most i can do rn is look at parts. My budget is around 850 dollars (3500 pln) and i think i found parts that fit right in that number. My GPU of choice is the Gigabyte GTX 1660 super 6GB oc, and yesterday i realised that the oc means overclocking (whitch im not planning to do) . 

Im wondering if the oc the card IS already overclocked or if that just means that it CAN be overclocked?

If anyone is wants to know the full pc spec i will list them in the coments.

Btw i typed this all with my left hand olny cause my right one is broken so sorry for any mistakes lol
