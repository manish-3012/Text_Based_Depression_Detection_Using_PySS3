Is it bad to have thoughts of intimacy? Iâ€™m a 17 year old boy.I donâ€™t wanna sound like Iâ€™m thirst of creepy or always horny but like Iâ€™ve never been intimate with someone someone and I have thoughts of what it would feel like.mi really want to experience that. Is it wrong to thing about it? Itâ€™s not something thatâ€™s always on my mind and itâ€™s not like those thoughts cloud my judgment or anything theyâ€™re just thoughts that come across my mine from time to time very often. Is that ok or should I not be thinking about it at all?
