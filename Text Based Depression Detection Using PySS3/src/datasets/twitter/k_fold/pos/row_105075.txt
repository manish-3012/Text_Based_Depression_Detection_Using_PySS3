Iâ€™ve been working in this assisted living inside the kitchen for about a month now, and my team members literally donâ€™t talk to me idk why. Iâ€™m quiet, but none of them arenâ€™t gonna say hi :(

Everyone there is a little over my age but still. I just keep making eye contact with em but it turns out to be weird and awkward and so nothing happens after
