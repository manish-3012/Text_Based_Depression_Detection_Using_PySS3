I realized today, that i read way too fast. My english teacher uses a web service for a couple book websites that can tell how much a student reads, but i read at least 400 words per minute, or at least that's what my teacher said, and i was the first one done, and after i finished, she thought i just skipped, so she gave me a test thingy, and i passed it 100%



But my English teacher is now giving me more work to do, so now im sad...
