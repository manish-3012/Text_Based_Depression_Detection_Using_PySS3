Is it normal to get banned for saying offensive things in PM? Iâ€™ve been temporarily banned a couple times and finally permanently banned from my main account for saying â€œoffensive thingsâ€ in PM as satire.

Iâ€™m pretty sure the person Iâ€™m talking to wouldnâ€™t report me for such dumb things.
