I don't want to be part of the current world THIS IS NOT A DEPRESSION POST. I AM NOT HAVING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. THIS IS ABOUT THE GENERAL WORLD'S SITUATION, NOT MINE. 

This may not be the correct subreddit, but it's the one I relate to the most.

Now that's out of the way, let's talk. 

Firstly, I'm a teenager. You all know it sucks.  Treated like children, expected to act like adults, school's ramping up, etc. This is most likely the worst stage in human life.

Secondly, I'm a boy. This may seem like an advantage, as we live in a male-dominated world, but when you can get hate for saying something as innocent as men deserve happiness (https://twitter.com/word2mymothaa/status/1370428957871443971 just read the comments) and everyone blaming age-old wrongdoings on your gender, it gets to you.

Third, I'm young. Our generation is expected to clean up messes older people made with no knowledge of how to and less resources then the people who did. Did you know that true irreversible damage to the enviroment from climate change, if things keep going at this rate,  will happen in 7 years? I will either be in or just graduated from college. I won't have a full life on a healthy world. 

TL:DR The world sucks and I am forced to be a part of it.
