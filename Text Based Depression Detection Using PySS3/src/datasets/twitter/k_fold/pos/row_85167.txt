Wanna develop a game? Ok so I have literally 0 experience with coding but Iâ€™m pretty ok at graphic design and I was wondering if anyone wanted to make a game with me, maybe even publish it on steam. Idk just sounded like a fun thing to try. Pm me if youâ€™re interested. (This wonâ€™t be a really serious venture, just an experiment)
