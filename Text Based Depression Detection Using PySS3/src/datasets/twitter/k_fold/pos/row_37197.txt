Just a joke tbh So, I've got this girlfriend who I've been with for quite a while now and since Tuesday, all she's been doing is avoiding me. I've asked her if she's okay she says she's fine. And everyone knows that when a girl says she's fine, she is not. So I just thought "maybe she just wants a bit of space" so I gave her some space. During this week, she keeps going to my best friend and according to him, she's been trying to get close to him. He told me that if she tries to do anything he's just gonna tell her to fuck off. I've asked her multiple times if everything is okay and that she's been ignoring me all week. She didn't even look at me. I've just been telling myself that I'm overthinking everything. Turns out my overthinking led me to the real truth. 

My best friend, that she's been hanging around with, tells me that she told him that she WAS avoiding me and never actually liked me. At that point, I didn't care. I wasn't upset, I mean don't get me wrong I was a bit pissed off, but now that I think about it, it was all a joke. She ditched me to be with my best friend, and she ignored me this whole week. My friend said that she was thinking of breaking up with me. I didn't care. I didn't care at all. She kissed and hugged me, held my hand and it turns out it meant nothing. I never wanted to end this relationship but if this is what it's come to, I guess I have no choice. I mean, she lied to me all this time. So when I go back to school on Monday, I'm just gonna end it. I've thought long and hard about this and I've realised...I'm just wasting my time.
