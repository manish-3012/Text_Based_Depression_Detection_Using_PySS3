you know when like, you suddenly get a gf out of the blue. because of like a competition thing. ok, so. basically i kinda "won" her in like this judging competition she created. personally i like her, she is very sweet and kind. but im just confused personally. like how the fuck is this going to work. i know you can see this person im supposedly dating or something, tbh its just weird.
