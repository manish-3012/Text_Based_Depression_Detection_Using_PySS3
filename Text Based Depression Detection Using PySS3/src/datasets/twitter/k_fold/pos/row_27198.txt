Am i copying? I wanted to post this here because i think most teenagers went through this before, i am usually s quite person that won't say a thing unless you ask me about it so usually my parents ask me a out stuff after they ask my brothers and they almost always have the same answer as me so my whole family just says I'm a copy cat and i should get a life, so i have been into computer science and game development for about a year now but never told anybody so last week my oldest brother started talking about the SAT and the AST exams and how he wanted to take them and my dad asked him what he was interested about, i thought he would say law since he once told us he wanted to become a lawyer, anyway he said he was interested in computer science and now i try avoiding talking about what i want to be or what I'm interested in studying because i don't want them to think I'm even copying the same life choices my brothers are choosing, my family knows about me coding and making games but they think if it as just a hobby and that making games didn't a real job and real jobs are only office jobs so i already hates talking about what i wanted to be and now this? And the worst part is that they fully supported him about it and didn't give a crap about the games i was making
