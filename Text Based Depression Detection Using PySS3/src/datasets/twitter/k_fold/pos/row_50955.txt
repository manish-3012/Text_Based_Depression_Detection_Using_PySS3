What to do if you really like a person, but everybody around you say that I should end it? So I like this girl that weâ€™ve been friends for a while. We were both into eachother, but she friendzoned me in the end and there was a drama. She is really complicated. Everyone I talked to about the situation said that what she had done was terrible and I shouldnâ€™t talk to her at all. After a week, we decided to meet. We had a 10/10 time and we agreed that we were not over eachother and maybe we can try again. Well, everything was going great, we were getting along really well, but then one day she remembered her ex and we got into an argument( she wanted advice, I gave it, she said I didnâ€™t understand and ignored me) . We have talked since then, not well though. She says she isnâ€™t mad at me, but itâ€™s not the same talking to her. She feels colder, doesnâ€™t talk to me the same. I think about her a lot. Itâ€™s starting to bother me. I act purely out of emotion. And I feel that Iâ€™m starting to get delusional. 
She really has done awful things to me, but I enjoy every second being with her. 
Anybody has any suggestions what should I do?
