I just got dumped! I find myself in a rather amusing predicament. For starters I rarely date girls...I f*ck n dump em...but this chick I met a month back I felt like keeping her around after I fucked...yesterday we were having a conversation based on our philosophies, Iâ€™m a very science oriented individual, as such I would dismiss most of her illogical arguments because of her ill reasoning.(for instance I explained to her astrology doesnâ€™t work and itâ€™s just the Barnum effect that makes her believe the arbitrary descriptions, perfectly describe her personality) she then started crying and I, pitying the poor girl apologized to her and said she had the right to believe whatever she felt was real.... anyways I suppose that got to her n she dumped because she felt that I belittled her delusional beliefs and made her feel worthless(the stupidity of some people).

Anyways I thought this was pretty funny so I made a post about it. Excuse my grammar English isnâ€™t my first language.
