what the hell is up with my teacher she gave us the choice of participating in class and some people decided not too BECAUSE SHE GAVE THEM THE CHOICE. then when a student who decided not too earlier tried to answer her question SHE SAID HIS POINT DIDN'T MATTER because he said he didn't want to participate before.
