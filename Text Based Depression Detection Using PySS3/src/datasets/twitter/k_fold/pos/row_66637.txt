the guy I like is the sweetest boy ever &lt;3 today I had a big fight with my sisters (and parents too) and I was feeling so down, so I told him about all that was bothering me and how sad I was, and he gave me a shoulder to cry on (hypothetically, we were talking through texts) when I most needed one. After I apologized for bothering him with my problems and for all the voice messages, and thanked him for caring, he just said: â€œdonâ€™t mention it, Iâ€™m just a guy who likes you very very much, and wants to see you well no matter what :) when we see each other Iâ€™ll give you that tight hugâ€ and I swear my heart just melted &lt;3
