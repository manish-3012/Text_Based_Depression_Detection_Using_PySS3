I already hate this year I just hate it. Nothing is gonna change for me. I'm never gonna get to meet a good group of friends to go hang out with, I'm not gonna meet someone to date, and I'm tired of holding out hope that I will. I've never had many friends and never had female friends either, and that's really sad being that I'm in college already. I don't know how things will ever change for me and I hate it
