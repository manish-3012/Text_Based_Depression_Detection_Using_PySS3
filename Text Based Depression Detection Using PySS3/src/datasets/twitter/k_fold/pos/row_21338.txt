If anyone can help me with home work it would be so appreciated I've been having trouble with homework bc of medical issues and just no motivation 
 I'm in the 10th grade I have a business class, American history, and geometry. 
If I don't have it all done by midnight tomorrow everything is being taken from me and I just don't understand a lot of things or can't focus. 
This probably won't go anywhere but if you have time to spare I would be so pleased, thank you
