Want to get a job but parents don't allow me In detail, I'm currently around 14/15 and in the UK, it's legal for me to work (I can't drop school and don't have plans to). My friends have got jobs at restaurants and pubs near them so I was considering doing the same so I can get some money.

 I asked my mum, and her answer was to concentrate on my studies. This really annoys me since that's what they've been telling since I was 9. It makes me feel like they're telling me I'm an idiot but that's not today's topic. I don't have any exams until next year so I don't really need to spend all my time revising and I'm doing well in my classes.  In top set for most things and never do anything bad, except from short skirts (but that's just adults being adults). 

There's nothing stopping from getting a job, like it's legal as well. My friends have jobs and I've seen a leaflet about teenager jobs at the library saying how it's legal. I was planning on working at the chippy or a restaurant do some waitressing or cleaning. 

I just want to earn my own money and get some basic work skills like customer interaction etc. I don't have anything to do at home, I only have one club on Monday evenings. I get Â£30 a month but I spend like Â£10 on my phone for topping it up straight away so it's Â£20. I like shopping, clothes etc. and Â£20 isn't enough for my shopping habits so I would like to earn more money. I can't ask, they've already raised it recently. 

How can I convince my parents to let me get a job?

 Also does anyone have any advice on getting a job, like what should i say on the call or is it better to go in person. Should I go with my parents or by myself? What do I say especially, do I just ask if they have an opening?
