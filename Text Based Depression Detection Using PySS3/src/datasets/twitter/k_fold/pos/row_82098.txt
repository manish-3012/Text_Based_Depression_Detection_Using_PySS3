Yo can someone help me on my essay. Is this racism?  Although Greg\\ and Peter were both mean to Jin, I donâ€™t think they were being racist. Racism occurs usually when one person thinks they are superior to another due to race, but I donâ€™t think this is the case here. For example, when Greg\\ called Jin â€œBucktoothâ€, or when he said to â€œstay away from my dogâ€, he did not regard himself superior in any way.  Although Greg\\ said it in a demeaning way, it was clear Greg\\ had a cultural misunderstanding of Chinese people, having learned from his mom that Chinese people eat dogs. When Greg\\ called Jin â€œBucktoothâ€, it was clearly just a playground insult commenting on his appearance. However, even though it wasnâ€™t racism, Gregâ€™s words were still mean and considered bullying by definition.
