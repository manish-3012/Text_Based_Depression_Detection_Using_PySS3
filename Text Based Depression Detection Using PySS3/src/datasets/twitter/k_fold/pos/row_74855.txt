To everyone who didn't get a Valentine... Hey don't feel down. I have had people like me, and if they can like me, then the standards are pretty damn low. Dudes, dudettes and dudonts, You're all handsome, pretty, and good lookin in your own way. The person that likes you is probably too shy to admit it, or too scared of a bad answer. Sleep easy, and wake up, feeling better. We don't want you being down. Anyway, need to go to bed, it's 2:05 am, I have school tomorrow, have a good night/morning/afternoon. Bye!
