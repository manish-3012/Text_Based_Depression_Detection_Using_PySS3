My l o v e l y friend Ok, so one of my friends is half asian, but he looks 100%.

now in my primary school being asian, or any other ethnicity aside from caucasian but generally asian fsr, was *bad*, they didn't even care exactly what nationality you were if you were asian you were bad ig. they would always have these jokes they would play on you that was ***Really*** Racist.

So they would squint their eyes at you in different ways and say "Chinese, Japanese, Dirty Knees" (They would only say these ones because that's the only ones they knew ig) Which i guess meant that asian people were always on their knees doing manual labour or something racist. 

So this one guy rocks up to my boi, and does the "Japanese, Chinese, Dirty Kne-""

"Im filipino" then he just walks off, it sounds much less funny then it did then, but the look on the guys face when he realised that there are more nationalities aside from japanese and chinese was worth it.
