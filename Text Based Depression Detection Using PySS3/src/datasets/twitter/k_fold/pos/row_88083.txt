I'm not allowed to get my fave pierced till I'm 18 :( I just got out of a week long mental health rut, and i really wanna change how i look, i already died my hair while I was in said rut. And I've also wanted some sort of face piercing for like 2ish years. I get my parent's reasoning, but it still kinda sucks.

Edit: supposed to say face not fave. And if you're just gonna comment something along the lines of "good" just don't, thanks.
