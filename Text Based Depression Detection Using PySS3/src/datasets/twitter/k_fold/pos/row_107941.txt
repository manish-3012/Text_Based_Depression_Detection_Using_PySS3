Hello Teenagers of Reddit! I am currently looking for friends to play with online, this is mainly because most of my friends that I know in real life, moved away from where I am. So if you are interested in making a new friend, hello I am as well.

About me: 17 (Almost 18) M

What I play on: PC

What I mainly play on PC: Rainbow Six Siege, Modern Warfare, Minecraft, and Among us

My Time Zone: PDT (or West Coast Time)

I know posts like these are hard to trust, but please give me a chance before not asking. I am not very good at posts like these so I hope that I summed this up enough for anyone that is interested. If you want my discord feel free to ask me for it. If you have any other questions feel free to ask those as well.
