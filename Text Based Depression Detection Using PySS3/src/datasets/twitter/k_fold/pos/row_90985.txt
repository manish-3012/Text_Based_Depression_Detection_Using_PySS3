Iâ€™m afraid I might have schizophrenia Iâ€™m afraid I might have schizophrenia, Usually I can tell that somethings going to happen seconds before it does, like a YouTube video appearing on a certain spot in my recommended, I see people in my house out of the corner of my eye but whenever I look at them they disappear. I also sometimes hear thumps or slaps of some kind on my bed whenever Iâ€™m at my desk, and I Also smell things that arnet there, like when Iâ€™m walking through the halls at my school I can smell a Subway or an EbGames. I do have asd so maybe that has something to do with it? I really dont know what to do and Iâ€™m really scared. Iâ€™m 14 so I donâ€™t want to tell anyone about this because I know my mom will be worried sick about me. Idk if Iâ€™m experiencing this just because Iâ€™m stressed or if itâ€™s something else. I really need some help.
