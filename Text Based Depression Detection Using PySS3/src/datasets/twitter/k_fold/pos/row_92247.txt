Friend got a gaming pc, doesn't use it. So don't make fun of me for this but I played Roblox with him basically everyday bc that's all his pc could run, but now he has a really good one and has money for games and he bought the roblox currency instead of a game to play w me. His brother gave him access to his steam library which is massive as well and he wont play any of those.
