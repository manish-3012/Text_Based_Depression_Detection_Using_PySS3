The protest has been done (and it kinda failed) Atleast we are allowed to wear masks if we are in the hallway now. Many students took the masks that me and my friends where handing out, i put the masks that didn't get taken in 1 box and put it in the hallway. Only 3 other people besides me and my friends helped with the protest. Wich means that the teacher's stopped it very fast. Thats all.

BTW, i'm going back to posting what i normally post.
