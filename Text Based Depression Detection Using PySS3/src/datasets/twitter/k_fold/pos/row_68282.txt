Dude I was walking out of the computer room to go the bathroom And I looked up and thought I saw a spider. I freaked out then got realized cause it was just an imperfection in the ceiling. I looked down again to see an ACTUAL massive spider on the tile floor. So now I havenâ€™t left the room yet and donâ€™t know where it went MonkaW
