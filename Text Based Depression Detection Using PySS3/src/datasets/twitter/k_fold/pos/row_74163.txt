Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 53: William Shakespeare William Shakespeare is, whether you like is writing or not, a major figure in the English language. His works even pressed social matters, like the time he made the general in one of his plays a black man to push against England's treatment of blacks. However, great artists usually commit some vices.

First, he did basically leave his wife and kids so that she had to raise them all herself. He did send them money, but hardly ever saw them.

Speaking if rarley seeing his wife, William did find multiple places to settle his *urges* that were not his wife.

*Romeo and Juliet* is one of his most famous plays, but he actually ripped off another play called *Pyrimus and Thisbe* which, funny enough, was mentioned in another of Shakespeare's plays.

There is debate over whether or not Shakespeare ever wrote the plays, and even more on whether he existed at all.
