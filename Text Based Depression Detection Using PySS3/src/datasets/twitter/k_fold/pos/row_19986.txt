Am I the bad guy? So for a little bit of context I have a little brother .He is 6 and I am 13.He often hits me.You may say that he's only 6 but once I made a joke that I ate his croissant and fully kicked me in the stomach and face with his leg.I kicked hik out of my room and my mom yelled at me because it was my fault.Multiple times he hit me in my nose while I wasn't even talking to him I was just staying on my phone and kicked me in the nose with his leg.He always starts fights and it's ALWAYS my fault for not reacting.My mom says I should hit him too and when I do she yells at me because I barely touched him.I also have a strong feeling that they just hate me.I have to just enter the room and I can see such a pure hatred in my dad's eyes . am I the bad one am I just a cry baby?
