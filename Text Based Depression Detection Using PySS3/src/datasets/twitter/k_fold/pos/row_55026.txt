What's the spookiest unexplainable thing that ever happened to you? One time I looked out my window at like 2 AM and saw a mountain lion staring into my eyes, then it stood up on it's back 2 legs and walked up to my window, then I blacked out and woke up in the morning sleeping on my back (I sleep on my side) fully dressed on top of my blankets, with my shoes on (they weren't on before).
