Hey, I am going to rant.. Guys take this as a joke lol, cause this is about my life XD.

My parents hate me for existing, I am mediocre at everything and my parents raised me by beating me everytime for not being good at studies..

(áµ”á´¥áµ”) 

I am going to be 19 in two months and I still get beaten up by my father for existing. He hates me to the core, it's because of his superiority complex. 
I was never Happy in my life. 
I hate existing :-)

In Bible it says something along the lines of beating their children while they are young so they get discipline.
Them being a catholic Christians they tool that too seriously.

The only reason I soo rude to my parents is because of the childhood they gave me. 

I am prolly going to die soon, ï¼ˆ^_^ ï¼‰
No one knows that I am this depressed.

It's okay.

If only I was tall, if only I wasn't ugly.. 

It's okay, life is unfair (ï½¡â—•â€¿â—•ï½¡).

I never opened up to anyone. 
But here I am.
