How should I talk to my crush? So I like this girl, but  I never got to ask her for any forms of social media in school. So I have been doing distance learning and the only way to contact her would be through school emailing, is that cringe? Should I just wait until next year? What should I even say if I do message her? I barley even said anything to her last year.
