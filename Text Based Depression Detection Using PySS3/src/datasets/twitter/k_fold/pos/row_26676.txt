To the desperate mfs out there Idk how some of y'all out there are so desperate for a gf or bf that it literally makes you depressed and hate yourself. I'm 18 and I've never dated anyone but that's fine cause I know I'll find a gf someday. Take a sec to look at yourself and understand the fact that crying in your pillow won't get you anywhere and it's not impressing anyone. Quarantine gives you the opportunity to improve yourself physically and mentally so don't let it go to waste.

Also 99.9% of the "I AsKeD mY cRuSh" posts are fake and no you aren't "missing out" on anything except fake internet points so again, relax.
