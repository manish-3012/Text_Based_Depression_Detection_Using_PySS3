Why was I not invited? So this girl who I went to school with and was friends with, didnâ€™t invite me to her fucking party. What Iâ€™m the actual fuck. She invited my best friend. What the fuck? She didnâ€™t even tell me there was a party or it was her birthday. I donâ€™t know if I should text her something passive aggressive or nice. Iâ€™m texting her for sure, tho. I found out from my best friend. I wouldâ€™ve come because she was a (kinda) friend and wouldnâ€™t have wanted to.
