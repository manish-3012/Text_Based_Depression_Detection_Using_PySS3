I dot know if itâ€™s the right place but here it is I feel like shit all the time and like a failure to everyone

I canâ€™t sleep I canâ€™t talk without feeling regret and fucking sadness for everything Iâ€™ve done over the past 2 years I feel worthless I fucking. I contemplate ending it all on a daily basis I just feel like shit. I donâ€™t know how to end this as of know but everything I do feels terrible and like I am in a vacuum slowly sucking out all the air.
