BE YOURSELF. YOU DONâ€™T NEED TO CRY. This is me: The Year-10-Weeaboo-Weirdo-Neko-Pan-Man.

I am probably the strangest person youâ€™ll ever see, or read. Itâ€™s not a Direct thing, like Iâ€™m trying to seek attention, just who I am and my properties. I have always been the Weirdo, and I take pride in that. Whatâ€™s wrong with Weebs, Nyah? Nothing. I came out as a Pansexual awhile back, when we could actually go to school, and I have always loved that. And I recently fell back into a state of depression, and my Neko personality makes me feel happier Nyaah~
(Iâ€™m also male)


YOU MATTER. DONâ€™T LET ANYONE TELL YOU OTHERWISE. EMBRACE YOURSELF. YOU ARE YOU. It Doesnâ€™t matter what clothes you wear, or how you like to be. Be Gothic, Be Emo. Be Furry, Be Neko. Be Straight, Be Gay. Be Weird, Be Normal.


And if youâ€™re a pedo, just keep your hands to yourself.


Be *You*.
