So i just found out most of the people I know hate me I was on a call with one of my friends and he said â€œyou know, everyone hates you.â€I was confused. Then he said â€œyeah. A lot of people think youâ€™re really annoying.â€ I asked him for names. He gave me the names of my crush, Sophia, one of my closest friends, Noah, and another friend. Ian. I donâ€™t know what to do.
