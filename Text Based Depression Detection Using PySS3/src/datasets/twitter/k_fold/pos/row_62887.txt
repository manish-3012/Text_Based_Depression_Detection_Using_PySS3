Oh look, itâ€™s an â€œIâ€™m 20â€ post! Tbh havenâ€™t really been looking forward to this birthday cause I feel old as fuck and 19 passed by really fast but Iâ€™m American so I guess I have 21 to look forward to? Also as of currently itâ€™s the 14th and I will be 20 on the 15th, which where I am is in about an hour. So I guess some advice would just to be enjoy your teen years because they go by quicker than you think. Like really, it doesnâ€™t feel that long ago I was 13. But also teen years truly are transformative and you come out a completely different person. But yeah.... hereâ€™s to 20.... almost!
