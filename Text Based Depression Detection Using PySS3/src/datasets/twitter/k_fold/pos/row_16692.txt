I just gotta talk about how Mountain Dew Game Fuel beats its whole purpose So the can of Mountain Dew Game Fuel is designed in a way so that you can close it. That's one of the reasons it's supposed to be for gamer because if it can close then it won't spill all over your equipment. BUT, when you open the can it just sprays all over the fucking place! It's because of how small the thing you pull on is and you then slide it back. So basically, if I have Game Fuel and want to drink it, I have to step outside like a goddamn smoker so I won't get my whole room sticky.
