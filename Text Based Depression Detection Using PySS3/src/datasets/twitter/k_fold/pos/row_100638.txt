I want to die My pc was stuck in a bootloop so I turned it off and went to make sure my pieces were in right, I was in the process of saying it might be my cpu when my dad walks in and talk to me about it for a minute, he then proceeds to rip my fan off of my cpu without even warming the thermal paste, so now Iâ€™m panicking bc I was gonna order some thermal paste and replace it after I was done but now my cpu might just be fucking dead so Iâ€™m panicking, if you are still listening, that is all, goodbye
