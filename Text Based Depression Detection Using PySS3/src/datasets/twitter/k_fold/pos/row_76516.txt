Hello fellow teens, I once again am bored and ask for a DM. Hey, I'm Seth m14 (yes ik my bio says 13, refer to [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/DannyDeCheeto69420/comments/l50frk/ok_if_u_r_here_visiting_my_profile_read_ahead/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)), and my hobbies are video games (mainly Nintendo) and watching yt for the most part. I'm the kinda person u can say whatever's on ur mind to, I promise I will never judge u and I'll always try to give advice, unless told otherwise. If I sound like an interesting person feel free to hmu, and thanks in advance :)
