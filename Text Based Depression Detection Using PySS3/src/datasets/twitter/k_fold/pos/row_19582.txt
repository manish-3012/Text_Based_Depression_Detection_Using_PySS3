Its ok to admit that there are problems with how guys are expected it act... "Man up" Culture is genuinely exhausting sometimes. Not being comfortable talking about problems and being expected to show no weakness. I understand the feeling of wanting to appear "manly" and appear tough but holy shit the expectation that guys who want or NEED to talk about their problems are unmasculine destroys lives. I dont want to appear needy or even fucking feminine for expressing problems honestly.

Also none of this discredits problems with how girls are expected to act, both genders can have face genuine societal issues and both genders can also be causes for some of the provlems the oppsoite gender faces. Being honest about those issues is simple as expressing them honestly. Its petty as hell to turn the issues into a sex war (and not the fun kind)
