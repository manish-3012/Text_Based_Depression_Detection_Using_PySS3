Hi Everyone I am trying to make a form to workout what colour is associated with different emotions. if you could take a moment to fill the form out it would be super helpful. Ok. So the reason I am doing this is that I am taking a lighting drama GCSE course. and need info on the different emotions associate with colours the drama piece that I am working on. so if you could click the link below and fill in the form that would be amazing.
