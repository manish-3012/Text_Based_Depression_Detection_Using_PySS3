All I want is support. All I want is support, but I dont expect anyone to provide it. I understand that I'm too emotionally draining for anyone to want to stand by me while also hearing me berate myself constantly. I'm draining because I refuse to change. I want to keep being horrible to myself, one of my own abusers. I don't expect anyone to give to me because all I've ever known is take. People take and take and I don't mind. I've been trained to not mind. Take my happiness. Take my love. Take my life. I don't mind. I'd rather die than keep suffering like this. Just worsening my old suffering instead of escaping it. I probably deserve it. This is probably hell. Wouldn't that be funny?


And if you find yourself wishing to comment saying I'm edgy... Don't. :)
