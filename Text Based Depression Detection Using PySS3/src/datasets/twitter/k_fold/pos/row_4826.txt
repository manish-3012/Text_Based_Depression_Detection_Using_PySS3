My mom is a naggy bitch. Just because we're your kids, doesntean we have to do everything you meant is to do. My mom has to go to work in an hour at the time of posting and she calls that "soon." I was playing some MC withy dad and my mom walks in, and literally fucking breathes down my neck saying, "time to shower... Time to shower.. time to shower I'm going to be late for work." A)5.minutes isn't going to make you late. B) I'm playing with my dad which isn't something I get to do every day. And c) i was going to shower. The take away from this is that parents shouldn't think of us as their country and they're the government. If we're having fun doing something that will cost 5 minutes of your time, let us finish. 

Thank you I guess. Fuck you mom.
