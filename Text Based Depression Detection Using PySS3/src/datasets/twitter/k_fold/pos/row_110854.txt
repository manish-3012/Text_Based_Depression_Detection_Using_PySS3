Why does it keep coming back? I've been feeling nothing for 6 years, and was finally feeling better for like 3 months. It was finally feeling like i overcame everything. But i feel like its all coming back. Like it never went away. I am not suicidal anymore and i dont think i will be but i still feel like the feelings are coming back. Sorry if i am repeating myself again.
