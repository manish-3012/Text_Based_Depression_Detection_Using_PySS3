it's 2:49, I have a raging fever and can't sleep. I've been trying to sleep since 7pm yesterday and haven't gotten one wink. I'm either too hot or too cold, my center of balance is totally off and my skin feels super sensitive. I can't focus on much at all. I've given up on sleep and am now downstairs with a cup of tea and my dog. it hurts to look around the room with the headache I have. what should I do now? I don't have melatonin or anything to help with sleep, so I'm kinda stuck there.
