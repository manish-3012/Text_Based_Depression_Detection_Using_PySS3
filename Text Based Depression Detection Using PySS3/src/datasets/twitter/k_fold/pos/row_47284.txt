To the you-know-whats who toilet rolled my tree... The tree in our front yard already got toilet rolled last night. Already. Like it already got toilet rolled. Itâ€™s not even Halloween yet, and our tree already got toilet rolled. Already. It already got toilet rolled. Why is my life so fucking cursed?
