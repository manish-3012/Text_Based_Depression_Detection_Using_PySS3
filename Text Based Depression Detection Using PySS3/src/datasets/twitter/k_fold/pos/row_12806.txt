Feel lowkey proud of myself I have had bad like dandruff type shit forever now and I just started to use some good shampoo a few weeks ago and I'm hyped bc I actually went somewhere(family friend house) and didnt wear my hood or a hat like I normally do :) . Next i just need to fix my haircut bc it's kinda wack tbh. Thnx guys
