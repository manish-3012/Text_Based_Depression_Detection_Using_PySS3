Parents are annoying me and I just gotta rant Small bit of context that is kinda related in how I feel about stuff, I got a very late diagnosis of ADHD last year so not only to I have that but thereâ€™s a gap of understanding between me and my parents so it leads to issues. (I feel like itâ€™s important to say aswell because how I perceive things can be different to how other people generally do)

Anywayyyyy. I donâ€™t sleep well, my brain doesnâ€™t let me fall asleep easily and thus I end up being up later than my parents, my mother doesnâ€™t mind too much as long as Iâ€™m not being loud which doesnâ€™t happen very often. 
Last night my dad came in and essentially told me that I have to have my light off and be in bed by 10:30, that didnâ€™t happen and he comes in again at about 00:15 and starts a the usual talk of itâ€™s not good enough and that I need sleep etc etc. 
Tonight he came in and said that the WiFi is being turned off at 10:30 to stop me being on my devices and stuff(apparently he was also under the impression that I had unlimited data so I donâ€™t know why he thought this would do anything anyway). 

Itâ€™s feels frustrating to me because I canâ€™t just turn my brain off or decide when I want to sleep, I donâ€™t tend to get tired until about 1/2am at the earliest. So I donâ€™t know his logic with trying to force me, the times Iâ€™ve tried explaining he just doesnâ€™t seem to care or try to understand itâ€™s just, you have to sleep for your own health and I know that thatâ€™s important but I just canâ€™t sleep that easily. It also feels frustrating as I just feel like he treats me like Iâ€™m a lot younger than I am, I turned 18 in 2020 and I donâ€™t know what I expected but Iâ€™d at least hoped that they wouldnâ€™t try to control my actions down to the smallest thing because thatâ€™s constantly what it feels like. Iâ€™m not being loud or yelling or disrupting their sleep it just seems like the fact that Iâ€™m awake bothers them that much.
