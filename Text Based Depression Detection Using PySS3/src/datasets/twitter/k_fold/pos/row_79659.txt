So something happened today... I used to play on this minecraft server called "earthcraft" its a crossplay minecraft server. So i went on the discord to see why there were so amny pings and people were spamming literal porn, these werent trolls, they were everyday players, so i reported it to the mods, they said "its none of my concern." But thats not the worst of it, turns out everyone who has been on the server was DOXXED BY THE SERVER OWNER AND THAT CAUSED PEOPLE TO SPAM LITERAL PORN IN FRONT OF MINORS AND NOW PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DOXX THE OWNER. Im moving on to another server, im gonna play on tg earth more.
