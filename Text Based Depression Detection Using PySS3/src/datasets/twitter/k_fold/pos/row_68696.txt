This is a hate message I just want to give a big SCREW YOU to Kimberly-Clark. They are the people who create Scott's toilet paper. Now, you may be thinking, u/a_good_bagel why would I hate someone who makes that toilet paper? Well let me tell you, it is the CRUSTIEST, ROUGHEST, THINNEST, AND WORST TOILET PAPER THAT THIS SPECIES HAS EVER CREATED AND EVER WILL CREATE.

So, I'm in the bathroom right? A nice quiet and clean place. But this DEMONIC being HAS to ruin it with this sandpaper excuse for toilet paper.

The worst part? It's everywhere. School? Scott's. Local gas station? Scott's. My own house? Scott's. I hate it I hate it I hate it.

Have a good day to everyone except Scott.
