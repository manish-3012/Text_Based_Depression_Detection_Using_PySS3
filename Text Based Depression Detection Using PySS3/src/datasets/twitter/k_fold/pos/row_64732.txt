I need an idea for a semi-expensive gift My dad likes to get me and my siblings one gift thatâ€™s more expensive then the rest for Christmas every year. He says my siblings are easy to shop for but he doesnâ€™t know what to get me, and I donâ€™t even know what I want. Someone help me please! I am female, 14, not interested in makeup or anything of that stuff. If anyone has any ideas please comment it no matter how stupid. Thanks in advance :)
