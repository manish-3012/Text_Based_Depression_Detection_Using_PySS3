I just had another life changing 3AM realization I donâ€™t want a hot girlfriend, I donâ€™t want a girlfriend thatâ€™s a human supercomputer, I donâ€™t want a badass type. I donâ€™t care about all of that, but Iâ€™d gladly take it if they can comfort me.  
I just want a bro who happens to be a girl, someone who honestly cares about me, someone who is willing to give me a warm hug after getting kicked around by the world.   
Iâ€™ve thought for many years that as a dude, I should be the pillar of the relationship, that I want a hot supermodel as a girlfriend, that as man I live to fuck, that I should never show weakness to others, that I shouldnâ€™t ever feel pain for words and I should always march on, but I do want some arms to hold me when I need it.    
I just want someone who cares about me and can express that.   
I just donâ€™t want to be alone, Iâ€™ve tried my best to connect to my new classmates and Iâ€™ve failed everytime. I tried for months finding someone whoâ€™d accept me into a campaign and destiny somehow found a way to make me roll a 1.   
Iâ€™m always keeping to myself and solving my own problems and I just want to have someone who isnâ€™t judgementally watching over me like Iâ€™m speedrunning my drawing or someone who I feel interrupts my privacy and I have to make an excuse for them to leave me alone like itâ€™s death note or some shit.
I cannot run from the world, but I donâ€™t have to go alone.
