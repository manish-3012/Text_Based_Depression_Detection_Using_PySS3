Weâ€™re now best friends, what do I do? Me and her have been friends for about 8-9 months, but the way we act and talk youâ€™d think we basically grew up together. We have both made it verbally clear that we would both date each other, however were both not looking for a relationship right now. Her family really likes me, and Iâ€™m friends with her brother. Her brotherâ€™s friend (who I have been close with for a couple of years but we recently argue a lot) has a MASSIVE crush on her and she doesnâ€™t really like him back. He also talks shit behind my back to her. He has no chance. Me and her had a small problem, but solved it and now reside as best friends. What do I do? I feel satisfied with being best friends, and sheâ€™s happy to have a close guy friend. What do I do to be a good guy best friend?
