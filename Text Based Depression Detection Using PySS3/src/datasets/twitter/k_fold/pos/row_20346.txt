I have weird school dreams Weirder part is that theyâ€™re always in my old school, but it mixes people in my current school and people I knew in my old school. Normally itâ€™s another weird scenario but this dream was a really pleasant one.

So Iâ€™m generally really bad socially, Iâ€™m one of those people who canâ€™t take a compliment and will either make fun of you or myself, Iâ€™m not that attractive too and Iâ€™m pretty self conscious about it, but this dream was like if I had that confidence.

I was surrounded by tons of students, laughing with them, joking with them, eating with them, it was really weird because I had never talked to some of the people there. I felt popular, I felt like people actually enjoyed my company, it was heartwarming.
