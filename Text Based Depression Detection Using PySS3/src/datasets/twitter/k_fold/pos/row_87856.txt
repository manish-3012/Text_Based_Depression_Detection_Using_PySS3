I'm still angry at this teacher So in 5th grade I had this STEM teacher and we were going to talk about bacteria. So she started the class by giving us this powder to rub on our hands and then she told us to go wash it off. So like any normal person would I just washed until I couldn't see the powder anymore because it wasn't gross or anything so I didn't feel a need to scrub. When we all got back from washing out hands she told us to pat them dry not rub and at this point I was suspicious. She then called us up to the front one by one and put our hands under a black light which made the powder glow, so when I went up there I had a little spot in the palm of my hand but she acted like my entire hand was covered in it. She said "You're like Michael Jackson because he wears that white glove!" And I w as a little passed because she just made fun of me for something that wasn't true in front of my entire class. I tried to tell her it's actually just because I'm very pale and the light illuminated my hand and that it was only a small spot but she insisted she was right. So I was angry for the rest of that class but it got worse because later on that same class she tried to prove that hand sanitizer didn't work. She covered a students hands in the powder and said hand sanitizer didn't work because it didn't get the powder off. This bothered me because everyone else in the class believed her so I tried to point out how that's not how hand sanitizer works and that soap unless it's antibacterial just takes things off of your hands while hand sanitizer kills the bacteria and isn't designed to remove things from your hand. Of course she didn't believe me and just the sheer amount of stubbornness she showed still bothers me.

Holy shit that was a long one thanks for reading it if you did I just wanted to tell this story.
