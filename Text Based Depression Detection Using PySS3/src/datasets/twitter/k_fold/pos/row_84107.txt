Gen Z is really starting to concern me. Me and my friends have a discord server that we regularly use to talk to eachother. Recently, the owner has been adding some people to the server who are using the n word regularly (they have confirmed that they are white). The owner has even said it a few times themselves. They claim they have the "n word pass" which is complete bullshit. I've told them several times that its racist no matter what but they still continue to use it. This even happens at my school. I'm just really not sure what actions to take.
