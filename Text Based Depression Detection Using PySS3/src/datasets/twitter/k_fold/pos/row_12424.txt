Just some friendly (hopefully helpful) advice (coming from personal experience If youâ€™re ever doing something or think of doing something and the immediate thought after said thing is â€œdamn Iâ€™m gonna regret doing that.â€ Please donâ€™t do it! Remove that thought out of your head completely. Sorry if this sounds harsh but things are mostly gonna go wrong for you  and itâ€™s gonna suck way worse than before (and probably cause pain). I decided to ignore this advice and I am now facing the repercussions of my actions. I have injured myself badly
