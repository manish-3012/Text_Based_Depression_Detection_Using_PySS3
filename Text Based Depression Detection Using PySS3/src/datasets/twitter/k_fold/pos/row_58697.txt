Posting random things until I stop feeling down day 33: So, today sh*it got intense, a few minutes ago, this random girl texted me on Facebook and asked me about my gf (Because an ex of my gf sent that girl) and then she said that she saw my profile and that Iâ€™m cute, and I  was like â€œBruh, I have a gfâ€ and then the girl said the weirdest sh*t I have ever seen, she asked me if I didnâ€™t wanted to have two gfs, I obviously said that no, I might be a looser, but I would NEVER cheat on her, at the end she texted me to ask how was her, almost had died  lol
