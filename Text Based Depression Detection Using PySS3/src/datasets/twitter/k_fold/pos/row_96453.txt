Thank you yall I usually just lurk around, but I've been here for almost 2 years and it's been fun, this final year of my teenage has been weird ,but the usually funny and sometimes deep stuff I've found here always made me feel welcome and cheered me up.

Thank you r/teenagers for being welcoming and immature like we ought to be, atleast while we can.

Ps: Can I still lurk or wil it be creepy since I'm not a teen anymore?
