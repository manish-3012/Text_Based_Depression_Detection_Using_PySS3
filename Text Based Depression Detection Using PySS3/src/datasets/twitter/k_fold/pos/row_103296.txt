How do you work on an essay Iâ€™ve been assigned a 6 page essay and itâ€™s due in two weeks. Iâ€™ve gotten about a bit halfway and Iâ€™m trying to finish but I canâ€™t. 

Whenever I try to sit down and work on this essay I get paralyzed and donâ€™t know how to start. 

I just want some advice because this is my final essay for the college class Iâ€™m taking and I want to make sure I donâ€™t do it last minute and regret it.
