I just got a call from one of my managers and she told me I'm being terminated from my job. How do I deal with this? My day was great up until the call about twenty minutes ago. I just don't get it, I wouldn't say I'm anywhere near the best worker at the establishment, but I'm definitely better than one who's been working there for almost a year now. I've never done drugs or drank alcohol, but the coworker in question vapes regularly (and blatantly) and afaik he still gets to keep the job. Not to throw shade at drug users, but doing it on the job semi-discretely just isn't professional. I'm friendly with all of the customers and I've never talked back to upper management which is partly why I'm so confused. The manager for the day that called me up told me that my employer "Doesn't think I'm suited for the job" so I assume that means I'm not working fast/hard enough? I barely speak to my coworkers except for in select situations and I'm pretty much solely focused on working with the customers so I don't know what to think honestly.

This is my first job and I'm just now beginning to open up to the rest of my coworkers, which now seems pointless because I'm gonna be removed from working with them. I was told by my manager that I could come in on Sunday to talk to my employer about the whole situation, so for the next couple of days, I'm going to be wrought with stress (something I and I'm sure many of you as well are a victim of). 

When I talk to my employer what do I even say? Do I ask him what I did wrong? Do I ask him what can be improved? My dad told me that being fired is something that sticks with you and can permanently ruin your reputation for being hired ever again.
