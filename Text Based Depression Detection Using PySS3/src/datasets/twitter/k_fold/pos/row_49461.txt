My acne is so painful I've been getting really bad acne lately. I've stopped taking selfies because of it. I was with CeraVe, I have a good routine. I've tried everything recommended to me, watched alot of vids, listened to family, everything. I've been having trouble sleeping lately tho and really bad stress and anxiety which is making my acne worse. I'm getting clusters, and they have gotten really big and red. It's like cystic acne almost? It might be idk. I wanna cut my skin off with a knife. My grandma always comments on it and tells me to wash my face when I do, and I have always had a routine. She even had the nerve to give me an acne kit infront of everyone at our family reunion, pat my face (and like pet my acne??) And told me to take care of it. Sooo. Yes. I hate it.
