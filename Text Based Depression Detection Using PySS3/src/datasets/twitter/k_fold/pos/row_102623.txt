i'm 17 and i feel burnt out  I've originally made a throwaway account for this post (i only complain here and i feel like it's starting getting annoying) but it was removed dur to the lack of karma.

My friends kida stopped talking to me, i feel like a bit of a burden to them and i'm too scared to confront them, i'm lonely and don't feel like having much to look forward in life. My family lowkey drags me down by having little to no trust in me. never been in a relationship or anything close to that so i feel like i'm missing on being young (i blame all netflix originals on that). I don't know many people that have similar hobbies/interests to mine so I feel like an outcast. i'm kind of scared of starting conversations (both on the internet and irl) and I've sort of embraced feeling invisible to others but that hurts sometimes.

if you've read that, thanks for your time, have a nice day
