This subâ€™s obsession with girls Iâ€™ll actually post something serious on here for once because jesus fucking christ

Look I get it, weâ€™re teenagers, we like girls yada yada but itâ€™s not even the point Iâ€™m trying to make. So many girls get harassed to hell with comments mansplaining how the internet fucking works, like shit I bet she didnâ€™t know sheâ€™ll have to block a contact and post a screenshot to r/creepydms before 365 14 year olds commented on her selfie about them.

This is supposed to be a safe space not some playground where you think youâ€™re the leader of the pack and have to fend off â€œle simpsâ€, this fucking trend is getting on my nerves. I bet if I post a shirtless pic none of you would give 2 shits but your horny projections and the echo chamber of reacting to every post with the hint of a female presence with â€œbeware of simpsâ€ and â€œpedophiles existâ€ is getting toxic.

Iâ€™d like to hear your thoughts on this
