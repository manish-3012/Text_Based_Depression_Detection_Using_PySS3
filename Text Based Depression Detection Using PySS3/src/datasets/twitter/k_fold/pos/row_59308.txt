Should I do it? So this girl and I met about a week ago. We hit it off pretty well, and we ran into each other in the dining center on campus and got to know each other a bit (and agreed to go on sort of a date, even though none of us called it that). 

Somehow or the other we ended up in bed, we were intimate for a night (and we both enjoyed it and seemed happy to proceed). But in the following days she has been very distant. She went to go get drunk instead of going on the date we had planned. 

Today, she's not doing very well. According to someone she's having some family issues. I'm sitting in the laundry room rn waiting for some stuff to dry, and in about 20 minutes she's going to be here (she has some going too). When she gets down, should I talk to her? I just don't know, I'm real confused. I feel like it might be my last chance, but I also think maybe it isn't a good idea/worthwhile.
