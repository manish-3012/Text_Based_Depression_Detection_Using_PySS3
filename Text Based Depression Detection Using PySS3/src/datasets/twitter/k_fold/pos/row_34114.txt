I have school refusal Almost 2 years back I hit a low point from my now ex-girlfriend. Iâ€™m not going into detail but basically going to school was hell.
It got better the next year since she left but then I feel deeper into sadness.

Thatâ€™s when I started getting days where I couldnâ€™t go to school and I dreaded it. Whenever I wake up on a school day I feel awful and the night before I aways spend crying myself to sleep. Quarantine helped this but once I got back into school it started again. 

I searched up what this was and apparently itâ€™s called â€œschool refusalâ€ (look it up) and I donâ€™t know what to do about it.
