Alright, listen and listen good, you horny bastards. This is how you make a diy fleshlight Came across a post about someone wanting a fleshlight and other people wanting one. So here's how you make your own. 
  
Materials needed:
   
â€¢Empty Pringles can
   
â€¢disposable glove (like doctor's gloves type shit)
  
â€¢two sponges (get some thick/big sponges)
   
â€¢water based lube (not comfortable buying lube? Buy coconut oil. Works just as well)
   
    
Step 1: Take the empty Pringles can and poke some holes down the lower half of the can. This is so air escapes while you're fucking it.
  
Step 2 (optional): Stuff some socks or any cloth at the bottom. This will help keeping the sponges in place.
  
Step 3: Take your sponges and glove and make a sandwich. Sponge-glove-sponge. Leave the glove entry hole hanging out an edge. 
  
Step 4: Shove the sponge glove sandwich into the Pringles can
  
Step 5: Take the glove's entry hole thing and wrap it around the Pringles can opening.
   
Step 6: Take your lube and use liberally on the slit and finger the hole to get the lube all over inside the glove. Also lube up your dick.
   
Step 7: Go crazy and fuck a Pringles can.
    
Before you scoff at this, try it. You'll thank me later. It feels better than you think.
