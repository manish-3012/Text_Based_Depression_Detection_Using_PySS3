Im the kid that has wanted to play Overwatch for 3-4 years now, can finally get it in 2021, but is terrified to Because the people I would play with (my friends on xbox) have been playing for years and the way that I am says that if I'm not close enough to their level, I feel like everytime we loose a match its my fault. 

Ive wanted to play with them for a while, but I am terrified to let them see i play it until I am close enough to their level to let them see that I do. At least xbox has the "be seen as offline" thing that I can turn on when I do for a few weeks.
