i feel like an asshole all the time [14m] i don't know why, i have friends that i care about and really appreciate. but i don't know, i just act like a massive douche around them sometimes. i'm aware of this after and it eats at me and i'm really not sure why. i wouldn't say im anxious or depressed either, more of a self-awareness thing i guess. i don't think being an asshole sometimes is entirely a bad thing because it can be warranted. but what im referring to here, is just being an immature douche for no absolute reason. unwarranted, unsolicited and uncalled for.  


(i didn't know weather to mark this as rant, social, or advice so i just chose rant because i felt it was the most fitting)
