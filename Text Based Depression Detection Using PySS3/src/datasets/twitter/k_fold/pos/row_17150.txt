I have an abusive grandpa, what should I do? Before I start, I'd like to apologize for my bad English and wording. Also I already wrote a long post but it just disappeared so I'll be making this one short.

So my Grandpa is really fucking violent and shit, here's a few things he likes to do

-yell at me and make fun of my weight
-threaten to beat me
-hurt me
-call me very mean names


Honorable mentions:
-being racist and homophobic
-just overall violent af

Also this is what he decided to do yesterday: when he got home he started yelling the second he got in and while I was playing with my ps4 he took me by the shoulder and hair and dragged me from my chair across the fucking room and he complained to my mom that I WAS TOO VIOLENT BECAUSE I STOOD UP FOR MYSELF FOR ONCE 

So I've tried to tell my mom but she doesn't believe me cuz my Grandpa denies EVERYTHING.

Idk what to do, someone help? 

Again, sorry for the bad English.
