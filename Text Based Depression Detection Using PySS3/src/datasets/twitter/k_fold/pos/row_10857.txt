My aunt is against my plans to cosplay, but Iâ€™ll still save up for it I know I should be grateful to her because sheâ€™s already lent me over a thousand dollars to learn driving, but this is something I want to do despite her advice.  
  
Look, I know Iâ€™m a boy and the character I want to dress up as is a girl. But once I put on my costume, boots, gloves and mask, you canâ€™t tell thereâ€™s a boy under the costume.   
   
The dress perfectly hides my (censored) and the bodice (I know nothing bout fucking dresses, I just think they look cute on princesses) fits snugly on my chest. Plus, the character Iâ€™m dressing up doesnâ€™t have much of a protruding chest, so Iâ€™m good.  
     
Iâ€™m sorry, auntie. But I need my own personal way to unwind. The total cost of my cosplay is $170, while a brand new PS5 that you said I should get costs a staggering $729.
