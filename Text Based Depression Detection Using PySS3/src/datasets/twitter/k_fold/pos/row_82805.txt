Idk if this is true or not but apparently if you download tor you're automatically put on a watchlist- Bruh I downloaded it like last year because I heard some people talk about it a little bit and I wanted to see what exactly it was but got bored and deleted it like 10 minutes afterwards not even knowing how to use it

Well shit..
