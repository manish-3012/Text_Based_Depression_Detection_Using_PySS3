I cant take this anymore I am fucking pissed off. I had a fight with my mom yesterday
And she told me you are 15 you shuld act more like an adult.
So today i heard my parents talking about politics and i wanted to "chime in" as they say so i tryed to say somthing before i could open my mouth to say a single f*ing word my mom had the audacity to say "you are a child you dont know what you are talking about so go and let the grown ups talk in peace".

This makes me so f*ing mad.
Is it just me or is just a part of being a teenager?.
