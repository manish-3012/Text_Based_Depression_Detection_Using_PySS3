God when will the pain end... Every morning I wake up with one urge: to drink coffee. It has taken over my life. I am spending less time with my family and more time with caffeine. I love the feeling it gives you, to be energized. But once itâ€™s over, I go back to my boring, tired life. I am so depressed without my coffee. It has cured my depression but once itâ€™s gone, the depression comes back. My girlfriend wants to break up with me, claims Iâ€™m too obsessed with coffee. But if thatâ€™s the case, she can leave, because coffee is my love of my life. I currently canâ€™t get coffee because of a winter storm, so now the crippling, endless pain will continue. I think I need rehab.
