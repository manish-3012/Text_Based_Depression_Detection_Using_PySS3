In love with my straight best friend - please help lol probably not the best sub to post this on but i figured iâ€™d try here first. TLDR at the bottom for the lazy.

so, my best friend and i are extremely close. iâ€™ve known her for like ~6 years now, so weâ€™ve been best friends since elementary school. since i was like 8ish iâ€™ve always questioned my sexuality and whether iâ€™m more into girls then guys (spoiler: i was 100% right), but my fears were confirmed when i started to catch feelings for my best friend, when i was around 14. i was terrified because 1. she was most definitely straight 2. my parents and school are super homophobic, like extremely so. i even had my doubts *she* would accept me, and it didnâ€™t help the only other openly lgbt person at our school was bullied constantly. so yeah wouldnâ€™t be a great look for me. 

so i kept it to myself, and silently endured her boyfriends, the assholes at our school, and my parents and family. i developed a sort of self-hatred and repression from constantly being surrounded by people who hate me (love that for me), but i also started being colder to my best friend. i knew i caught feelings, i couldnâ€™t deny that, so i started snapping more and distancing myself. she obviously caught on and asked what was up, and i lied and said problems at home (which to be fair wasnâ€™t wrong). at this point in time weâ€™ve mostly made up and are on good terms. 

but i still canâ€™t stop thinking about her. iâ€™ve fallen in love with her, which is just so blegh. i donâ€™t know what to do, iâ€™m not out to anyone i know in real life. should i tell her im gay? do i go all in and say how iâ€™m in love with her? do i keep it to myself and repress even more? my biggest worry is that she wonâ€™t accept me and out me to the whole school, which will result in me getting bullied relentlessly and most likely disowned (it also doesnâ€™t help that my family is very racist, and weâ€™d be an interracial couple should she ever reciprocate). the best option would be to just stay put but i donâ€™t know if i can do it much longer, itâ€™s really starting to take a toll on me and i feel like i need to tell someone that i can actually rely on in real life, and sheâ€™s the only one who comes to mind. i donâ€™t know what to do, and i really need advice.

TLDR: in love with my straight best friend. go to a homophobic school with homophobic parents and have been repressing myself for so long i feel like i canâ€™t keep doing it much longer without breaking down. my fears are i wonâ€™t be accepted/outed and be bullied and disowned.
