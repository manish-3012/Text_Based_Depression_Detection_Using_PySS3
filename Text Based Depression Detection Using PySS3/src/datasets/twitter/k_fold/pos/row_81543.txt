I just saw a post about one thing worse than rejection. Girls if a guy ask you out and you donâ€™t like him just tell him. Lying to him and saying you do then saying it was a joke/dare hurts so much. I remember a girl I like told me I was handsome and then a minute later she said it was a dare. That hurts so much.
