What's your favorite Netflix shows? My favorites are Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Office, Umbrella Academy, and Community. I haven't found anything new to watch since August. Does anyone have recommendations? I find that the regular reccomendations are too adult and the regular "teen" shows are really cheesy.
