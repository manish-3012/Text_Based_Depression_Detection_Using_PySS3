Just reminded myself of that one time our like 60-70 yo 7th grade art teacher one day just said "today we will watch a movie" and showed us Dangerous Minds I don't fucking know if that movie's really appropriate for 7th graders but it was a cool movie with a great soundtrack, thanks...fuck I can't remember his name
