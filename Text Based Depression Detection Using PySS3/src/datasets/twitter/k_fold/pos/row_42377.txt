One of our two kittens passed away today. The kitten's name was Marshmallow. He was a one-two month old mixed breed that we'd bought a couple of weeks ago along with a gray kitten named Dusty (who is still alive as of the writing of this post). He stayed in my room for about a week before moving to our house's "playroom", which is where he was when he passed.

It's unknown what exactly killed him. He was suffering from a prolapse, but it wasn't quite to the point of being fatal (my family and I have seen cats with prolapse *way* worse than that survive their conditions). He was also somewhat sick, though what sickness he had exactly is unknown.

He was the calmer of the two kittens (Dusty is pretty hyperactive) and would often rest near my head or on my chest when I was lying in bed, and he'd purr really loudly when I stroked him (Dusty also purrs, but not nearly as loudly.)

I don't really know how to feel about this rn, since I never got the chance to spend enough time with Marshmallow to feel very emotionally attached. That's not to say I'm not upset or sad at all...I'm just not particularly upset or sad.

If cats have an afterlife of some sort, I hope he's doing better there.
