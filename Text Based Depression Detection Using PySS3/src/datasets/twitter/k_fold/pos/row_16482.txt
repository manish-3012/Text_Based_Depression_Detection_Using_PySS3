you know what I LOVE about the new online classes? the teachers ALWAYS complain about "kids this days are on their phones 24/7", yet they're expecting us to be on our phones 24/7 to know when we're going to have a lesson. Also, you know how in school a bell exists to let you know when a lesson starts and ends? ye forget about that with the online lessons. "oh you're late? WELL YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM YOU DIDN'T NOTICE THE MESSAGE ABOUT THE HISTORY LESSON THAT GOT BURRIED BECAUSE OTHER TEACHERS HAD OTHER MESSAGES TO SEND TO THE STUDENTS"
