I say uni all the time Am I not an American anymore???? I never knew that people donâ€™t call college/universities â€œuniâ€. I feel like I picked up this habit from my Canadian friend and never realized that others didnâ€™t say it...

Apparently this is a European/NZ/Aussie thing, not USA????

What????????? Can someone tell me now that Iâ€™m not weird and they use it too
