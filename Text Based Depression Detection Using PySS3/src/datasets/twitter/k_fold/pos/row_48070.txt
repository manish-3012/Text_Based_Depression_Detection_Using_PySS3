An important thing. Hereâ€™s an important thing about two sexualities: Aromantic and Asexual.

You see, thereâ€™s a difference between these two. Itâ€™s quite obvious but some people might not get it.

When you feel a romantic attraction, your brain goes like: I want to cuddle and kiss them.

And when you feel a sexual attraction itâ€™s like: I want to fuck them,

And you see, thatâ€™s the difference between these two.

An asexual is a person who doesnâ€™t feel sexual attraction but feels the platonic and romantic one.

An aromantic is a person who doesnâ€™t feel the romantic attraction but feels the sexual and platonic one.

An aromantic asexual is a person who feels only platonic kind off attraction.

Thank you for listening. If you have any questions I will most likely answer them.
