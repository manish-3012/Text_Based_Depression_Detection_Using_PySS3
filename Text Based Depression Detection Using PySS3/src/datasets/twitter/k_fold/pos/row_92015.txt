My observations from moving from a low end phone to a midrange So my comparison is from the mobicell hype to the vivo y11.

So the first thing I noticed is that the y11 is considerably heavier than the hype as well as the battery life being way better on the y11 (although this is expected as that's the main selling point of the phone).

Another thing is how smooth using the y11 is compared to the hype and just the wide amount of games you can play with on the y11 that you can't with the hype.

I can't really compare the feeling you have on the devices as my dad wants me to keep the y11 in its case.

The sad thing about getting the y11 is that it has a better processer than my laptop (1.9 octa core on the y11 vs the 1.7 quad core).

Well that's my analysis of the difference between a low and a midrange phone. 
Sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes I am currently using my phone to type this out.
