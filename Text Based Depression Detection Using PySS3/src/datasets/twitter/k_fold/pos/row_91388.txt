Do yâ€™all actually talk like this? Is this subreddit real? Iâ€™ve been on reddit for the entirety of my teen life, 12-19. Iâ€™m unsure when this sub started popping up, but for the entirety of this subreddits existence itâ€™s been a cringe fest. Teens have better humor than this, every post reads like a 35 year old pretending to be a teen. This subreddit needs some investigation.
