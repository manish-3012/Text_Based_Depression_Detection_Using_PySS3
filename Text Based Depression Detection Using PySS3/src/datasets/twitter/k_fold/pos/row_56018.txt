I need help so, naturally, I came to reddit I am a student having to deal with online school and I hate it. My uncle (gaurdian) is deathly afraid of COVID-19. I am easily distracted (example, I'm supposed to be doing maths rn) and am extremely alone in my house because I'm the youngest. I wrote a sheet with pros and cons but still feel like I need to do something more. Any advice?
