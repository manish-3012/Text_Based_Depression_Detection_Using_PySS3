I have a multi-gaming network that I would like to share with everyone  Hello, my name is matt, and I own a Multi-Gaming Network called TLS Community Servers. I want to share my community with the world. We are a small community, but we're trying to expand our horizons into different sections. Our server mainly consists of CSGO Players because we have a few CSGO Surf Servers, but we have a small community with a small portion of our Minecraft survival SMP players. We also have a rust server, but that is dying, so we might get rid of that soon unless it turns around into something bigger. Everyone in the community has worked hard to where we are today. I know my writing isn't going to get through to you, but all I ask is will you please join and we can all have a good time and have movie nights make new friends, and most of all make memories if we all came together as one into a community based off of gaming! Here is our Discord. If you would like to join, here's our link: [https://discord.com/invite/cdxa49s](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.com/invite/cdxa49s) Well, I hope I can see you there!
