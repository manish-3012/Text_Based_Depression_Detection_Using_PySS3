my mom came home while I was staying home skipping school I woke up late and felt like shit, while also forgetting to pack my bag last night, so I thought fuck it I'll just stay home, but the thing is I fell asleep and didn't tell my mom that I was staying home, now here I am hiding for the next couple hours, and I left my backpack in my room so I have to hope she doesn't decide to go into my room.
