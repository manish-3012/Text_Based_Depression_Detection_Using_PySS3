I told my teacher my dog ate my homework So I told my teacher my dog ate my homework. Of course she didnâ€™t believe me so I showed her the papers, still didnâ€™t believe me. So I showed her a video that my sister took of me trying to get it back. She finally believed me and let me do the paper again. I purposely gave my dog the homework and basically staged it. My teacher never knew.
