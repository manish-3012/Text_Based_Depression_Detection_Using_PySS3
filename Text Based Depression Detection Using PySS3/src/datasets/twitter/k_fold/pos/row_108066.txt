Iâ€™m sad So far this year, on top of the big events, my grandpa and dog died so that sucks. I also had a gf for a few months but school got in the way. 
I used to hang out with my friends often but lately Iâ€™ve been too busy to do things with them. I wanted to go to this haunted house event in my city with  a bunch of my friends but missed out because I didnâ€™t know the times/date stuff. 
Today is one of my friendâ€™s birthday and they had a small group of friends together and I missed that too. 
This is just a few of the things thatâ€™s been going on and I feel like Iâ€™m just missing out on so much stuff. Idk I just feel left out and a bit lonely.
