I got a speak japanese in 90 days book. So I got a book for learning japanese to fluency for christmas and decided I would try documenting it on her purly for fun 
Day 1: i came in with some basic knowledge on the japanese language. Basic sentance structure, a decent vocabulary etc but I still learned some stuff like how the japanese will shorten a sentence to the most important points for ex. If I were giving something to someone I would not say "I am giving this to you" I would just say "ã‚ã’ã‚‹"(to give.) I learned somemore basic sentances and what not. I will post again tomorrow.
