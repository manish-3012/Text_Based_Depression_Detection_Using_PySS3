Itâ€™s hard to have a descent agreement on reddit (other places ofc but this is the main sub I'm in that I come across it ) 
Ok so itâ€™s cdt time rn 4:22 am so Iâ€™m get to the point and ion care to much about grammar tbh you can speak English good enough to read this anyways (I will   Guess) so Iâ€™m a Trump supporter and I donâ€™t believe in blm but also soon as I say that I get down vote to hell ( more like -19 points but you get the point) and when I ask why I should support blm or not support trump I get jump by ppl then when Iâ€™m right they just donâ€™t reply or become grammar nazis which follows by down votes, thatâ€™s all I had to say Iâ€™m go to sleep probably or try I have school and work, oh also just in case Iâ€™m black just in case and no Iâ€™m not pay to do this.
