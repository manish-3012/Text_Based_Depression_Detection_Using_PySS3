I think I might be on track for my first girlfriend Iâ€™m not sure but on Tuesday I had this 4 hour convo with this girl and we both agreed it was the longest and most fun convo weâ€™ve had. Iâ€™m not sure if I like like her, not yet anyway, and I think there is a decent chance that we end up dating but Iâ€™m not sure what do yâ€™all think?
