Preparing for College So I'm graduating this year and going to college this fall and I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on how to survive. Socially and in school.
Some questions I have:
How different usually are classes and schoolwork compared to HS.
And probably the most important, HOW DO YOU MAKE NEW FRIENDS IN COLLEGE AND POSSIBLY EVEN A S.O. Thats all.
Thanks fellow teens and hopefully you provide some useful insights.
