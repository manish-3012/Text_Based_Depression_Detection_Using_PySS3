In what way do you think it would be better for you to get rejected (read the options in the post old) -Simple friendzoned (basically the "I only see you as friends)

-The I would have given you a chance but we are too much friends now friendzone

-A lie like "I am already dating someone or I am not ready for a relationship yet

-Cold truth of "you don't interest me because of this flaw'"
