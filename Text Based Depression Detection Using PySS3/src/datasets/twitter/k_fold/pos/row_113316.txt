Question about race and police Keep in mind Iâ€™m still new to the whole political landscape. I understand that the police has racial problems, but shouldnâ€™t that be all the more reason for them to obey? If you are at a higher risk than why not just listen to someone with a gun and do nothing stupid. Also, I am black before you guys say you must be white so you wonâ€™t get it.
