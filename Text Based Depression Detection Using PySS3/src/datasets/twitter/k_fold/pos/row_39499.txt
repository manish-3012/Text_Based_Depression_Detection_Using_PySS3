Only one who didn't get something for Christmas? So for clarification, half my relatives are dead, so ofc I don't get many presents. 

The last couple months I have been talking abt smth I really wanted next to my mum. A few hours before Christmas she told me she will give me a self-made coupon, but she doesn't know for what, kinda still hurts but I am used to not being listened to,so I told her again. I am the only one in the family who is still in school and I don't get pocket money either so I have to save up my food money for Christmas months before. My adult brother told me he'll buy me smth for 50â‚¬, the same amount I spent on his gift. A couple days later, I asked him to buy me smth, he said next month bc he doesn't have money rn. My mom promised me to buy the thing I wanted the next day, but ofc she forgot bc I am not that important, and now it's sold out and I am just sad that everyone in my family got a gift, except me, but they don't even care. Anyone else?
