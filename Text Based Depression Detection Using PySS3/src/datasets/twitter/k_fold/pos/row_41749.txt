How do I avoid death Today I accidentally slept through all of my online classes. My school has a shortened day on Wednesday, and I had woken up 2 hours before my classes started. Since it was that early, I decided to go back to sleep. And when I woke up my classes were over. Somehow I slept through 2 alarms on my phone and like 4 hours of school. My parents are going to kill me. So how do I avoid death at my parentsâ€™ hands?
