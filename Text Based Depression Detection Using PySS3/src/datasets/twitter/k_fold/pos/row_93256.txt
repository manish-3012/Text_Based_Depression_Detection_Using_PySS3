I hate my school So I go to a small country side school, of 21 students. (Grades 1-9) before Christmas, the school was in quarantine due to a teacher having Corona. You'd expect people to be extra careful after that? No. Not in my school. No masks. No distancing, nothing. does my school think we're immune now? And the students didn't stay in quarantine either! They went shopping, and to malls! I'm so angry at my school right now. Corona isn't over yet.
