So much crazy shit has happened in my life. First off, my crush rejected me on January 9th this year and then that same day my grandmother got sick. a few hours later i was napping and my father knocked on my door to tell me that my grandmother died. i was so shocked and sad. fast-forward 2 weeks. my father told me 2 days ago that the family was going to Pakistan where my grandmother lived. we're a pakistani family btw. we'll go there on February 16th. i still can't believe it, man. my grandmother is dead, my longtime crush rejected me, i'm going on a 20 hour trip thanks to that. just wanted to let my feelings out by making this post.
