Introducing r/Friender! A community designated for teenagers who have a lack of or want for friends! Due to the Covid pandemic, several people are feeling lonely and while apps exist, none do for teens (for obvious catfish reasons but a subreddit is much easier to monitor compared to an app) come here, post a description of your age, gender, country and interests and bravo. In no time at all you'll be assigned or find a friend similar to you! THIS IS NOT A DATING APP! check outÂ r/Friender to get started!
