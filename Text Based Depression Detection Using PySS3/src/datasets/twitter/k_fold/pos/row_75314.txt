Just need to vent a little I've been struggling since the beginning of the year with depression because NOTHING good has happened to me this year, nothing but tragedy. Lately I started seeing a therapist and getting help after I had a bad breakdown. My parents have been handling it rather poorly. My mom in particular. I have lots of anger over all the things I've been through and my mom is always the reason I lash out. Most recent incident was today. See was asking me to do a bunch of chores and I was getting aggravated. She asks me why I'm mad and won't let it go. Persistently asking why a person is mad is the LAST thing you do. Especially with me. So she kept persistently asking why I was mad and I blew up on her. Then she starts crying and goes to her bedroom. Then my dad gets mad and threatens to take away all my stuff, which is one of the only things that keeps me going besides social interaction. All of this just makes me that much worse and it's only when my parents pull shit like this that suicidal thoughts come to me. If my mom wasn't so annoying and persistent then I wouldn't have half of the problems I do now. Just about every time I've had a breakdown it was because of something my parents did. I JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE. My parents have handled this whole thing with my depression both good and bad. They got me help and have been supportive but have also been terrible with it because of how they handle me lashing out. Instead of just leaving me alone when I seem angry they always persist and make me more mad until I blow up. Then they have the nerve to blame me for something and threaten me for something that wasn't my fault. If they just left me alone none of these things would have happened.
