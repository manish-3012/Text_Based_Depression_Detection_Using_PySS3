My friend keeps texting me I donâ€™t know why. I tried distancing myself from them in a mix of mental health shit messing with my brain, and trying to move on a little bit. I have no real problem with the friend, in fact sheâ€™s the only one to have reached out in the past like year now. 

She texted me a few hours ago asking a question. The question itself isnâ€™t important, itâ€™s some kind of like ice-breaker tier question.

Well because Iâ€™m just trying to not contact anyone, I didnâ€™t respond. Then just half an hour ago she sent another random question.

I just donâ€™t get it. I feel like just straight out asking if she either wants anything from me or anything else I guess. I really just donâ€™t understand
