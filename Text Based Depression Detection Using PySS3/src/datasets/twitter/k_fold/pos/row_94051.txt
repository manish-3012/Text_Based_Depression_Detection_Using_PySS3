My first post here.        So I am a 2 time cancer survivor at 14. No, Iâ€™m not kidding. When I was 12 in 2018, I was experiencing severe pain in my right hip along with high fevers. I saw doctors who said I was being lazy, or it was growing pains. I missed days of school because the pain was too much to handle. Finally, after about 6 months of experiencing it I was scheduled an MRI. I was diagnosed on October 26, 2018 at the age of 13. It turned out to be Ewingsâ€™ Sarcoma, a bone cancer common in teens and young adults. People say I should have been diagnosed sooner because I had every symptom and I was the exact type of person who would get it. I went through the chemo and radiation because surgery would be potentially fatal for me. I handled it decently well, and I definitely grew as a person in general. From shy and quiet to cheerful and talkative. I finished Ewingsâ€™ treatment on August 26, 2019. I got my medals, t-shirt, rang the bell, and went back to normal life. It was great! Everyone said I changed in a good way, and I was happy to have that boringness back! 
       Then on December of 2019, I had my check up scans done to see if cancer was coming back. I was called back after Christmas for some more scans because they saw something that wasnâ€™t a result of past treatments. It turned out to be cancerous, and I had a biopsy done. They were expecting Ewingsâ€™, but it was ALL Leukemia. This was January 3 of 2020. They were surprised because there has not been a recorded case of someone having Ewingsâ€™ then getting ALL Leukemia. They were a little relieved, though, because ALL Leukemia is one of the high survival rates cancer in children. I started chemo on January 8, 2020. I was lucky they caught it early because that meant that I didnâ€™t have to stay in the hospital for a month. Only two weeks! I found out that I needed a bone marrow transplant later due to the fact that my body was still very weak from prior treatment, and the fact that I had this as my secondary cancer. My Leukemia wasnâ€™t super hard to achieve remission, but the transplant would be the only sure way to get rid of everything completely. A body reset. Leading up to the transplant, the hospital attempted more chemo on me. One two week stay in the hospital with angry kidneys and a deadly allergy attack from a chemo which landed me in the ICU later, I was just put on a very small amount of chemo each week until transplant. 
            I went in for transplant on April 30, 2020. I had chemo plus radiation to kill of my old cells, and make room for new cells. I got my transplant on May 6, 2020 by 2 umbilical cords. I felt weird, but fine for the next week, then I got engraftment syndrome. It isnâ€™t actually a medical illness, but it is what we call when you start showing signs of engraftment. You will know when you are engrafting because the pain is horrible! It also came with loss of appetite, nausea, weakness, and other fun stuff! I was on a morphine drip, and asked for benadryl every so often. I didnâ€™t sleep for about 3 days straight. Because of the coronavirus, I wasnâ€™t allowed any visitors beside a select few hospital staff. Thanks anti-maskers for making sure that 4 kids all under the age of 16 werenâ€™t allowed to see their families during the worst part of their lives! I ended up being so mentally messed up that the unit was allowed to have a therapist come and visit instead of doing tele med. It was all worth it though because after 35 days in the hospital, I was allowed to leave cancer free! My muscles ached so badly though, I could only walk a few minutes at a time very slowly. Transplant is such a surreal experience because you can feel everything that is going on in your body. Pretty hard to describe. 
           I still had to stay in a hotel nearby the hospital because they want you close by in case if something happens. I only got one fever, which they still donâ€™t know what caused it, and a few graft versus host rashes. I was doing so well that they let me go home early. After 92 days total, I got to sleep in my own bed for the first time! I still have to go to the hospital once a week for check ups. Right now, I am got my Ewingâ€™s MRI done which showed what they think is radiation scarring so Iâ€™m not too worried about it. The radiation oncologist said it did look like delayed scarring, and it was in the exact place where scarring would show up. I am also getting a lot of post 100 days transplant tests done at the moment. All of which with good results. 
        I posted this just to say enjoy the little moments. We all take stuff for granted, and I got it all swept away from me in an instant. I used to be able to jump, walk without a limp after exercise, spend time with friends, celebrate holidays, and go to school. I have been wearing masks since 2018, and now I have to when I go to the gym during slow hours. I am feeling a lot better physically and mentally than 4 months ago. Iâ€™ve completely changed as a person from 6th to 9th grade, and Iâ€™m grateful. Not for the cancer, but what it made me. I met some of the best people in my life from doctors, nurses, and other patients. I have made some lifelong friendships. I was opened up to many opportunities that I never thought I would do before. I am actually a bit of a mentor now to kids that get recently diagnosed because I have so much experience. I have met kids who wonâ€™t live to be 20, and ones who passed in my treatment. I am just grateful that I got off lucky so many times so far. I see life in a new angle. We all live our own lives, and all feel differently. Really the best thing to do for someone is understand them. Stay safe, and enjoy yourself and those around you. If you like to hike, then hike. I you like to be alone, then be alone. Just enjoy those happy moments. I donâ€™t know how to share pictures on a post, but if I did it would most likely be my cancer medals. I hope you all can believe this, but I understand if you donâ€™t.
