My parents treat me like a baby Iâ€™m almost an adult. Iâ€™m 17 (female) and my parents treat me like a complete baby. They have always been like this. Very strict and not willing to let me do anything. 

Although Iâ€™ve been gaining my way to the top but there is still things that are off limits. 

First off, letâ€™s talk social media. 
I am 17 and I canâ€™t have Snapchat or Twitter. I have asked for Snapchat for years because my friends have it but they say no Iâ€™m not trust worthy even though I havenâ€™t done anything to disrespect them or destroy the trust. They also think Snapchat is all about sending n00ds when it isnâ€™t. I told them I have never sent one in my life and they still said no. 

Iâ€™m not allowed to drive outside past 7:30pm. This is absolutely embarrassing. All my friends get later curfews and I get 7:30pm and it not even dark yet. I have tried to have a talk with them about this. I told them I think Iâ€™m old enough for a longer curfew and they immediately shut me down and say end of discussion! 


Iâ€™m not allowed to be on my phone past 8:30pm. This is when all my friends come home from work so I donâ€™t get a chance to talk to them because I have to say I gtg to bed guys. Itâ€™s almost as if Iâ€™m 7 I have extremely early bedtimes, early curfews, and I canâ€™t have apps that every other teen can. Itâ€™s humiliating all my friends laugh at me because of this and every time u try and speak to them about it they say end of discussion! Anyone else have parents like this?? It is so annoying and yes this is a throwaway account
