&amp;#x200B;

You know what sucks? Knowing you're never going to be special to a girl. Knowing you're never going to be anyone's first anything. Never going to have that "special moment." It sucks. It fucking sucks. Because you watch as people who don't try and are assholes get everything they fucking want but you do the best you can to be the nicest guy to people and you get rewarded with shit just because you're ugly. You know, here's the three things I want in a girl. That's it. It's going to sound a bit harsh because of how pissed I am but here we go:

\-Be attractive (hypocritical, I know)

\-Not a whore

\-Not stupid

That's it. That's fucking it and already that's too much for me. I'm done with this shit. I just wanna be happy fucking end me okay my best friend does nothing and gets everything in the fucking world i fucking hate him shoot me end me i don't care the world is hell
