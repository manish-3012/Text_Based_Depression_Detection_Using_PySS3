It hurts so fucking bad being trans like trying to get money as fast as i can so i can move out and just have basic fucking human rights that I deserve Like even though I hate myself and don't think I deserve much, everybody fucking deserves to just be called by the name they want. But my parents don't give a fuck I'm an adult and they think they own me like property and get to call me whatever they want.
