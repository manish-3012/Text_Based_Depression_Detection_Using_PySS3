goddammit mom So here i am, sitting at home pondering what i want for my birthday, and i text my mom and dad saying (this is paraphrased) "Screw it. I dont want gifts or a party." 2 min. later, my mon calls all worried sayibg "Oh dont say that! Thats things suicidal people say! I know what happaneded last year, but your in a good place" *eye roll*    First of all, don't be the moms who get on facebook and self diagnose your kids as suicidal. second, you really think that me getting bullued A YEAR AGO is gonna make want to kill myself? Pfft, Me being bullied is going to be great fucking motivation for me to become an air force pilot and find that kid and say "Look! I happily signed my life away to protect your ass. I've done more than you ever will." Stop worrying about me mom. I'm almost 16. Instead of sheltering me, you should be letting me get even more of a taste of the real world. I think when someone gets bullied, goes to jail for defending themselves, and the bully gets off scott free, the victim matures. Big time. Start teaching my how to pay rent and how to pay bills instead of looking at me like a broken garden gnome. I long for the day I turn 18, because when i do, it's ne with you and dad, it's just me. I'll forget about you. I'll be nothing more than a sweet memory. It's for the better on both sides. That shit grinds my gears. Stop giving a fuck about how i feel and let me learn to live life properly. The stupid, immature 15 year old me is gone, mom. He's been replaced by a realistic 15, almost 16 year old. One who's probably to realistic for his own fucking good.
