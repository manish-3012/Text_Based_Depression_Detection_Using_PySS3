Why do newer childrenâ€™s songs have to be sung by a terrible singer?! I have been trying to take a nap for the past half hour before class because I only got 3 hours of sleep. 

But my sibling are watching these childrenâ€™s music YouTube channel and the guys voice is so bad and I canâ€™t fucking sleep.  Iâ€™ve never even heard this one!
