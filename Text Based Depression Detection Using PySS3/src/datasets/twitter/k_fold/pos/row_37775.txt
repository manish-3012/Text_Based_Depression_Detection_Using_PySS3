Itâ€™s fucked up and kinda sad. Something has just happened to me in life that brings me down easily.
I had a very good friend whom I knew from kindergarten. After kindergarten we both went to the same elementary school in the same class and were also very good friends there. It separated our common school way, because we both visited different schools. But we decided to keep in touch via Skype, because we both used to play together a lot. Starting around 7th grade, he told me that he didn't have much time to play at the moment - that's why we kept texting. A year later I got a message that he had time again. After that we had a phase for 1-2 years where we played GTA with others. On one day I could no longer reach him, both on WhatsApp and Discord. Suddenly I was able to reach him and he told me that he no longer had time for such things. I remember the time with him with pleasure, because he helped me also in bad phases.
After that time we only wrote each other birthday greetings and New Year.
One day we planned if we should get in touch again since he would have more time now, but due to COVID we couldn't meet. On New Year we wished each other "Happy New Year" again. I gave him the suggestion that when the pandemic has subsided a bit, we can meet. He didn't read the message and blocked me two days later. 
That makes me a little sad that it had to end that way. Yes, I've made new friends in that time and even grown fond of them, but that just sucks and is brazen. In my opinion, you should tell the other person what you think instead of ignoring them.
I hope you can understand my situation right now. And I hope you could decipher my English well too.
