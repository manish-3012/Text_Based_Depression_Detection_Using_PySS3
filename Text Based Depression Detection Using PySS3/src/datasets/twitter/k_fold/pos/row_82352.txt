I saw a woman reject her boyfriend in a restaurant &amp; it was the most heart breaking thing I ever saw in my life This afternoon I went into a restaurant after many months of quarantining myself at home, and in front of our table there was a very loving couple. We progressed the day there as normal, and they were talking a lot too. Soon before we started leaving the restaurant, her boyfriend was talking about marrying, and she rejected him. He threw his food off the table and ran away seemingly crying, and it was probably the most heart breaking thing I ever experienced in my life.

I really think that when someone rejects you in real life, it's much more sad than when they reject you online.
