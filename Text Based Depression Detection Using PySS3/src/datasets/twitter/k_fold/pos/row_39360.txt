has anyone else had this problem with tiktok? i made a tik tok account and i had it for a couple months. i ended up never verifying the email and i a few months later i broke my phone and had to get a replacement. i didnâ€™t remember the password and because i never verified an email, i could never get back into it. i posted some really dumb stuff and my dumb ass put my full name on my account. so basically if anyone looks me up, they find that account right away : family, friends, employers, etc. iâ€™ve tried reporting and asking others to report as well but nothing has happened. does anyone have any troubleshooting ideas? i need help asap bc i have a work background check in a few weeks
