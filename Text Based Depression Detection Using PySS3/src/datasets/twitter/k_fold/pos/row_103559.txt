Anyone else feel like this? Iâ€™m going through depression right now and I constantly feel like I donâ€™t deserve to. I keep telling myself that Iâ€™m just being a whiny brat and that Iâ€™m overreacting to have just broken up with someone before the summer. I am literally forcing myself to not be able to feel sadness, so now I feel even more sad.
