I just did the coolest thing on Friday and ive reached my peak So am I that one quiet kid in your class who you suspect has autism. Saying that im unpopular would be an understatement, it's more like other people actively ignored me 

So we were playing basketball during PE lesson and at the end of the class some guys requested me to shoot the ball as a final send off when I was already half way across the court. I didn't put much focus on it and threw it, and what do you know, it actually fucking landed. I was never good at sports do its kind of surprising. Everyone cheered afterward 

That's all folks. That was the last amount of luck ill ever have in my life
