Any advice for healing a picked thumb I have been struggling with anxiety for a while now and sometimes when Iâ€™m anxious I pick at my thumb, and by this point the skin has gotten pretty flaky. I caught myself and havenâ€™t picked at it for a week or two now, but the skin is still flaky and doesnâ€™t look like itâ€™s growing back. Is there any way to help it heal faster or is my thumb just like that forever now
