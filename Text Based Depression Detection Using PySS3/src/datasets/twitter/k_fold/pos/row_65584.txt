We're beginning to miss churches, even though many of us don't believe in God The title gives a bit of a feeling that this doesn't belong in this sub, but let me explain.

So there are lots of people here who have quite serious issues about relationships and mental health, and this is the first place where they express their feelings. And usually, there are lots of us wanting to help and doing so, too, no question.

But here I have to use the (among our generation) infamous phrase: Because our parents and grandparents didn't have internet, what did they do in situations like this?

They probably went to the church because most people then were believers, didn't they? Seeking advice from the priests and socialising also weren't the only activities that one could do in a church. Plus they are everywhere, each of us should have a church in their vicinity.

But now? Many of us teenagers are atheists and are not attracted to going to the church. But some are not socialising enough. Not to mention the staggering levels of mental health issues that nobody cares about today. We can meet in the town, in the shopping centres etc. But not everyone likes that busy ambience there. And it doesn't offer many ways of helping with the obstacles of our age.

If someone in power thought about this, imagine how many great, original ideas could come up. We could have places offering a bit of privacy and nature on one hand, and socialising and openness on the other. People like me and you could come there to clean their heads, to seek advice from someone, or to voluntarily give advice to someone they don't know.

The internet is sometimes a good place for this, but all of us need a bit of nature and reality sometimes.

Also, sorry for the grammar. It's really far from perfect.
