I finally got the courage to meet my crush, got crushed After several months of talking and flirting, she liked the same things as me and we'd often say things like "when you come my ends we can just stargaze on a rooftop and listen to peep all night ect" I really had a crush on her especially because she was there when my grandmother passed. Well I hit her up with " what caffe do you work in i wanna come suprise you" because she's only a hour away she hits me with "I have a boyfriend now so it's best if you don't pull up". Should've taken my shot a while back I guess, just needed to vent.
