I'm really close to having a panic attack over my teeth Ok so recently I discovered I got my first cavity, which fucking sucks because my mom has been chewing my head off everytime I mention anything regarding it, and today I checked on it and noticed that FUCKING 3 OTHER TEETH ARE STARTING TO GET CAVITIES and I don't know why! I've been so paranoid about brushing, I have been flossing and using a mouthwash, fluoride products, I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I'm just hyperventilating because my mom is gonna be so fucking mad. Seriously wtf how the fuck did I manage to get 3 more cavities, I'm just so scared to go get this one cavity filled now because I know it's gonna hurt and I'm scared of the dentist and then he's gonna see my three other cavities and I'll have to get those filled too. God I'm just freaking out so much rn why can't teeth just not rot at all??? Fuck you teeth
