i donâ€™t get it what is the freaking point in talking about my feelings? i donâ€™t feel any better. i told them everything but i feel like dying still so how exactly does this help? so that you can better help me? bitch you donâ€™t know how to even help except give me a hug but it hurts so bad that my anxiety developed into thixophobia. so how are you supposed to hug me now? and how does that even help? i mean it feel like your just saying â€œsucks for you, let me hug you so that your pain goes awayâ€ thatâ€™s even more bizarre than crystals having energy.
