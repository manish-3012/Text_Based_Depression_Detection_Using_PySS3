A small cry for help from someone who has exams tomorrow( Math) I have mocks tomorrow for maths and I was hoping to find people who I can ask questions which i don't understand or don't know how to solve. Till now, I was studying in a pace where i'd get good grades for the actual finals but due to covid increasing here again, There are high chances for another lockdown, meaning the grades from mocks will be sent as our true grades. I don't want to fail cause this is the last year of highschool and I made a deal with my dad for my dreams and failing these exams would completely set me back. So for the next 4-5 hours, I'm requesting help. Thank you.
