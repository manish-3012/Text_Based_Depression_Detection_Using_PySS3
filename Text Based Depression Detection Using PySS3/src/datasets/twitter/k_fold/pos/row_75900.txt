typing quirks are fucking stupid Like how the hell is anyone supposed read what your saying. "O" does not need to be "0", "S" does not need to be "Z", "A" does not need to be "4". Stuttering in your messages isn't cute, it's cringe and annoying.

Some of y'all be like *it's a coping mechanism*. The fuck you coping with, the alphabet?? Tell me why the people who use typing quirks are the same motherfuckers who throw around the word "ableist". If you're going to type in that annoying ass way, put a fucking translation.

**so damn annoying.**
