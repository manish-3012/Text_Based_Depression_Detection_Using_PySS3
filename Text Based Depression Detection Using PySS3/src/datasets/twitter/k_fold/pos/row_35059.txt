What should I do? Honestly, I'm not hopeful at all that I'll ever get a girlfreind or boyfriend. Literally no girls wants to date me. In 17 and have never even been on a date. Like I know I'm not ugly so its completely my personality and how dry and bad at talking I am. I'm talking to like 4 girls, 1 of them just leaves ne on delivered for long periods of time. I've asked out like 4 girls but I always get rejected. I wanna like date someone already, I havent even held hands with a girl. I guess you could say I'm desperate but wouldn't everybody be if they were in my situation?
