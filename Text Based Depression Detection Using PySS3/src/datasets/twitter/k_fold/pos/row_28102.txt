How do yall deal with mental issues? I've kind of had a but of ocd or anxiety, but recently it's come back a bit and I'm having intrusive thoughts about not existing and some other stuff for a couple days, like an Existencial Crisis. I have no idea what to do or what to say to get help and I'm just at a loss. It's terrifying thinking about it and I just can't shake the thought.

I don't have a gf or someone like that to vent to either.
