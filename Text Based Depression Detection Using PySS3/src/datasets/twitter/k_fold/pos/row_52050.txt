My mom got replaced by an alien So when I got my sideshave in November she was like "lol no it's ugly" but I did it anyway and I still love it. But she was talking to my aunt like "I don't understand how she could like that" and I just thought her hating my haircut is a small price to pay for having an awesome haircut.

Well today my brother was reshaving it for me and my mom watched and my brother joked "you going next?" And she was like "yeah sure" and my brother and I both assumed she was joking.

Then when I was done she went to sit in the chair and my brother was acting like "wait what" and then started getting it ready to shave the side off and I was like "oh yeah they probably agreed to something an hour ago and are pranking me"


#AND THEN SHE ACTUALLY DID IT???
