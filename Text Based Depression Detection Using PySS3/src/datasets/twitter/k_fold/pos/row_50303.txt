Follow up to the post about the girl Iâ€™m really interested in. I made it. I didnâ€™t get her number on Friday but later that day I was scrolling through the recommended on Snapchat and I found her. I added her and then she added me back, I didnâ€™t text her until the day after. We started talking on music and sweet lord is she better than anyone else Iâ€™ve ever talked to, she puts into the conversation. We talked the whole day yesterday and then I thought I made a mistake. I asked her if she played among us and she said yea, so I then asked if she wanted to play some time. I thought that it was too forward but then later on she responded and said she was down. I need to be careful and try not to be too forward. Iâ€™ve made good progress, do yâ€™all think I should wait it out or ask her to play? So we literally only started talking yesterday, it may be too soon. I just want to know yâ€™allâ€™s opinions.
