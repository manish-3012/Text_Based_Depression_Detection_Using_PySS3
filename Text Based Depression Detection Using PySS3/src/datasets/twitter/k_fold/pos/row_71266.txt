Who wins a death match? The original 6 Avengers VS the original 7 Justice Leaguers minus Aquaman to make it fair. Theyâ€™re blood thirsty and they fight in a realm where outside powers donâ€™t work like the mother boxes or the infinity stones. Stuff thatâ€™s unique to the marvel and DC universes. They can call for back up at anytime sort of like end game where strange teleports the people there and green lantern calls the corp. The version for each team is the endgame avengers vs 2001 justice league show version.
