i litterally hate everything, everything is dumb and stupid i litterally love when u fall in love with someone and tell them litterally all the reasons as to y, and then u continue to ask if u can hang out or somethin, and they say no, cuz they gotta do something but then .5 seconds later your other friend says they r hanging out with the person u fell in love with. and so now your just sitting there constantly like, what the fuck is wrong with me, where the hell did i go wrong. the worst part is that nobody knows me like she does, nobody. out of 8 billion people in the entire world only 1 knows me, and she doesnt even like me.

sorry i just wanted it out
