Girls help I think someone maybe likes me. So this girl and I have been friends for a while.  But lately she's been kinda flirty I guess? Like giving me stuff, holding my hand, wanting to work with me at school all the time, and picking me over her childhood friends. All the boys think she's into me but idk.
