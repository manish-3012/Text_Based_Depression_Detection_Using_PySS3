I'm a queer Muslim and it sucks I have done so much research about LGBT in Islam, and honestly, it starts to piss me off, because I will never find a 100% yes or no answer. 

I like to believe that God made me this way and he'd love me regardless of who I love, but at the same time, I have talked to a lot of people who told me, that this might just be God testing me or something. 

Or people saying, that my attraction isn't wrong but acting upon it is, which doesn't make it any better to me.

I really don't want to end up with a man I can't love or get abandoned by my family. At this point, I'm not even lying when I say, that me labeling myself as bisexual is just me trying to convince myself, that I still love men.

Even though many of my friends are accepting, I'm scared. First of my family, that I'd be terrified of even if I wasn't queer, then of burning in hell. 

Yes, to the atheists among you guys this might sound ridiculous, and honestly, I can't even be mad. But I really don't wanna convert or risk my family abandoning me.

I just wanted to get this off my chest.
