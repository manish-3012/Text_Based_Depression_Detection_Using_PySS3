Appreciation Post u/WholesomeCuddlesUwU is probably one of the awesomest people I've seen on this subreddit.

Is their UwUtalk cringe? Maybe idk I use it all the time.
Are they weird? Yes.
Are they wholesome? HELL YES.

We need people like then in this world where everything feels like shit. It's not an easy task. At all.

So, thank you :3
