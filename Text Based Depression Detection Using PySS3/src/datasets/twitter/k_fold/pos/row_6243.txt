I need to take life less seriously D*isclaimer:* Okay, I'm a LITTLE older than a teenager but I still feel like one so I'm posting here.,..

**TL;DR: My professor told me I should â€œtake life less seriouslyâ€ and sheâ€™s right.**

So I was apologizing to one of my favorite professors for fucking up in her class last semester. It wasnâ€™t about the grade, I actually got an A- (which I honestly didnâ€™t deserve and I think she did it out of pity) but because I turned in everything late and my papers werenâ€™t nearly as good as they usually are/should have been.

I was embarrassed and disappointed in myself because I was so excited for this class and passionate about the subject but I had some personal problems/mental health issues/procrastination and I really blew it. You have to understand that, as immature as this probably sounds, I really really look up to this particular professor as a mentor and scholar. Iâ€™ve read her research and discussed it with her. Sheâ€™s given me lots of book and movie recommendations. Weâ€™ve talked outside of class about art and philosophy and mental illness and life in general. I try not to burden her too much, and to give her space, because I know sheâ€™s not my friend, or parent, but sheâ€™s been so encouraging and motivating to me, and shown me a lot of kindness and sympathy when my depression, OCD, and PTSD stated to become more and more obvious (I was eventually hospitalized in the middle of the semester once).

Anyway, I told her how much I genuinely enjoyed the class and learned from it, despite my poor performance, and admitted that I was disappointed in myself and wished I could do it over again. She told me I needed to â€œtake life less seriouslyâ€ and that I perhaps cared â€œa little too muchâ€ about her class for my own good. She was very sympathetic (as always), but it made me realize how I come across and how I need to change that.

I know sheâ€™s right. I now feel so ridiculous for caring so much about everything. I really want to stop being so self-absorbed and taking everything so seriously and just relax, but I do really care about the impression Iâ€™ve made, not in everyone, but on her and my other mentors. I need to just stop caring so much. I KNOW it doesn't matter. I KNOW I need to focus more on other people and less on myself, I just don't know HOW. I will try, at any rate.
