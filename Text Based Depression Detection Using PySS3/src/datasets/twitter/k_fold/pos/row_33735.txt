Just wanted to clarify, is anyone else still doing virtual fully? Hey everyone! I have been doing school fully virtually the entire year. We all had the choice to go back but I chose not to since I am halfway through the year at this point, and I felt like It'd be too drastic of a choice to just start going back. Do I miss my friends? Yes, some. Everything else would be no. Is anyone else still going virtual and having a hard time? I get distracted easily and use my personal computer instead of the Chromebooks because they hurt my eyes more because their screen is so small.
