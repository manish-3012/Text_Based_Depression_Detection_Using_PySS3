Is anyone else's YouTube reccomended FUBAR right now? See the title. My youtube reccomended is quite literally fucked up beyond all recognition, almost as if I logged out of my account. I refresh and get the same videos, all the videos and clickbait/channels I never watch (James Charles and videos boomers watch) with a tiny bit of what I actually watch

If YouTube is trying to shut out smaller channels, it's working. Anyone else experiencing this?
