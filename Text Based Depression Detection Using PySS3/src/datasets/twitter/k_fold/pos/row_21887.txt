I Asked my ex to come over in 10 days... 

I asked my ex if she wanted to come over in 10 days (because in 10 days my parents will be away but I didnâ€™t say this) and she replies with â€œbro what, whatâ€™s in 10 days?â€ It was on snapchat so it was a selfie and she seemed to have a concerned look. 

Based on her reply, do you think If I reply with â€œmy parents arenâ€™t gonna be homeâ€ she will be like â€œwtf is wrong with youâ€?
