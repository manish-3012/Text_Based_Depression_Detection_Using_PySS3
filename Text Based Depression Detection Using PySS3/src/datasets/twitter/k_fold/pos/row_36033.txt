I did it!!! I still can't believe I finally did it. I've been terrified to put myself out there but I finally made a [blog](https://thegradebgenius.com). So no I didn't ask my crush out, I didn't have cancer, and I don't have depression (surprise). But I do have a project I worked really hard on starting and I'd appreciate any tips or support.
