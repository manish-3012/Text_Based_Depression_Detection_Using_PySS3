I still have feelings for her I still love my ex. There, I said it. But I can't bring myself to say that to her. 


#***Here's the plot:***


She was in my same class for 3 years. Got to know her in the first year, became best friends.


Started dating at the end of second year.


Broke up after 2 months. 


Don't get me wrong, she was fantastic, and I really loved the way we connected, it was the right amount of mushy and it was perfectly cute. I felt a very intense sense of comfort around her, and I was deeply in love with her. It wasnt a "She's-The-One" relationship, but it felt so nice. She was also a bit nerdy like me, and we loved talking about a great deal of things, and it was definitely one of the best things I've ever done during my teen years. And I really thought she felt the same way about me. Anyways, back to this.


We didnt talk to each other for the rest of the year. Started to avoid each other for the start of the 3rd year, and she publicly made a scene because I wasn't paying attention to her, **even though** we were still broken up at that point. We mutually decided to set it aside for a while. Had some brief interactions sometimes (all of them being insanely awkward {and maybe a bit hostile}), but for the majority of the third year, we avoided each other. (Or in her words, "ignored.")


Next year, our classes were different. Avoided her for the first half. Connected through Instagram, talked a bit, realised we could still be friends, but nothing more. It was an unspoken agreement, but we mutually accepted it. So this post-breakup friendship has been going strong for a year and a half now. But somehow, I still feel the void.


I understand I may not have been perfect, and I'm still not, but I've done everything I possibly could to redeem myself. I still talk to her, and I listen to whatever she has to say to me, no matter the time/space I find myself in. I realised if I need to make amends, I needed to let her know that she was a priority, and she is a close friend to me. I wrote poems for her, bought her some makeshift gifts to uniquely express how much she meant to me, I listen to all of her worries/insecurities/troubles that she faces, and I try to be there as a source of consolation whenever she needs it. I really do care about her. I really do. But it hurts when I never really see any reciprocal reactions. I think she appreciates it, but, you know, she's not that glad either. (But not in a disrespectful manner)


There's still a part of me that still misses her a lot. A LOT. I still feel like I made a mistake. A few months back, I told her that I still had feelings for her, but she was non-responsive initially, and when I asked if she does feel the same way about me, she said no. It was my own version of r/WatchPeopleDieInside moment. I had to make a joke out of it, quoting some movie scenes, and essentially play it out as if it was a practical joke. But man, it was hard. I was dead inside. Also as I later learned, another guy asked her out, and she still had feelings for that guy, and it was a weird experience for her (even though she proceeded no further with that guy, as far as she tells me. I don't know much, but I understand that that is not my business to mosey into, and I'll leave that arc there)


I know I'm supposed to accept "No" for an answer, and I completely respect that, but this weird, awkward, heavy, torn emotion still harbours my mind no matter how hard I resist it. And the worst part is it is the only acceptable thing I could do. I can't even tell her that I have feelings for her. It sucks. A mutual friendzone filled with emptiness. We were so much more, but now, it's all gone. She's like a completely different person to me now, and sometimes it's as if I barely recognize her. We became so distant in those few years, despite being this close. That's the only time I ever dated, as of now, and I've been quite reserved to myself ever since, because I know I definitely dont have the mental capacity or energy to go through another experience like this, an experience that was so destructive to me (not to mention completely wasteful), that I was reduced to a mere mental husk of an emotion. I pray I don't have to feel that feeling again. All that energy I could've spent to improve myself. And I'm making amends for myself now. But the emotions hit differently. 



If you've read till this part, you have my eternal damn respect. Hats off, kind Redditor, thank you so much for reading this small fragment of my life. It's a thing that i cannot influence or change further, but on the bright side, I have a friend. It's not much, but it's still better than losing one. So that's my story :) Have a great day!



TL;DR : Breakups are the worst. Please take care of yourself, no matter the end result. Be yourself, that's all that matters. Truly.
