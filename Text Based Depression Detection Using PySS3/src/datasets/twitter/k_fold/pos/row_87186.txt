How do I get in contact with friends from primary? Currently in year 11, I can only remember the first name of my best friends in my old primary before I moved to a different primary. I dont have any contact information at all, is there any way I can get access to it? Is it possible for me to E-mail my old primary school providing some sort of evidence I was actually in that school?
