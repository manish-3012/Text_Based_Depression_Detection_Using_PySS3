Hey ladies ;) You see all these people with "talent" and "skills" and "contributing to society" I can do you one better. I beat Prey 2017 on Nightmare difficulty, with all the survival settings turned on, and with only human neuromods. Feel free to dm me because I know you definitely want to after reading this and you're not just thinking "what a loser"
