How the fuck do you run with short hair?? Recently, I had the brilliant idea to cut my own hair ([pic related](https://ibb.co/x7bNGrF)) and I didnâ€™t realize how many issues this would cause, the main one being that it gets in my face every time I run. 

I canâ€™t tie it up because it makes me look like an idiot and I can tie it down because itâ€™s too short. Does anybody have any experience with this-
any help would be much appreciated
