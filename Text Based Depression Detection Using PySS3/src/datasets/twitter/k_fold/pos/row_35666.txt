How to bypass Parental Controls and get to Reddit and Youtube So here are a few things you can do to get to Reddit and Youtube if your parents donâ€™t let you have safari or reddit or youtube because of Parental Controls. The first one is probably the broadest one: use settings (on an iphone). Open up settings and click â€œPasswords and Accountsâ€. Press â€œAdd Accountâ€ and click Aol. Make an account, and when you are done with that, follow all the steps and then you should get back to the place where you clicked Aol. Click Aol one more time and then log in with the account you just created. After putting in your password, you should see something like â€œby agreeing, you will allow ios to...â€ and then four boxes. Scroll to the bottom and then, above the agree button, there is a link that says â€œ I agree to the AOL OpenID and OAuth termsâ€ click that and you should be brought to the Verizon mobile website. press the stacked pancakes in the corner and click privacy center, and then Third Parties. Scroll down until you see a black link that says â€œ.google analyticsâ€. click that and click the google logo above it. Congratulations! you are in google. you can look things up, but the top part of Reddit and Youtube is unaccessible, but that is worth it, because who would block Settings overnight. My second exploit is News, and it is the one I am using right now. If your parents allow the News app, put this link into Notes. https://apple.news/AeeNh6cCEQs6rWyMuLoKsmQ Scroll down until you see a link saying about Bangor News. click that, wait for it to load, then scroll down a little bit and click the Reddit icon. it will have you log in, then it will want you to post a link, but you can just get out of it. Congratulations! Comment on this if you need any clarification.
