I keep seeing a lot of posts about femboys here Iâ€™ve openly been identifying as a femboy for about a year and itâ€™s really become part of my identity. i get that some people think femboys are hot and all that but seeing so many people here fetishizing femboys is kinda disheartening. too many people associate femboys with being a kink. itâ€™s fine to like femboys and be attracted to them but itâ€™s the blatant fetishization that makes me sad to see. i wish it was easier to identify as a femboy without the sexual part being associated with you. thanks for reading ðŸ˜¿
