Help me find the reposter. I was scrolling reddit and I saw this joke about downloading the whole Wikipedia illegally. It was more of a zinger cause the punch line was I can explain everything. It was posted in r/jokes by u/Rupe_Knabu 5 hours ago. I scrolled down and saw the exact same joke in r/teenagers. Before I could see the posters name and time I accidentally pressed the home button and Reddit refreshed. I clicked after the refresh and accidentally opened a live stream. I clicked the back button but accidentally pressed it twice and refreshed the reddit twice. I subsequently went to the r/teenagers home page and tried all types of sorts but couldn't find it. I went to u/Rupe_Knabu home page and saw that he didn't post the joke in r/teenagers. So we have a reposter imposter among us. The reposter might have been u/Rupe_Knabu but I seriously doubt it. To make it worse the repost had awards, multiple. Help me find the reposter and call him/her out. As teenage redditors it's our solemn duty.
