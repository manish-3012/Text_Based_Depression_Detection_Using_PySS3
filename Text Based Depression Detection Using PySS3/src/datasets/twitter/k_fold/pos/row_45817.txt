Iâ€™m walking 60km for mental health So thereâ€™s a fundraiser in Australia happening during October (which if you didnâ€™t know is mental health month). The fundraiser is to raise awareness for mental health, I donâ€™t know if anywhere other than Australia can donate, but it would really make an impact on so many peopleâ€™s lives if you donated. https://www.onefootforward.org.au/fundraisers/jordanbass/one-foot-forward this is the link for the fundraiser and a place you can donate (all donation will be in Australian Dollars)
