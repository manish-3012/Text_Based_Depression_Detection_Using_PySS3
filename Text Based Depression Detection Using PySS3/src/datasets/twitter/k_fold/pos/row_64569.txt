What are your Opinions on MGTOW teens? Disclaimer: this post was not made to discourage dating, if you want to date then more power to you. And the iteration of mgtow I'm talking about is the lifestyle, not the moment.

I personally follow the mgtow lifestyle, for some people, people like me, dating is not my thing, if you do like to date then like I said, more power to you. But the question I wanna ask is are any of you teens out there mgtows. Somthing  I wanna ask people who do know what mgtow is but don't participate in this lifestyle. That is: what are your Opinions on the lifestyle. Me being a mgtow personally, and it not being to common for you to see people who are mgtow, or atleast say they are, I was always curious among all the teens out there, if there are any teen mgtows, I'm just looking for opinions on it
