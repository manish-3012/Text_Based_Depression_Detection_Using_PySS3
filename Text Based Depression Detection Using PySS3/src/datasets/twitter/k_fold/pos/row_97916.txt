Can I just say I'm absolutely in love with this (I'm assuming) new trend of celebrating eachothers achievements on this sub. I recently reinstalled Reddit on my phone and it always brightens my day to see someone posing with their DIY project or just sharing something personal. I think right now, the world needs more of the sheer positivity and inclusiveness this subreddit displays on a daily basis! That's all, happy Holidays guys! Keep it up, you're doing great!
