Do u guys feel weird when you like a bunch of things but they donâ€™t â€œworkâ€ together For example, I liked several different types of music but they donâ€™t really â€œworkâ€ together like itâ€™s just a super weird assortment of stuff. Idk even with clothes and stuff I just like things but they donâ€™t exactly work with each other. I just see other people having this one thing u know like even if they enjoy a lot of stuff it all works together. I feel sort of unstable like nothing I do works together and feels unified. Or with my friends, people I like talking to. Itâ€™s sort of weird talking about people in the same paragraph as those other things but oh well. I know people who are nothing like each other and itâ€™s just weird as fuck that I know people who are so different like I have no solid sense of identity so I donâ€™t really seek out people completely identical to me bc idk who I am u know. I just sorta talk to really different people and I relate to different parts of different people.

I literally have no idea if anything I say makes sense to someone, lmk if it does
