Is it really that bad that I have B's instead of A's? I used to have A's, but my grades dropped to B's after an extremely stressful week, and now my mom says I should be able to sleep/relax/play games until I get them back up to A's. Is it really that necessary? I understand that I'm going to highschool next year, but having B's for 1 week isn't going to hurt right? Is she right? Should I be more worried about this?
