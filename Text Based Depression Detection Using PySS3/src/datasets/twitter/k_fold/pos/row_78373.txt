How do you guys feel about using emojis? Some might consider it a normie thing. Iâ€™m not a normie, Iâ€™m probably the least normie person out there. But I personally use them every now and then because theyâ€™re useful when I sometimes donâ€™t know how else to express myself. The only time I really dislike them is when they are overused.
