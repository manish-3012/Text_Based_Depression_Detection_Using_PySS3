Will I ever be happy again? So a few weeks ago I (19M) caught feelings for the first time in my life ever for this girl. We kissed a lot, she invited me over I bought her flowers and so on. Now last friday we were at a party and she suddenly treated me like I was the biggest jerk and ignored me didnt want to kiss me and that in front of all my friends. I wanted to cuddle her, she turned away and started cuddling with one of my friends. And I sat there alone. She broke my heart like 5 times that day. Now all I do is lie in my bed and I dont have the will to life anymore. How do I get myself back up?
Sorry for the bad english, I am german :)
