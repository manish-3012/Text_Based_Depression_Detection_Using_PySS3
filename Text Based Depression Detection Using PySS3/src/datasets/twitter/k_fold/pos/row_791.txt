Parents complain way too much I probably will sound controversial but if I had to do everything they told (house tasks) why can't I do anything I want after? Litelary if I watch a YT video they say me to stop because youtubers are loud (which I agree most of the times but not always tho), Use my phone for more than 5 mins nope, aren't studying even when don't need to? Now you have to study until you are as smart as Albert Eisten, meanwhile they can stay in their phones on Facebook or Instagram :/ 

Its like someone eating pizza in front of you on purpose while you need to eat salad
