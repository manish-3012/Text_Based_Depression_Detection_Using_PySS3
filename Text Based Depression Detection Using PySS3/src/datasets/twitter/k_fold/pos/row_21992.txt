Why Iâ€™m afraid of mirrors Ok so mirrors are scary as fuck

Like what if the ugly bitch in the mirror comes out and bites me or some shit, he already says mean things to me. Like honestly that prick always shows up when Iâ€™m near a mirror and calls me slurs itâ€™s so mean

Being around mirrors gives me more anxiety than driving past the school where I got bullied for two years straight because the mirrors all have the prick in them and he just teleports from mirror to mirror and always follows me and bullies me and I get so scared heâ€™ll come out of it and bite me or something

And heâ€™s just really ugly it hurts me and scares me to look at him

So yeah thatâ€™s why mirrors are a bitch
