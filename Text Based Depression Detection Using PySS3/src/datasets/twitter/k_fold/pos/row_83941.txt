The age of adulthood should be 25 Scientists show that the brain is not fully developed until you reach this age. Their prefrontal cortex in underdeveloped. This means people they will be less capable of making good decisions if they are under 25. People who are 25 or older have a fully-developed prefrontal cortex, so they can make decision with good judgment and be aware of the long-term consequences. Society puts too much pressure on 18-24 year olds to grow up, but they are incapable of having the same judgment as people age 25+. Instead, they rely more on their emotions to make decisions. I donâ€™t think it it right to overload people with responsibility when their brains are still growing. I have devised a new schooling system to compliment this:

Grades K-7: Elementary School (age 5-12)

Grades 8-11: Middle School (age 13-16)

Grades 12-15: Lower High School (age 17-20)

Grades 16-19: Upper High School (age 21-24)
