Heres a swag and hillarious prank to play on everyone 8-) Gain yourself a reputation as an investor. And then once you get good enough offer people the service of you investing their money in exchange for you getting a partial amount of the money made of investments. But then you never invest it at all you actually use the "invested money" to pay off all the people you should of been paying. So now you have a network of people paying you money that should be invested but in reality all they are doing is making you richer. Then when a recession inevitably comes you get arrested and thrown in prison for life and then thousands of lives are ruined like a boss 8-)
