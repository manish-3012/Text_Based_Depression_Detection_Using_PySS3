Time really flies :'( So I'm 15M and I have shifted schools a lot but since 5th grade (2016) I've been in the same school and I've made really good friends till now. My best friend's gonna graduate in two years, she and I are ultra close and we tell each other about every single stuff I do. My guy best friends are most probably leaving school too. I know this is what's supposed to happen in life, you know, change is the only constant and stuff like that. I am really feeling terrible right now, the fact that everyone I know is gonna leave me some point in life. I know this isn't the best of things to share but I was really feeling like talking and telling all this stuff to someone :'(
