My steam account might be banned for no reason So basically, someone accidentally reported my steam account for directly scamming and making illegal purchases (I did neither).  The person who accidentally reported my account reached out to me on Discord and told me what they did, as well as message steam support begging them not to ban me or themself.  I have put a lot of money into games on my steam account and can't afford such a big financial kick in the face at the moment.  Is anyone willing to contact steam support and help spread my situation?  Link to my steam profile: [Here](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198410432303)
