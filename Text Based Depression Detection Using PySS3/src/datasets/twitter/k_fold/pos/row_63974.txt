Tbh, itâ€™s not the end of Trump even if he doesnâ€™t win He has the right to run as many times as he pleases since he only had one term. Heâ€™ll keep coming back and his followers will be all for it 

So I really donâ€™t see the hype in Biden winning thinking that itâ€™ll end it when itâ€™ll only prolong it
