I wished my friend a happy birthday, and he ignored it My friends birthday was a week ago, I texted him happy birthday on his birthday.  He didnâ€™t respond and I was like â€œok, well he gets in trouble a lot so maybe he doesnâ€™t have his phoneâ€

Until a few days later he texts in a group chat.   Saying â€œIâ€™ve been playing *this game* on my phone every single day hahaâ€.  Which means he just completely ignored my text.  

Fuck.  Why are people like this
