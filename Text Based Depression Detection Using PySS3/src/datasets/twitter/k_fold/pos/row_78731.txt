should i seek out someone to date or just wait naturally? My first girlfriend i met just by chance of her commenting on my story, and i ended up loving her more than anything. After that ended I knew what loving someone is really like, but now I just find it hard to have a meaningful relationship with many girls now that the bar has been set. 

Is it worth it to go seek out someone who i might want to date or would it be better just waiting for someone to come along and let it go naturally like my first girlfriend did?

There might not be a difference and it might sound weird but I've just been having existential crises about having feelings towards people and I'm scared of starting a relationship with someone i won't end up loving (which has happened before:/).
