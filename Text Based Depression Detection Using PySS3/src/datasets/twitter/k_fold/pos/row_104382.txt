Why does everyone hate younger siblings?! Like Iâ€™m the younger sibling and all it means is that most of my clothes are hand-me-downs, no one takes me seriously, and i get constantly ignored. And I donâ€™t get spoiled by my mom, in fact sheâ€™s harder on me. She just wants me to be a clone of my brother without the bad parts. Like if Iâ€™m experiencing something that my brother didnâ€™t my age my mom will deny it solely for that reason. Being the youngest sibling sucks. Itâ€™s not fun, trust me.
