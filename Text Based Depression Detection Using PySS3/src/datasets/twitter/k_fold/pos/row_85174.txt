Incels suffer from sexual exclusion If i bring up sex the girl is like "How dare you think of that? To be clear, i only see you as a friend.". But if i had the looks she would ask me if i want to use a condom or not.

Sex is basically a taboo for incel men. People can talk about it all day but if you say it they look at you in a berating manner. Because they know you are genetci trash, you dont have any sexual rights and you should embrace your lonely miserable life.
