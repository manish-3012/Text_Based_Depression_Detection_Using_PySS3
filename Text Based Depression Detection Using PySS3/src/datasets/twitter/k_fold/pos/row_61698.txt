Advice on breakup Hi, Iâ€™ve just gone through a super casual breakup, I love her so much and my problem is, the breakup was so casual that my mind hasnâ€™t registered that weâ€™ve broken up., I didnâ€™t cry didnâ€™t get mad had no emotions, and I just still love her,. But the fact that we canâ€™t be together breaks me. Weâ€™re still friends so I still think about her a lot. 
Does anyone have any advice on making my mind register that weâ€™ve broken up and let me just be friends with her and make me forget that I love her so much.. cause I canâ€™t live or move on like this where I am still madly in love with her.
