Has anyone taken the GED? How hard is it? I've heard secondhand that the GED is 9th-10th grade difficulty, but I want to confirm this. I'm terrified that when I do the test it will be super difficult and I'll fail. I passed 10th and 11th grade.

Was the test hard for you? Any other help would be appreciated!
