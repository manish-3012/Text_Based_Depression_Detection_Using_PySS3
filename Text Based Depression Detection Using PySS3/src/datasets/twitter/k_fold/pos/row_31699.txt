What in the actual fuck? So i had a dream and to cut to the chase if anyone voted on their phone they would just dissapear. I mean like if they havent existed, then i got teleported to a mall. This mall was of the ordinary, but it had 2 black shadow demons. If anyone has played AC Valhalla yet it was like Odin from Valhalla. Then the other shadow demon was a literal tolder that can run as fast as one could. Apparently my dream self got on my left side and curled up into a ball. If it helps any i do believe in Norse mithos and the representing gods. Can anyone help with this witchery?
