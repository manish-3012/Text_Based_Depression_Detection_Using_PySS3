I found out that my crush likes me back, should I ask her out? The title explains it pretty well. I'm asking you, the people of r/teenagers who have most likely gone thru the same thing, if I should ask her out. I'm torn to not get my heart broken again (my ex cheated on me) and I feel like I'm actually in love here. What does a guy do?
