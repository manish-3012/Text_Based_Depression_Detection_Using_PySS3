Iâ€™m SOOO depressed Iâ€™m getting angry. I have nothing. Nobody in discord or anyone helps or talks to me. Canâ€™t get therapist either. Someone give me some kind of advice My mom knows aight my depression and doesnâ€™t give a shit. I havenâ€™t had a friend in more than 5 years and I have breakdowns when studying. Nobody even cares I used to be the best student in school last year. Now Iâ€™m just so lethargic and un motivated I have no idea what to do. I wish I had a friend maybe. Iâ€™m just so lonely. I go home and do nothing. Ever. Maybe if I had a friend it would help me a little, but man Iâ€™m so depressed. I want something free like no therapist since I canâ€™t go to one to help me. If I have no one to talk to like a friend or therapist the what do I do? Should I just die? if I have no support, whatâ€™s the point of going on? Iâ€™ve been supporting myself for years alone. Now Iâ€™m just dead. I canâ€™t take it. Someone plz suggest something. I canâ€™t go on. Thereâ€™s more, but I donâ€™t wanna be dramatic or type anymore since this is like the billionth time Iâ€™ve vented about my life to no avail
