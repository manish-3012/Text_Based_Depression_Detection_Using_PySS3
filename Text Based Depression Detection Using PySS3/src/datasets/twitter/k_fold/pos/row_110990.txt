I don't understand politics. Let me explain. 2020 It's basically two old guys on this stage bickering and arguing at each other one side of red and the other side blue all they need to do is just fight over gravel then you have team fortress 2. I mean the blue side Joe Biden is basically a pedophile. And the red guy Donald Trump is basically an orange carrot in a black suit. So that's right I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican I'm going to diss on you too bad it's not 2017. So yeah politics are pointless and useless and I don't understand.
