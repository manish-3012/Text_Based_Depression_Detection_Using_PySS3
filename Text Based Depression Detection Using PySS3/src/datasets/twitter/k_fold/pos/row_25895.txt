Things are going great Schools will stay closed this whole month where I live, literally.

Just skipped a bunch of dumb online classes. It's so easy.

And as always, a bunch of annoying teachers try to catch me in the chat. "Why wasn't I online?"

Hmm, mate! My internet didn't work!

This excuse works every time and allows me to do how I please.

It's impossible to have to repeat a class anyway this year, because of corona. They won't make us repeat a class. No matter what. EVERYONE graduates.

These new coronavirus strains are my savior. They will ultimately keep the schools closed even longer. Politicians in my country are already shitting themselves.

I finally get to stay at home and be at peace for multiple weeks beyond the holiday.

Thank you corona, you are my best friend!
