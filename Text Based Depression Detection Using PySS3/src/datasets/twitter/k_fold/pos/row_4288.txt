Making a Diary like thing on Reddit Day 196 Soooo, as i said yesterday, life was getting ready to give me a kick in the balls. I was right, it got ready, but only though my okay charisma. Though it is not perfect most of the time, i can be pretty good when i Need to (along with help from a Friend). Anyways, this person got really sad in the middle of the night, and thought about some not so good things. I dont want to go any further, so let us just go to my Day.

So, i mainly spend my entire day infront of my computer. Nice. I listened to a Lot of music and i really like it. I Mainly heard Hamilton music, because for some reason i decided to watch the whole animatic on YouTube. It was fine, but i feel like i am Missing a Lot of it, because i dont get the acting scenes. It's fine though, because i liked it. The music is good too. I personally like non-stop, my shot, and Aaron burr, Sir. All 3 songs are quite good.

I also played some payday 2, and it went okay. Other than i am not as good as i was before. Still fun, tho.

See ya tomorrow.
