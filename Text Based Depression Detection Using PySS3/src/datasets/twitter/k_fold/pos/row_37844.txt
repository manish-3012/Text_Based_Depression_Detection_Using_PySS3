What people need to understand about preferences Just because someone says they have a preference doesnâ€™t mean they wouldnâ€™t date someone that doesnâ€™t fall into that category, when someone says â€œI prefer black womenâ€ Iâ€™m pretty sure they would date a very attractive, like extremely attractive women from another race if they had the opportunity, 

Preference means, I find people that are/or have â€œinsert traitâ€ more attractive, I donâ€™t think anyone would says their preference is a requirement

If they do they are probably lying, especially with race preferences, I donâ€™t care who you are if a model thatâ€™s a race your donâ€™t prefer comes up to you, youâ€™re clearly gonna be attracted to them
