Should I try to get in contact with someone So I used to have this crush on a girl and I told her how I felt and she said she didn't feel the same which whatever, but I told her when I moved for some stupid reason anyways I was talking to my friend who still lives there and he called her and I didn't know it was her and I thought oh wow I could really be friends with this person and I want to be friends with her BUT I lost her contact info and Idk how it would feel asking my friend for it and if I should even do it
