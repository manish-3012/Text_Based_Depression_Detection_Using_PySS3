It's so hard being a teen and ya know what's worse I'm getting out of it soon :") I'm turning 20 at the end of the year. I know we shouldn't compare but all these successful people these days (actors/online personas/singers/etc.) are literally my age or 1-2 years younger. some are even younger than that age range, some a little older than me but still


&amp; I'm here struggling to find a reason to get out of bed
