I'm upset My father's co worker tested positive and now my whole family has to quarantine for two weeks even if we test negative. School literally just reopened and the last two band shows are in the next two weeks (I'm in band). I hate online school. I almost failed half of my classes last quarter because I suck at online learning. I haven't been able to talk to anyone for over half a year. The worst thing is that I can't do anything. I don't even know why I'm posting this here you guys will probably downvote me for being mad about quarantining.
