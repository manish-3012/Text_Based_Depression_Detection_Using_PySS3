You know, not enough people are wearing masks. I don't know how it is in your country, but here people think that being vaccinated makes you invulnerable to covid (and the infection part doesn't matter, because hey, it's not like other people, for example your fucking child, are not vaccinated and are afraid of getting covid and dying), and so they don't wear masks. Like 30% of everyone that's out in the street doesn't even have a mask to begin with.

Anyway, since *apparently* it's so goddamn rare to see someone caring about other humans, I am going to thank every person that I see wearing a mask properly. bonus points if they are talking to someone. They just deserve the appreciation.
