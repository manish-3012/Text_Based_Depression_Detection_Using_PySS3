Driving test anxiety I have my driving test scheduled for next week and I can already feel the nerves creeping in. I know I can drive but itâ€™s just the pressure of doing it that getting to me. Does anyone have advice on how to calm nerves for the test because Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll sike myself out of doing well.
