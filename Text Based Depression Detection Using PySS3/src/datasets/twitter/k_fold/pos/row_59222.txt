THE REDDIT LOGO IS ORANGE AGAIN I don't know if this is just on my end, but finally, since it was changed back in early june, the reddit logo is orange again.

This is the dumbest thing to be excited about

Not that I was against it being black, but new users weren't even realizing it ever was orange
