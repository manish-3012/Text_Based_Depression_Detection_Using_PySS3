To anyone making jokes about dementia... My grandma is in stage 4 dementia, and i spent an hour with her today. Within that hour she said people wanted to kill her, she was gonna kill me, she was sick, she cried, laughed, and cried again. This has destroyed my family and her life. Please dont make jokes about it. For her sake and everyone who has been affected by this disease
