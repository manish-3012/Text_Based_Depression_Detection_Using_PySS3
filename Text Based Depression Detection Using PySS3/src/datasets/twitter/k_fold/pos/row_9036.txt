Fellow 15-17 year olds... Remember leap frog?

Iâ€™m currently in junior year at high school (eleventh year for you Europeans) and I was talking with my friends about it and I was wondering if anyone else my age remembers the wonderful counsel it was like a Nintendo switch before Nintendo switch

If you do remember leap frog,reply with your favorite game in the leap frog counsel


Mine was the Madagascar penguins game and mr pencil

Thanks bye,
