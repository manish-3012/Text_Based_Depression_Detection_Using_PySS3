I'm an idiot So Im in 8th grade now. But this happened when I was in 7th just before the first lockdown.

I had told a few of my friends that I had a crush on this really cute girl. Most of them were cool and didnt tell her. But the one day Im in robotics class and I hear my friend scream from accross the class "STEW (that's my phseudonym) LIKES YOU" Andrew you son of a bitch.

I went full dipshit mode and just shut the fuck down. I just sat down on the floor and kept working on the robot. The girl and her friend both walked over. But since Im fucking stupid I didnt even acknowledge that they were there. I was just working on the robot and asking the guy I was working with to hand me parts. Im a fucking idiot
