Probably not allowed but Iâ€™ll give it a shot     Hello! Iâ€™m requesting a couple of games (one of them) on Steam if you have them and you donâ€™t want them anymore.
 
****DO NOT PURCHASE ANY!!!****

****DM ME IF YOU HAVE ONE AND YOU DONâ€™T NEED IT ANYMORE.****

 1. **BeamNG** - I think itâ€™s a pretty fun game and it would be pretty interesting trying out crashing those cars and see those simulations. A couple of years ago, I remember watching videos on YouTube where they would take a variety of cars and crash them in different objects and I believe this was the game. 
 

 2. **My Summer Car** - Like every other game, Iâ€™ve also seen this on YouTube and I think is pretty cool how youâ€™re fixing the car and doing all that cool stuff. Seems interesting.


 3. **The Long Drive** - Another quite interesting game similar to My Summer Car but a bit newer I think. I really like the survival concept and that is relaxing :D        


  4. **60 Seconds!** - This little game seemed boring at first but after I watched a couple of videos, it made me quite interested. Another survival game lol
    

  5. **Planet Zoo** - Might not be as fun as the previous ones but Iâ€™m in love with wild animals and this game seems a pretty good one.


  6. **Fall Guys** - This game totally blew up last year along Amon Us and I gotta admit that both look pretty fun although I havenâ€™t tried Fall Guys.
   

   7. **Scrap Mechanic** - Just as Minecraft, itâ€™s kinda interesting that you get to build whatever you want.
