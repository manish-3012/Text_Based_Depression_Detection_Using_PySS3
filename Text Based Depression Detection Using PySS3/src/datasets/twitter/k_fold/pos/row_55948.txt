I just got a threat is this legit? Can they track me down only with my phone number? The body text is what they sent me My boss just informed me not to send you any more text messages, and he investigated about you, and you only ask for photos and waste time for each of his girls and you are one of his main objectives, since all the girls in his company have made him waste valuable time, he has his active men to go to your house or your job, so I think it's better to try to talk to him before things get worse and you and your family and Work be involved in this.
