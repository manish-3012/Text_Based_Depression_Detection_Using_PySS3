I'm going to get downvoted, and that's ok. Recently, I've been seeing online that many Gen Z are bullying our military, cops, and president. I dont understand tmwhy we have to do that to the military and cops. Do whatever you want to the president, but where law enforcement? I know that many people are outraged at the police force because of the inequality and racism against black people, however that doesn't stand for all the police officers, only a handful. Many of them are on the streets getting screamed in the face, harassed and bullied which isnt ok. If they are just standing there guarding, you shouldnt harass them. They are doing their jobs. As for the military, what did they do? They are fighting for the country and protecting us. I would also like to say, that all lives matter, and no one deserves to be treated unfairly. If you would like to enlighten me about why the deserve this, then please do so, just dont start hate.
