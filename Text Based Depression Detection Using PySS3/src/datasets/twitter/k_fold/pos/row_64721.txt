This is kinda desperate sounding but... Can someone talk to me about my mental health? I feel so alone...

I'm struggling wish depression, stress, gender dysphoria, and imposter syndrome.

I'm trans mtf and my pronouns are she/her

I hate who I am and I just wish I stopped having to worry about it...

Sorry I'm begging for attention.
