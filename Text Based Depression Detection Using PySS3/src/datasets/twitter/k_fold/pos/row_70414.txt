I failed a test I failed my Microsoft Word certification test and now I just feel like giving up. I barely failed too which just adds a lil more to top it off. Iâ€™m not sure how to go about doing anything right now as I just donâ€™t feel like it and Iâ€™m just kinda sad.

Thatâ€™s all, thanks for reading if you did
