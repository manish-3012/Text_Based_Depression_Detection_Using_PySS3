Is my coping method healthy? 18 male here, i wanna know if my coping method is healthy.

I had a relationship with this girl i loved approximately 2 yrs ago it lasted about a year or so, and i got real hurt by her and we broke up. 

Ever since then I have this problem that i just get very sad and hurt by very small things, and recently ive developed a new coping method, whenever this happens and i get  really sad, i think about my ex and how i really loved her and how this small thing thats making me sad is nothing compared to my lost love, and it actually makes me feel a little better than before.

Is it ok or should i stop doing this?
