I hate to be that guy but WW1 was pretty fucking good If WW1 didn't happen, women wouldn't have joined the workforce and feminism would have been set back 100 years. We would still be clinging onto religion and homophobia would be just as rampant as it was in the 40's. 

WW2 wouldn't have happened which basically debunked racism. "Oh look, white people are doing terrible things. Guess we are equal". WW1 was basically the start of the end of colonialism. Before WW1 a black or Asian person beating on a white person was barbarism, the opposite was justice. Not to mention it showed the military strength of the Japanese and Slavics which again, debunked racism because it was basically "Oh look, white man isn't the most powerful." 

The world was steadily adopting a socialistic mindset so you could probably kiss capitalism and democracy goodbye since at the time democracy = inevitable poverty. 

Also the first computer? You have the war to thank for that. War = competition = technological innovation
