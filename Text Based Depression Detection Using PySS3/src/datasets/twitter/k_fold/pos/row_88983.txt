Fk covid First year comp sci uni student here. Made 0 friends cuz everything is online and i dont live in campus. Basically failing and im planning to change my major. The problem is changing major = reapplying for uni again. (Like the process cuz its not guaranteed) Holy fk. I hate my family so much. I have two successful sisters and i chose comp sci becuz one of my sisters graduated from uwaterloo software engineering. Im not even talented in that area. I gave up doing art since grade10 and i regret it. Now i get roasted for being a failure cuz im gonna do art. Ok i tried but i still donâ€™t understand then is it still my problem? My motivation from the beginning of uni dropped to rock bottom where i dont want to see anyone. If im kicked out of uni im nothing.
