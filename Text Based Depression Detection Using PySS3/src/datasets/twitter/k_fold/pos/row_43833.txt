The seller in the hole Fictional : 

He has gun powder, Cuban cigars, even discontinued medications for the intestines. He lives down in this hole somewhere and you have to knock on it before opening. Upon opening one would find another layer of glass and behind it is a man in a black skin suit with a dragon mask on. Only speaks through a marker and a whiteboard. One day when buying some old diet pills from the 80s I joked "how many crimes have you commited". Well he must have been prepared because he handed me back a list of every crime he had ever been involved in, with times, locations... all the beef. Well never doing that again
