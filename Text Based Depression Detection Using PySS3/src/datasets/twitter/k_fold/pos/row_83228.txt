Confession. (A bit graphic) I threatened to smash my grandmothers head into a mirror this morning and slit my own throat with the glass. I was so frustrated. I regret it so much. I have a lot of difficulty coping with my ODD and at this point I just canâ€™t take it anymore. (Iâ€™m not trying to excuse it or justify it)

I need this off my chest.
