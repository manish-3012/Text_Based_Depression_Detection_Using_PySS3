im frustrated with how small the internet feels i mean when i was young, there was moshi monster and webkinz and ty and club penguin and so much more. now its the big social media sites (instagram, twitter, reddit, ect) where its so croweded its hard to be noticed

i open my laptop and think â€œwow, an entire world of information right hereâ€, then i dont know where to go. where could be interesting? who would i share it with? once in a while i find something new and thats nice, its just the internet seems so small now. everything seems serious
