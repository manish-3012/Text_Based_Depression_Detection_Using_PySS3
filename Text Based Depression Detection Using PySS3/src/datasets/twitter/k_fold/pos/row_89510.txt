I probably just lost all the progress I made about my mental state in quarantine and I don't know what to do. I had been planning for a while this year, I started planning it, so after my vacation I gave myself a few months to re-plan not only the end of this one but to organize everything for the next one, and it was going so well, I had managed to change, I had managed to concentrate, I had managed to buy everything that was necessary, I had managed to order my priorities; it was important to me, because this is my second year in the new school I'm going to since I moved from other country to here, but because of an irrelevant nonsense that my stepfather had been doing and things he has been saying to me for some time now, and that has ended with me stressed out, now I do not know if I am ready, I can not concentrate on what is important, I ignored all my plans and I spent like two fucking weeks on mental autopilot because I had a nervous breakdown, even when I knew in the first place, that it was the most ridiculous thing to worry about possible, but my answer was: If I have suffered way worse things, why is this the one that keeps me awake at night? Specially with something that isn't my fault?

 These days haven't been the best for me honestly: And this totally healthy way of giving myself a bad life has led me to a shitty sleep routine where I spend a lot of time, late at night, in which, I am not given the possibility of doing the things I have to do, because there are people sleeping, or the inspiration to do the things I want to do, because I can't concentrate, which has led me to put off things like my video projects, or my social life and outings with my friends, because I live far away from my friends: But one thing that sadly I can't Ã±ostpone, it's my studies, so I'm in this situation, where all I want is for the world to give me one more month to prepare, because if this had happened to me a month ago, when I was so calm, I would have time to recover my progress for this date.  But since I know that that will not happen, I am at 7 in the morning, without having slept at all since yesterday, sitting, on a bridge of the outskirts of my town, thinking about what can I do. 
And I can't play videogames or listening to music without thinking I'm wasting my time and not doing something to solve my life before it's too late and it fucks up my entire future, but at the same time I have no idea of what to do.


The conclusion I reached is that I am going to have to live with it, that I am going to have to try to keep my plan even if I know that I am not in the conditions to do it, and I'm just hurt.
