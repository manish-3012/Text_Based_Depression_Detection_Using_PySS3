People keep shutting the elevator door on my face I mean, I think it's funny because it happens every time I'm trying to go down the elevator after I finish my math hagwon. Today I made eye contact with the guy for at least 3 seconds, and the door was closing really slow, so slow the door was open by at least an arm's length by the time I was in front of the elevator, and this dude, right in front of the buttons too, just closes the door on me. Wtf? It's happened for the whole week now.
