Idk, if I'm the only one who doesn't want to look pathetic, but also doesn't want to hide his emotions? Like, I don't want to seem "weird" or pathetic. I just want to feel good during school, but I also don't want to hide my emotions. 
I hope u understand. 

Ps: I don't have this problem at the moment, because I am happy right now. When I wasn't, It was just hard for me to show it.
