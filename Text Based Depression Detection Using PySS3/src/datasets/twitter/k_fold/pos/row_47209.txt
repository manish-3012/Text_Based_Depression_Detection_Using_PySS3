I am a romantic genius when it comes to making plans for my friends Of course when it comes to me I never can

Ok so my best friend was gonna do that one overused april fool's joke to his new gf (they've been together for about a month, really good friends for a few years, he was trying to date her the whole time lol); the one where it's like:

"Do you want a kiss"

"Sure"

*Presses Hershey kiss against lips

"April fool's"

So I was like "ok do that this year, but then next year do the same thing:"


"Do you want a kiss"

"Didn't you do this last year" 

"Do you want a kiss"

"Sure ig"

*Actually kisses

"April fool's"


Now if only I could romance like this for myself...
