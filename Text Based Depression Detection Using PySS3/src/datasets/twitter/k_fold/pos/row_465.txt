Can anyone whoâ€™s fluent in human conversation help me out? So I like this girl, sheâ€™s new and weâ€™ve only talked in zooms. I DMâ€™d her on Instagram and we had the following convo: (she put a rickroll in her bio for context)


Me: Aaand I just got rickrolled (she hearted this)
Me: shouldâ€™ve seen that coming (she hearted this)



Her: HAHAHAHAHAH
Her: woops


Me: now Iâ€™ve gotta memorize the link ðŸ˜­ (she hearted this)



And bam, convo over. What do I do now? Am I really this shit at talking to people?
