Is it bad obese people make me uncomfortable I don't know why. I have no problem with them but when they get close to me without reason or for an unavoidable reason I get **really** uncomfortable.

For example a girl just came as sat right next to me for no reason. A part of it is that corona is still going on here and I treat my body pretty well. Maybe a little too much Mtn dew but nothing I don't work off with my daily work out. Another part is I have way bad social anxiety but this is way worse than anyone else sitting next to me. 

No I don't have a fear of obese people, they just make me uncomfortable.

I again have no idea why, my best guess would be I feel like my persona space is being invaded more so even if it's really not. That just my theory tho
