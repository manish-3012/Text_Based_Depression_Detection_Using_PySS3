DID YOU KNOW: Capitalism caused racism to exist!  

Yep, itâ€™s true. "White" European capitalists wanted free labor; as well as sweet sweet money from selling slaves, and they found a looooot of people they could enslave in Africa.

But, they were Christians. Theyâ€™re supposed to treat other humans well. So what did they do to justify slavery? Well, they invented scientific racism, which would give them a good enough excuse to enslave the â€œinferior racesâ€ and even go as far as to deny them the status of human.

So yep, anti black racism was caused by capitalism, and it can only be destroyed by moving beyond capitalism :/

This is true of all of colonialism. Capital interests wanted to conquer, conquering is kinda fucked up, so they make up an excuse and paint the victims as subhuman.
