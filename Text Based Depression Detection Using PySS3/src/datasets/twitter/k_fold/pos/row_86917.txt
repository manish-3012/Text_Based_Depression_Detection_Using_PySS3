Iâ€™m guilty about so much itâ€™s crazy, I donâ€™t even know anymore if I can say anything without feeling bad about myself. I know so many things are normal for people to do, itâ€™s completely okay to be that way but damn idk why I have so much guilt. Wtf is wrong with me, I just want to do things without feeling like an awful person all the time. Nothing I do feels okay. I really just regret everything I say and do. I just donâ€™t want to do anything anymore. But that makes me feel so guilty too bc Iâ€™m supposed to be doing something
