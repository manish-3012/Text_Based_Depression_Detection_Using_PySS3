So i was thinking today Do other people when they drink alcohol or do other drugs have a feeling like they are letting out some other person that lives inside your head and closing down the "original version of yourself". Every time when I drink alcohol I feel like I am aware of what am I doing but I dont control the actions. For example I know someone is 100% lying to me but I belive that. So now im wondering if its the same for people who take medication.
