assistance please iâ€™m in 8th grade and thereâ€™s this girl i like. i really want to be friends with her but i donâ€™t have the confidence to say something. should i leave her a note or something?? this is prob not the best place to ask this but itâ€™s my last option. iâ€™ve tried asking my friends and wikihow, but none of them really helped. thanks lmao
