the 'popular' girl now does what I get hated for and no one cares this girl I used to go to primary school has started watching anime, dying her hair and wearing darker clothes and eyeliner. I found her insta again the other day and all of the people in the comments are like being nice and saying she looks great and how good kakegurui is (as I'm pretty sure that's all she's watched) as she recommended it to them. And I still get called names for watching anime and wearing black and it scares me and I really, really hate it. Not her liking anime, of course. Just her being accepted whereas I'm not.
