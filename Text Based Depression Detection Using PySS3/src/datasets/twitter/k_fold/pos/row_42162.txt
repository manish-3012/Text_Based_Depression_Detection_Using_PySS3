I've been thinking, So, we've all had imaginary friends, right? Or are at least aquatinted with the idea. I know a lot of people probably had fake or mythical creatures as there if (imaginary friend), but I had one that was just a normal person, so, what if, somewhere, some kid has an if that's literally just you? Like looks, interests, the voice... I should really go to bed.
