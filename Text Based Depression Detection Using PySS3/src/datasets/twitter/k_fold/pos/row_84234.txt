The highest compliment I can bestow upon anyone is either drinking from their bottle or eating something they bit off of or letting them have a bite of something of mine I swear Iâ€™m not a germaphobe, I just really donâ€™t like sharing mouth stuff. Iâ€™m pretty sure it has to do with my pure hated of throw up or something like throw up. If I share my food with you it means I must really like you or because I really donâ€™t like you but donâ€™t want to say anything because Iâ€™m a shy ass bish
