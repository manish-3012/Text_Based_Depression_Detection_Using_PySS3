How to get rid of teenage stretch marks? Approx. a year ago I got stretch marks across my back and it's only gotten worse since. The only treatment I get is some creme that my dad found at the drug store. Is there any hope they'll fade away on their own (instead of getting worse again) or should I consider more serious therapy (idk I read something about lasers lol)?
