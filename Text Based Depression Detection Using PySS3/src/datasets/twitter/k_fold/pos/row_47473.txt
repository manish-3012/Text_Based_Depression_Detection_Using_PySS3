my favorite ppl traits girl: high anime voice, fishnets, black flowy dresses, old worn out boots, is very bossy but not at all rude, super funny but not on purpose, can always start actual interesting conversations and keep them going, and they have super cute stub eyebrows and a bob and bangs, super loving, flirts often

yeah yeah i know its a lot. i dont need alll of them

my kind of man:

very masculine, doesnâ€™t look gay, nice jawline, shaved head, beautiful penis, loving, funny, good at conversation, flirts often, wears long sleeve plain shirts under plain white and black tees

i also like all other genders but i still have the same interests for them
