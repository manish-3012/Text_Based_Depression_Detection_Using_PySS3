Okay teens. Weâ€™ve got a problem, and we need to fix it. Now. I think weâ€™ve all seen or heard about the massive pedophile issues this sub is having. Starting right now, if someone has been DMâ€™ed dick pics or been asked for nudes by anyone on Reddit, not just this sub, DM me their username. Of course, make sure theyâ€™ve been reported to mods of the subs theyâ€™ve been on. 

I know thereâ€™s tons of these people out there, so if you want me to handle reporting these scum to the FBI, Iâ€™d be glad to. Of course, you can report them yourselves at [this website right here](https://report.cybertip.org) which is an organization that works with the FBI to fight online child exploitation. But, if you want me to handle any of this for you, or if you want someone to help you cope with a traumatic experience, or really anything else related to this, my DMs are open. Iâ€™ll get back to you guys as soon as I can. 

Thanks for reading. Letâ€™s fight this together. Also, this specific website only applies to US-based reports, although Iâ€™m sure Interpol and other international law enforcement agencies have similar systems.
