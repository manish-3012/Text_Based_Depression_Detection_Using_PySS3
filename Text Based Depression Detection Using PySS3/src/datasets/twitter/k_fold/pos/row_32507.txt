Am I the only girl thatâ€™s horny Sometimes, in band class, I see the trumpet players and trombone players, and I think, wow I think Iâ€™m horny. I play flute, but Iâ€™m not flutey. My friend that plays the clarinet seems clarinety. My friend that plays the baritone seems baritoney. I think Iâ€™m more horny than flutey. My heart yearns for the French horn, but my instrument says to stick to it.
