Is anyone else having every meme that they post getting taken down? Iâ€™ve posted at least four memes that were taken down within an hour because they were deemed â€œtoo similarâ€ to another meme. Most of the time itâ€™s just the fact that itâ€™s the same template that had a similar subject matter, which is irritating because it is a new meme. But Iâ€™ve had memes that get taken down for being too similar despite the fact that itâ€™s a different template and is talking about two different things. I donâ€™t know if this is just me having issues, but if it isnâ€™t I think we need to take a serious look at the bot that scans them.
