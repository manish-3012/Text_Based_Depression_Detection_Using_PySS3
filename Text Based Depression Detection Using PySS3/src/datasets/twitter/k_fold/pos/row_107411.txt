Just a vent, carry on. Soooo, hmmmmm. I dont know where to start, vents arent my thing. Guess, i dont know, i have been feeling pretty sad and lonely for like some time. It started almost 5 months ago, im not sure. I might have been lonely before but that's now not the point. I was always the "weird" kid. I had friends, but i mostly preffer to be alone. So those 5 month ago i decided to ask my crush out, i said "fuck it. What do i have to lose?" and to no ones suprise, atleast mine, she said no. And thats fine, it was her choice and it didnt bother me that much at first. The whole time i just thought :"i still got further than people who didnt ask their crush out." I thought i would get over it but life said :"Nope, fuck you!" My best friend said the day after that he is moving out in 2 days and we planned to atleast spend the next day at his house playing some cod zombies or some shit. But turns out i had to go to my aunt or something other. So he vent away without ever saying a proper goodbye. We still keep in touch, but its not the same. So now im here alone, nobody to talk to. I tried making new friends online since corona exists but i have 0 friend making skills so the conversation stops after no more than 10 minutes. Also school gave us 10 test in 3 weeks didnt help me. Im just sad, lonely, maybe depressed. I dont know at this point. I just feel so lost and alone, I see all these post like what should i get my bf/gf for cristmas and she said yes type of posts and a part of my soul just dies every time, a part of my soul i didnt know it exists. And i dont know how to say this, but i feel like my problems dont matter because im 13, almost 14 and i know that there are people who have suicidal thoughts and other mental desiases. 

Thanks for reading it till the end, sorry for bad formating and any gramtical mistakes i made.
