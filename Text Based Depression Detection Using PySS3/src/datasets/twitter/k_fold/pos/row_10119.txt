I donâ€™t know what to do with money So... as the title says I donâ€™t know what to do with the money I earn from chores, small jobs, etc. If anyone here wants/ needs something special for this coming Christmas, let me know and Iâ€™ll try to help as much as possible.

Edit: Thank you to all the people concerned about me needing to save money and all that. I greatly appreciate it but Christmas is the season of giving, even though itâ€™s not here yet, and I want to give what I can to everyone.
