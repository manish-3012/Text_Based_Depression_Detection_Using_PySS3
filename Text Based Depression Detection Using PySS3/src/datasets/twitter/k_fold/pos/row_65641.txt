Food simp This dude is always trying to get my attention when he sees me eating, idk food must be his thing. It seems like a weird thing to do but I actually enjoy the attention, however the thought of dating him makes me sick. If heâ€™s not staring heâ€™s drooling, begging, trying to look cute, and if I ask he will even spin in circles for me. He must really want that cake, but this act heâ€™s pulling is not gonna get him a piece.

I mean even if I wanted to give him a piece of my food, the vet said dogs canâ€™t eat people food
