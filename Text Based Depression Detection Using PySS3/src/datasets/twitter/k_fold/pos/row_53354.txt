my school has no chill ok so recently my school  has given a feature to teachers where they can see what tabs we have open and CLOSE THEM whenever they feel like, online school is extremely boring and I need stuff to do every once and a while. it feels like I have no privacy, my computer is currently broken and this is the closest thing I have to one, either way it's kinda embarrassing how they basically shame you for being in different tabs, I'm probably crying about nothing important and I'm in the wrong but whatever
