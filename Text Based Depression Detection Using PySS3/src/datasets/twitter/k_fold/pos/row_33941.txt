I havenâ€™t skipped a day of wearing my retainer at night for more than a month Iâ€™m kind of proud of myself bc I managed to make that a habit. I was freaking out bc I didnâ€™t wear my retainer months after I got my braces removed so I thought that my teeth would go back to the way they used to. It was really hard to get used to it at first because it hurt a shit ton but then it hurt less and less. Now my teeth look back to the way they did right when I got my braces removed. My orthodontist would be proud of me bc I never wore my rubber bands when I had my braces lol. Anyways I just wanted to say that bc I havenâ€™t missed a single day and Iâ€™m happy with how my teeth look rn. Iâ€™m glad I suddenly decided to wear my retainer bc I could have ended up having to get braces again possibly. I kinda learned how you can get a good habit with this experience.(not that itâ€™s a huge thing, itâ€™s just a retainer lmao.) It got me thinking how it seems so impossible at first but after the first couple of weeks it becomes second nature. Maybe I could quit all my bad habits that are pretty much impulsive this way
