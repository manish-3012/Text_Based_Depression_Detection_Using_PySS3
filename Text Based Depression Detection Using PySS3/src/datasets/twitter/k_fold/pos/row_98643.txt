Dating just to say you are Okay, so alot of people ik are dating ppl, i feel like most people in high school just date to be able to say I'm not single (i said most, some people not everyone) like i feel most people do it so they can have some kind of flex over someone with "I'm not single, i have a gf im dating" i personally don't care either way so why try make yourself have that title when in the end yall break up.
