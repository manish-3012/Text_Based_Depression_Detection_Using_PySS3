Happy oluja day For those that don't know.

Oluja (storm) was a military operation where by all odds Croatia won against yugoslavia in the Croatian war for independence.

Because of this operation we got hope and were able to win the whole war and get our independence.

No hate to any Serbs ofc but still we celebrate this
