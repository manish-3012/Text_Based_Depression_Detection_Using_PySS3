anyone girls be my internet girlfriend so this is kinda serious kinda not im just so lonely i just want to love someone and be loved, is that so much to ask for? the worst part is constantly hearing other people and how they are so fucking lucky to have a gf/bf, and here i am, with nothing. hell even the single girls i find are all like "not interested in a relationship rn", and the one girl i ever met who actually told me she liked me, deleted her account 2 days later and i never heard from her again. can't i just have love. is that so much to bloody ask for?
