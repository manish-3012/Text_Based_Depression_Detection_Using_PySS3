Haha, I'm very funny. Like the 90's. Julie, Jonny, Jennifer and Tobias had a little Halloween get together at Julie's house. Julie took out a few boxes and explained the fun game she planned.

"You have to stick your hand in each box and feel what's inside! But watch out! There are real organs and body parts in each box! Whoever conquers their fear gets a golly gee ton of Caprisun! Because that's what 90's kids love!"

Tobias who had been an emo freak who didn't want to conform the entire time quickly brightened up as much as a pale ass emo kid could. "Alright! My family plays this game all the time! Tubular!"

" I don't wanna do it!" Whines Jennifer like the little bitch she is. "I'll do it!" Says macho man Jonny who then quickly backs out like a fucking pussy.

Tobias shoves his hand in hole of the box the way a teacher shoves her hand in kids mouth for gum.

"It's an eyeball!" Tobias cries with mighty triumph. "Good job!" says Julie because she is a simp for emos.

But then Tobias pops the "eyeball" in his mouth. "Tobias no! You're not supposed to eat the peeled grapes!" Julie whines because even though she is a simp, she needed to give those grapes to her drunk step dad so he wouldn't leave the house naked in search of food.

Tobias pauses and stares at Julie in confusion. "Wait." he says. "These aren't real?"
