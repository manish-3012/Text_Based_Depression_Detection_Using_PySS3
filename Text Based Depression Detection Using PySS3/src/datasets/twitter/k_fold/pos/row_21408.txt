I cant stand Khan Academy! what do you learn from khan academy, nothing but BULLSHIT. it fucking pisses me off when it makes it impossible to actually learn shit when the fucking narrator makes a 1 page topic 10 minutes long. Dude, it is 1 page and you cant easily teach someone how to do it? like by the time I finish a book the video isn't even half way done yet. and no, the video isn't even enough for the fact that the practice problems are complete bogus. you don't get any second chances doing the problem even if it was a typo on the last FUCKING problem. I hate how khan academy is forced down our throats. fuck khan academy.
