Animal's are kinda scary (sorry its so long, its worth the read though)

OK so just tonight, ive gotten scared by two animals. 

The first animal was a spider, I was chilling in my room and then all of a sudden, there's a huge spider on my floor, like 2 1/2 inches wide or something, I cant think of an example as to how big it was. But anyways I saw it, I got really scared and I got up to kill it but it ran away to my closet. After that I started thinking, I saw on my foot this morning that I had a spider bite, then I saw a really big spider on my floor later that night, I got payback and I feel good about it :)

But ok the other animal, earlier tonight I carved a pumpkin and I went to go check to see if the light was still going but got distracted by a random animal running across my yard. I thought it was a tiny kitten so I went to grab my sister so we could both see it. There's a pipe under my driveway for like floods and what not, the "kitten" ran under there so my sister and I went over there with a flashlight, she shined the "kitten" with it and it was a possum. We both screamed so loud but it was hilarious after. It scared the absolute \*shite\* out of me.
