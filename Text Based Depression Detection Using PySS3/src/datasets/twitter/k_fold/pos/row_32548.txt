A story about how i almost died.  In 1st grade, some guy pulled a "prank" on me by grabbing my head and putting it under the water because we were in a pool. So he put my head  under it and i literally just accepted my fate, my thoughts were "welp, it's not like i was gonna do much with my life anyway, goodbye world i accept my fate" and then the dick head let go and i was free.
