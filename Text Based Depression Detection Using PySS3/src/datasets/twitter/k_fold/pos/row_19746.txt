I am so happy for my sister and her boyfriend They were just hanging out today before school and I realised how happy I am for her. She has been dating her best friend for months now. They text each other good morning and good night everyday. They don't go on any dates but when I see her in the hallway chatting with him I know they are having fun. I love her and I hope they remain friends till they grow old. She's only 14 so I don't expect their relationship to last forever, but I know they are really happy
