Ranting again I guess I have become very self conscious about how I look and I'm beginning to hate it. I used to care very little about how I looked, of course I wanted to look decent so I did try to look appealing as of brushing my hair and other hygiene. Then I started wearing jackets to cover my arms. Then I eventually started wearing hoodies to cover all of myself. Then I started wearing clothes without words or objects on them. Then last Christmas I bought some plain blank dark colored t-shirts even though nobody will see them under my hoodies. Now I keep worrying about my hair. There's one part over my eye that does some stupidy curly shit and I can't do anything about it.

Now it's four thirty AM and I begin wondering if I've lost hold of myself all because I fell down a rabbit hole in my mind about a school bus.
