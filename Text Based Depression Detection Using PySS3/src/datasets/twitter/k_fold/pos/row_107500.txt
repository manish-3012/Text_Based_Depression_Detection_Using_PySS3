I am extremely scared Firstly some facts ....I am from India and with the huge population....competition here is extremely high.

Every year we have an exam called JEE to get into the most prestigious universities of india for engineering...and I have been preparing for that ....its been too stressful...I used to be this highly positive attitude person but all of these studies and seeing others do so well has constantly been decreasing my morale.

I study many hours a day...though i am not as smart as others...I study efficiently and used to end up getting good scores but now everything feels extremely hard....I am extremely scared for my future...I get panicked thinking about this
