I successfully completed an entire 45-minute lesson (and its homework) without any distractions whatsoever. This includes reddit. I know a lot of these kinds of posts are satire and joke-like (at least for this sub), but I feel pretty accomplished because it was a big step for me. I always get sidetracked doing schoolwork, but I managed to pull myself together for an entire 45 minutes without checking reddit, staring mindlessly at my screen, or looking out the window.

It feels amazing and I wanted to share. How was your school day?
