I don't even know how to explain, just read the post My birthday was yesterday and I saw my girlfriend cheating on me with my brother. Today I mentioned it to them and they were both denying it. As if I hadn't seen them going at it on my desk. After a year of constant stress, and now this, I'm starting to feel life isn't worth living if all that happens every time I open up to someone is I get hurt. I needed to get that off my chest, and I don't feel comfortable talking to my family. Thank you. If this even remotely darkens your day, I'm sorry.
