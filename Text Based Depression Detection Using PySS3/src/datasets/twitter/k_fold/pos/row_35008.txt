Am I at a good age for a teenage relationship? Iâ€™m 13, turning 14 and in Year 9 (I think grade 8 for ppl in America) and Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m ready for a relationship with someone. Maybe Iâ€™m not mature enough or... 

So I came to this subreddit to ask, since I saw a bunch of other ppl posting about their relationships. 

Also please tell me if I should post this in a different subreddit and Iâ€™ll remove this one. Thx
