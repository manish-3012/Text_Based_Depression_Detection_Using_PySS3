I know it's cringe but just had my first kiss Just had my first kiss today we were in a group of 9 and they all went ahead and we stayed back to take a picture and then me and my gf just kissed! I know it is not a lot but I thought I should just post it really happy I can have such a wonderful girl like her (I'm a guy)
