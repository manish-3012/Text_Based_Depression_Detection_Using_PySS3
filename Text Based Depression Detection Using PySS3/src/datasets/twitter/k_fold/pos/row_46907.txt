In the comments, write a one paragraph summary for every year of your life, and I will read and respond If youâ€™re thirteen, write thirteen paragraphs, if youâ€™re eighteen, write eighteen paragraphs, and so on. You can skip over when you were a baby, but maybe put some stories people have told you if you can.
