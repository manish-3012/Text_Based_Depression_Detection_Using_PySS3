I despise COVID No, not for the usual reasons. For a special one. My grandmother used to live with us, and every few months she would go to visit our home country to take care of stuff and visit her friends/siblings. She was supposed to come back to America in April earlier this year. But thanks to COVID, she got stuck there for five extra months. 

But that's not why I despise COVID.

I was on a video call with my grandmother yesterday, and I said I was really for her to come. She then replied to me by saying that for 2 weeks, we can't do anything with my grandma, we have to wear masks around and basically social distance inside our own home. 

I want to be able to talk with my grandma after not seeing her for a while. But no. I know that routine is what's gonna keep us safe because she came in from another country, but I want to have fun with her, and see what gifts she brought us.

That is why I despise COVID

Fuck you COVID
