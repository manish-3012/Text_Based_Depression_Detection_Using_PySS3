so god damn tired and sleepy so I slept at like 3am last night bc I couldn't sleep and also I may or may not have been high which is normally weird bc when I'm high I can sleep perfectly fine but lass night I think I drank too much coffee or something and that's why I couldn't sleep but last night was miserable and then I had to wake up at 7am for school yknow and now it's almost 11 am and I wanna take a nap so badly
