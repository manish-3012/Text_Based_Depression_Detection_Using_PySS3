Feeling fucking pissed, and I need to rant.  This ["man"](https://www.reddit.com/user/hot-mission8540) pestered me to send nudes, even after I said no. I then played along, to see him go further with his foolery. After seeing his antics go further, I finally basically told him to go fuck himself, and made a post featuring him. Now, action should be taken place against him. Can't believe these kinds of people are so stupid.  I honestly feel sorry for the people who have had to go through that. hearing him talk about me the way he did made me feel sick.  If people harass you, they should be reported. 

I don't care if a person goes down the street literally naked, they should not go through that. Period. Going through first hand experience of these kinds of degenerates really made me get it. It really does feel awful. I feel for people who have gone through, and worse, situations than mine. If anything, this was tame compared to what other people go through, and that fact alone makes me pissed.
