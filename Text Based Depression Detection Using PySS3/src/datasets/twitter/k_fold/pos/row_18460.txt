I did a good deed today so I was walking back home after a long work day and found this white elderly woman struggling with this tall  black man with half the face covered for his purse. 

I couldn't stand such blatantly racism act so I kick the woman with all my might right in her chest so hard that she drop in the ground without moving after that. The black man looked me with gently eyes and run away as fast as he could. 

I didn't mind that he didn't thanks me or called the cops because everyone would be scared after went through this situation.

 Then I went feeling happy to my house, I didn't even called the ambulance for that dirty thief. I just let her lay there on her own.
