Issue with my school(nicely put rant) **Dealing with mental health issues among student:**

Consistently in school i have seen the deputies deal with students with bad behaviour in 1 way..... Give them a time out card(A card that allows them to leave class at anytime with no questioning) Students will abuse this power so much by using it and jumping the fence, even students with no diagnosis can get a card as long as they look, sound, ETC like they have an issue. I have a friend who has one of these cards and she abuses it like hell. Time-out cards can woke if done properly, but they're not. The school doesn't even set the student up with a therapist

**The schools look(Behaviour)**

My school has a terrible reputation, fight after fight after fight with themselves, we've even had police come into our school for things like Machetes, Guns, Drugs ETC But they think a tie will fix it all, No it won't caring about your students will fix the issues and addressing the issue will help

**The schools look(Buildings)**

The school is disgusting, gum everywhere, broken railings, torn and burnt grass, flakey paint, everything is bad
