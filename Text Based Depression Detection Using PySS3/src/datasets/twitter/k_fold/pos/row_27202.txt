Anyone wanna read this story I wrote for a school assignment?  

*Luke Jacobs, 7/10/18 10:20 AM*

Oh Lord. Something's happened with Bill.

I just got a call from Emily. The guys are gone, or something. Out in the ocean somewhere. Why do bad things happen to good people? 

I've known him for years, I guess hearing that he might be gone is a bit of a shocker, he was here just the other day. When was he here? Tuesday? No, Wednesday was 4th of July. My memory fails me these days. I guess I'm aging. Why am I even writing right now? I guess it's my stress relief. I mean I did meet Bill while at a bookshop in Findlay. He was working there, I looked at his little name tag, and asked where the surname *Ratchinta* was from. He told me nowhere, that his grandparents made it up when they came over and moved to some out-of-the-way area of rural Ohio. 

But it was fishing where I really met him. The number of little aquatic monsters he's caught could fill a market in Indonesia or something, I don't really know I've only seen places like that on National Geographic. But Bill did like to fish. Fished with his dad growing up. Fished with me and the guys afterwards. Can't remember who he's with now, I think the Southerners.

Guess it came back to bite him. Down in Florida yesterday fishing and now on a boat somewhere in the Gulf. Or the Other Option. But let's try not to go there. 

But I guess if we're trying to write a story here, or at least the scraps of a story, I'll have to describe what Bill looks like. And hey, I have time. I guess one could try to say it this way: think of a stereotypical farm guy on a tractor with overalls on, make his skin the kind that burns in 30 minutes of being outside, and then have him work in an automobile factory for most of his life and have some muscles from it. He sort of lacks any sense of style and is perpetually in the same pair of T-shirt and jeans. And overalls. I never did get the overalls thing. Hopefully if he ever reads this he'll like my description.

We just got a call about the situation, and I figured I should write down what was said. My best recollection about what I heard from Emily from down in Florida is: "They think they're trying to figure out what's happening with them, somehow there's no signal or anything from a boat anywhere. I've just been sitting on the docks for a while, waiting. Waiting." Then she hung up. Bit of a strange call in some ways. But what am I to say from here in Ohio. But while we're waiting, I guess I'll add some info on what those docks are like in an attempt to keep you at least passingly entertained and me, passingly distracted.

I've been down to where they go fishing plenty of times. I usually go every year was it not for the fact that I had my nephew's wedding to attend in Toledo this trip. I never got why they picked Toledo anyway. But I guess anymore there's a lot I don't get.

But back to the docks. It's a nice place. You'll get a few groups of guys all going out at nine and getting back for dinner at four. Tiring stuff, so a man by the name of Redding who frequented those docks set up a fish gutting shop right next to it all. Land's cheap around there, there're farms on every side and Mr.Redding could buy a little plot for nothing. And anyway everyone already knew him. It's a tightly knit area. Only things you hear are fisherman, rusted trucks, and the buzzing of whatever kinds of monstrous bugs they have down South. Those things make me shiver.

Hey! Both this and the last entry are exactly four hours apart. But otherwise, we just got another call in from Emily about why they guys are even stranded. She said that she had to cut the last call because her phone died from both forgetting to plug it in last night and then repeatedly trying to call people. She said that they went out in the morning, maybe five or six, just my guess because that's when we usually go out. Apparently a storm was around and the guy's weren't 100% on everything, but every news station said it was moving from the Gulf over the peninsula towards the Atlantic. But Bill got everyone to agree and the three of them went out anyway. Guess his ever present optimist did him in a bit. But Florida weather is a pain and the storm changed directions while they were out and they got caught up in it. And it had strengthened on the way upâ€¦

UEFHUIJunvjsken. WE HAVE PROOF! PROOF OF LIFE! HALLELUJAH!

But in seriousness, we just got a call from the man himself. I'll try to write down all the words he said that I remember:

"Hey Luke! You hear me? We're okay! We're gonna be fine. The engine died in the storm, so did the whole electrical and basically, well, anything systems. But we've been fine, maybe a little wet. Got an SOS out to the mainland, we aren't too far out, I think they're trying to figure out where they put the Life Guard boats or something. We've been drifting a bit too much and the SOS doesn't give very accurate readings for some reason. One of the reason's this beautiful boat was so cheap. Hope she runs after thiâ€¦" And there it cut out. He got the call out from his old Satellite phone that Emily went on about when he bought it, saying that a married couple needs to consult each other for stuff like that. I guess that money was well spent. Though he never did pay me the $50 he said he was going to when we let him sleep on our couch for a night.

I just saw the news. There's ANOTHER STORM going by. WHERE ARE THESE COAST GUARDS I SWEAR. But maybe I'm being a bit too harsh. After all, Bill's little dinky "ain't she a beaut?" is, well, dinky. Bill's quite a frugal character. I guess he gets it from his parents, who got it from their parents, who were all poor Scotsmen who one day decided that they could hop on a boat and move out to this little agricultural sector. Maybe the Scots is why he seems such a patriot . And why he filled his bathtub trying to make homemade beer that one time. The taste still makes me shiver a tad. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*7/10/18 11:32 PM*

No clue what's happening. I tried to check what happened to the weather and it looks like the storm didn't last too long, I don't think. Seems to me that my friends seriously need portable chargers or something, that's what I'll say. But it's late and I figured that I'd write one last entry before 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*7/11/18 7:37 AM*

Sorry for that one, I was too tired and just closed the computer and went to bed. My phone just went off a-buzzing a few minutes ago. Pictures of the guys. And a very long explanation as to why they didn't text or contact anyone when they got rescued yesterday. They dropped the bag with all the phones in the water hopping from the USS-whatever-he-calls-dinky-boat to the Life Guard's boat. And Emily had to get her phone charged after she had been doing stuff all day. But they got back safely, and they pulled the boat back to shore apparently. The Guards got there at 7:20 or around there, so I guess I *was* a bit too harsh on them yesterday.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*7/13/18 5:18 PM*

Ay! Bill's here now, they just finished up driving back. Hey Bill, why don't you write us something!

Hey Luke! Nice to see you. I see you've written about this whole situation. I do like your description of my fashion, sounds accurate. Yes, I do seriously need a buy one of those portable power battery things, and yes I know you're watching me type this right now, so while you're at it can you text me the ones you so famously love and use all the time. If I were to rate this wholeâ€¦ experience, I'll rate it a 4/10. Terrifying, but hey, glass half full I got to ride in a Coast Guard boat. 

I think I'll end it here
