i hate this literal cult please get me out of here so i don't know if y'all have heard but the pope made a statement endorsing gay marriage, so you know, i was happy cause basic human rights are good. well my church printed on pamphlets "the catholic church can never be accepting of same-sex marriage and the homosexual lifestyle" and then the priest proceeded to claim that pope francis's words were manipulated using video editing by atheists and the "radical left."
