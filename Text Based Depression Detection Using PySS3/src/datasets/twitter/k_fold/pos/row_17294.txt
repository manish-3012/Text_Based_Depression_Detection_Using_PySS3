Yo! (15/m) here, wanna chat? Even though I'd prefer talking to cool boys and cool girls my age, 14/16 year olds are welcome too I guess.

I've recently noticed that I have NO friends, due to me being extremely awkward, lazy and introverted. 
I've tried to reach out to people irl in the past but that never ended well so here I am, asking for friends on Reddit. Yes, I'm THAT pathetic.

Here's a list of stuff I'm into:

â€¢Netflix 

â€¢Anime (not a full blown Weeb tho)

â€¢No context humor

â€¢Sketching

â€¢Being lazy

â€¢ Animals

â€¢Folk Rock
