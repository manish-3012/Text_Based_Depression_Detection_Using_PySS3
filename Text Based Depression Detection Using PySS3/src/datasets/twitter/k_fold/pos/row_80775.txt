Words of advice: always make sure to think your jokes out before you post them on reddit and don't want to go back and change a several hour old comment I saw some post about Biden winning the recount in Georgia. Someone commented "wanna see me win Georgia? Wanna see me do it again?" I got the reference, but my smooth brain replied with "Captain trump, beat him in an election and hes bound to erupt."





Several hours passed and it just fucking dawned on me that I could've said "Captain MAGA" because that's so much fucking closer to magma and I don't want to go back and edit the comment because the post is probably already dead and that ship has sailed.





Thanks for coming to my TED Talk
