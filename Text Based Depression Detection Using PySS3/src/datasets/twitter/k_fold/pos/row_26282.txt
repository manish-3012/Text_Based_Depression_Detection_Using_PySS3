Fuck it. Here's the (slightly censored because I don't want to get banned) lyrics to U.S. Gay by Sons of an Illustrious Father. If I donâ€™t die tonight
Iâ€™m gonna dance until I do
And if you're not too afraid
I wanna dance with you

If Iâ€™m not shot tonight
Iâ€™ll shoot instead for the top
And if you want to give me a shot
I swear Iâ€™ll never stop

I want "F**" tattooed in red on my forehead
A revolution in my bed
To do as Valerie said (cut up men)
I wanna be straight instead

If we make it through the night
Girl, I wonâ€™t marry you
But we can celebrate our love for each other
And our other lovers, too

I want us murdered, martyred, mutilated
Matthew Shepharded to the calm
To sprout wings as we fall
Donâ€™t want my friends dead at all

If you wanna fuck shit up
Iâ€™ll fuck with you
And if you want to fix it up
We can do that too

Whatâ€™s a poor boy-girl to do? (ooh) x4

To be gay in the USA is not feeling light and gay
Who knows how long weâ€™ll live anyway
