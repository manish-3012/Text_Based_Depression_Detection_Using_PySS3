MY WORLD HISTORY TEACHER JUST TOLD US WIKIPEDIA IS A VALID SOURCE!!! He was explaining our next assignment, which is gonna be a research paper, and he says that when we start researching â€œWikipedia is a great source.  The in text links open doors for key research and opens you up to new topics that will really help you push yours to the edges.â€

â€œWikipedia should be how you start, not finishâ€ This is not like the simulations, every other teacher I have tells us to avoid it...

Now I donâ€™t have to make up random citations on my works cited page because I wasnâ€™t allowed to use Wikipedia!
