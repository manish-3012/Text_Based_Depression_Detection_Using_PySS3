Can I just say how annoying this is? Do we seriously have to have ads UNDER EVERY POST NOW? Oh my science, it's so annoying. I mean I guess I understand if reddit was struggling to make ends meet before, but I never heard anything about this until it just started happening today. Come on Reddit, the mods were supposed to be bad, not you! ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜­
