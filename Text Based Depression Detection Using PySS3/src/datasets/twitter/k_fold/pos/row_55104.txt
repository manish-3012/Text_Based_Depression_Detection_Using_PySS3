Letâ€™s just say Iâ€™m really glad Iâ€™m getting stoned out of my mind tonight The other week I got rejected by the girl I have been in love with for 3 1/2 years, and Iâ€™m still hurting considerably from that. Today I pulled the trigger and blocked her on all the social media shit, and unadded her on snap, and it didnâ€™t feel good but it felt right. 

My mother is also being a huge bitch right now, I donâ€™t know what the fuck is going on but sheâ€™s trying to blame me and my brother for every tiny little small thing and itâ€™s making me beyond pissed.

So yeah Iâ€™ve had a great few weeks, how about yâ€™all?
