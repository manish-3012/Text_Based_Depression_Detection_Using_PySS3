So Iâ€™m really upset at my friend right now (I hardly post here, just didnâ€™t know where to put it. I donâ€™t necessarily need advice, I just need to spell this out. Thanks to anyone that reads to the end) So Iâ€™m (16 M) kind of pissed at my friend (16 F) right now. Light backstory, I met her online, weâ€™ve known each other 9 months, weâ€™re best friends. I broke up with my ex, Iâ€™ll call her A, about two and a half weeks ago. I always confided in my friend when things were difficult in the 5 months me and her were together, and she always helped me. My friend has a boyfriend, who Iâ€™ll call E. The other day, my friend admitted that she used to have feelings for me, and will always â€œhave some bond closer than friendshipâ€ with me, but she wonâ€™t break up with her boyfriend for me, which I get.

So last night I was texting A, we still talk every few days, and she casually mentioned that she had a friend over to her house. That I know, thatâ€™s the first time sheâ€™s had a friend over to her house since we broke up. I still am not 100% over her, 99, but not 100, so that made me a little jealous. That used to be our thing. We met multiple times during quarantine. Two of those times were the best days Iâ€™ve had in who knows how long. Anyways, I wouldnâ€™t tell her that, so I went right to my friend. I type out this long paragraph (we both do it, we write long messages back and forth to each other. Itâ€™s our thing) to her about how I heard from A that she had a friend over, and that made me jealous. I thought I was over her, but I was not. Her parents are really strict with the Wi-Fi and I didnâ€™t hear a response from her all night. That wasnâ€™t unheard of. Anyways around 1 PM today she sends me this long winded, even for her, message about how she was disappointed to be talking about this with me again, and that we were back on the subject, and that she saw the message last night but didnâ€™t want to respond. Weâ€™d been talking a lot about us the last week or so and learned a lot of new things about each other. We used to talk relationships a lot so I think she thought us not talking about them anymore turned over a new leaf in our friendship. But that just pissed me off. I hadnâ€™t talked about her in over two weeks. During then, she talked about E at least twice at length. I used to talk about A a lot when I had a crush on her. Iâ€™m sure it wasnâ€™t fun for her. But if I happen to bring her up one more time, like I said, itâ€™d been weeks since I even mentioned her name, she can try to talk to me and help me. It just pisses me off a lot. Itâ€™s not much to ask that you support me if I might miss my ex once in a couple weeks. And sheâ€™s the one whoâ€™s said on multiple occasions that you can never talk about relationships, or someone you love, too much and that itâ€™s normal. I understand this is an ex, but itâ€™s the same shit. She did offer me some half assed advice, but it pissed me off so bad. Sheâ€™s started being really short with me the last few hours and Iâ€™ve been trying to take her side, because I know, I used to talk about her a lot, but it wonâ€™t kill you to help me just one more time. I know it sounds selfish that Iâ€™m expecting sympathy from her at all, because she doesnâ€™t owe it, but I feel like sheâ€™s shutting me out for the wrong reasons. I let it go. I tried to steer the conversation to something she liked more, and I donâ€™t want to sound demanding, because I liked talking about that too. But I can dare to bring up my ex if something happens. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m asking for too much here.
