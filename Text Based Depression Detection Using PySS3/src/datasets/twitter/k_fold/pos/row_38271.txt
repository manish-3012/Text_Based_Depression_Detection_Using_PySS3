how do I (15F) make money without getting a job I do art (not really good art but art nonetheless), but idk any services that allow you to make money as a 15 year old, Paypal only allows people 18 or older to get an account, similarly I'm too young to become a sex worker, and my parents are dicks to me and make me do the same chore multiple times before I can get anything and only then reward me when I am at my all time low and miserable, then get mad at me for not instantly feeling better
