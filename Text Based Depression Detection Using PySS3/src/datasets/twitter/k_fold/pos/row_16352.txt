I swear I'm a nice person I just like to argue a lot like I'll take any chance to have a debate. I love that shit. 

Like I want to hop onto a sub that's homophobic and be like yo I'm gay and watch the chaios go down. 

Maybe it's like I'm nice but I'm chaotic. Maybe I'm not nice. I mean I'm not racist homophobic transphobic or sexist. I argue against the people that push hatefully opinions 

Also something that's bugging me. Reddit isn't that kind to girls in some places. Oh God that makes me sound like one of those crazy femists. It's just like I don't want someone to stare at my boobs. That makes me feel unsafe. I don't know what they are going to do. They might attack me when they get a chance. 
It's kinda hard to get boys to understand being female and why we use the car keys and carry pepper spray.
Like my body is not here so you could be happy with it. My body is not here so you could stare at it. I don't want to pleasure you. If I can control myself when I see a girl in a skirt and not stare so can you. 

Yea that's what has been on my mind


Also! If you want hugs just ask and if you don't have the time to here is one right here for ya
