I really f*****g hate COVID. Today was the day I was supposed to go to my friend's birthday party. It was planned 3 months ago and we all looked forward to it. But yesterday, a day before the party , guess what??? I was running a high fever! Still there today though not as much! I couldn't attend the party because of this shit ! I'm feeling really really disappointed, sad, angry and irritated. Sorry to vent on you guys so much but I had to tell someone.
