Little history of washing vehicles So, I helped my stepfather in washing trucks. First time was like 2 or 3 years ago. Of course, I made some mistakes, but that is nothing new. Truck transport company bankrupt, but stepfather started new buisness by chemicaly washing vehicles. It was short though, since we almost didn't make any money from it and stepfather's health was getting worse (he had cancer on his balls, so not only he has one ball, but walks like old person). Sitting in truck sometimes all day was way better option for him. He is in less pain than during cleaning job.
