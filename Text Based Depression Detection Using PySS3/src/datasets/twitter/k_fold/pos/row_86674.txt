So Iâ€™m going on a date for the first time tonight. I could use some help. I basically asked my friend out if she wanted to go out for valentineâ€™s day and she said yes. Iâ€™ve been planning on exploring the downtown portion of my city with her and doing stuff throughout the entire day. This would be my first date and iâ€™m kinda nervous but also excited. I already made blondies to give her since I asked if she wanted some. Any advice to make it go well? Anything would be appreciated.
