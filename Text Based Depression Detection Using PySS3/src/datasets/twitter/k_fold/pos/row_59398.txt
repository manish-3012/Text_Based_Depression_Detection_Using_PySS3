I might be a literal rocket scientist No /s

I managed to get my fourth rocket to the second moon of my planet in an orbital space simulation game and return safely

Iâ€™m really happy, return trip from minmus went well. Next is the mun, I probably should swap my lifter swivel for a skipper engine though
