Iâ€™m not going to get into the colleges that I want to and Iâ€™m losing it Iâ€™m only 15 and a sophomore in high school, but I feel constant anxiety and dread when I think of college applications which is often. Iâ€™m a good student, I get about one B per semester, and I do a couple of extracurriculars. But, I am much too ordinary to get into the places that I want to go to. I feel embarrassed. I know that the people around me will do better. I donâ€™t want them to see me underachieve compared to them. Does anyone feel the same?
