Story of how I got out of going to school for a month So basically I go to a school as a student. Iâ€™m in the 10th grade and currently weâ€™re doing 4 classes and 2 semesters. At the end of the 2nd semester of my classes Iâ€™m supposed to get another 4 classes but something happened lol. Letâ€™s go back in time to about November 16, 2020 12:00AM. That day I fought the wither under my cousinâ€™s house in Minecraft and we almost got our entire base destroyed. After staying up until about 6:00AM that day I realized I had school in like 2 hours and 30 minutes. After school I had about 8 assignments (2 per class) but I decided to blow them off and take a power nap...this didnâ€™t end too well. I slept for over 5 hours that day and woke up at around 7:00PM and decided that I was going to procrastinate my schoolwork and instead I started watching anime. After that day I continued to miss work but I sort of made up all of my work in everyone class expect for one; wOrLd HiStOrY. I soon realized that I did not give one fuck due to the fact that I was already being overloaded with a lot of work as it was. Fast forward to November 25th, 2020 8:32AM. I woke up late for class and my mom literally would kill me if I ever decided to over sleep so I kind of panicked and I quickly opened up my school device and logged on to get into my class when I see that the app my county used for schooling was down. I was confused and then all of a sudden my mom burst into my room warning me that my schoolâ€™s website was hacked and not to touch my school computer because it might have a virus on it. I needed a scapegoat to get out of doing all those missing assignments so I celebrate for about 5 minutes but then I realized I literally had just opened my school computer so now my computer is probably done for. My school will probably be unable to fix this for a month they believe so I guess Iâ€™ll just have a lot of free time until then.  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
