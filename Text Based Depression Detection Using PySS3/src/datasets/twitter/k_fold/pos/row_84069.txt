Dad jokes daily until I get a girlfriend #351 I try to tell everyone about the benefits of eating dried grapes. 

Itâ€™s all about raisin awareness.

**OK everyone, I know I just posted #350, but I've been running the numbers and even though I've posted literally every single day, they just don't add up. Every answer I get is a different number, but unless years can be 363 days, then I have to add 2 more jokes.**
