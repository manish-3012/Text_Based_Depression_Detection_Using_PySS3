Your boy just got c o m p l i m e n t e d I never thought highly of myself in my life so when I heard a good friend who happens to be a girl compliment my hair my eyes and my smile in a row that sheet made my year, I had the goofiest ass smile on my face after hearing that. Happy boy hours in this bih for once.
