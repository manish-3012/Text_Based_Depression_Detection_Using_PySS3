MY COMMENT WAS PINNED ON GAME THEORY! On The Game Theorists's Newest video I commented a theory I had on Minecraft and it got pinned! I've been a long time fan of the show and to see this happen made my day! I just wanted to share this because it made me happy and it was one of the best things to happen to me ever.

P.S my theory was that Ghasts are made of the souls found in Minecraft dungeons because they were refereed to as "Ghosts" by the developers.
