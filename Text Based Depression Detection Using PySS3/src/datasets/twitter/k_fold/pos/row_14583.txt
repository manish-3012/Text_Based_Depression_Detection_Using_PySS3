What's something you all wish you could hear/could have heard at 14 from a close cousin? Hey! My cousin is gonna turn 14 soon and I wanna send him a letter/Bday card (I already feel old at 22, great lmao) as he lives far away and sending a small gift doesn't really do enough justice to the guy, we get along great and he's almost like a brother to me. What's something you all would be happy to read or wish you could have heard back when you were that age without finding it cringy or cheesy? We usually talk about how we're doing, mental health, and issues he might run into at home/in life, so I'm probably gonna make that a good part of it while also telling him he's a great person I like to spend time with, but idk if that's too much or what's something that'd matter more to say than I might think, I don't have that many memories about being that age!

(Please make it at least kinda serious, I like memes but those ain't really what I'm going for in that letter :p )
