It happened I had my first kiss recently (I'm 19M). We went for a walk around the Loch, then headed back to her room. We talked about random uni stuff for a while then she suddenly started kissing me

I was stunned, but I did my best to adapt to her. At one point she sat on my lap, another time I was on top of her, tongue was used a bit.

I'm genuinely still stunned
