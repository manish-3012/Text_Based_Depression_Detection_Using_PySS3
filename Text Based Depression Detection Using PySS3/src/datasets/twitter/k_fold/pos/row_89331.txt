Anyone else prefer to play on an older version of Minecraft? I know I'm gonna sound like a boomer but I genuinely prefer the older versions. Like I don't need a jungle boat or a quartz slab or weird animals. Mob grinders were much easier to create back in beta. I prefer to play in beta sometimes even if there's no shift licking or sprinting. But mostly I'll play on 1.6.4 because that's the version of the game that was out when I began playing. Horses and Fireworks are still strange to me
