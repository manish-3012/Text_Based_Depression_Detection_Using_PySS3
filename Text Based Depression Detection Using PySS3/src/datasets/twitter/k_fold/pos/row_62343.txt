â€œNo witch huntsâ€ Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ve all seen the recent posts about mods and pedophilia, and I just wanted to share my thoughts as well. The policy the mods enforced, resulting in the ban of u/Thesavagepotato06, is that witch hunts (many people going after someone or some people) are not allowed. I call this into question: why? Why shouldnâ€™t pedophiles be exposed and ostracized on a sub primarily used by minors? These pedos will be banned by the moderation team, Iâ€™m sure, but Iâ€™m also sure the pedos will just come back with alt accounts and renewed attempts to prey on young people. I believe the mod team is being naive if they donâ€™t realize that banning those who speak up about these depraved people results in the indirect protection of those people. Additionally, from an ethical standpoint, victims of sexual harassment should never, EVER be removed from the conversation they begin to expose those who were harassing them. I think the mods have seriously messed up in this situation and have allowed their rigid adherence to the rules erode their ethics and morals.
