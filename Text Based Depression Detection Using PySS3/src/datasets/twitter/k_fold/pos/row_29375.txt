I can't stop crying and it's making me have bad eye bags How can I move on? My friend of 3 years left me for 3 other girls in middle school. They all cyber bullied me and I hate how everyone pretty much immediately told me to get over it. I can't stop thinking about my ex-friend, her new best friend, and how much everything sucks now. I'm crying every day. I need help.
