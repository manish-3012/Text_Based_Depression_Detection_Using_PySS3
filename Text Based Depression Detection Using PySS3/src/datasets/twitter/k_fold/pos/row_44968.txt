I cried My friend was just being nice and said, "I just wanna hear you voice, I'm bored of my other friends". He meant this as, I've been talking to them alot, I haven't talked to you alot. 

I cried bro, I felt so happy that somebody actually likes talking to me. None of my friends are that nice to me ever. Like, Jesus, that was euphoric. 

Worst part is that I used to have a crush on him, and when he said that I almost caught feelings again. I need to keep filling the void with fictional character so I can't get my heart broken.

TLDR: Friend was nice, I cry, I reevaluate my friends
