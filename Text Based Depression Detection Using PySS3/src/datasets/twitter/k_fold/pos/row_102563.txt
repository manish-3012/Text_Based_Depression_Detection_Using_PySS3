Ngl dick swinging contests arenâ€™t even fun for the â€œwinnerâ€ Sure Ima rant abt this for a second. I prob am just too upset but I wanna get my feelings out. Also Iâ€™m not talking abt real dick swinging contests, but more like arguments on the internet which end up as pride wars.

Why do people have so much pride for pointless things? Why do some situations always just turn into xBox 360 game chat for no reason? Why do people think theyâ€™re sick for like no reason? 

Iâ€™ve been on both sides of these things and they arenâ€™t fun for either person. They just get you overly heated about whatever it is and you gotta wait till you calm down again which is hard cuz you always think youâ€™re calm but youâ€™re actually still angry and itâ€™s just awkward. 

Fuck dudes. Why am I like this?

Like on one hand I just wanna fuck around and meme but on the other hand ppl get super hostile sometimes. Idk
