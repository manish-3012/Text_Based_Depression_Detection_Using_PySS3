My history class is geographically challenged Nothing important just thought I'd share. I'm sitting in my bed rn trying to sleep and I remember a time in history class where my teacher asks what the continents are and some kid yells out Argentina. Made me laugh so fucken hard lol. And more recently a classmate said something about the United Kingdom being a city. Idk why I laughed so hard on these occasions, but my history class really needs to brush up ok geography XD
