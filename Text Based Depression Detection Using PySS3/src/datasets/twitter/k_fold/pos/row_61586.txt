I need ideas On the 17th of September I'll be turning 18 years old. I live in Australia, I'm the oldest of all my friends and siblings, most my family (except my father and step-mother) and close friends live in another state, and I really want to go out and explore the adult night life. What could I go out and do for my birthday by myself?
