I just got asked to homecoming! I love how I just made a post a day about not being able to ask someone to homecoming, and then POOF I have a date. Never in a million years would I have thought I would get asked to a dance. I kinda feel like I don't deserve it. But I'm so happy I get to go with this guy, he has made past mistakes but he has owned up to what he has done and has become a better person.
