It's funny how the people that always told you "promise to never leave me" were the ones that ended up leaving you. I use to be close with this one person, that always told me shit like that. I use to put in all my time and effort for them, just so that they could be happy. Most of the times, the only reason they ever wanted to meet up with me was because I was their last choice. They fucking used me. They use to say how they never wanted me to leave them or become distant but now they're completely ignoring me. Looks like they just used me, and dipped after they became bored of me as if I was a fucking toy.
