I passively accused someone of theft. What do i do? I'm cringing my ass right now. I passively accused someone of theft. 

So me and mother had to pickup a  vehicle that belonged to our relative which someone else was taking care of. We went there, talked, the someone is a very nice person. Now, as we are about to leave, my stupid ass asks if there are any spare keys to this scooter. He says no and asks why. And then my stupid brain : 

"What if someone used these spare keys to steal this scooter." 

This scenario had popped in my mind for some reason(see, this is what loneliness does to you lol).

Now, he looked visibily _shocked_ . My mother tried to soften things out by saying he would know as this scooter belonged to our relatives. 

As we are ridding home, every bone in my body is cringing. I dont think I'll be able to sleep tonight and 10 years later when this memory randomly pops up. 

How to I make up with him? 

PS : I know I'm not making a mountain out of a mole hill because I believe it was not something nice to say and would normally not have been said by someone.
