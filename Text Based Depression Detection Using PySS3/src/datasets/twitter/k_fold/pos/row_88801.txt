i dont know how but.. i was into rnb before it was 'cool'

but was kinda forced to in the beginning then i started vibing (my bus driver always played 95.7 the beat like full blast every ride home)

i think it was in like 2017, those days where redbone and boo'd up, i remember them also playing Khalid's location
