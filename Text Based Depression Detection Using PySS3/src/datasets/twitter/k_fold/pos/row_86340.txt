The worst spring break vacation I've ever had Time to complain on reddit. ya

I usually don't like to talk about my personal life on reddit, but I'm so sick of everything rn &amp; my family either doesn't listen or they say "tHaT's NoThInG".

I'mma give you a list of all the shit that I've been through. For context: I went to Florida (yes crazy land) for Spring break.

1) I went to this awful Chinese restaurant &amp; got soup that was half full of a goddamn cabbage. 

2) I got sick the next day (not covid) &amp; spent the majority of my trip laying in bed practically dying.

3) My aunt died back in my home state.

4) My face decided to have a acne break out.

5) The first day I'm finally feeling good enough to leave my house; I dropped my phone in the parking lot. My phone cracked on both the bottom left corner &amp; the top right corner. So my phone is broken to the point where I can barely even get to the home screen.

6) We have to leave early to go to my aunt's funeral (which is fine, it just kinda sucks we have to leave early &amp; I barely did anything)

7) We didn't even go to the beach ._.

I'm still on this trip, but we leave tomorrow night.
I'm just hoping, with my luck, the plane doesn't catch on fire.
Sorry for complaining about everything awful that has happened in my life for the past week.


Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
