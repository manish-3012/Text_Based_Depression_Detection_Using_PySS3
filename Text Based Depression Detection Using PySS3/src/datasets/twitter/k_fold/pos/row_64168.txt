I need relationship advice - from other teens Me and my bf have been dating for a couple months now, and its been getting choppy. We reached our peak a few hours ago, reinforced that we love eachother ect.. However, he admits he is toxic and not good in relationships, but im willing to stick it out. He declared he was aromantic, and says we should be friends with benefits/love eachother. He also wants a break from sex because of his traumatic past. I was all fine, until he said he could flirt or even date (in my case) other people. This broke me. After all we have been through (which is a lot), he has no loyalty, although he assures me he loves me very much. And I love him. 

I don't know what to do

:/

(hes pan btw)
