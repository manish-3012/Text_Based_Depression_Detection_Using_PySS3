Does anyone else experience this Do you ever just have a problem then wonder if youâ€™re making it up then get anxiety over lying to yourself then realizing that this cycle is pointless and spiraling is just evidence that youâ€™re not faking it then realizing that coming to this realization is like a twisted form of self justification then recognizing it could be impostor syndrome then getting anxiety over the fact that you could be lying to yourself about having impostor syndrome and then once again realizing that this anxiety wouldnâ€™t exist if you were lying then tell yourself that this is just a sociopathic attempt to calm your moral subconscious to go through with the lie then convince yourself youâ€™ve gone through 26 levels of self delusion like a psychopath whilst the original problem lays festering in the back of your mind as you continue to justify your validity in facing the problem as you wage a war with yourself over whether youâ€™re being deluded or not or is that just me
