do you know how great it would be? to get a text without texting them first? to have someone tell me good morning? to have someone send a smile my way every once in a fucking while? to have someone try to hold a conversation with me instead of just leaving? to have someone at least *pretend* they enjoy talking to me?

sorry I've had a rough day
