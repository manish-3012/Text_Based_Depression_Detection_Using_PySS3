Quitting porn Iâ€™m probably gonna regret posting this on my main. But fuck it! 

Iâ€™ve been using porn off and on for around 2 years and daily for around a year. 

Iâ€™ve noticed not only is my attention span gotten considerably worse when I am try to remember something or read a book or whatever.... 

But I just donâ€™t feel any drive anymore, 2 years ago: when I would get a school assignment or something. It would just be like clockwork. Go home, work on it get it done, move on. 

But now it feels like I have to actively FORCE myself to do anything that takes more than 10 minutes of quiet concentration.

And theirs my mood, Iâ€™m just not as happy or satisfied with life as I was or should be considering how lucky I am and how I am doing amazing things and things I love. 

I know itâ€™s probably immature to blame it 100% on porn but... would quitting help? I think I need a little push, but Iâ€™m ready to do it.

Thanks
