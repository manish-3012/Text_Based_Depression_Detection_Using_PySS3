I think Iâ€™m bisexual but idk right now AAAAAAAAAAAAAA I am a guy and I have always liked girls but recently (like the last year or so) Iâ€™ve been thinking that a lot of guys are cute. But I canâ€™t imagine myself in a relationship with another guy. I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m just comfortable enough with myself to admit that some guys are cute or if Iâ€™m actually bi so yeah. Thanks for reading this as a tried to form a coherent thought. Have a good night yâ€™all âœŒï¸
