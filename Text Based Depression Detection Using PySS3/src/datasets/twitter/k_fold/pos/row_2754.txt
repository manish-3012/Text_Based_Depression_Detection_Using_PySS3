How to talk to my crush the I haven't spoken to in over 2 years? So I have had a crush for the past 3 years on a guy (let's call him M).  I have been thinking about him so much that I want to contact him really badly.. like grab my phone to say hi.  

But how do I contact M without sounding awkward?  Any advice?
