Please help I'm having a cognitive dissonance I described my situation more thoroughly on r/amitheasshole but I'll describe more or less precisely what happened; I wanted to buy a laptop for quite a lot of money because my PC broke down. I'm sure it would serve me well for at least the next 3 years. I'd buy it with my own money that I either earned or saved. Mom said she would give me a bit of money too so I thought I was good to go. I found a really good offer (3 years old, almost top spec laptop with 1 year of warranty for $800). I thought about this a lot and I thought that I'd start working as a web dev again (I have about a year of experience now, not much but I managed to earn my first money) and this purchase would pay itself off in about 3 months of work or even less.    

I didn't tell my dad anything because when I mentioned buying a laptop in the past he didn't even want to listen and said that laptops are shit (he has 15+ years of experience in IT but his knowledge is very outdated). He's also kinda broke and he's very nervous and impulsive overall. That's why every time I have been planning on spending money I was either not informing him at all or mom would tell him when we were right about to buy something.    

Yesterday mom told him about my plan and he lost his shit completely. He was trying to force me to think that I don't need it, that he would give me a laptop from the attic (probably a 10-12 years old Dell Latitude that barely could open a browser). Later he was talking to me about being responsible, that I'm 18 and for example if I hit someone on a crosswalk I'm going to prison (where the fuck did you get that example, dad?). Of course he couldn't find a better moment to say something like this because I'm having my driving licence test in 2 days...    

He didn't care that it would pay off, he didn't care that I wished to spend MY OWN MONEY (remember, I'm 18) that in some part I have earned myself.    

But that's not all. There's what made me get cognitive dissonance. During that talk he said that when I earn this money myself then I can do whatever I want to do with it. Then I told him that I either saved this money or EARNED IT. Now listen to this. He got mad again and went on how he worked when he was young, that he would carry 50kg bags of material the whole day and things like this. When I pointed out his nonsense he just said "Then go and fucking throw $800 away!!!". When he was leaving he said loudly that he can't stand me and my mom.    

And now I don't know what to do, I'm worried that if I go for it he will just break it in half in anger. On the other hand a laptop is a thing I'll need anyway because I'm going to study IT and I don't want to buy a $200 piece of crap that couldn't even run Firefox. Also such a good offer is probably never going to pop up again...
