And y'all say teenagers are drama. What about parents huh ? So yesterday my mom asked me what I wanted to become in future and I was about to say writer but I didn't because I knew my mom wanted me to become a doctor so

 I said "I would become what you want me to be" 

but my mom said "don't you want to become what you want to be. It's not that I'm forcing you to be" 

I nervously said "I want to be writer" because she was my mother so I shared it with her 

 and guess what ?? I ... I ...

 She said "there's no life in writer you can't earn from writing. I was expecting something bigger and earing dream not this crap. No guess what you ARE being a doctor" 

Guys help me
