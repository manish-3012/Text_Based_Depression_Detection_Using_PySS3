I'll never get over the fact that the US hired a Columbian terrorist once Columbia: Us, we know you have him, hand over the terrorist

Us: what terrorist we don't know what you are talking about?

Guy from Maryland: (murders someone and flees to Israel) 

Us: Israel, bruh hand over our murderer 

Israel: no, if you guys can have that terrorist we can keep your murderer 

Columbia: you guys just said you didn't have our terrorist

Us: oh shoot you mean THAT terrorist? Here you can have him 

Terrorist: wtf you said we had a deal you said if I fought in your proxy war you guys woul-

US: a deal? A proxy war? Wow this guy is crazy you guys should execute him immediately
