Passed my GED practice tests! I don't post on this sub much, but I just needed a place to get all my happy words out!!!!

So basically for my 9th and 10th school years, I was very depressed to the point where I did little to no schoolwork. I only got a few credits for those years. I've been playing catch up for my 11th and 12th (current) years, hoping to graduate with only taking one extra year. 

Then my advisor told me I could take the GED tests and get 8 credits for passing them. I was sure I would only pass one in my best subject

BUT I PASSED ALL FOUR!!!!!

This doesn't mean I get the credits now, but I passed the practice ones!!! Which means I can most likely pass the real ones!!! 

I'll be on track to graduate this year!!! Just a regular four year high school experience!!!!

I am SO HAPPY I feel so light and hopeful!
