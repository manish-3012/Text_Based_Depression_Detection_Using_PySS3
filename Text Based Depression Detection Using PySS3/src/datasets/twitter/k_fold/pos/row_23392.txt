Our school suddenly wants to follow the normal schedule like every goddamn year! We're doing online classes. They give us tons of homework. Got us to complete our projects and submit them in person because the world would stop if we didn't submit the freaking projects. Unit tests were in July(20 marks) and exams in August(80 marks). Now they're taking ten mark tests which are till 5th. Second set starts the very next day and there can be more than one test on the same day. Then the exams start from 27th. Like WTH. No time to self study. No time to do anything else. They want us to focus like every year when we're locked up and basically teaching ourselves. They expect us to do everything and have a social life. Sucks. I know I procrastinate a lot but still. It's a pandemic , no one cares if ninth graders miss an exam or don't do projects. And they say, being a student is the easiest.
