Guys I need help My friend canâ€™t feel any emotion right now, which is worrying since they are normally one of the most emotive people I know! Iâ€™ve tried to help them feel something, whether that be sadness, happiness confusion or anything but it didnâ€™t work and I really canâ€™t think of anything else. This person means a lot to me what do I do guys?
