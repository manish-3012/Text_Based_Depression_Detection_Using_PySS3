If you're feeling down, lonely or depressed, please read this.. As a teenager who has gone through lots of stuff.. drunk parents, friends who left me during the hardest times, embarrassed to walk in school due to rumors and even being slapped in front of the school due to some stupid rumors. I've understood that no one actually gives a fuck if you are depressed or if you are going through hard times, sometimes not even our parents. All that you have is yourself. You might get beat up, you might fall in your life, but what matters is if you decide to stay down,or get yourself up and fight back. 

Ik it's easier said than done, everyones gonna say "dude it's nothing, stop acting like a baby" or "there's people who are going through worse stuff" and this is what I hear the most "it'll be alright just ignore the problems". But in the end it's we who know what we are going through. So ye, I'll stop here. These are few quotes I've read that made me stronger and think better in life. I love you and your life matters, stay strong. 

-A bird sitting on a tree is never afraid of the branch breaking, because her trust is not on the branch but on it's own wings. Always believe in yourself.

-Don't wait for the right person to come into your life, be the right person to walk into someone's life. (this one seriously made me think)

-It is better to be yourself and have no friends than to be like your friends and have no self.

-Never beg anyone to stay in your life, if you ask them and they still ignore, just leave. That's called Self respect.

And at last, have a good relationship with God, always pray and be grateful. Peace.
