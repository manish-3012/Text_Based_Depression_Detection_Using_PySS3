How do you cope with loneliness? 
Iâ€™m 13 male for all wondering. So I was talking to my online friend, and they were talking about a thing that happened at a party they went too. I got really lonely from hearing it. I feel like every other kid my age is going out to parties with a bunch of super interesting friends, and other here I barely have any friends. Now Iâ€™m feeling really lonely, and I was wondering how you guys cope and how you would suggest that I be more social. Thanks for help in advance
