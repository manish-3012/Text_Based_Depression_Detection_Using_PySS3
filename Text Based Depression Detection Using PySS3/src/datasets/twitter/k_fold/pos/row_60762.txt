Am I permanently banned from Twitter or is it Temporary? I have Received an email from Twitter saying â€Hello (username),
 
Your account, (username) has been suspended for violating the Twitter Rules.
 
Specifically, for:
 
Violating our rules against evading permanent suspension.
 
Note that if you attempt to evade a permanent suspension by creating new accounts, we will suspend your new accounts. If you wish to appeal this suspension, please contact our support team.â€ 

I want to know if this is permanent or temporary

Also I case your wondering, I got banned because my dad was permanently suspended and made a new account using my phone number
