I've had enough Why do we have to fight over the smallest things? Politics being one of them. Like why? At the end of the day we all are human, we all bleed red, we all breathe the same oxygen, we all live on the same earth. Why do we have to constantly hate each other? I get it some people are stupid and pretty hard to reason with, but that doesn't mean that people who share a opinion or belief with them are the exact same as them. We divide each other more then we bring each-other together. I don't care what color your skin is, what you believe in, who you like, what your gender is, what your political ideology is, just as long as you treat me like a fellow human. Now i understand its hard to be kind to certain people, and i get that but it'd be a lot easier if we just walked away from it instead of making it worse.   
You are able to hate anything and everything you want, but you cant tell other people to hate something you hate if they don't, that's really uncool. Trans rights,Black rights,LGBT rights, women's rights all don't exist, because last time i checked they are humans and have human rights just like everyone else, unless things have changed and they no longer are humans. I know i'm going to get hate but i don't care, ive had too many nights where i've cried myself to sleep, or thought about killing myself because we are so fucking divided, and i'm on the wrong side apparently and it's my fault certain things happen. Go ahead and hate on me, but i'm just stating my opinion and how we should all come together instead of dividing each other.
