Guys, what's the weirdest dream you've ever had? I'll start.

Once a upon a time, there was a withered, leafless autumn tree. It had two arm like projections with three sharp, long branches.

A man was passing by, who was apprehended by the tree. The tree asked, 'Do you have a geometry box?'. The man, who had heard of the legend of the autumn tree, dishonestly replied 'No.'. The tree said, 'Very well then, You shall pass.' And the tree let the man go.

Now, another man was passing by, and like the previous man, was stopped. The tree asked the same question to him, but the man, a foolish and honest fellow, replied 'Yes, I have a geometry box.'

The tree proceeds to stab the man with its long branches Wolverine-style and kills him on the spot.

Your turn.
