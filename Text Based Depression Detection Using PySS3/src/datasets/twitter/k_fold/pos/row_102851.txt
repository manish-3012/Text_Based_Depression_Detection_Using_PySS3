Electric cars &gt; Gas cars I'm buying my first car next month and I've decided to go with a poor man's tesla. Electric cars are superior bc:

they're quiet, very little to no maintenance, no greenhouse emissions, $30 monthly electricity for battery &gt; $200-$300 monthly gasoline, less likely to be stolen, not a target for rising catalytic converter theft, sustainable, and saves more money in long run since gas prices will be rising substantially in the future
