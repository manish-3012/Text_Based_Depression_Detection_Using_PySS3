Do your guysâ€™ english teachers make you relate the definition of a literary element to the theme of a story? I think itâ€™s ridiculous Iâ€™m in my sophomore year, taking Pre-AP English and throughout the year we have been doing microanalysises and essays on different poems and short storyâ€™s and stuff.  Basically my teacher has us relate the definition of a literary element the author uses to the theme. For example, one of the stories we read had a theme that was something along the lines of how you had to separate ur past trauma from ur present in order to be happy, and it kind of had complex sentence structure sometimes. My teacher had us say â€œjust as the clauses in these complex sentences must be separated by commas, you must separate the traumatic memories of the past from the present.â€ 

Thereâ€™s no way that that is how itâ€™s taught everywhere, right? Like it seems so absurd that the definition of each literary element, like symbolism, metaphor, refrain, similes, or some â€œstylistic deviceâ€ like punctuation or something has to match up with the theme. Thereâ€™s no way any author ever has ever thought about the definition of symbol when writing a story and including a symbol in it. 

Has anyone else been taught this? I canâ€™t find it anywhere online and it seems just absurd to me.
