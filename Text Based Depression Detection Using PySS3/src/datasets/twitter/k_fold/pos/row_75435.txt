Lebanon explosion I just don't know where to go with myself so just come here. I am in the country where the explosion happened which is lebanon. I was lucky enough to not be around but all I can do now is bury myself in tears that I even don't know why I am crying. I can't stop myself. Am I sad on my country? Or it's the huge number of people affected? Or my inability to help? I am just crying not knowing what to do or what will happen next. Some advice would be appreciated. 
Please pray for lebanon.
