Am I a bad person? So I was at a well visit today and we get to the part of the well visit where the doctor has to check for hernias... So the doctor says she has to get the nurse in here for liability reasons, me not liking having more then one person staring at my penis blurted out â€œwell Iâ€™m a Boy Scout and part of the Catholic Church so itâ€™s fine Iâ€™m used to it at this point,â€ she did not enjoy this comment... the check up proceeded and as the test was goin, I turned and coughed but my smart ass thought it would be funny if I said â€œyeah the subway guy told me to do the same thingâ€ letâ€™s just say I donâ€™t think my doctor likes me anymore. In conclusion donâ€™t talk about Pedophiles while the doctor is looking at your sack, also am I a bad person?
