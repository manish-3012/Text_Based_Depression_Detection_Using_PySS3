Any advice on how to live without genitals? Hi, I'm an eighteen year old AFAB agender. I plan on removing my genitals, and it seems due to a recent talk with my family it might be happening soon.

I'm a bit worried about what my life will be like without a vagina. I'm nervous on how people (especially girls I like) will treat me when I don't have genitals. I'm also a bit worried about how I'm going to masturbate and have sex once those parts are gone. 

I'm definitely going to have it done, but I'd definitely like advice on how to live like this.
