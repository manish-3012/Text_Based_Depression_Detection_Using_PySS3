How do I motivate myself None of my parents support or motivate me in certain things(except for my brother). They either donâ€™t support me at all or they just stick every person that is better than me to my face. Especially when I do bad in school. They just go like why didnâ€™t you do better. Me going like why should I even do anything when nobody will even be proud or atleast happy about me in anything. 

If your going to ask like why donâ€™t you try being good in the topics. They will eventually be proud. Oh boy was I wrong. Fun fact I got 3rd place in my 6th grade year. The first thing they said was 
â€œWhy werenâ€™t you first?â€

I got a new phone that year. But I donâ€™t count it as being proud. Itâ€™s literally bribing if you ask me. What do you think I should do to motivate myself?
