I don't know what to do with my boyfriend These past days my boyfriend and I haven't been talking a lot. We're on a long distance relationship so... speaking is all we can do. 
We haven't been talking a lot because he's been preparing exams and it's really stressful for him. For some reason that also stresses me out (I hate myself for this but my fight or flight gets activated when he's sad). Now he only wants to talk to me when he feels sad and leaves my messages on read. Like, yesterday I told him something really bad that was happening to me and he ignored me and didn't talk to me until that night when he needed a favor (he wanted me to send to his friend ice cream because she broke up with her boyfriend??). I don't know. He's 19 and I'm 17 and he's just talking to me when he feels sad. I'm tired, honestly. We've known each other for three years and we've loved each other since, but I'm tired of him right now. I know it's a bad thing to say, that I can't stand him because he's sad. But even yesterday I tried to comfort him and he was talking to me as if I was the one to blame? Some days ago he also got mad at me and treated me kinda bad and he wouldn't tell me why. I may sound like a jerk but I don't know what to do. Should I wait until he's done with his exams or talk to him now? What would I even talk about? Just some minutes ago he sent me voice messages talking about how bad he felt and when I tried to say something nice he left me on read. The worst part is that he's always online or liking my tweets or seeing my instagram stories, so he isn't studying but also he isn't talking to me. I feel so bad but I know it's not.. his fault I guess? What do you think?
