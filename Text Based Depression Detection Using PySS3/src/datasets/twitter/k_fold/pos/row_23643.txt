Had a pretty bad holiday, please cheer me up I am really down rn, so please make me think about something else than commiting suicide. 


For some context:
I was on holiday with a friend and my parents to visit the rest of our family. Me and my friend used to stay together at my grandma's house, while my parents stayed at an apartment in an other city. I thought it was a great idea to bring a friend so I wouldn'd be alone, but I was so wrong. Even though we spent 24/7 together for 2 weeks, I never felt that lonely before. We didn't talk much and she just was chatting with her other friends all time while completely ignoring me. Always when I tried to start a conversation, she a) just didn't listen, or b) wants me to shut up. So every evening she was texting her friends until it was very late in the night, while I was trying to sleep and thinking about ending my shitty life. I had to deal with depression for several years now and finally was getting back to life but this holiday just took me months back. 

I don't really have someone to talk to, so I'm telling this to some random people on reddit, hoping someone will understand my situation or just distract me from all those negative thoughts.

Anyway thanks for reading this, have a nice day or night. 
(I hope I didn't made any spelling or grammar mistakes, English isn't my native language)
