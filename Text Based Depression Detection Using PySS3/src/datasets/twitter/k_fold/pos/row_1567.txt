I feel lost. I donâ€™t know anymore. It hurts so bad. I try making friends but never get invited to anything. People donâ€™t like me. Every girl I talk to just plays with my feelings. I have all fake friends. So I give up. People fucking suck. I am getting out of this. No one actually cares about me. I need better friends.
