What the fuck do I do By some miracle, I happened to run into a girl from Finland online and weâ€™ve hit it off so far. Donâ€™t ask me how, but yeah (Should probably add that Iâ€™m 16, sheâ€™s 15)

Weâ€™ve mostly been talking on Snapchat and FaceTiming a bit, but with her being 8 hours ahead of my time itâ€™s a bit tedious to do. Also, with school starting tomorrow for both of us, weâ€™re even more screwed.

Adding on to that, Iâ€™m a complete fucking dumbass that doesnâ€™t know how to talk to girls. Itâ€™s unfortunately made FaceTiming a little awkward at times, since I donâ€™t know what to say. 

So I ask you, r/teenagers, what do? How can I keep a smooth conversation with someone Iâ€™ve never met in real life? Yeah this probably wonâ€™t go anywhere, but I have to try. Sheâ€™s... amazing, guys. Please help, and thank you for reading my rambling
