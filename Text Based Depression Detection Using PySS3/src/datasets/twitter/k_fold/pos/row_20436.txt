I feel like a creep. Ok so I met this random girl on among us, she was funny, I added her on snap. We talked for a bit but she said I was boring and didnâ€™t respond to my message saying sorry. Anyway she sent me pictures of herself for some reason.  My friend sent me a meme so I tried to screenshot it but I accidentally clicked her and took screenshots of the conversation and pictures she sent of herself, I didnâ€™t know what to do, so I panicked and blocked her. Will she be able to see that I took a screenshot, or will the blocking cancel it out? Also Iâ€™m new to snap.
