Letâ€™s go over the good and bad things that happened the last 7 days Good: It snowed, I now own 2 small plastic skeletons, spotify let me try out premium for free, and I caught ajj live from quarantine lady night, in which Sean played my favorite ajj song.

Bad: I fully broke 2 bones in my wrist, I will need surgery, schedules changed so I can hardly talk to my cute Australian friend on the weekend, And Iâ€™m stuck in a cast for at least 6 weeks, removing myself ability to bike or do anything that requires 2 hands.
