Why do I still like the girl that broke my heart? It happend almost 8 months ago, in February, it didn't really last, only 6 weeks, but I caught feelings hard, I wasn't perfect, I was an attention whore, as I was insecure about her feelings, and that basically made her to break up with me, that happens even pre corona quarantine, with all this time, I didn't have other crushes, kept her in the back of my head, I still think I should just DM her to see what's up, idk...
