Flirting and dating advice for y'all #Let's start with the basic (this apply for everyone) :

First of all never ask someone out if you don't know them. Try to spend time with them and find common interests.

Once you know them well, you have to make them understand that you are interested: 
- Text them first
- Initiate conversation irl
- Compliment them
- Make eye contact and smile at them
- Make them laugh
- Flirt

Easier said than done, I know but I strongly regret that I haven't done that with my old crushes. Take your time and it will come together.


If they feel uncomfortable they are maybe shy or not interested give them time to think.


Once you did the previous step you now have 4 choices:

1) Ask them to hang out (only you and them)
2) Improvise a date (grab your friends and wait for them to leave and then you will be alone with your crush)
3) Kiss them while you hang out (but before drop a signs like a big hug or your hand around their neck, head on shoulder or something like that)
4) Never ask them out and cry everyday for the next month


I highly recommend you to not try the fourth option

If you choose the date (or hang out) and you are really shy, find an activity that you both like (so you can concentrate on the activity instead of thinking what you have to say). Also don't try to be someone else, you are perfect as you are.


Now it's an avengers level threats, it's late, you "finished the date" and you have multiple choices:

1) Kiss them or tongue kiss them: Doesn't matter if you are good or bad at kissing, as long as you both enjoy it, it's fine.
2) Invite them to your place: If you want to make out privately or have the thing
3) If you are still really shy and don't want to kiss them or anything, have a physical contact (hold hands or something). Then agree to have a second date

#General advice: 

Don't act different with your crush and with others.

Don't be afraid of doing a move to your crush in public you will probably regret it in 2 weeks.

If you are really shy, try to have a mutual friend with your crush for easier communication.


That's pretty much it, have a nice day !
