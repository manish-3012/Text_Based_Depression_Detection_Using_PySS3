Online education vs university For learning new things self-education is superior to university education, you can freely select from a wide range of resources including university lectures. 

University education does however give you an official degree which is valuable (if you finish), it also allow you to network with people who selected a similar degree. 

Personally i did enjoy being able to be there physically over having to watch via my computer screen but that also came with disadvantages such as not being able to pause or rewatch.

If you have an opportunity to get a free university education you might want to take that, you can still learn stuff on your own as a supplement to your university education.
