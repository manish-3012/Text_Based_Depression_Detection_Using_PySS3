Posting everyday until I get a girlfriend. Day: 87 Wow there are some people in this subreddit who are supportive (I appreciate yâ€™all) and some and not naming any names that apparently just get joy out of annoying others with their twisted ideas haha. Never actually thought people could be like that until Iâ€™ve actually experienced one yesterday. It was a fun ride haha
