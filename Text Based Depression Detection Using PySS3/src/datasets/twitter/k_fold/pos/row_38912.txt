I honestly can't wait till trump is out of office. Ten bucks says he tries to say the system is rigged, and that it's a big conspiracy and the system is rigged against him. I can't wait till politics aren't some taboo that only starts conflicts There should be a law that requires you to have some sort of qualifications to become president besides age cause honestly we can't have another one of him.
