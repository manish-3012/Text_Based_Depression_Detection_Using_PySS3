Last few hours as teenager Tomorrow is my birthday and i'm turning 20 and i have never posted in this subreddit but today i felt like i had to.

I don't really have anything to share but i'm gonna say that i always loved this subreddit and the people in it. Love you all! 

What should i do in these last moments as teenager? :')
