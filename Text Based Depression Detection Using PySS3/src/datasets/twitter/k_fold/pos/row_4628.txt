Let your loved ones know before itâ€™s too late So my grandma passed away a couple weeks ago, she was in a really bad shape and she just suddenly passed, i was very saddened by this then i accepted that she is now in a better place.

It just was so unexpected and my mom was heartbroken, it made me realize that one day my mom might pass away unexpectedly just like my grandma.

So now i make sure to wish her a good night and give her a hug at night.
I never got that chance with my grandma
