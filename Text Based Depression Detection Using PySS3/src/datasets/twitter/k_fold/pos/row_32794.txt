â€œI hope you feel betterâ€ they said. â€œDonâ€™t worry, youâ€™ll be okayâ€ they said. I appreciate the kindness, but itâ€™s not better. Iâ€™m not okay. Maybe people will think Iâ€™m an asshole for saying this, but saying something like that and then ignoring someone for days on end doesnâ€™t magically fix any problems. It creates more.
