friend copies me in everything and its annoying my friend just copies me in everything. not like physically mimics, but copies phrases I say, jokes (and goes and tells other people them; sometimes could tell ME my OWN joke), says "inside" jokes OVER and over and over which just kills them, steals my music/taste in stuff and pretends she's obsessed with a movie (or other things) that I like, texts me 24/7, copies my hobbies and never gives me space. I am just sick of her. she's pretty nice and isn't a mean person but I find it draining. like why cant she just STOP. I don't want to cut her off because she is a good person and has never been rude but she just always alters herself while speaking to different people just so she can seem relatable. idk its really annoying- she HAS to text me EVERY single day even if its the most useless unfunny things. like she expects me to reply with a "HAHAHAHHAHAH IM DYING" message every time. and also when I say things that aren't even meant to be funny she texts "SKSKAHASSHHS NO WAY U KILLED ME HAHAHA" uh it wasn't even that funny anyway. she also copies words I say so I just STOP saying them because they just die that way. overall im just annoyed that she changes and isnt herself- I dont want a knock off version of me 

 so yeah idk who to tell so thats why im making this post lol
