Help with tattoo sketch So Iâ€™m trying to convince my parents to let me get a tattoo to cover self harm scars and I think a sketch of what I want would help. My idea is to have the hands from the creation of Adam with flower vines trailing between them and wrapping around the fingers. Could anybody help me out with the sketch?
