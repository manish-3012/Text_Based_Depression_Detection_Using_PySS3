I saw someone I knew at my local park the other day I was shooting around at the basketball court on Saturday and I saw someone I knew. That someone was one who I had an interest in (and likely had an interest in me, but I was too nervous to shoot her a message so I missed out). We ain't talk to each other (which I don't mind because I'm shy and she might be), but still another odd run-in with someone familiar. Usually run into a few people every year even though I'm almost never out my neighborhoof.
