the old/original toho kaiju movies are so good, very underrated as we all know there is the new godzilla vs. kong circlejerk going on, so i thought id watch some of the originals. the first one was something else, it was so bad but so good also, had lots of shitty destruction, black and white, subbed, it was a dude in a costume as godzilla, really funny looking, pretty epic right, yeah. so i ended up watching like 9 of them in a weekend, i liked the first one, but my favorite plot-wise is "Ebirah: Horror of the Deep". idek what i like about them, i jut like the movies so far, im watching them in order and i recommend you do too. (dont watch invasion of astro-monster, it was cheesy and lame). so pls watch them, they are on hbo max i think.
