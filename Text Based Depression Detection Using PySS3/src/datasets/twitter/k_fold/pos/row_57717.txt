I need help My boyfriend left me a few days ago and this is the hardest experience Iâ€™ve ever had to go through. He was everything to me. I constantly showered him with love, affection, gifts, sex, and anything he wanted. But a few days ago he pulverized my heart to a bloody pulp. He told me that he physically and mentally couldnâ€™t love me in the way I loved him. He said it was unfair to me to be in such a one sided relationship. But I love him so much I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s one sided, he was my everything. I was ready to carry that entire relationship all the way until the grave, thatâ€™s how much I was in love with that boy. I have been constantly crying, unable to eat, vomiting, and having pounding headaches. The only way I can sleep now is by shoving melatonin gummies down my throat. I need help to get my mind off of him. Everyone keeps telling me, â€œitâ€™s gonna be fine,â€ ,â€œitâ€™s gonna be ok,â€  but I canâ€™t just perk up instantly and be fine. I need genuine help, I need a hand to hold. I need someone to help me fully take my mind off of things whether it be through games or memes or phone calls. Please help me
