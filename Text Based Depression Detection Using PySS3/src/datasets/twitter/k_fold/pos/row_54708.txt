Need advice I go to tuition and my crush goes to the same tution and I just made a friend in tuition (it did not happen in front of my crush) and we all study in the same room at the same time, my crush thinks of as a brother of the guy I made friend, to simply it My crush is A and my friend B, A Thinks of B as a brother and I am newly friends with B, is it a good idea to tell B that A is my crush, or will he just make fun of me and tell my crush and then she things would be awkward ? Also I only have like 20 days left after that it's almost impossible that I'll even see my crush
