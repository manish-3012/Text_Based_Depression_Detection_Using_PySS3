I made a mega playlist I decided to make a spotify playlist during early 2020. I thought it would have like 20 songs in it, but it stacked up to well over 100. (I forgot how to check how much songs are in it and I'm too lazy to try). I am now listening to it on shuffle and it not only feels nostalgic but also incredibly depressing. I was probably at the worst mental state I have ever been in during that time, so a lot of the songs are pretty sad. It's creating a very strange mix of feelings, kinda like halfway between crying and laughing. Anyways I just felt like sharing that because I'm bored lol.

Can't wait to listen to this in a few years or something so the nostalgia really hits.
