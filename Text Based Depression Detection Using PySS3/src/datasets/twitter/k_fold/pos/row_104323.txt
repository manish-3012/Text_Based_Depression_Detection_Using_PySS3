What advice should I take? My brother is a firm believer that until you are halfway through highschool, having a gf is useless. He says they waste time and money that could have been spent with the boys. I agree, but Iâ€™m not sure. On this sub, people *younger* than me are asking people out and asking for advice. It really seems to me everyone on this sub doesnâ€™t believe what my brother does. So, why? I feel that one has to be right, but Iâ€™m not sure which. Is it actually worth it to be in a relationship before sophomore year?
