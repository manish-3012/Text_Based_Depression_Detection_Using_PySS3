did you ever feel empty? because I do. I don't have a lot of friends and the only friends I have are primary school friends who I barely see. my last 2 years I got bullied really badly and that made my feel like nothing is inside me. I changed classes now but it didn't get better because it is hard for me to find friends. in my primary school I also got bullied 2 times but then I still had my friends who supported me all the way. I never found someone who really understands me. I asked my parents about my problems and they talked about it but they didn't see it as a big problem. I tried everything to just have friends on school but nothing worked. and that makes my grades go worse as well because i cant concentrate when I try to get friends. 

just something to know: THIS IS NOT KARMAWHORING. this is just sharing my problems to reddit.

if you think you know me personally, you can see my first name in the username and please comment.

other comments are welcome as well. I hope this doesn't get lost in new because then nobody sees this post.
