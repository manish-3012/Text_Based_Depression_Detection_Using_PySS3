When a girl kicks a boy in the balls hard for sexist reasons/some sick satisfaction she gets out of doing this to a boy, is that any better than when a boy puts a girl in that kind of agony and gropes her?   

When a girl kicks a boy in the balls hard for sexist reasons or some sick satisfaction she gets out of doing this specific thing, specifically to a boy, and specifically as a girl, is that any better than when a boy puts a girl in that kind of agony and gropes her?

Seriously, how is that NOT sexual violence and humiliation? It's intended as EXACTLY THAT, and born from a distinct contempt, or lack of regard specifically for males, an exploitation of their genitals and male weak spot, and intended to violate, hurt, humiliate and dominate them based on their sex.  


Also, when a girl does this, why should the guy not punch her in the face hard once he can stand again?
