I see my friend hang out with her boyfriend at school, I hear my friends go on about their love lifeâ€™s and who like them, and then thereâ€™s just me, alone Trust me Iâ€™m not depressed or anything Iâ€™m actually very happy but like that itâ€™s just occurred to me. Iâ€™ve never had a boyfriend, never been on a date and never have had my first kiss, and like my friends have. I honestly doubt anyone likes me either. 

Anyway imma go vibe to my music bye bye
