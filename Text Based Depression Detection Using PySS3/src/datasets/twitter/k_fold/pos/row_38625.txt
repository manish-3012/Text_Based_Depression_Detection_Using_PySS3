Poem repost (messed up the first time) Like the revolutionaries throughout history
I stand defiant
unending tyranny and damned destructive disastrous dictatorship
The narcissism, god complex and insanity of a mad king
Iâ€™m your prized possession, unwilling to let me go and change
But I am the worst traitor
the time for tumultuous tyranny is ticking away
the truth trying to tell itself apart from lies
Will reveal its revelations,causing rampage, a rupture, a split in sides
The protectors, justifying actions, unwilling to take action
 the mad king, will be cut down by those revolutionaries
As they stand defiant
(Lemme know if I should post my second one)
