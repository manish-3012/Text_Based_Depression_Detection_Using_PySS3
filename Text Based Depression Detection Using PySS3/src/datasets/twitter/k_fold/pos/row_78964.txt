I had a dream that told me something important about myself Essentially, the dream consisted of me driving recklessly down a dirt road in a 90s sedan, crashing it, the insurance man coming out to cover it, and then coming home to my disappointed parents. After showing me a receipt of my previous real-life car expenses (including the two fender benders I got into when I was 17) and how much they cost, they wrote an apology letter and had me sign it. Within this was spliced in a segment of a probably fake racing game from the Cars movie, emulating the same reckless driving.

Unlike most dreams where I wake up suddenly in the middle of it and forget what happened, this one I woke up from on my own when it was done and I remember what happened in vivid detail.

It kinda got me thinking that maybe I haven't really grown up.

Looking back, there are a whole lot of symbolic events that happen that point to this theme, but here are a few of importance:

1. When driving, I really did want to stop and slow down, but I kept going anyway and crashed. This might be symbolic of my autism spectrum disorder that holds me back from full maturity.

2. Me having to sign an apology letter written by my parents instead of me shows my unwitting reliance on them to cover my mistakes, instead of having me suffer the consequences myself. That goes for the insurance man as well.

3. I see the gameplay segment spliced in after the crash as portraying how I have a habit of using entertainment as escapism as opposed to facing my problems, and being partially of the problem itself since the game essentially replays what I just did.

I dunno, I might be overthinking this, but it got me thinking.
