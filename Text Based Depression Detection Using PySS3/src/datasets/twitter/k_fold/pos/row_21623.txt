I fucking hate this You gotta love the way parents handle things, and by handle things i mean not handle things at all. Like yeah lets just ignore the mental breakdown im having and how i feel like shit to point out that i got a tiny little bit of something on the floor and then complain when i go to my room to not cry in front of my family and then have the audacity to post on facebook about how teenagers are lazy and too emotional. (Sorry if this is confusing just wanted to vent)
