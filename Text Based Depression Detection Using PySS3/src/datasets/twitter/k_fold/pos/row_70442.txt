My dad is very ill Im scared that I'll loose him, he has covid and they took him to hospital, hes been there for 5 days and nothings changed, there trying everything, he doesnt think hes coming home, i cant even visit him, i dont know what to do anymore, it feels like theres no point waking up if all im gonna do all day is worry about him, my mum is upset all day and doesnt have the energy to do anything, im lost.
