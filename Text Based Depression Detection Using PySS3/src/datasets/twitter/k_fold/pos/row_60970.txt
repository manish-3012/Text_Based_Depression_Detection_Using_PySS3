Thereâ€™s literally nothing to look forward to. St Patrickâ€™s day is boring and spring break will be boring too. The only thing to look forward to is the weather getting warmer but I doubt that will happen any time soon. I used to have so many things to look forward to but now I donâ€™t. Every day is the same repetitive bs.
