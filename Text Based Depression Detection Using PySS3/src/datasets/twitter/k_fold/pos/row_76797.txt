Iâ€™m bored. Letâ€™s play a guess my zodiac game. You tell us your base personality, and we try to guess youâ€™re zodiac sign. I am a weird, sensitive kid but doesnâ€™t express those feelings in front of other people. Iâ€™m a huge dog person, as well as mildly creative and loyal with my friends, the few humans I like the world. I can be petty (writing answers to a large math paper incredibly small just to get back at my teacher having a small conversation with another student while I had my hand up to ask for the fricken paper), and I like cartoons(all hail Avatar, Steven Universe, and the Owl House). I like PokÃ©mon (it is my life. Umbreon is the best, I will die on the hill), I like to draw, and Iâ€™m relatively smart. Introverted, and I hate the sound of my own voice on recordings. Tend to judge myself in a way some would describe â€œharsh.â€ Thatâ€™s all I can think of at the moment, guess away! Iâ€™ll play with you guys in the comments.
