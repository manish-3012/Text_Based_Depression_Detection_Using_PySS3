iâ€™m so confused. me and my bf havenâ€™t talked normally for the past two weeks because heâ€™s been spending more time with his family, and i know i canâ€™t get mad at him for taht i wanna send him this, but idkk i feel like i sound too mean. i might be unreasonable sometimes, but if i feel some sorta way thereâ€™s a reason for it. i feel like i do more for him than he would for me in some things sometimes. idkk. â€œiâ€™ve been making all the effort to talk to you i donâ€™t wanna do that anymore. if iâ€™m not getting any effort back, iâ€™ll just sit back n relax. not in a bad way. just enjoy ur vibes, iâ€™ll enjoy mine. i wanna be happy when i talk to you and not get all the dry responses unless i do or say something weird at the only times we can actually talk, n itâ€™s not the same. itâ€™s not that either of us has to try, but thatâ€™s what it feels like.â€
