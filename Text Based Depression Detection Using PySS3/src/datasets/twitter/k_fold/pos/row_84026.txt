So let me tell you a story that happened on a public survival minecraft server So it was around 5 years ago and i went to my best friends house, and as always we fired up minecraft and went into a server, me and my friend used to live near each other but my home was a storage to keep our stuff, not really a home

and also we were the richest people in the server with the biggest house in thee whole server,

so the server is a non-pvp survival server, but i found a way to kill people , there was a glitch that allowed you to hurt players that teleport to you by request in the nether roof,

so i did the nether roof glitch and i got over the roof and i spammed the chat saying that i found something super amazing on the nether roof, so someone requests a teleport, and i accept.

since he had a bad internet connection it took a long time for him to load in, so we killed him

he had A LOT OF expensive stuff, a whole lot of goodies

and even un obtainable items in the game that you had to purchase with real money

so i took the stuff and teleported myself to home so he couldnt kill me when he used /back

so he started begging in the chat telling me to give his stuff back and ...

and we had a good reputation in the server and we didnt want to ruin it, so i said it was my cousins fault because he was playing at that moment (i was lying)

so i tell him to tp back to me so i can give his stuff back

(he was gearing up because he thought we were still on the nether roof)

but also i knew another glitch for killing players in the non pvp server too

if you are in a claimed by player section but you are trusted in that claimed section you can set fire to other players but they cant hurt or set fire to you,

so we all know what happens next,

i accept the teleport request and he tps into my friends house and since he has a bad internet connection we set fire to him,

and he was geared up with god level full diamond pack and a whole lot on music discs for some reason

music discs were really really expensive and hard to find and god level enchantments are bought using real money

so after killing him we quickly spam the chat saying that it was my other cousin that did that

and we quickly left the server, but he did alert the admins but the admins told him that its his fault and he shouldnt have done that

so here is the stuff i got by memory

\*249 Diamonds

\*320 Emeralds

\* A whole lot of very expensive discs

\*lottery cards (more on that later)

\*premium vote cards

\*576 cacti

\*Around 200 Diamond blocks

\*Three sets of god armor, half used and one brand new

\*64 Gold blocks

\*God level chest keys

\*leather armor

\*A whole lot of iron ore

\*God level enchantment books ( i think there were 7 of them )

\*128 Cooked beef

\*Instant health potion

\*\*A lottery card is a paid and one use item used in that server were you could win the lottery and get a lot of good stuff or outright lose your money

\*\*Vote cards and Vote keys do the same but you will 100% get something and they are more expensive and the highest level prize is worse compared to the lottery card

i have a lot more stories like this, if you are interested i will post more of these stories
