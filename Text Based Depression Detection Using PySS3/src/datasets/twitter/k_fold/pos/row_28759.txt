Is it okay if I eat little to nothing for just one day? I want to cosplay but Iâ€™m a fatty and I look skinnier in the mornings when I donâ€™t eat.

Is it okay if I donâ€™t eat that day? Iâ€™ll have to eat a little to take my medicine and Iâ€™ll eat dinner when Iâ€™m done cosplaying but for the rest of the day I donâ€™t want to eat.

No this wonâ€™t lead to an eating disorder I know what happens if I donâ€™t eat everyday.
