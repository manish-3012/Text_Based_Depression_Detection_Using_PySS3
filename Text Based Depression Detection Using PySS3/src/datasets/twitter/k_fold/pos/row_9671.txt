I'm finally getting fit again After almost a full year of rehab for my ACL surgery, I finally can now get back into physical contact sports. So 3 weeks ago, since I got my first job, I decided to sign up for a jiu jitsu gym like 10 min away from my house. I cant play football anymore cause I'm in college and the signing up period for my college is over, so I'm doing the next best thing. After months of barely being able to do 3 pushups, gaining weight, I mean a lot, and just overall losing confidence, I'm finally getting back to where I used to be and I'm hyped. Like even in jiu jitsu, I get exhausted, but I dont feel like I'm using my muscles, except my legs, i can feel them burn everytime  but I can tell i definitely am when I put on my shirts, they fit so well now around my arms and chest. I'm so fucken hyped, my push up count is going up, I mean, I went from 3 to 15 in 3 weeks, and I'm 240lbs, which I am planning on dropping back to 210, and i have lost 5lbs already. Idk, I'm just so fucken hyped, the old me is coming back and I'm also joined a professional weightlifting gym next week that my friend recommended. I'm gonna be better than ever
