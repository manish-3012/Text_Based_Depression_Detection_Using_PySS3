Tik Tok: I did this for you I di this so you don't have to. I went ahead and downloaded tik tok to see what it was like. And for the most part it is cringe. But there's only one thing I noticed, (for me) it's only the women and people who use animals that are cringe. I've seen a lot of dudes in the video that are really funny. But the main reason it seems like it's only the females that are unfunny is because Tik Tok doesn't really give you the choice to find actually funny people. I'm sure there are really funny girls on the platform but due to the limit of exploration, I barely see any funny girls. Also, there isn't really a fairness to it. I came across a video of this guy who was mad. I don't know if you guys know but there's this girl on tik tok who got famous for just nodding her head. And the point this guy makes is that he works and takes a lot of time out of his hands for his followers by doing very complicated art, while she just nodds her head and is instantly famous. He really has a point there. Also, I came across something suspicious as well. After the first day of me just downloading tik tok, I got a system update on my phone. Now I haven't had one of those in about 2 years so it was weird. Which leads me to believe that yes, tik tok is spying on us because why would I get a system update right after I downloaded tik tok. But there are actually really talented tik tokers on the platform. It's just hard to find them because Tik tok doesn't give you the choice of actually looking for people the you like. They just throw a bunch of videos in your face and wait to see which one you like, and they just throw more if those kinds of videos in your face. Now there's not really anything wrong with that, but it'd be nice to have the option. Kind of like YouTube. But overall, don't download Tik Tok. It's really no worth it.
