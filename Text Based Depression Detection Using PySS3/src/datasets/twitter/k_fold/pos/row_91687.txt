I thought teachers were the smart ones So in class my teacher gave us this online forum about how we were feeling. It said â€œFeel free to vent about your dayâ€ so being the dumbass I am I responded with  â€œI am doing good, but if Iâ€™m able to vent please donâ€™t tell the other crew matesâ€ and then my teacher responded to the forum saying â€œBy Crewmate do you mean your other teachers? I wonâ€™t tell them what you sayâ€ and now Iâ€™m wondering how they donâ€™t know about Among Us
