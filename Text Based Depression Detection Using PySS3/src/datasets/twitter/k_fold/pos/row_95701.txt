My 8th Grade Graduation... Hello there. ill be sharing a bit of a story about my 8th grade graduation. although im in 10th grade now, i just thought id share a good memory of mine! so, lets begin...

8th grade was one of my decent years. although i had some bad memories during that time as well, i mostly had good ones, such as when i won a Poster Contest for a bully poster. i think the best day had to be graduation...

i was waiting for this day, due to the fact that i rode in a cab, due to school being far, and had another passenger with me who was 9 years old and went to the school. i was finally happy to leave the school for good, although i do miss it here and there.

June 13th, 2019, the day of graduation, we were given our phones to hold onto, take pictures, and such, which my old school NEVER lets us have our phones. a lot of the graduates were taking pictures and such. i didnt want to be included in them, cause i felt like a minority to the school.

eventually, me and 2 other people we're told to go up on stage. i was chosen to give a speech on graduation, which i had wrote prior to graduation. to be honest, i wasn't even that nervous. sometime during the speech, however, i brought up how my grades when i started was 3rd and 5th grade levels, and that they doubled to 6th and 9th grade levels, since i was there. Everyone started clapping and cheering. i have no clue why, but i believe it was cause i've made improvement.

later on, i went to go sit back in my seat, and next thing you know, i was called up to receive a math award. this day was probs the best out of the whole school year.

eventually, the graduation had ended, me and my parents had left, and a few months after graduation, had started a new chapter in life...
