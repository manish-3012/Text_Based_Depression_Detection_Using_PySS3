A Teenagers Podcast?  

I have an idea for a podcast that I would like to create.

The  premise behind the podcast is that I take a group of about 2 to 3  teenagers and we create a couple episodes with a group on various  topics.

We would have an  introductory episode where we all learn more about each other. Then  perhaps an episode regarding aliens, or religion, or politics,  conspiracy theories or any topic the group would like to discuss.

Depending  how eager the group is, we may have 1 or 2 episodes together or 10. The  only requirement is that we are all similar in age, and that we are  open to listen and have thoughtful conversations.

Hopefully  we could all get to know each other and have some fun, meaningful,  interactions. If you are interested please fill out this google form. If  you have any questions please ask below.
