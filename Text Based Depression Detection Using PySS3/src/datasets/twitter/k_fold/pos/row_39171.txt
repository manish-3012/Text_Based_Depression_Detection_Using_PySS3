I didn't want to live to be 18 years old. When it came, I changed.. I didn't want to be 19 years old. Today is my 20th birthday, and I couldn't be more thankful that I clung to life for that extra last bit. Everyday of my life I told myself I wouldn't make it to a certain age because I intended to die before I made it. It hung over my head, and haunted my life for so long. It influenced my decisions, made me lose friends and a massive chunk of my life. As I look back, I regret every decision I made.. but that doesn't mean I'm mad at myself; I'm learning from those mistakes and as I now leave my teenage years I realise how insignificant the troubles I had were.

I turned to awful methods of coping, and will have life-long repercussions because of them, but I will continue to live a happy life because I began making the right ones. I can't sit here and tell you that your teenage years will be easy, or fun.. but I can tell you that they will be what you make of them. Others will not remember you for the mistakes you made, so make them remember you from all the good memories you can make. 

You're all beautiful and amazing, and I wish the best for all of you. You can do it.
