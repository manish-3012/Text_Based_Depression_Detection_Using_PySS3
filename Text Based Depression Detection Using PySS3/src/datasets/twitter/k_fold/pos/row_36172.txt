I hate the STAAR test I had to take the STAAR test today. For those of you who donâ€™t know what this is, the STAAR test is a standardized test we have to take every year and we have to pass it to move up to the next grade level. We take one for every main subject, which is math, science, English and social studies. The one I took today was 65 questions and we also had to write an essay. But the worst part was waiting for everyone else in the school to finish so we could go home (we get 5 hours to take it). We canâ€™t use our phones, we canâ€™t talk, so all we can do is sleep or read a book. I hate this test. I hate it with a passion.
