Idk what's wrong with me I don't pay attention in class and I don't study at all. I need to get good grades this year but I really don't have any motivation. I really wanna go out but I can't because of my social anxiety .My sleep schedule is fucked .I'm scared that I'll fuck everything up. I don't know what I'm gonna do after school , my life's a mess. I don't wanna be a failure . My parents have done so much for me , the least I can do is study and get good grades but I can't even do that. I have so many assignments to complete and so much notes to complete, I don't know how I'm gonna do it. I'm extremely stressed but for some reason, I still don't study. It's too overwhelming for me. I'm sorry if none of this makes sense ik I'm not the best at expressing myself.
