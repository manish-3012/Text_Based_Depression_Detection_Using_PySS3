Would this be a good enough poem to hand in as english literature homework? I know its bad ok but whatever here it goes

Tick tock goes the clock
But i thought the hand was broken

Tick tock goes the clock
Theres something breathing behind

Tick tock goes the clock
Its breathing down my spine

Tick tock goes the clock
Its only one step behind

Tick

So if its not the clock thats ticking then who is it behind me?

Tock



I know ok, its bad, like really bad
