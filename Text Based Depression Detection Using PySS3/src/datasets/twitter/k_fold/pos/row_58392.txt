I did a speedrun of Super Mario 3D Land. I beat the game in 1:52:25, and I know that might not seem that impressive to elite gamers but I'm still happy about it. I know none of you have any reason to believe me but that's okay. I just wanted to share something I felt like doing and how well I did at it. You can all do whatever you put your mind to, remember that.
