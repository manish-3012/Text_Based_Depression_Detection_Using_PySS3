Asian Lives Matter Too  It's been almost a year that the pandemic has started and this is the worst it has been. It's so bad. It really is and nobody will talk about it. As an Asian, I've known racist remarks and subtly condescending jokes all my life, but it has never been this bad. Now, it feels that no matter who you are, where you are, or what you're doing, being racist to ASIANS is somehow okay? I can't tell you the number of times people always use China as a method of analogy or some kind of support for the CLEARLY RACIST ARGUMENTS. Stuff like, "Oh, but China didn't let Black people leave their country. Why should WE treat you like a human being." It's always China did this, so you have to face my revenge racism. But the thing is, I AM NOT IN CHINA, I am AMERICAN, just like how you ARE NOT AFRICAN, MEXICAN, BRITISH, FRENCH, we are all AMERICAN. But for me, and all my friends as well, no matter where IN ASIA they are from, they always get the China argument.

And this is from all sides. Whites, Hispanics, AND African Americans, all have a part in this. This is not a single race issue, this is an AMERICAN issue. I don't know why I thought that my fellow People of Color would at least have my back, my mom's back, my family's back. Instead, I don't know, it seems that no one has our back? It's been tough and hard and a struggle to see your entire race being condoned to racism by the entire country. I've seen it again and again, arguments so blatantly full of racial aggressivity masked on under the guise of political debate, and high moral ground. They try to be subtle and try to spread their racism to others. Then it slowly turns into real violence, real acts of hate, but no news covers it. It really breaks your heart and makes you just want to do something, but you can't. There is realistically nothing Asians who make up barely 5 percent of the US population can do. Our votes don't matter, our voice doesn't matter, we don't matter. All we can do is struggle from oppression from all sides, all people. I'm scared for my family, my friends, and of course myself. 

I don't know when this will end, but all I can do is to keep on living.
