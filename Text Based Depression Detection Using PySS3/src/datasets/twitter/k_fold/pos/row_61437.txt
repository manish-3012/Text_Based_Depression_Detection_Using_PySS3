How to deal with inferiority complex because of acne? So I am 17 (M) and I have a bad acne problem, despite consulting two doctors about it, I'm not getting any positive results. 

Because of this problem, I'm ashamed in front of my friends and in my school, I feel terrible and I can't make eye contact with anyone, my confidence is all lost.

All of my friends have flawless skin and hair and they sometimes make jokes about my pimples and how I look. People constantly picking up this topic has induced some kind of inferiority complex in me.

Now, I can't even show my full face or be in bright lights because people may see the acne. I'm taking medicines and idk if they're working or not, but acne has lost scars on my skin as well as my overall confidence.

I'm getting socially inactive and I fear walking out, I usually bail out on my friends on hanging out. Sometimes they come to my home to hang out and I tell my mom to tell them that I'm sleeping or something.

They also joke that the pimples are because of me jerking off too much which I consider false.
Also I don't jerk off often. As I'm quite good in studies, they joke that I stay up all night studying that has resulted in the pimples. Whenever some topics come about skin and hair and all, I try to divert it, skip the topic . 

I used to look quite good, but since these pimples came, my life have taken some other kind of turn.

What should I do? Please help me out
