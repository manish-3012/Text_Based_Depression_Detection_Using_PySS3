anyone else's parents get mad at them for being depressed? A little backstory, I'm a senior on my high school swim team and we haven't had any meets, practice, or anything so far this season. The consensuses was that if things were better by second semester we would be able to have a few meets and have our state meet in February. Since things haven't gotten better, we wont be having any meets and more sadly we wont have a state meet. I was talking to my mom about how this made me kinda depressed and made me feel unmotivated to do anything really, and she got mad at me and said everyone is in the same boat as us so I shouldn't be so selfish and upset. Idk, I just wish she would be more empathetic about it...
