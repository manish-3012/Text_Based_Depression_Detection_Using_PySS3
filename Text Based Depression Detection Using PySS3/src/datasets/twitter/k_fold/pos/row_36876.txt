My parents are giving me a hard time During February Break my parents made me study for at least half the day. Okay, that's not so bad, I can at least do fun stuff in the evening, right? So every day I go through tests and homework problems because my dad makes me want to stay ahead. So now every time he sees me playing video games or doing something I want to do in the evening he gets mad and says that I haven't studied enough and asks me to prove that I have WHEN HE HAS WATCHED ME EVERY DAY DOING WHAT HE ASKED ME TO DO. I fucking listened to what my parents wanted me to do and now they want to take away my free time and tv, video games, talking with friends, etc. So basically if my head isn't up a textbook's ASS 24/7, I'm wasting time for college. FUCK THIS, I want to love my parents BUT THEY SEEMINGLY BECOME STRICTER AND STRICKER AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE ANYMORE.
