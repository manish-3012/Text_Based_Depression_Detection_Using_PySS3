I need assistance. I wanted to get a friend of mine a christmas gift. 2020 has been a horrible year, as you all well know, and I wanted to give them a gift that makes the year a little brighter for them. They're dyslexic, and dislike reading, but theyre really smart and enjoy stories. I had the idea to make some small recordings of myself reading some really good, classic books for them, so they can enjoy these amazing stories without the frustration of dealing with dyslexia. Is this a good idea? The main problem i have with it is them accidentally seeing it as rude (ive accidentally made jokes about their spelling and reading, because i forgot about it) instead of what im trying to make it, which is wholesome. Any opinions, or am i overthinking this?

Tldr: friend has dyslexia, i want to make audiobooks for them, christmas present. Is it offensive or not?
