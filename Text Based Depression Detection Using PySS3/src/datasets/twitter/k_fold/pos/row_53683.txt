I know America has flaws But why hate the country, so much better and more free than many other ones, we may not be the best, but certainly not the worst.  I donâ€™t car how many downdoots and hate I get, I will always love my country and the people that fight for it. All of reddit seems to hate America and I am tired. Just some idiots hiding behind a screen complaining about the country and not trying to make it better.
