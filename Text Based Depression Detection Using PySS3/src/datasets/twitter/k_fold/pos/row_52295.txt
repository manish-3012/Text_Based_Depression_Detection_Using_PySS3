My friends grandfather, whom he loved dearly has passed away. He is feeling pretty sad and he has to arrange the wake and funeral which means he has to stay up till midnight on a school day. 

For purposes of anonymity lets call him Ian. So Ian has had a rough couple days staying up till midnight and not getting enough sleep. Lets show him some love in the comments.  

I want to be able to show him the replies and cheer him up.
