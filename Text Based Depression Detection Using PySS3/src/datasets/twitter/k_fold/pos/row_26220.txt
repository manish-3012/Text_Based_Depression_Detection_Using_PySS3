Yâ€™all need to learn people have different opinions I made a post on why I think abortion is wrong. I expected to have somewhat civil discussions on it, but I was so wrong. I guess itâ€™s mostly my fault thinking that people on Reddit are welcoming to other opinions. 9 death threats and 6 of those calling me slurs. Donâ€™t even know how to handle this shit.
