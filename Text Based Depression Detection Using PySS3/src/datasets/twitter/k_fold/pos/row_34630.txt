A moment to appreciate Can we just take a whole moment to appreciate the BOYS?

Not the "boys" who are like B-Tier friends but the real deal Gs who get you through the rough nights and all. The real boys who support you with all of your endeavours and share great moments with you.

Those, those are the BOYS. We all love em.
