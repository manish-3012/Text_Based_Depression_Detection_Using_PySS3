guys, so can you help me out pls? ok so, what happened was that recently, my best friend asked out a guy and the guy rejected her and she is very sad, today I got into a zoom call with her and some other friends. it started out normally but then somehow they got into the topic of her relationship and they started a random fight. now she is even more sad and she is probably crying now, I feel bad for her...

can you pls help me on how to cheer her up?
