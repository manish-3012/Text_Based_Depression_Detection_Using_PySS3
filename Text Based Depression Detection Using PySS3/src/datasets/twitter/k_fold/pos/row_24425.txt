ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ Random Antarctica Factoid #30 ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ There's a lake very creatively called Deep Lake in East Antarctica that is 10 times saltier than the ocean. It doesn't freeze over even though it's colder than the ocean because it has so much fucking salt in it. There's barely anything living in this lake because it's such an extreme environment. It's honestly pretty amazing really.
