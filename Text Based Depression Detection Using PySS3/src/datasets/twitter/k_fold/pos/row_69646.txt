hey reddit i need help deciding something so thereâ€™s a girl i like (like a lot) and weâ€™ve been friends for like 2-3 years now. we are both into the same things, like anime and call of duty and shit and we always call each other during class. iâ€™ve kinda had feelings for her for like the past 3 months but i feel like asking her would be weird so i need you guys to describe for me. i made a strawpoll [here](https://strawpoll.com/4v5k5jv4a) and whichever side has the most vote iâ€™ll act on. donâ€™t screw me over please
