At the start of the pandemic, I was kinda enjoying it. But now Iâ€™m just not All my GCSEâ€™s were cancelled (final exams) and I basically just got given passes in everything which was pretty good. so I got to just hang out and be relaxed during what I thought was going to be the most stressful experience of my life, revising for exams

Now Iâ€™m kinda bored of it and Iâ€™m prob lacking in my schooling massively now. Right now Iâ€™m doing online learning and itâ€™s not great.
