I got into writing lyrics a bit ago and have been taking alot of inspiration from other songs which I have now created one that has a original opening I hope you all enjoy In my mind,
There's a war inside,
It's a long one,
In my mind,

Iâ€™m starting to lose the war,
In my mind,
I try to keep pushing on,
But I can only hold on for so long,

I have been fighting for to long,
And feel like i'm losing myself,
And feel like i'm running out of ground,
Not to long till I run out,

I try to get on in a world where everybody is the same,
I'm just like you and youâ€™re just like me,
I feel so empty inside,
And we are losing our sight,

But now that I found you,
Iâ€™m now regaining ground,
And starting to see a reason to fight,
In my mind,

Youâ€™re the only one that understands,
Whatâ€™s going on,
Inside my head,
And feel the pain,
Of the war in my head,

But now with you by my side,
I can continue to fight,
Continue to try and win this war,
Continue to make it to end of the tunnel,

But now Iâ€™m afraid,
Afraid of losing those who I fight for,
Afraid to lose you,
But I promise,
With you by my side,
I will continue to fight,
From now,
To the end,
