Unpopular Opinion: I hate the â€œget to know youâ€ assignments teachers post on liek the first day of school Idk if itâ€™s just me but I really really donâ€™t like those get to know you assignments that teachers assign, they ask such weird questions like â€œHow would you like to be rewardedâ€ and â€œWhatâ€™re you most proud ofâ€ like bitch idk
