Outback steak house So Iâ€™m was in an argument with my ma and sister then my sister says I have Asperger and then like 20 seconds later my mom tryâ€™s to end the argument with oh we must just have different opinions and Iâ€™m just yell at both of them in outback steak houses saying â€œSHE SAID I HAVE ASPERGERS WHAT DO YOU MEAN DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONâ€
