sometimes my friend is chaotic good, sometimes just chaotic His neighbours and antimaskers and wont let others around the neighbourhood wear masks. My friend knows his mom would die if she got covid. His solution? While they were away he poured molten thermite on their car and threw the sprinker in trough their window. Another time he just overdosed on antohistamines because he tought it was fun. He also burned down an abandoned house
