story time! A few years ago I did gymnastics with this girl and we were close friends despite our families being pretty different (religious beliefs, political stance, ethnicity, morals, etc). One day she was being super homophobic so I called her out on it and we had a BIG fight and it got pretty nasty. BUT THEN she bailed doing a round-off whip-half front layout and hit her head REALLY bad. She got a concussion and ended up losing all her memories from the past week. After a while we drifted apart and she still doesnâ€™t know what happened.
