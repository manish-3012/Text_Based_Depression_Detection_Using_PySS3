ayo i think im gonna miss my dad for context: my dad's always been pretty abusive and ive always felt a deep hatred when his alcoholism turns him into a total dick, but when he's not drinking, he's ok. i cant even count the amount of times he's thrown me and my siblings out on the street tbh, but he's leaving for the city and going about five hours away for work. i dont even know when he's coming back, but a weird part of me feels like it'll miss him? it's totally fucking me up ngl, how could i miss someone who's basically ruined my entire childhood and refuses to admit it?? 

tldr: abusive dad leaving for a while, my feelings are fucked cus i feel like ill miss him
