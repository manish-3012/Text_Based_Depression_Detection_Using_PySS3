Text buddy binge I'm looking for someone to casually message with, but my idea is that the conversation never stops.

 We never say we have to go, if you can't answer you don't and you just answer when you can. 

Replying "OK" or such conversation murder is forbidden. If nothing else you ask a random question.

No worrying about seeming clingy with when you answer back or feeling it's been awkwardly long.

 If you don't want to continue you say so and move on with life. 

The point is to have someone to message always without worrying about timing. Getting notifications from someone to know someone is thinking of you even if you're busy and can't answer. 

If you're interested pm me
