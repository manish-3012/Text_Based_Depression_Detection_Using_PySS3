anyone else view odd names as relationship deal breakers? if we're gonna date, your name has to be an easily said name. if it's weird or "unique", I'm out tbh. how am I gonna be romantic with you when I can't even say your name seriously?
  
I can't think of any at the top of my head, but I'm hispanic and a lot of spanish names are just eh to me.
  
anyway, anyone else like this?
