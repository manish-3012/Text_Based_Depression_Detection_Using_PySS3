I have a final exam the day after tomorrow and my grandma died a few days ago and also I think I nearly overdosed on ritalin UwU wtf this is pretty cringe but Iâ€™ve never been a mentally unstable person up till now because Iâ€™ve never had anyone I know die and also Iâ€™ve never failed an exam

(all I want to do is play genshin impact and watch anime but no my stupid life wonâ€™t allow it )
