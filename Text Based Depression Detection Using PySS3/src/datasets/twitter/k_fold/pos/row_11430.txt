Do any of you miss school? I know some of you will be like â€œHow could you miss school???â€ and yeah, having to be at a random place for six hours is awful, but I kind of miss it.

I think I mainly miss seeing my friends. All of my friends have been made through school, so when we had to go online, I wasnâ€™t able to see any of them. And yeah thereâ€™s texting, but itâ€™s not the same as seeing them in person. Not to mention that school has changed so much and Iâ€™m still trying to get used to it. Idk, itâ€™s all been really stressful for me, and I just wished things would go back to normal.
