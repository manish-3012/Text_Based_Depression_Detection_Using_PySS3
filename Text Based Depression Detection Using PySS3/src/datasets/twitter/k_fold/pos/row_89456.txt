How to hang out I(17m) have been...not the most social person the last few years.
Last time I was meeting with friends I was still playing LEGOs with them.
Then I kinda went hermit mode, and was there for like 4 years, and another year of lockdown.
So 5 years without meeting someone for something that is not
a) helping one another with eg. Homework.
b) occasionally play PokÃ©mon GO with others.
I don't count online games, I am talking about physically meeting.
What would you do if you'd meet with 2-3 others of your age, none of you has a phone/uses it, and covid/lockdown wouldn't be an issue cuz it is already 2027.
