If I.... (for my future self) If I ever get a fan base, Iâ€™m going to interact with them as much as possible. I know that if someone I looked up to ever acknowledged my existence, my self esteem would be great.
   
,If I come out to my mom as trans.... Iâ€™m going to still be myself, and not try to fit into male stereotypes. Iâ€™m also going to explain queer identities to my mom.  

If I move schools, (I go to a Christian school in the south, Iâ€™d be bullied relentlessly for being trans AND queer.) Iâ€™ll keep in touch with my close friends, and Iâ€™ll make new ones at my new school.

If I ever feel hopeless, Iâ€™ll come back to this post. (You can leave a positive comment if youâ€™d like, but as Iâ€™ve said this post is for me, from me). I know Iâ€™m loved and valid. I know things will get better. I know Iâ€™m smart, handsome, and unique, and nothing anyone says can change that.

If I get my heart broken, Iâ€™ll know that Iâ€™m going to find the right person. If theyâ€™re not it, theyâ€™re not it.

IIf I have to run away, then Iâ€™ll be smart. 

To my future self, 
Have you figured out your name yet? If so, what is it?

Have you made it into a dance competition yet? If so, which convention was it for? Did you place?

Have you come out? If so, howâ€™d it go? Are you on hormones, and has your period stopped?

Have you posted a video to your channel yet? If so, how many subs do you have, and how many views didn you get?

Answering in a little while. x
