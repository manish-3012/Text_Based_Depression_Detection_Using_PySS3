Hearing trump talk about "patriotic education" is kinda wack Like dude the US has been a bad fucking place for a long time, we've been doing a lot of bad in other places for a long time, patriotic education seems like it's just gonna stir nationalism, not patriotism. I'm leaving primary school this year but it lowkey scares me for the kids that are gonna start school if this shit is implemented cause they're not gonna learn good information.
