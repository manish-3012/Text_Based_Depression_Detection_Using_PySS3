The argument against mooblooms and glow squids that theyâ€™re â€œjust reskinsâ€ is completely invalid Mooblooms are flower cows

Glow squids are squids with glowing eyes

And iceologers are ice evokers

Theyâ€™re all â€œreskinsâ€ with slightly different features from existing mobs, using that against 2 of them while ignoring the 3rd one is just ignorant and hypocritical.

and thereâ€™s also the argument that the mooblooms and glow squids are â€œuselessâ€

Actually the only mob confirmed to have a â€œuseâ€ is the moobloom in that it interacts with bees in some way. The iceologer isnâ€™t confirmed to have any cool drops or special abilities besides the fact that they can summon an ice cloud that damages and slows you (which by the way, is the same effects as the strayâ€™s slowness arrows)

Not saying you shouldnâ€™t vote for the iceologer or trying to convert you to another mob, Iâ€™m just saying those specific arguments are completely ignorant and invalid, and if youâ€™re going to argue for the iceologer, at least come up with a real reason (and donâ€™t put them in the comments, this post is specifically about those 2 arguments and I donâ€™t want to start anything)
