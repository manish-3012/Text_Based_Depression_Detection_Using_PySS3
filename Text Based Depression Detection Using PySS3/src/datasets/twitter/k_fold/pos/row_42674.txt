Go get your DS/3DS/Wii or any older console and start playing some games on it right now. Seriously. Go play something on it. Youâ€™ll have a blast. This time was probably the best era for Nintendo, and so were the games. Especially the Super Mario Galaxy series. Its soundtrack is gold. And if you donâ€™t have any of these, I feel bad for you.
