Soo in exactly 1.5 weeks i have a testweek I do pretty good in school but this week is different shit.

In the testweek i have tests where you need to learn your entire book for a test. I dont live in america, way different school system here.

I have like no time but need to learn insane amounts.

Last 3 schoolyears i was on the verge of failing but i passed all. I hope i can do that again but i really need to get good grades. School only cares about grades.

They say grades dont matter but whenever u fail ur future is pretty much ruined where i live. They also say you shouldnt do it for the money later but whats the whole fÃºcking point of getting a degree then?

I try to study everyday and keep my screentime under 3 hours i hope i will make it
