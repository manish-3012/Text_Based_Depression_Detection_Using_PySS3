You did something productive with your day, I spent the last 8 hours trying to kill every guard on the new gta island. We are not the same &lt;!I hate this game. Why base an entire heist around stealth in a game with dogshit stealth mechanics I just donâ€™t get it like I spent over an hour and a half on one attempt and 90% of the guards were dead I was right there about to reach the stupid goal I was going for and I somehow miss a simple as fuck headshot so I have no other option but to fill the guyâ€™s body with bullets and the alarm is triggered bro how the fuck are you gonna trigger an alarm when youâ€™re currently getting stuffed with bullets I hate this game I wish I actually did something useful with my day!&gt;
