Apparently Iâ€™m a pick me :) (This is gonna be really long but if you love drama I suggest you read through it) 
So Iâ€™ve been hanging out and playing video games since with this group of guys since middle school, weâ€™re all cool and theyâ€™ve always seen me as one of the bros. 

So recently one of the guys got a girlfriend, Iâ€™m not very fond of her my self Iâ€™ve never liked he vibe when I first met her at school, I brushed it off as over protective sister. Since I see this guy as my older brother even if weâ€™re only a few months apart from age. Well whoa my gut feeling was right. 

The other day we were in a ps4 party and his gf joins on her brothers ps4 at first I didnâ€™t realize it since thereâ€™s always people coming in and out I kept talking to my friend then I hear her. For the sake of knowing whoâ€™s who D is my friend, B is his girlfriend 

B-â€œUh whoâ€™s that other girl?â€ 

D answers with â€œoh itâ€™s Sen, you donâ€™t recognize the voice?â€ 

She had the audacity to say â€œyou mean [deadname] I recognize [deadnameâ€™s] voice not Sen.â€ 

Everyone in the party got quiet after that no one has ever dead named me like that on purpose. Yes Iâ€™ve had people call me by my legal name while in the hospital or you know placed where I canâ€™t use my current name yet. To break the silence my other friend S started talking about our sleepover where we all get together  for the weekend when his parents go to visit his grandma which is every two weeks, D and B have only started dating the week after the last sleep over so she didnâ€™t learn about this until now

S- â€œSo.. anyways are you guys ready for Friday? I have everything ready.â€ 
B- â€œFriday? What are we doing Friday.â€ 
There was a slight pause 
D- â€œoh babe Iâ€™m sorry but this is a thing between the guys and Sen. You canâ€™t come.â€ 
B- â€œwhat do you mean i cant come?! Why does that pick me always get to hang out with you? Itâ€™s not fair!â€ 

Iâ€™ll save your time, they got into a huge fight in the party infront of everyone. I never noticed that D and I hung out more than usual so i thought i was the problem so I just left the party and joined a different one. My friend did record the whole fight however, once I listened over to it I realized I wasnâ€™t the problem but it was B, she constantly bailed on him to hang out with her own snarky group of friends. I shouldâ€™ve mentioned this happened Monday morning in between our breaks for online school.

 I havenâ€™t attended class since in hopes of avoiding D and B. I felt like I was getting in the middle of their relationship, D has continued to call me and text me. I refuse to answer. I donâ€™t like confrontation never have so I thought it would be best for me to distance my self from him so he can have a relationship with B. Turns out B told D he has to choice between me or her. I heard this from S I just told him that he could choose B i wouldnâ€™t mind she is his gf after all. He ended up breaking up with B and now thereâ€™s a bunch of rumors being spread by B and her friends. 

Theyâ€™re saying that Iâ€™m a pick me and that itâ€™s my fault her relationship didnâ€™t work out with D. Iâ€™ve talked to D since only in a ps4 party though, I donâ€™t answer his calls or texts because I still feel bad. I can tell thereâ€™s a weird tension between the both of us because of the rumors being spread. I honestly donâ€™t know what to do Im probably going to step out from going to the sleep over on Friday. Iâ€™ve gotten serval messages from people calling me a whore and pick me so I guess thatâ€™s nice. I just wish things could go back to normal. I want my friend back with out having to bring up this situation because it gives me too much anxiety.
