I made an INSTA account with some friends where we poster cursed images and my dad found it So it started as a joke and my dad found it today. There was an image with a caption about throwing away a baby and the post hashtags included Satan and Jesus. My dad made me delete those and tell my friends not to post that stuff. I told him that it was mostly my friends posting which is true, and he said not to post that stuff anymore
