Why in the fuckin fuck are bananas not round, everyone appreciates a good round shape. Bananas just have to be different- donâ€™t they... look at them those independent annoying curvy cunts. Explain why I canâ€™t just get round bananas... itâ€™s outrageous!! Most fruits are round and bananas just need to be stoned and entirely banned from Britain itself, those little shits- canâ€™t put em in your mouth properly like a good Apple can you. It doesnâ€™t make sense and hurts my banana hating brain. Bananas are curved and look exactly like the downwards curve of my liking for bananas. Banana slices are, showing that by dismembering them, we make a much better thing- letâ€™s team up and completely fucking destroy these little yellow minion looking extraterrestrial curvy inappropriately shaped pieces of trash.

This must alert the mods of this astonishingly gobsmacking situation, and they can in turn show the government. Only then can we utterly eradicate bananas.

Together. We... CAN do this.
