My best friends dad just died and I don't know how to talk about it He got hit by a truck, and they were really close, like closer then my dad and I. And I was to talk to her, but I want to be nice and not hurt her feelings if I say the wrong thing, I'm going to delete this in like 5 days. Thanks for your help.
