I feel so sick about myself Iâ€™m such a disappointment and thereâ€™s no way to take back what Iâ€™ve done in the past so Iâ€™m not able to fix the future. I just wish I could start fresh all the time but I donâ€™t get fresh starts. People remember everything and I canâ€™t fucking erase parts of their memory or something. Anyways Iâ€™m literally so useless, like I actually donâ€™t have a life. Another day gone with me just laying in bed, crying, worrying, and sleeping.
