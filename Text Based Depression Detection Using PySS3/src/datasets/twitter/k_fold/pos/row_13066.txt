Update on my post about my crush from last month I keep seeing her around school and have classes with her, but I feel like Iâ€™m in denial, I keep thinking the same thing; â€œyou havenâ€™t spoken to her more than once and have only been back at school for a weekâ€ but every time I see her I get really shy and flustered. I want to talk to her really badly but I donâ€™t know how. I wasnâ€™t prepared for a huge crush I spent the last six months in bed playing D&amp;D for fucks sake
