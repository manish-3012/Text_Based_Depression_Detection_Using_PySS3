Bro its 1:55 AM and I just made cinnamon pumpkin spice muffins from scratch....that says a lot about me but nothing at the same time Anyways...yeah anyone want a muffin in like half an hour? Also if anyone needs to rant or a hug or tips for legit anything (I helped a dude open his salsa a couple days ago) then well my DM's are open. Anyways...lifes crazy ay? One month you're debating on running in front of a school bus and 5 months later you're offering strangers hugs online, making scratch muffins at 2 AM, blaring slipknot, chatting in 3 discord servers at once, and cheering on your gf for her essay shes doing....I love life but also hate people and want to help as many people possible. Anyways, sorry this prolly doesnt even make sense at this point. Its 2:05 AM and I havent slept more than 5 hours in the past 5 or 6 nights.
