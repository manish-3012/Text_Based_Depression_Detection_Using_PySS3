Make me not feel bad about taking a bath I like baths. I have a few (maybe like 4) a month.

I know they're a waste of water which sucks. But I'm an anxious mess. I take baths to relax. Yes, I know they're a luxury. But I like them. I just finished an online summer course today, and I'm kind of proud of myself. I just want to take a bath.

But then I keep thinking about how unnecessary baths are, and that I'm just wasting so much water.

I don't want to feel bad :/
