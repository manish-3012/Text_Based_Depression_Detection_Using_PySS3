Thanks for the advice yall I got some advice from some magnificent people a few months back to be myself,  I did not expect this to work out but it did.  I've been talking to a girl who quickly became my best friend.  I'm gonna ask her out in a few weeks when I'm finally seeing her again after more than a year. She's been telling me about how I make her happy and how I'm cute. We share a lot of the same interests and want to see each other more. Do you think she'll say yes and what's the best way to ask her? I'm the most happiest I've been in a long time because of her.
