u/ADripOfVioletTeaâ€™s NNN 2020 log day 1: I donâ€™t know why, but I decided that the best thing to do in Log for this yearâ€™s NNN, because why not.

Day 1: I just woke up and Iâ€™m feeling good right now, I honestly donâ€™t have anything interesting to say for now since this is the first day. I think I might have better chances doing better this year, than last year. After all, my Animal Crossing ex Wolfgang broke up with me a couple of days before, so Iâ€™m kinda more sad tbh.
