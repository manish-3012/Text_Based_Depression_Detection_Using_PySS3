What are you working on today? (MARCH 2021) I decided I'd make my own little event, and that is to share any projects people are working on! I'll share some of these projects in my personal feed, and also in the WINNER OF MARCH 2021 project collage, to be posted on r/teenagers! Go ahead, what are you working on?
