My thing about lawyer ace attorney reacts Now obviously im not saying i know more about the law than a lawyer because of course not, but the thing that always got me was they only react to the first case, or the first episode of the anime.

Like i dont think the first trial is a good idea to just react to considering its sole purpose is world building and introducing the player to the game mechanics. 

Plus i know the legal system of ace attorney is a mix of japanese and american legal systems and is meant to be a satire of japanese law but they each say their doing it from the perspective of an american lawyer so i dont see the issue as much, tho i would like to see a japanese lawyer reacting to it.

~~there probably is somewhere on niconico now that i think about it~~

Either way id like to see a lawyer critique another ace attorney case than just the first trial tbh. I know their long but still, theres kinda issues with only critiquing the first trial and id kinda wanna see how accurate the whole game is.
