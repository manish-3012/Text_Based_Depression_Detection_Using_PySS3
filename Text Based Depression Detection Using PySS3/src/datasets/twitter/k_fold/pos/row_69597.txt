Ok so basically... My parents, sister and grandparents had gone out on a boat for the day yesterday (we belong to a boat club) and when we came back we were sitting around a table with myself and my dad at each end and my grandfather (from my mumâ€™s side) told my dad that he was carrying a knife whilst they were on the boat in case he fell off so he could cut himself free of his life jacket. What kind of idiot does that? Yes i think I shall cut off the thing that is keeping me alive. Apparently the weather out on the water was shit and they faced high waves and wind in the Axopar 28. My dad and I are still laughing about my grandfatherâ€™s stupidity. Bloody hell he must have a screw loose.
