What song do you think has the most beautiful lyrics? For me itâ€™s definitely Kathyâ€™s Song by Simon and Garfunkel. I love the song in general: the vocals, the guitar. But the lyrics are so beautiful. I know itâ€™s a love song but for me it oozes feeling of something being bittersweet. 

Anyways, comment what song you think has the most beautiful lyrics.
