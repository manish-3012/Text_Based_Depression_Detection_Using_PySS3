I'm looking for artists and song that are not about romance and that stuff This is probably not the best subreddit to post but I got tired of the same topic on music over and over again. I listen to rock music too, which is used by the artist to say other kind if interesting things and not just that they had a lover. So, if you could recommend an artist or even a playlist on Spotify, I'd be grateful.
Sorry if i use any word incorrectly, I'm not a native English speaker.
