Canâ€™t help but feel bad for police officers that try to do their job to the best of their ability and get hated on by people who donâ€™t know them personally and generalize all officers as evil racist pigs. They risk their lives for low pay and a mostly unappreciative community, and I feel like instead of judging them from headlines we see or clips out of context we should try to get the whole story before going out and saying all cops are bastards.
