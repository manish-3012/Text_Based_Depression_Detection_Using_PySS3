Not supporting the lgbtq+ is NOT homophobic... Just because you donâ€™t Avidly support something does not mean you hate it, as long as your not constantly hating on that group of people or treat them differently your not homophobic you simply just arenâ€™t a fan of the movement. And as for the ss movement thereâ€™s nothing transphobic about not preferring transgenders and ps if their really the gender they say they are why put Trans in front of it? Stop calling everyone a homophobe and transphobe just because your feelings are hurt... the large quantity of people in that group who say not supporting them is homophobic is exactly why some people donâ€™t support it ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™‚ï¸
