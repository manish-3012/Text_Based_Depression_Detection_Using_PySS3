I really hate that I even want to talk about this, but I guess I should. I (a minor) live in America with my dad and stepmom, and my biological mom lives in Australia. I didn't know how bad the US really has it right now until my mom told me that Australia has less than a hundred active novel coronavirus cases. That a whole lot of nations around the world aren't accepting travel specifically to and from the USA. I didn't even know the staggering number of cases and deaths alone in just America, that being about a quarter of *all* cases and deaths.

I was confused, at first. I knew my country wasn't having the greatest of times, but none of them were, were they? But eagle land, where I'm sure a whole lot of those of you reading this are, is probably having the worst time. And it sucks that this is being caused by a few really stupid American stereotypes. Anti-maskers, large gatherings in the streets, and a whole lot of folks ignoring the people who are in charge and who probably know what they're talking about.

I haven't seen my mom for seven months, and a large part of that is due to "hur dur muh rights." Maybe I'm over-exaggerating this problem, but the numbers don't lie, and the numbers say that the freedom country is getting fucked by itself. This won't be over anywhere on Earth for a long time, but flattening the curve vertically is not the answer, unless you want your body to be vibing in a mass grave. Don't be stupid, everyone. Please.

tl;dr Wear a mask, wash your hands, listen to guidelines, stay home if you're sick. Remember the safety of those around you, and even of those on the other side of the world.
