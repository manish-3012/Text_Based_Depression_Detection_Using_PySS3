I hate how texting is supposed to feel natural Itâ€™s not something that feels natural to me at all. You canâ€™t see the fucking person, you canâ€™t hear their tone of voice, you canâ€™t see their body language, and Iâ€™m supposed to understand the right thing to say and not have a dry conversation?? Maybe it comes easily to other people but I think those things are 70% of conversation and Iâ€™m supposed to just pretend it isnâ€™t?? I hate how people rely on texting so much and Iâ€™m expected to have the perfect response somehow and itâ€™s not natural at all. Iâ€™m given the option to take my time and irl Iâ€™m supposed to just talk. There isnâ€™t time to craft the perfect response. The problem with words on a screen is that itâ€™s hard to make my words convey how I feel. Itâ€™s already hard irl and I have to somehow pretend im a fucking writer. Everyone has all the expectations and Iâ€™m so sick of the fact that I canâ€™t meet them
