Don't read this you literally won't care just keep scrolling I still lay awake thinking about you, I cried for days without you, I know I made mistakes but nothing I couldn't change, why am I in the wrong when you're the one who lied. 

Its funny how you hurt me yet I'd still do anything for you. 

You say you care but what do you to care.
