I thought I reached rock bottom 3 years ago but I guess not The past 2 weeks feel like 2020 condensed, there's an absolute minimum of 2 catastrophic events that happen every day. I don't have anything to look forward to anymore, I only now regret so many things and I give up. I messed up my neck, probably permanently, lost a 55k scholarship, lost all trust and respect for my friend. That's only a small part. I'm so tired I can't talk to anyone properly even if they're family or friends, there's nothing I can think of so I don't say a word for hours straight. All I'm waiting for is to finish school, look through Reddit and sleep. I just distract myself from everything because I can't handle it.

I deserve all of it though, I don't feel comfortable saying why but I deserve a million times worse than this, but I can't go through with it. I keep seeing visions of hanging myself and other ways of doing it so much, I find it appealing. There's no one I can talk to, I can't get better, I can't change, and I can't kill myself. The only option for me right now is to deal with it and I've already broken 8 months without cutting. All of it doesn't even compare to what other people go through and I'm somehow struggling?
