How would I know if Iâ€™m depressed Iâ€™ve been down a lot lately and I want to know if Iâ€™m depressed or this is just puberty and mood swings. Iâ€™m doing a gratitude journal right now because itâ€™s supposed to make me happy if Iâ€™m not depressed. If I am then it wonâ€™t make a difference. 

So any other things that could show me my current state other than therapy?
