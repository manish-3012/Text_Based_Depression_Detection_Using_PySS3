I fucked up Without getting too into detail about my person life, I fucked up. I said things I shouldn't have said and now there's only one person in my family who still truly loves me anymore. I just really don't feel like I can continue on with this life anymore. The way I see it, there are three options: Run away and try to start my own new life, or find the gun in my mom's closet and end it. With the choices I've made, I can't imagine my life having any good future, and I just need some way out. This all just feels like a nightmare and I want to wake up.
