Do you guys remember your imaginary friend in your childhood? How it was? I had a girlfriend in the kindergarten, but when I was home, I idealized her playing with me. When I was at kindergarten with her, we played together and kissed eachother.

That might sound stupid, but it was cool to me that times.
