This is embarrassing but I kind of just want a love that is otherworldly and I yearn and am wistful for something I donâ€™t even have I feel so lame. Everyone tells me i should enjoy being young but I donâ€™t care about hook ups or anything. I want something deeper and just. Everything. Yknow. Itâ€™s so weird.
