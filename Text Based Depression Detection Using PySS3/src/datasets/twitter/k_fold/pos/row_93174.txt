Here I m again needing help So, today after I talked to my friends my mom barges into my room and then after talking to me about something starts giving me a bad lecture on study and that my full marks rn are irrelevant, I have been crying for the past hour, I think if in place I did not get full marks in any subject like last year she would have shouted on me then too, idk what to do with my life. Plz tell me what should I do to improve the situation between me and my mother.
