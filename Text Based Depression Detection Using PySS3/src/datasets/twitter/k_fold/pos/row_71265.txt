reddit dmâ€™s are funny sometimes like you dm someone because you wanted to chat and you exchange pleasantries and make smalltalk for a little bit and then be like â€œhey Imma go Iâ€™ll talk tomorrowâ€ knowing damn well neither of you plan to and you never talk again

or one of you wanted to but was too shy to text first

or itâ€™s both of you

sometimes
