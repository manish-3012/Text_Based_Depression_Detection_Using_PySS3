How the turns have tabled Me and my cousin are 4-5 years apart and we used to play cod 1v1 at his house and because he was like 11 and I was 6 he destroyed me and it stayed that way for about 6 years then we stopped playing, then quarantine came up and me him and my dad got together to play fighting games like jump force and street fighter like old times and we kept this going from June to now and recently I got back on my ps3 and we 1v1nd on bo2 and I absolutely destroyed him with no mercy and he blamed the controller so we switched controllers and I still caught up and he finally admitted that I was better than him.  So yeah the turns have tabled
