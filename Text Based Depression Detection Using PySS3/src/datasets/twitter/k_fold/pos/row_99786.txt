Would it be possible to be a sci fi fan and a normal college student at the same time? Could a student play at least one Mass Effect game or finish The Expanse during their 4 year college experience and still maintain a healthy social life or would that get in the way?

The only people I came across who like shows like this look like people who live in a basement. I saw one of these people in a "Half Price Books".

Perhaps getting interested in real spaceflight would be better. Tom Hanks and HBOâ€™s series about the space race â€œFrom the Earth to the Moonâ€ is excellent as well as movies like â€œFirst Manâ€, â€œApollo 13â€, and â€œThe Right Stuffâ€.

There is also this series on Apple called â€œFor All Mankindâ€ and I enjoyed it more than I would have expected to.
