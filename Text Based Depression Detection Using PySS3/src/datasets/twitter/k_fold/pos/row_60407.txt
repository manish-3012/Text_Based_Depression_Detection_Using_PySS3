In a couple of hours I will become older by one year (this is not a goodbye post) Its my birthday and I feel sad. I really do like my birthday and that my family cares about me and gets me presents and stuff, but what im sad about is that time seems to be going really fast. I feel like I'm wasting my life away just staying inside playing video games but it's not like I can do anything else because of quarantine.
