That post defending "Cuties" was made a man pretending to be 16 year old girl. [This is the post I'm referring to](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/idt6ik/since_everyone_is_so_misinformed_about_cuties_let/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

I don't know there isn't much else to say. A while back on r/oneplus they [referred to themself as a guy multiple times](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/hwoc1p/the_most_unfortunate_day/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). I'm just assuming this is some sort of troll, defending Cuties is wack lol.
