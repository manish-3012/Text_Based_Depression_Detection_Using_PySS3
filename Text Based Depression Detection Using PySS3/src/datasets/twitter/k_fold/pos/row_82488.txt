What was your most dramatic kiss like? I don't mean passionate or anything, I mean dramatic. Like "when your girl/boyfriend is falling and you catch them in one arm and lean in and kiss them" dramatic. If you haven't had this kind of kiss before, try it out sometime. I haven't kissed anyone but it sounds funny like this.
