my cat just sliced my hand open he was playfully biting and scratching my arm and i was trying to get him to stop and then i felt his claw stick into my palm and drag to the other side of my hand, leaving a big fucking cut. i look down at my hand in shock and see a deep cut in my hand, waiting for it to bleed. i rushed to grab a bandaid and its all covered up now

after my cat cut me i showed the cut to him and he was like ðŸ˜” and then he followed me to the bandaids to make sure i was okay hahaha
