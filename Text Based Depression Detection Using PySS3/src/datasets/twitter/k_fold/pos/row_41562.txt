god night time really sucks, it feels so lonely i donâ€™t want to be alone, iâ€™m so used to always falling asleep with my bf that itâ€™s so hard to sleep when he isnâ€™t here, like iâ€™ve literally barely slept the past 2 days, it fucking sucks, i donâ€™t like feeling like this, i just want cuddles goddamnit lol
