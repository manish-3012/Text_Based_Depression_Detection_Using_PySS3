So I dont know how to say this, but it's been coming for a while now So where to begin with all of this... 
I guess it all started a couple years back when things were quiet, and what I thought was perfect, but as time went on we just started diving more into it. At first I thought it was fun and it seemed like nothing could change the state of things...but then....this happened...its made times tough and it led to me making some tough choices and even going through some dark times where I doubted it all and whether or not I should carry on or even devote anymore time to this.

Now I know all of this sounds very vague and like on really not saying much but this is the best way I can put it all into words, and if like me you're wondering "what is this idiot talking about" or "would he just get to the point" and to that I say THANK YOU...

THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT THIS FAR INTO THE POST....(I'm rather proud of this tbh) but this is all about a YouTube channel called Global Expression Music, and we are devoted to sharing the music of small and upcoming artists who make music as their source of expression and want nothing but for you to hear their craft.
