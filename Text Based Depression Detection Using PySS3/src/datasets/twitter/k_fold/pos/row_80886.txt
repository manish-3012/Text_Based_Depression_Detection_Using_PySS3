I know you guys see so many posts like this but still Male depression is a serious issue that needs to be addressed I know friends who have self harmed over it and I also have heard them talk about how whenever they bring it up people respond with â€œsuck it upâ€ or â€œyour being dramaticâ€ itâ€™s a massive issue. I have medium to bad depression and I just canâ€™t talk about it because people will just say to suck it up and that needs to change.

Sorry for a post you guys see all the time but I just felt the need to say something and I thought this would be one of the places I should put it
