Should we change the definition of the word "gay?" Trigger warning ahead? Idk, depends on the way you think

So recently I've found it inconvenient that one of the definitions of the word gay, "to be foolish or stupid," was now considered an offensive definition, even though stupidity and homosexuality have nothing to do with each other. Of course, I can't do anything about it because I'm not gay.

Now, I understand that finding this to be inconvenient is a very selfish concept. For example, if I said "I support gay people" and then later said "the government is gay," my first statement is contradicted. Although I used the word in two completely different ways, the fact remains that I used the same word, implying that I think homosexuals are stupid.

However, recently I found out about the origins of the word gay. Other than its oldest definition (to be happy and carefree), one of its earliest definitions was to be immoral and promiscious. Whether you were a prostitute or just a person who fucked a lot, you were called gay. Later on, when homosexuality began to appear more often, the term gay was then applied to homosexuals (it was still applied to prostitutes as well). Finally, the older definitions were removed, and the word briefly held the aforementioned definition "to be foolish or stupid," before it was deemed offensive. 

In my opinion, I think it's strange to use a word with this kind of history on a supported minority. It's similar to the n-word: the mere action of saying it does not cause you to become racist, but it is still correlated with racism due to its history (although it's not like people used to say "the government is a n****!" back then)

I feel like a word with a history of negative connotations should remain with negative connotations, and a different word could be used in place of the word gay. Homosexual sounds a bit too scientific, so maybe "lesbian?" Idk, all I care about is knowing how you all feel about my opinion.

Remember everyone, this is a very weak opinion that I have so it's very open to changes. Rather than simply downvoting this post and calling me a stupid bigot, why not downvote and tell me why I'm wrong?
