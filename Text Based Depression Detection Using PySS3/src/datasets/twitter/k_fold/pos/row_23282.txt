Hey fellow teenagers , I Need some help in buying a laptop. So I have a decent laptop right now. 8gigs ram and 1 TB HDD with 128 GB SSD. The only thing it doesn't have is a graphics card. I am getting a new laptop and I was being very futuristic with my thoughts on getting a laptop that would play gta 6 ( in future ) possibly high settings. Now I think that's a stupid idea. Bec who knows when the game will come. When the pc port will come? So I thought why not get a good machine with good battery for the next 4-5 years under 1000 dollars. Can someone guide me a bit? Like why should I buy an expensive laptop just so that I can play a game which will come in future. Enlighten me !
