Thereâ€™s a girl I like, but sheâ€™s one grade below me, is that bad? Iâ€™m not on some Epstein type shit, but thereâ€™s a girl Iâ€™ve been talking to for a while and sheâ€™s so amazing; but the only problem is sheâ€™s one grade below me. I know there are marriages that have like 5+ years of age gaps, but it feels a lot different considering weâ€™re in High school; even if itâ€™s just one grade. Tell me what you think, because I donâ€™t wanna have the reputation for hitting on younger girls just because I like a girl one grade below me.
