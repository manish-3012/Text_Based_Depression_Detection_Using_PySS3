On Sunday Iâ€™m going to see some kittens My dance teacherâ€™s cat had kittens and she doesnâ€™t want all of them, so sheâ€™s letting some of us have them. Iâ€™m one of the people whoâ€™s getting them and Iâ€™m soooo excited. Iâ€™m gonna turn into a crazy cat lady tho. 

Anyways, the kitten that were going to get is orange, so any name suggestions yet?
