It's been a tough year, and id argue this is a Christmas we've all been waiting for more than ever. Please understand that for some of us, it isn't such a Merry Christmas, be with these people, don't force it, just love them. Finally make 2020 Christmas one worthy of bringing back some joy and home into this year.
