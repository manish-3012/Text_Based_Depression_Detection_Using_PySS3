That was the best shot of beer I ever had. this is a long read, if you don't have time, it's ok

So there was this girl, she caught my eye first day of school and then we only talked for like 2 or 3 times that year. Yeah, I'm that shy. Reading all the posts here back then, about "Just being yourself and just go talk to her" and I thought about as pure bs and just decided to go on with my life.

I play codm, and is kinda good at it, I post my battle royale victories to, you know, kinda show I'm not dead yet. Then lo and behold, she posts a victory of hers at codm. My heart fucking races, "WTH WHY IS SHE HERE" and shit like that. Then midnight, I took a shot of beer. Exhaled, "Fuck it, Imma ask her."

I asked her. "Hey, what's your rank?" I really didn't expect her to just invite me to a game. A few, we didn't really talk, poor coordination, I got knocked down more often bc I was real nervous. Few days later, same thing.

While scrolling through reddit, I saw this meme about manning up from being a virgin, and I took that personally; I decided to just go have a normal chat with her. AND SHIT, we were actually very similar. We got to that point where we'll talk about life up 'till 3 am, and this feeling man. We talked about her insecurities, we talked about my childhood trauma, we talked about our hopes and dreams... It's like a dream. Like it's not real, but it is.

I wanna make her my girlfriend. I guess that's that. Do you have any advice, guys?
