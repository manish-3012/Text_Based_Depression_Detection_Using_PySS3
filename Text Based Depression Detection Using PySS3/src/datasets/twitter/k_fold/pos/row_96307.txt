I used to not give two shits about Covid-19 untill recently... Okay so overall I do not give two shits about Covid-19.
When the major outbreak (in the EU) happened I didn't either.
This was the sweet spot for me, I could just join Online Classes and play games or something while "being there"
Since the end of June the lockdown was over.
(I live in the Netherlands)
There was nothing except work for me to leave the house,
This was about the time I hadn't burned out of gaming so the entire lockdown and barely going to school was heaven to me.

My mental health wasn't going well for a while but it wasn't *that* bad since I was constantly doing something I enjoyed.
Okay well now summer break.
This is about when I burned out from gaming, I mean I still played games but I didn't (/don't) really enjoy playing em anymore.
In result I barely did anything, I just made some things in Photoshop chatted a lot with friends and I met a cute girl on discord.

Fast forward a few weeks and I grew a crush on this girl.
I knew it wasn't going to work for her and tried to stop having a crush on her so to say.
Well that didn't work out well...
Me and her have been talking for quite a while and I decided to tell her about my mental state since we became friends and I needed to tell someone how I felt.
She was/is really supportive about everything which helped a lot :).

Fast forward to last Thursday (September 4th) 
Even though my crush supported me lots my mental health went down faster and faster for some reason.
(Just to clarify with mental health I am talking about depression)
The fact that I had a crush on her when knowing that wouldn't work didn't really help...
But that Thursday is when everything changed.

I did something that night that I shouldn't have done, I regret doing it but I later on wanted to make it worse for myself but I told my crush that my first attempt on doing something horrible failed.
She later on told me she liked me...
So I was incredibly happy and confused since I was like 100% sure that things wouldn't work out, but guess what it did!

So right now we are chatting a lot and we want to meet up IRL really badly, my gf lives in the UK.

NOW HERES THE PROBLEM:
I am not allowed to go right now because of covid-19...
SO IF COVID-19 COULD PLEASE SHUT THE F#CK UP THAT WOULD BE AMAZING!

Okay I needed to say that, thanks for coming to my TedTalk.

Also, About the mental health thing.
I have been better but also not, I have written out an entire post for this subreddit and I have it saved as a draft.
There is some things in it that I myself am not 100% sure with if I want to post, but I am willing to if you guys would like to read it/give your thoughts on it so....
Would you guys like for me to post the post I have saved?
