A guy I like said he loves me... Heâ€™s said he loved multiple times, but Iâ€™d always took it as a joke, i mean, who would love me?  

We would always sit together during P.E. / health. 

On Thursday, his female friends told me that I should ask him out.  In my head, I thought, â€œWeâ€™re in a pandemic?!â€  I said, â€œI can barely talk to people.â€  I also forgot to mention, Im not allowed to date males until high school.  

That was during recess and we were outside in the snow; so I awkwardly walked away and threw a snowball at him.

Thanks for listening to my Ted-Talk!
