Somethin weird happened yesterday I was using my phone while lying on the bed. I kept my phone aside and decided to sleep. I remember checking the time it was 03:08 am. I closed my eyes and I thought I went to sleep.

 After 8-10 minutes a bullet train of thoughts ran through my head. I can't remember what all I was thinking but it was really random. For a moment I thought I went to sleep and and was just dreaming. 

I woke up like people woke up after a nightmare (which is highly uncommon, it usually never happens). I thought I've slept for more than 2 hours so far and had some dream that I can't remember (this is pretty common). 

I checked the time, it said 03:30 am. So I went all through this in like 15-20 minutes and my body started feeling less sleepy, mind felt light and quite energetic. It was a fucking random half hour.
