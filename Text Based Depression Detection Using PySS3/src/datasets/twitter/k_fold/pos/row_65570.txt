Fellas, take your health class as early as possible, or you end up like me, or embarrass yourself So this has just happened recently. I'm now 16 years old and have finally learned that I was circumcised. The reason I never found out was because my parrents never told me. I know your thinking "How did you not notice?" I don't know. But I was always confused by those foreskin memes. just to find out i don't have it. This is pretty damn ironic because I've always believed parents shouldn't be able to make that decision. instead, later, the child should.

Take a health class freshman year if you can. Don't embarrass yourself
