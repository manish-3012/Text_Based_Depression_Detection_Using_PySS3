My life is going great right now and I am so happy So, recently I posted that I got a job interview, update, I got the job. And thatâ€™s awesome. But right now everything is awesome. Iâ€™m 19 and I have a car, a job, a girlfriend. Sheâ€™s in college working hard to become a teacher and Iâ€™m just trying to make a bunch of money. Itâ€™s like. Everything is so good and clear right now. A year ago right now I was failing school, single, jobless, and my car was constantly broken down. But I kept on chugging along and now Iâ€™m so happy. So if youâ€™re thinking about giving up on anything, donâ€™t. It will get better sooner or later :)
