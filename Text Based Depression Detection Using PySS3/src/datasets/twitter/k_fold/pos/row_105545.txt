I just noticed "super straights" ruined my joke I used to day "I am super straight, like really really really straight, so straight I don't like girls because girls like dick and that is gay, so by liking girls I would indirectly be liking dick"

Now I can't even make that joke without people thinking I am one of those types of people.
