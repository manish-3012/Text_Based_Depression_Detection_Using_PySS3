I'm kinda looking forward to turning 18 a little bit not for any reason in particular. I just think it would be neat to be considered an "adult" (even though I don't feel like one at all lol). but at the same time, I'm not looking forward to how the next few years are gonna go because they'll probably end up being shit and I'm pretty disappointed that I didn't die before turning 18 like I wanted to. it could still happen but it's pretty unlikely at this point.
