ABOUT THE NEW NETFLIX MOVIE TRAILER As you probably know, a bunch of the trailers were disliked on YouTube since is supporting basically paedophilia, but hear me out first, I don't support pedophilia. 

Most of the likes are probably just children that don't know what really is in the movie and maybe not pedophiles. 

So in my conclusion, we shouldn't hate the people who liked it, we should hate all the pedos who liked it. 


If there might be another reason, please tell why, I would like to know if there are other reasons it has about 8k likes per video.
