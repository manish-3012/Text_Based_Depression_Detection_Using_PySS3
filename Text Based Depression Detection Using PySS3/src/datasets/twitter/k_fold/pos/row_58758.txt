I lost a friend on Discord a year ago She randomly DMed me, which I hate when people do that, but she seemed quite nice and we talked and became good friends. Unfortunately, I got too comfortable and I started talking about nsfw topics that she didn't feel comfortable about. She said she didn't like when I did that, and I said that I was sorry but I was how I was. For obvious reasons, she blocked me and we didn't speak again. Now when I was cleaning through my Discord DMs, I accidentally clicked the x next to her name, and there went my only possible friendship with a female.
