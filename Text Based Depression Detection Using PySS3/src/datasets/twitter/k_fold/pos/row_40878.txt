They say that a random act of kindness can make someoneâ€™s day and itâ€™s true. I have been having a shit week recently, went through a breakup, got put on lockdown over spring break, dad caught covid, just general shitty week. Because of this Iâ€™ve just been in a bad mood and generally depressed.

But hereâ€™s what happens 

I was driving home from work today and I had the windows down and I got caught in traffic for a half hour going 5miles. I had my music playing and I go into a sneezing fit. All of the sudden I hear someone scream â€œBLESS YOU!â€ Apparently the guy two cars over also had his windows down and heard me. 

Idk why but just him yelling that over the engines and music made my day 10times better.

And to that guy I say thank you!
