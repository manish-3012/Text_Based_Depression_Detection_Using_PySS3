Brain associates bad things with events too fast Hi...

So i dont know if this is normal but i struggle with it,
My brain associates events with anxiety too fast (i think)

For example: on my school i get guidance on homework etc, i have been on this school for 3 years now and i had a guidance meeting where my teacher helps my with planning and shit, and once in those 3 years i had a bad meeting in my first year. Now everytime i have a guidance meeting i get an half anxiety attack, my heart is my troat, i am sweating, i feel dizzy, i breathe like i just ran a marathon. 
The same is with math, everytime i hear my math teacher her voice it happens ( i have a bad experience with math)

Why am i like.this, do you experience the same?
