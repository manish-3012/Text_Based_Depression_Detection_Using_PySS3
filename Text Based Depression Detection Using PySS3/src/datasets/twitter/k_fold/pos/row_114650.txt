I don't wanna grow up. I'm 18 and this is all happening too fast. I wanna go back. At the end of 8th grade, I had a breakdown in front of my teacher about how fast everything is happening and in a flash high school ended and now I'm in college. I can't believe I'm halfway through my first year of college... there's no way to stop this and I don't want this anymore. I wanna go back. It's honestly happening way too fast and I don't know what to do about it.
