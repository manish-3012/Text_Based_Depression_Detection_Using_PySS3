I'm going through a lot stuff right now I'm going through a rough break up and I feel like it's all my fault but she keep telling me it's not. she's going through a lot stuff and my suicidal thoughts weren't really helping she started having nightmares of me dying. Honestly right I do want to die I tried overdosing before it didn't work, but for now I might just build wall around to hid my feelings for a while....
