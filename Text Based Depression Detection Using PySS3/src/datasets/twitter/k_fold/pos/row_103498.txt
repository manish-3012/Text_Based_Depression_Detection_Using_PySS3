School Is So Stressful 
I had to work online for the second-half of last year. Almost everyone did. It was rushed. With that being said, it worked.

Iâ€™m currently doing school online again. Itâ€™s worse than before. Iâ€™m failing. No, Iâ€™m not failing anything, Iâ€™m just doing terrible.

Iâ€™m NOT TOLD HOW TO DO ANYTHING. I hate it. I donâ€™t have a textbook. I donâ€™t have formulas. We donâ€™t do any calls. It takes days for the teacher to get back to you through email. 

Iâ€™ve avoided three exams in math cause I donâ€™t know what I am doing. Iâ€™m going to flunk the midterm. It doesnâ€™t help that my teachers mark every assignment that I do right. They donâ€™t look at it. I keep getting one-hundreds. I have a mid-term next week. 

Iâ€™ve been doing fine in Legal Studies. Iâ€™ve gotten above eighty-five on the first two exams. I flunked the third one. I got a fifty-five. I want to double check with her as a lot of the deductions donâ€™t make sense.

I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s stressing me out. At this point, I have no motivation.
