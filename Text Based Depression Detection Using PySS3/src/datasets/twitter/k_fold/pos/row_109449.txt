Everyone Pro Biden and Pro Trump I understand a lot of you have a strong side on the political spectrum

I also know that a large percentage of you reading this aren't American yet you still hold a side.

I am not going to try to change your opinion because whatever it is it's cemented, and 1 of my post can't change it. I am also in this post not taking sides.

All I ask is you guys pro-trump or pro-Biden go on incognito mode and search what has trump done in his 4 years and what has Biden done as VP what do they want to do in their next terms and what are some policies they implemented and wanna further implement.

I know a lot of you think Trump is a racist bigoted xenophobic moron but I still want you to search it up. Don't watch mocking videos cause there are tones of them on both sides and they serve no purpose on educating you. Don't look up bad things first look up good things.

I am well aware that the election is over and this post will not affect it. But I believe everyone should educate themselves on people they support. Both trump and Biden have done some questionable things in the past but it's the future that matters.

Even after educating yourself if you choose a side that's ok. I got nothing against you. But first learn about the people you are behind. You'd be shocked on what you learn about the other candidate.

\*One last thing for those who really don't care and would insta downvote this for even mentioning something neutral about trump. The reason you probably hate trump(and this doesn't apply to a lot of you) is because the media has portrayed him as such. You have to understand that before he was the president he was a very rich person being the president only made him stronger and he had a lot of dust on a lot of people obvs the higher ranking guys would wanna get him out of power. So even tho this paragraph seems like I'm taking his side. This is just an incentive for you to go and research, atleast that way when someone cross questions you you'd be ready. And you'd know your candidate for who they are and not because everyone you know thats "good" supports him\*
