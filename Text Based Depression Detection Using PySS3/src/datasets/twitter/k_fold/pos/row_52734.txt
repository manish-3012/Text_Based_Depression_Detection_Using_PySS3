sometimes when i think About how much my mom loves me it makes me tear up wtf ðŸ™ like we definitely dont have the best relationship but i see how much she loves me in the way she texts me just to say hey everyday im away at uni and how fiercely protective she is of us kids and all the sacrifices she made for us (esp while we were growin up) ðŸ˜­ i just love my mama yall
