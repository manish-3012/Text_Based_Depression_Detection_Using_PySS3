I feel kinda bad right now Lemme tell you a story about how I lied.

Yesterday evening I spent my time playing and talking with friends, instead of studying for the tests I had the day after. I knew I was not going to make both tests if I went to school. But, I had a headache and I knew I could profit from that. I went to bed at a reasonable time, but stayed up so I would be tired the next morning, to help me fake that the headache got worse. Indeed, the headache got worse, but not so much that I couldn't go to school. My parents just told me to get a painkiller to get through the test. But I was so tired I started crying because I knew I wouldn't get through the tests with a sufficient. My parents noticed that and let me stay at home.

So well, yeah now I feel bad, and that's probably good cuz it will make me want to actually study well next time.

I just needed to rant a bit, go on with your day and remember to study well my fellow teens.
