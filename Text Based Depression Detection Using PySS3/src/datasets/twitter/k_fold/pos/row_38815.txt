People really shouldn't act depressed for attention It's so stupid seeing some kids on ig reminding everyone about their "depression" on every story/post. Depression is not when you feel sad  'cause you have 2 missing assignments. Having mental illness is not cool at all, yet some people think it is. If somebody is seriously depressed, they wouldn't talk about it every 5 minutes.
