I made a post saying that it is NOT transphobic if you don't want to date trans people. And triggered fucking cishets are still finding ways to attack me and say I'm wrong and aggressively affirm that their preferences are valid. WHEN I literally fucking implied that they are valid. Lmao. And the post was more of a joke/jab at transphobic people anyway. I was confirming that the preferences for not wanting to date trans people is VALID, except most people who say stuff like that are transphobic in general anyway, not just because of that preference. And the people attacking me seem exactly like that when they find the need to constantly say that they don't want to date trans people.
