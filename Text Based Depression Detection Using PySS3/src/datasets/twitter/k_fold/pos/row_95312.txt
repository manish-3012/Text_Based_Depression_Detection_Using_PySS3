Reddit sucks sometimes I feel like you canâ€™t say *anything* negative about awards without getting them now. I donâ€™t understand why someone would spend $20 on fake internet points just to give someone because they talked bad about it. I can see people using them for a really high quality OC post, but not when somebody says â€œoH i HaTe AwArDsâ€ and then get 500 of them. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
