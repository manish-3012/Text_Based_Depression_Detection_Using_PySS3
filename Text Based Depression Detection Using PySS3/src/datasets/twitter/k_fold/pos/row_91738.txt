How do I tell my dad That my airsoft gun that shoots plastic balls isn't a real gun and I shouldn't have to treat it as such. I mean yes it looks real but it doesn't shoot real. I already know real gun etiquette I just choose to avoid it because I know I'm not in any real danger holding it. It's just a toy. No matter how realistic it looks. He wants me to treat it like a real gun because I aimed it at my punk ass brother as a joke and he told my dad. What if I don't want a real gun dad? What if I wanna have actual fun, DAD?
