16M looking for a girl my age to talk to because Iâ€™m lonely and talking to guys donâ€™t really help. I made a post like this before and realized that Iâ€™m not bad at talking to people. Iâ€™m bad at starting conversations with girls. 

At this point Iâ€™m desperate enough to ignore the shame I feel making a post like this lol.
