Sleeping in So I decided to sleep in today. I usually wake up at 6:30, leaving me 2 1/2 hours to get ready for school. But this morning, I didn't wake up until 9:00, *right* when e learning starts. I sat in my bed for like, two minutes trying to register why I was panicking until I realized, *"Oh no. I'm late.* ***I'm fucking late!**" So I turned on my computer and rushed to get dressed. I didn't have time for breakfast, so I was barely functioning. I'm so glad the app is set up so that I have to turn on my camera to display my video, otherwise I'd have probably been suspended, or whatever they can do to punish me online. I sleep shirtless, which ordinarily isn't an important detail, but it's the main thing I was worried about.
