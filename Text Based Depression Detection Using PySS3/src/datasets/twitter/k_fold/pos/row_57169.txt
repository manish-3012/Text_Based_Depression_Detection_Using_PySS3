I've lost so many songs because I put them in a playlist on YouTube or something and it gets removed. I can't count the number of songs I lost because I didn't write them down or something. I listen to a lot of music so it's hard to keep track of every song that I liked. It gets even worse when its covers or something. I Remember things about the songs I like but I cant remember enough to find them again. It's like my brain is teasing me. I hate how much youtube takes down or doesn't allow certain videos to be viewed like bruh it shouldn't matter what country I'm in let me listen to some damn music. If I had physical copies of the songs that'd be nice but highly unlikely. Downloading or getting digital copies can be expensive or tedious. I shouldn't have to pirate music just listen to it without it being taken down because it has a similar sound to a certain sound from a random song. Just bs
