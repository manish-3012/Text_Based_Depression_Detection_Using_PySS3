What are your fake-friend stories? I typed a whole paragraph about one, but then deleted it because it's really easy to identify who I am if someone who knows me stumbles upon my Reddit account. **Sigh** Any story that you are comfortable with sharing? You can vent your heart out, because I know that there are some things you can't share with people in person, but you would like to get off your chest.

Hope you're doing well and have a wonderful day wherever you are!
