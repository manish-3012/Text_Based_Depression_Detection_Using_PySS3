Tobias secret! I was with my friend Tobias he told me that he had a secret. Tobias shoved a book from under his bed, he told me that it was a very secret book. In the book were all men who had no clothes and some pages were glued together, probably because they were too secret to share with humanity. Tobias gave me one the pictures and told that I should tell no one! I asked Tobias if the men had no shirt, because his biceps were too big, but he didn't respond and looked very concentrated at the man and said: "I need to pee!" And took the book with him. I think Tobias didn't really have to pee, maybe Tobias is a secret agent. :)
