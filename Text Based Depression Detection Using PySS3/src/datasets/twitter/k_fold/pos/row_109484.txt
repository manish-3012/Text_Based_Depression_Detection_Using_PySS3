Does your school have a Discord or Minecraft server? I am currently building a Discord server for my school. We are in online learning and students have no clubs or activities this year. I have been pushing to get a student social platform up and running but the district keeps asking me for a function example. I need their approval on the project to get it recognized as a school platform. So far I haven't found another school that has a board approved server and therefore have had a difficult time getting approval. The Minecraft server will definitely be harder to make an argument for but I also feel like it's worth fighting for.

TLDR; Need an example of a school approved Discord or Minecraft server.
