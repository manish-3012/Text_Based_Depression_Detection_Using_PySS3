minor question Why does reddit not allow you to see who is following you? I feel like this is something really dumb that would also be incredibly easy to change. I mean, I've got 3 followers and only have the most vague idea of who one of them might be. I WANT TO KNOW WHO THE HELL IS FOLLOWING ME!!! Anyways, that is all I had to say. I hope you have a good day.
