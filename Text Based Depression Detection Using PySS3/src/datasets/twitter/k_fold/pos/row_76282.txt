Yo yo yo itâ€™s your girl, receding hairline, and Iâ€™m here to tell you why Iâ€™m blocked almost constantly One time, this guy started spamming me with the f-slur, and I then proceeded to write him a 5 page love letter on to why heâ€™s the sunshine to my rainy day.

Another time I got blocked because I asked my friend to peer review my Cookie Monster x Elmo fanfic.

And lastly, I got blocked by a friend when I sent her an essay on why sporks are useless. Donâ€™t judge me, I had a lot of free time on my hands.
