Did I do the right thing So my best friend was curious and I were talking in class. She asked me about a guy we will call John, she rejected him and then he spread rumors about letâ€™s call the best friend Kayla.
Anyways Kayla asked me what rumors he spread, I really didnâ€™t wanna reply and I held off, but I ended up saying it to her anyways. It was seriously messed up.
She froze with anger then she started crying, I stayed with her until the teacher found her crying and me and her were the only ones in the classroom, she demanded I explain the situation then I did. She said I should have lied and then she kicked me out the classroom.

Kayla is now at the hospital.......
Am I stupid? Did I mess up, what should I do? She isnâ€™t responding to anyoneâ€™s messages, advice please, if you wanna be brutal go ahead.
