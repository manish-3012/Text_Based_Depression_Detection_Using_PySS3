You know what really bothers me When people decide to shower right before my specific time ive been showering at for the past 4 years. For no reason. Like they either already showered and they just shower again or they "dont have time in the morning" when they have plenty of time to do so they just stay up super late. Now i shower 10pm every single night and theyre excuse is oh i thought id be out in time as they get in at 9:50. We have had an unspoken schedule for years about this and when i break it its hell on earth and I made them shower for a couple minutes less because i had to brush my teeth. But when they do it its just oops. Ok gn its just bothering me currently and I needed to complain about it have a good day.
