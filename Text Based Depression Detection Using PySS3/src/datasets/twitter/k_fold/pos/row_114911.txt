Welp i feel angry My dad and iâ€™ve been arguing for awhile now and it really got bad today.
In prep-school iâ€™ve been 3rd out of 50 students(15-20 were really hardworking).But my phyisics,chemistry and biology were bad.I said that it was bad but my father said you are really trash more than anything.But i always try to look for bright side even though i know it was bad.He does not understand that I really donâ€™t want to be a job that i hate(but only job that gives good money is medical school)So i donâ€™t know what the hell do i do any tips ?
