Hey so I need some advice. So a little while back my English teacher assigned our class a paper about Gen Z slang. The assignment was to choose a word that I use and other people in my generation use and write about it. So I chose a word and wrote it but now my teacher is giving us a chance to rewrite. Since I didnâ€™t do too great on the first one, I rewrote it with a different word. This time, I chose a twitch emote (weirdchamp) and my English teacher reviewed. But after that, I thought of a funny idea. I thought that I can rewrite it again but using a different emote (Jebaited) (which means to trick). So heâ€™d think Iâ€™m writing about weirdchamp but Iâ€™m actually gonna turn in the paper about â€œJebaitedâ€, and itâ€™d be funny because that would be a Jebait. Iâ€™m very tempted to do it but Iâ€™m kind of nervous. Should I do it or not?
