OH MY FUCKING GOD WHY THE FUCK ARE MY PARENTS SO UNREASONABLE They scream at me for saying ONE WORD in a slightly angry accidental rude tone because they pissed me off in the first place and when my sister (who is 9 this year) whines / shrieks out stuff in an obvious rude and disrespectful tone they don't even say anything

They say that it's my she's this way because of me but at least I'm fucking trying to stop. I barely even do it but half the things that come out of her mouth are rude so I don't know why they're fucking picking on me when they almost never scold her instead

Idk why they're picking on me when there's clearly a bigger problem here. kinda feels like watching someone get hit by a car and breaking all the bones in their body and them complaining that their hair got messed up

Damn I can't wait to fucking move out
