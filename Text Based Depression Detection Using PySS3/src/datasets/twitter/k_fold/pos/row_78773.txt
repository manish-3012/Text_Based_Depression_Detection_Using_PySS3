One Year To This Today marks one year of me and my partners relationship. I texted him "Happy One Year Anniversary" and he only said "No" and blocked me on every social media page. I guess its over between us, I had immense feelings for him and I think he got tired of me and just ended it. Maybe if im lucky he wasn't in the mood for me and just blocked me, or maybe he just didn't love me anymore. It hurts, I learned that ending relationships hurt they, really hurt. I always knew it'll end but on any day But he decides today. I guess Ill move on to the next one. 


I never made a post like this so Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
