I just had to listen to 7 hours of TikToks during a sleepover because the only TikTok user there doesn't know headphones exist First time posting here 


The worst part is it was very loud and we couldn't even watch movies or play games in peace. He wouldn't stop and said that's what TikTok is for... I agree it's for annoying people that don't use the app.
