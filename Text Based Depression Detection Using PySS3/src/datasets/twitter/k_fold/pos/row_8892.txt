I'm so glad I said this So in English class we had a quick prompt to write about sterotypes, and if you agree that they're untrue. I wrote about how people always tell me how I'm good at math and assume I'm good at it (I'm not). Anyways when she asked if anyone wanted to share I did although I was nervous. I said something along the lines of "There's a sterotype that all Asian people are good at math, and that's just not true. People have assumed I'm good at math since I was little- and I'm not good at math at all" I said more but I don't really remember, and I'm glad I said something because if I didn't I knew I would regret it
