need to get this out i once again realized what a loner I am, at work i had a conversation with a girl for a while and it was the first real conversation (something longer than a few sentences) with someone my age in like more than a year. i got no friends and am always alone outside school. at first it didn't bother me now i wanna fckinfmg cry, i hate being alone, i feel like I'm caged in a weird way. i just can't really express how i feel. i hate my life for real
