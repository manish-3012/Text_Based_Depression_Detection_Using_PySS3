I CAME OUT TO MY DAD AND MY MOM AS TRANSGENDER AND THEY ACCEPTED ME! I also opened up to them about my depression which I've been struggling with for a long while, and they agreed to get me a therapist!!! 

I really thought they would hate me, I'm so happy!!!! My mom even asked me if I wanted to get a binder online, or if there was anything she could help with. Didn't change much for my brother tho- because we were always kinda 'bros'.

But then my alarm clock kinda rang and I woke up.
