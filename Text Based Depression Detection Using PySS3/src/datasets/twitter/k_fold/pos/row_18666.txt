So I caught feelings Basically I'm a 17 year old dude who did have some experience with girls already but never really caught feelings and well, it finally happened and I'm not going to lie, It's scary as shit to feel a new emotion. Idk, thought I'd share it here I guess

Oh and the girl I caught feelings for also has the same feeling towards me and I'm also her first person so ya I guess I'm just a lucky bastard
