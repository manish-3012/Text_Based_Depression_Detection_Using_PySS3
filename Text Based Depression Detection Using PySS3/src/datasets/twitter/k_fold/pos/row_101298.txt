I calculated how long the â€œSpotify 30 Minutesâ€ actually is. You know how Spotify Free constantly interrupts you with â€œWatch this short ad to get 30 minutes of ad free listeningâ€? 

I decided to test if this is was true with some hard data. From all 15 attempts that I did, the average time given (and slightly rounded) is actually around 9 minutes. 

Spotify needs to go back to preschool to learn how to count.
