My parents bought a FordðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ I have always told my parents how much I hate Ford trucks and how they feel so cheap and that Iâ€™m loyal to Chevrolet. Well, they dropped me off at my grandpas to work on my bass guitar and they come back with a Ford F-150. What really pisses me off is that they traded in our Chevrolet Colorado that my dad had promised to give me when I go to college. â€œWell, it was a great dealâ€ he said in defense. I donâ€™t care how great of a deal it was, you traded in my dream college car for my least favorite truck of all time. Even worse, it has a shell on the back and is used. I refused to ride in it on the way home. So how was youâ€™re day?
