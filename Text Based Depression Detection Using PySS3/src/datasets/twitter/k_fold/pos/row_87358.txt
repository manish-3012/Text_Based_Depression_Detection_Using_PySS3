I have a one-sided, distanced love with my best friend, and I'm okay with that. My friend (15f, let's call her Tanner) has been my best friend since kindergarten. When I was colle ting rocks and byrying my head in a book, she found rocks she'd think I like and got me a bookmark so I could keep my page to go and play with her. 

She has also always been a people-pleaser. 

Always flitting around with different friend groups, ignoring my concerns to get involved with their drama, doing anything and everything to get social attention. But I stay here, watching, knowing that she will always come back to me. 

Particularly Dec. 30th, we had been talking about having a sleepover because we hadn't seen eachother for two months. She said thaf she'd see about this weekend but she was "probably busy". 

I open up her snapchat only to find her hanging out with the friend group that has cheated and denied and talked shit about her again and again. I'm still glad she's having fun, but most people would feel hurt and betrayed. I don't, really. Why?

She's on an organt transplant list atm, has Lyme, is battling acne, has a 2-year long relationship with a guy she has had to keep secret, has specific cognitives disabilities that make her a difficult student to deal with at a terrible school, she's poor, her parents occasionally fight, and she's always treated how a middle child is. Obviously, she's just trying to chase good stimuli for she also has ADHD and bipolar disorder (sex, drugs, one-night friends, etc.), but what she needs is stability. I have to be that stability for her. 

How do I know she's not using me as a shoulder to lean on when she's abandoned? Because she gave me one first. 

Not sure what the point of this whole thing was, to be honest, I guess just to see yourself on someone else's shoes and be that supportive soul (okay, I'll see myself out.)
