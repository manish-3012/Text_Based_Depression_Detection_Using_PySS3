My dog has been attacked twice in a week My 2 year old Pitbull has been attacked twice this week, one of them was by two Golden Retrievers and the other one which happened this morning was by a German Shepherd. Both of these instances happened because of irresponsible dog owners who open their garage and their dog just runs outside without them noticing.


Stupid people shouldn't be allowed to have dogs. I dont hold it against the dogs but I do hold it against the owners.
