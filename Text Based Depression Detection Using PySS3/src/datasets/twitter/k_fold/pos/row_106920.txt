I just flew over 550 kilometres today, and now I sit drinking Chocolate Milk. Basically just flew north and landed at an airport in the middle of nowhere near some indigenous reserves. Runway had grass growing through it and the windsock was shredded. 

I probably should eat something honestly. Ive had 3 cross country flights in 3 days. 

College life for me I guess lol.
