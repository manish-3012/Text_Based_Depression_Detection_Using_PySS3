Iâ€™ve just realised how homophobic the people j surround myself actually are My parents are the worst by a long shot (long story and I might bother to make a post about it later today)

But my class mates also think I *have* to fit to the gay stereotype 

Iâ€™ve only got my sis and one friend who I can be completely honest with

Man my life sucks...
