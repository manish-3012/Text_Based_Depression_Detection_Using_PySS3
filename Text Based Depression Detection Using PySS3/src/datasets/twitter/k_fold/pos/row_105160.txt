Wisdom Teeth Recovery I got all 4 of wisdom teeth out almost a week ago and it sucks (even tho i canâ€™t suck O_o). Iâ€™m really nervous theyâ€™ll  get infected even though i clean the areas after meals(if you can call apple sauce and yogurt a meal). It sucks because they bruised a nerve during the procedure and i still havenâ€™t regained feeling of my bottom lip, bottom teeth, or chin. Itâ€™s getting better everyday but it is just very frustrating. 

From what i gather, getting your wisdom teeth out is a different experience for everyone. Took my older sister 3 weeks to fully recover. My older brother was eating burritos after 3 days. But any advice or other experiences would be nice to hear.
