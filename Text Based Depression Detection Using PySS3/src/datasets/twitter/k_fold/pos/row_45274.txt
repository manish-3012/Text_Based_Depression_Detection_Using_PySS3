Im getting my school results tomorrow, they dictate what college course I do and go to It is currently 5.45am in the morning, the results are officially out at 9am, i cannot sleep, I have an anxiety disorder and cannot stop thinking and spiraling about this, I'm so worried about the result. I have put down 3 options and I'm worried that I won't even get my 2nd option......
