My mom just bought two carts full of food supplies. My mother and I work for a school district. We recently got an email from the superintendent. It stated that the state may go into another stay at home order for One Week. We are buying for someone else so I'll cut her some slack but TWO carts full of food for one week. How the hell is that reasonable?
