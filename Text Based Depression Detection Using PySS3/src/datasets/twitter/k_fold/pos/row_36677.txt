I really want to drop out of school omfg It's a fucking nightmare for me to go to school Jesus christ. I know a lot of what the teachers teach because I can do shit for myself and so I do the work and have to sit there for an hour then go to the next class and repeat for 8 hours, all the while I have "friends" who I don't fucking like and teachers who are dickheads. I dicked around my first 2 years of hs and won't graduate this year. I wanna just drop out and get my GED so I don't have to keep going through this fucking cycle of bullshit
