Can yâ€˜all help me please? I want to send someone help and support on reddit because Iâ€˜ve seen a post of someone talking abt suicide

So I went on their profile, tapped on the three dots in the top right corner and went to "Send help and support" but the "Yes"-button that comes after that doesnâ€˜t work. It does nothing

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jxw6yh/haha_i_hate_myself/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) is the post. Maybe yâ€˜all can try to send them help too

And if you see someone who is depressed or suicidal, always send them help and be nice to them. I know how they are feeling and it helps when you give them the feeling that you understand them

Thank you guys for reading this and helping me with this :)
