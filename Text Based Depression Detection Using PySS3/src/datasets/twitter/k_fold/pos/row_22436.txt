For the first time in my life Iâ€™m pretty proud of myself I looked at my report book and realised i scored 47% overall score for my exams 2 years ago and i just received all my results today and saw that i got 72% overall, i know its nothing crazy but still though Iâ€™m really proud of my improvement



also Iâ€™m asian so you can imagine how pissed off my parents were when they saw my results
