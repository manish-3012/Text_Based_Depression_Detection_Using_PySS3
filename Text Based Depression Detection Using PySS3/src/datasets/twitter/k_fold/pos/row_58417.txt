I donâ€™t know what to title this but Iâ€™m annoyed My dad just went to my brothers room knocked and then proceeded to try to open the door just to ask why the door was locked. He didnâ€™t even wait a second after knocking to try opening the door. Also my brother didnâ€™t even say my dad could go into his room. At least he knocked because he used to just try to open the door.

Itâ€™s become a habit for me and my brother to just lock our doors. Heâ€™s starting to just knock more often but he does it more with my brother than me.

Also if he knocks he doesnâ€™t say anything. Heâ€™ll just wait for you to come to the door or tell him to come in. Rarely heâ€™ll say â€œIâ€™m not talking to a door.â€ But he hasnâ€™t said that in a while and just stays quite.

Once he got mad at me because he knocked while I had my headphones on and when I asked who was there because I wasnâ€™t sure if I heard a knock or if it was just my game. Then he got mad at me because I was ignoring him.

Heâ€™s getting better with me and sort of better with my brother. But I still feel bad about my brother because he has sound proof headphones he uses to game with and me and my mom always tell him that he is probably wearing them because my brother usually answers when heâ€™s not. But my dad still gets mad at him because he was ignoring him. Also for some context my brother is one floor up and my dad is yelling from the 1st floor. My room isnâ€™t that farther down the hall from my brothers and I barely hear my dad yelling up to us without headphones.

Well thatâ€™s pretty much it if you read the whole thing thanks and if you didnâ€™t I get it. Also sorry if the story was hard to follow Iâ€™m just annoyed.
