I think I'm bi. Actually idk. I just need advice. So... all my friends think I'm bi and have thought that since I started highschool (where I'm from we start at 11/12). I have an opposite gender partner, who I love. Um Idk I just remember thinking about how hot some people of the same gender as me are. Umm my friends say I act gayer than some of my actually gay friends. Overall I'm very confused and want advice from internet strangers because I dont wanna talk to my actual friends about this. Help me.
