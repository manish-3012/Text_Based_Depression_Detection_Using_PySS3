I might finally get to be independent! Later this month auditions are opening up for our stateâ€™s governorâ€™s school for the arts, where they do a bunch of artsy stuff like dance, drama, art, creative writing, etc. Whatâ€™s awesome about it is that itâ€™s basically like a mini college with dorms and a similar class structure. Itâ€™s about 2-3 hours away from home and thatâ€™s what really excites me. I get to meet new people, study writing (I wanna become a writer someday), but most importantly, I get to wear what I want. Iâ€™m Non-Binary and I LOVE skirts and fishnet stockings and Black Lipstick, but my grandparents would never let me wear them. My plan is to audition (hopefully get in), get a job, stay at the schoolâ€™s dorms, and save up money to be on my own! Whatâ€™s even better is that two of my friends are also gonna audition which means I might not be completely alone if I do get in! I know a lot of people probably wonâ€™t care for this post but Iâ€™m just really excited and nervous at the same time!
