my dad literally got hospitalized because of covid for a bit of backstory, at my sisters school a guy came to school after he got tested for covid. He tested positive and infected the entire grade including my sister. So since she had it she tried her best to self isolate but we all ended up getting it anyway. My dad had it worst, and could barely breathe so we called 911 and the paramedics were extremely unprofessional and told my dad to stay home and take Tylenol (which he had been and vomiting it up including food)  when he was struggling to even breathe. We had to force them to take him to the hospital and here we are now
