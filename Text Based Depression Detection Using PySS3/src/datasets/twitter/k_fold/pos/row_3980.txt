First thing I told a girl was that I would marry her So basically, a girl added me on snap from my friends story on my birthday. Her first name is the same as my last name so the first thing I said to her was â€œIâ€™m going to marry you and itâ€™ll be funnyâ€ 
 
Fast forward a few days and turns out sheâ€™s cute and fun to talk to. we talk every night and she calls me future husband 

So. Dub?
