I'm 5'4" at 15 and I can't stop thinking about it.  So a couple of months back I took an x-ray for my back and it said my spine is done growing.  My mom said not to worry my legs will still grow. It's been almost a year since I have last grown and like it's destroying me. I keep thinking it's my fault I'm not tall. Oh yeah just for reference my dad is 5'8" and my mom 5'2" and the last time my doctor checked I was going to be around 5'8" also. The reason why I keep thinking it's my fault is that I would constantly crack my back on vertical objects. I also was weightlifting while not knowing I had a small fracture in my pelvis.  Everyone keeps telling it's not my fault Christ i don't even get bulled for it. I just don't like be shorter than most kids at my school. I'm sorry if I come off as one of those self-diagnosed depressed teens. I don't want to be 5'4" for the rest of my life I just want to grow atleast two more inches. I'm not sure if I'll grow. I know it's mostly genetics and diet but something keeps telling me it's my fault help me.
