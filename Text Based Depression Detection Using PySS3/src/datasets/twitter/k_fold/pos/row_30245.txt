I just l o v e how my parents point out and joke about my abnormal behaviors But donâ€™t even consider the fact in their mind that maybe thereâ€™s something wrong. They also act like the things I do are out of nowhere and have nothing to do with the trauma Iâ€™ve been through. Istg some people are so blind its not even funny.
