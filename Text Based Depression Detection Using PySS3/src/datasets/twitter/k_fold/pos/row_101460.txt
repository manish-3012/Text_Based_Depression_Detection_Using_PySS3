Just a little message to you guys Alright so iâ€™ve seen a couple of posts saying that OP isnâ€™t â€˜livingâ€™ not in a dead way, but like, in terms of what youâ€™ve done as a teenager kinda thing.

I just wanna say that there is no typical teenage life, we all do a lot of the same stuff like school and changing ourselves and stuff like that. We also all do different stuff too, like go out with friends or buy things or find someone to be with.

Donâ€™t try to do everything and donâ€™t be sad when you donâ€™t do it, not everyone can do everything.

I for one have never gone on a roller coaster, iâ€™m just too scared to be totally honest, but i donâ€™t feel like i havenâ€™t â€˜livedâ€™ because of it, lots of other people have done it, but i havenâ€™t, and i donâ€™t really care that i havenâ€™t.

So donâ€™t beat yourself up over what you havenâ€™t done, if you wanna get something done, commit to it, itâ€™s not always easy, but youâ€™ve still got tons of your life ahead of you to get things done. itâ€™s no big deal if you donâ€™t do something, thereâ€™s still time, just donâ€™t let that drag you down.
