Uh idc if no one sees this but Iâ€™m fucking heartbroken So my crush of three years apparently has a girlfriend, which I learned right after I sent her a cover of Iris (goo goo dolls) and was met with a smile emote and her saying its her new favorite song. So I was really happy for about thirty mins until I texted my friend about it and she informed me that my crush has a gf. So Iâ€™m sorta numb rn but Iâ€™m gonna break down soon I bet. Anyone got advice?
