Why do Nintendo fans immediately make assumptions about you if you say you don't like Nintendo? Here's a few I've got.

&gt;"It's better than your FPS games." 

I'm more of an AARPG and platfotmer guy, I don't play many FPS games. 

&gt;"You just don't care for good gameplay." 

Because Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc isn't one of my favourite games because the gameplay is solid? Right. Because Mirror's Edge doesn't have good gameplay? pfff.

&gt;"He probably just wants lots of gore in his games. "nInTendo iS fOr kIdS""

Yep... Kingdom Hearts, Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, Rayman etc all gory af. Better make Spyro an 18 watch out kids.

Why is it hard for them to accept some people just aren't into Nintendo's first party line up? Could never get into any Mario game other than Sunshine. PokÃ©mon is good, but I wouldn't buy it constantly every year. I have Black 2 and Y. Then I got ORAS and thought "This is basically Y with a Hoenn skin." Played OoT, not for me. Got bored after 4 hours and haven't picked it up again.

Some people just don't like the games for no other reason than they're not appealing.
