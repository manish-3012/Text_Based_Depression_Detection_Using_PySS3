Boy, what are you doing you can text me one day and then stopped texting me the next day

you thanked me for being your friend even though it didn't work out but because you sent *that* message we started talking again and now no messages from you again?

bruh

i mean maybe you just want to see if i texted first, but you know i never do because i'm scared to reach out to you again or show you attention again after all the pain you caused me.
