I Can See You... I can see you,
staring out of your window, into your world.
I am with you, sharing the same doubt....


"When will we meet?", I wonder.
I'm sure you've asked the same.
When will we break this wall of reality,
and finally touch each other?


No barrier can block our friendship,
no chain can hold apart our unity.
Whatever the reality split does,
we will eventually traverse it,
and embrace each other.


For now, we have this portal,
where we catch glimpses of each other,
and where we both wonder,
when will we be one with each other...
