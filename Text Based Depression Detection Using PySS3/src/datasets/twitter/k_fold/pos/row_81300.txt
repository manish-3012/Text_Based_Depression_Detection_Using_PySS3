I finally told him I finally told my crush that I'm in live with him for over 2 years now.

He reacted quite nice and said we could stay friends and always be mate anyway. But now I'm just scared currently we have a 1 week holiday and I don't know what I should do when I see him in school again l. Can I even look in him direction. I mean I'm pretty sure he didn't even know I'm gay (it's an open secret though and a lot of ppl know)

So what I want to know guys, is there any advice you have for me or anything I should keep in mind that could happen? I'm just really scared
