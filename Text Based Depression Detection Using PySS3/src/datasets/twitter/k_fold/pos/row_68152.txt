Help with a Halloween costume (idk where else to post this) Hello!


So I have an idea for a Halloween costume, but I need help finalizing it.Â 


What it's going to be is a skeleton skull painted on the face and neck, a fedora with a small red stripe going around it with a rose on it.Â 


For the clothes I want the torso to be a red button-up shirt with a black/grey vest over that or a black button-up shirt with red suspenders on.Â 

For the arms, itÂ´s either red/white gloves or skeletal hand design on gloves or painted on.Â 

The legs will be black dress pants, no belt, and black dress shoes.


I am open to ideas of any kind and I personally am leaning towards the red button-up shirt with the vest and white gloves. The costume is meant to be fun and not exactly scary. If anyone reads this, thanks. Any help is amazing, and have a good night!!
