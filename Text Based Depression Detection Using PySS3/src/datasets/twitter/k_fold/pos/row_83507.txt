I havenâ€™t been on Reddit in a week... Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s going on:

1. Iâ€™m still as depressed as before (if not more)

2. Iâ€™m even more stressed than before

3. My mother is currently in the hospital 

4. My toxic father wants to go out to eat with me in two days (alone...)

5. Iâ€™ve been cooking, cleaning, not sleeping, doing school, and looking for colleges for the past month

6. Help ;-;
