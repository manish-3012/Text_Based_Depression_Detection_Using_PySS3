Dads up and gone Iv never been close w any of my famly and knew pretty much nothing about my dad but thought I would be more upset about it or even cry but I dont realy feel much about it. I guess i feel abit lonly, he wasnt a good influence and did some pretty evil shit but yha know I loved him. I just wish he was around to help me understand stuff better. I understand this isnt the most dramatic thing ever but it just feels very strange to experience.


Just wanted to tell someone people about this. I dont feel comfortable talking to my friends or mum about it even if it isnt much I'm tryna be more open so here it is
