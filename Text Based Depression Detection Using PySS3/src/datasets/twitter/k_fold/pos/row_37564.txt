Dear popular kids Some of you need to fucking stop â€˜hanging outâ€™ with us shy kids to seem like a good person and then spend the next few days flexing that you talked to the shy kid for 5 minutes. Seriously, were not blind and can tell that most the time you dont actually give a flying fuck about us. 

If you genuinely want to be nice to us dont go and spend the entire school day telling your friends what good a person you are cause you said hi to us once. 

(i dont know if this happens everywhere but it certainly does at my school)
