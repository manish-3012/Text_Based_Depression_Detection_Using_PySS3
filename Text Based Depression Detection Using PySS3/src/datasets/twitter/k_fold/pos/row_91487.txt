I had a wierd dream So last night I had a wierd dream. Almost forgot about it so I'mma just say it here so I don't forget. It was uncanny. I was a part of the cast in spongebob everyone, including Mr Krabs, squidward and the fish were normal. The only thing that changed was that Spongebob was hot. He was fking smouldering. He was just the right amount of ripped, had brown hair which flowed like the wind and his voice was manly but angelic. Slightly deep but he can sing opera. What the fuck is wrong with me? I'm not gay.. I think? No. Why can't my heart stop beating for that Spongebob? It's not even real. Fuck. Ugh. Someone help me please. I'm confused.
