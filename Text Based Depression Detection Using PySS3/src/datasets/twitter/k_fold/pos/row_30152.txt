Im the most indecisive teenager to ever live And it pains me to say it but i need help picking out christmas options to send to my mother so she knows what to get me. Im 17 male, play video games for the majority of my free time on the xbox one and am pretty mediocre at most of the games i have. Im also a metal head and i listen to classic rock (60's to 80's) too along with grunge like nirvana or alice in chains. I will consider every (serious) response and i want to keep it under $100 for any items. Thank you
