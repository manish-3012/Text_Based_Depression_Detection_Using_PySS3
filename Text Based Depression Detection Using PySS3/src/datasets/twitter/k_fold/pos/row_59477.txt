My psychology teacher said Iâ€™m wrong but Iâ€™m convinced Iâ€™m not I still believe Iâ€™m right but she said Iâ€™m wrong

Ok so thereâ€™s two studies she asked me about. One was a study which had kids shown someone be aggressive and because the majority of aggressive kids were the one who watched the aggressive person, I said the whole thing is situational, meaning the situation the kids were put in influenced their behaviour

For the other study it was a kids choice between two inhalers with one being â€˜betterâ€™. I said this was individual as the kids werenâ€™t told which one is better and yet almost all preferred the â€˜betterâ€™ one, because this was the kidsâ€™ decisions I said it wasnâ€™t situational

She said I was wrong, she said both studies could have the results just be coincidence

So why teach us this shit?? If the results are just coincidence then theyâ€™re useless, therefore our time is wasted!

Sorry if this post is confusing, I just want to know if Iâ€™m stupid or correct lol
