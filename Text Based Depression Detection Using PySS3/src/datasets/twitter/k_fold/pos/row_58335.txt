I donâ€™t like my friends Recently Iâ€™ve been finding that my friends are falling into 3 categories

1 - They are unmotivated, never reach out, only respond in one word answers all the time, and force me to carry the conversations. Most in this category have adopted depression as their personality and itâ€™s just boring being around them. 

2 - I have nothing in common with them, and am only friends with them because we went to / go to the same school. They arenâ€™t ideal friends or even any friends that I would want. The only reason I ever talked to them was to get through the day. Other than that, Iâ€™m happy being strangers. 

3 - Politically different. Not much to be said here. All they care about is echo chambering their political ideologies with one another to the point where their conversations are repetitive and just annoying. When I want to discuss something different or mildly disagree with them, Iâ€™m just excluded from the conversation and nearly kicked out of my own social circle. 

I just hate these dynamics so much and I donâ€™t want to be friends with any of these people anymore. I want to leave them in the past, but I have nowhere to go. All of this was highlighted by quarantine, but reflecting on this, itâ€™s always been this way, I just needed them more before. Now for once Iâ€™m stable enough to not rely on them, but at the same time, total social isolation right now seems like a bad idea. I donâ€™t know what to do.
