Ryan'sToysReviews isn't making anymore youtube money You know? The kid that somehow is still 4 years old and milks reviewing toys just for his parents' gain, making over 20 million fans jealous? Yeah most of those fans are 13 and have probably moved onto EvanTubeHD(surprising how his content isn't just reviewing toys anymore)

Oh, btw coppa got to him so now his videos aren't making any more money. Sucks for the parents but for Ryan nothing changed for him.

They also made a bootleg lego company so that's something.
