when people from ur â€˜online friend groupâ€™ who live in the same city as u meet ur irl friend group oh no  

I shouldve moved states to study and i mean that was the plan but i was too dumb and now im interconnected in this web of lies

Not really lies but i would reveal different versions of myself to different people 

plus the online group knows my nickname and idk if they rmbr my real name and they had me on fb/sc/discord but they were alt accs and now deleted, they dont know how i look, i like showed em 1 pic ages ago and dont have contact with them anymore

But like the irl group has mutuals/friends with my online group

But i go mia with all my socials/ restart with different users but my irl group contact me mainly via phone number 

my nickname is kinda unique irl and essentially both groups know my school/real name/nickname (if anyone from the online group rmbrs that is)

Heck i even go to the same uni as the online ones and some of em go to uni with my irl friends but different from my uni and are friends according to fb
