I need help with my crush, please, I dont know what to do Im scared that our friendship is ruined... some context: we're the same age, we always talk with eachother about sexual stuff, he knows I like him, I didnt send any nudes, we were both consenting and were not under the effect of anything(drugs, alcohol..), we're very close friends.

two days ago I sorta offered that he'll jerk off to my picture. he did and said it was great, but he felt a bit guilty, I reassured him it was fine, and told him if he felt bad we dont need to do something like this ever again.

yesterday, we decided to go further. we tried sexting, I told him what to do, etc. it felt weird, but oddly nice, it was first time for both of us doing such a thing. when we were done, we started to realize that maybe it was a bad decision...

at first we thought that we would be fwb, but when we were done, he started to feel guilt. said that he felt like he was using me, even though he really wasnt, that he didnt want it to ruin our friendship, and after a while, he realized that he was blinded by his urges, and regreted it.

I feel so guilty. I didnt force him to do anything, I made sure he was ok with everything, but stil, I know him, I should have realized he would regret it. I know how he wants to save stuff like this for a future girlfriend, why didnt I think about it when we did it?????

an hour and a half ago I asked him how is he doing and he hasnt responded yet. Im so scared. please if anyone ever experienced something like this, please give me any piece of advice. please I dont know what to do.
