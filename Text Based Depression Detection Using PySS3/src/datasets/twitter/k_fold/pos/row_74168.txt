United States of America: the country that has no name When you think about any country, all of them have interesting and original names, like China, France, Belice, Colombia. But thereâ€™re two countries that donâ€™t follow that rule: South Africa and USA

The first one is very easy to understand and justify, since Africa isnâ€™t divided in north and south, it isnâ€™t confusing if someone says â€œwhere is south africa?â€ 

But USA. Oh boy. Why did they choose a very lazy name? All countries are US if we are honest. All countries are the union of different states or provinces in a specific continent. With that logic, EVERY american country is USA. 

Huh, and now you are with doubts. Bc their denomyn is the same as the continent name and the denomyn of any person who lives in America as a continent. 

Its like saying â€œhey, I am an Earthlingâ€. Yeah, we all live in the Earth so we are all earthlings, even if your country is called United Floors of the Earth

I feel its pretty vague and also degrading for all american people who arenâ€™t Americans but they actually live in the continent. 

In Spanish, so we donâ€™t confuse the therm â€œameriacoâ€ (american) with their denomyn, we use â€œestadounidenseâ€, which is also a problem, bc any person in the world is â€œestadounidenseâ€ becouse every country has a lot of states untied.
