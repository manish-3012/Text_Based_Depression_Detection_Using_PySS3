Whatâ€™s your traumatizing High-school experience? I am welcoming dumping trauma here. Pretty much the only friend I had after one of my friends attempted suicide and became paralyzed, also attempted suicide, and killed himself. I then went to his funeral, and went to school immediately after and listened to people make jokes about him for weeks. This isnâ€™t a pity party for me though, please tell me your stories.
