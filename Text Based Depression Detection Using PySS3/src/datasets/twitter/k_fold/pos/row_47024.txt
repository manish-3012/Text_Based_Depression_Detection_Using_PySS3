I hate my voice Everyone says that girls like deep voices which is great cause my voice is usually really deep, but the second I try talking to a girl my voice gets super high and I sound like a little girl 

I know itâ€™s probably just puberty shit but itâ€™s really annoying, I wish I could just use my actual voice around people I like for once
