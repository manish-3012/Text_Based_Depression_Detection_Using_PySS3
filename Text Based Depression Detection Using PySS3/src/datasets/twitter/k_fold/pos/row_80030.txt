Thinking about my old school makes me grateful for online schooling (and me moving) Sometimes I will think about the past and my school and I want to cry wondering how I genuinely didnt commit suicide. I have been bullied by kids, teachers, the fucking principal etc etc, its stupid looking back. Like I remember a time when I was punched by a kid on the bus so I reported it to the principal AND I GOT SUSPENDED FOR A WEEK. I was given detentions for weeks on end for literally no reason. I was bullied in the changing rooms for agian no reason... Every once in a while I will sit and think about that school. I'm so glad that all this quarantine stuff happened and I'm even happier that I had moved away. Over the past 8 months I have went from a sad mess that had nowhere to go to possibly the happiest i have been sense I went into that school in 2017. 2020 has been my best year so far and I believe it can only get brighter.
