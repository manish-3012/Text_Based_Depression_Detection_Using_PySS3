laying in bed listening to music being sad but have a lot of homework to do :â€™) iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a clear answer but why does sadness seem to be the most common, prevalent and/or strongest emotion? like itâ€™s a lot easier to be negative/sad than positive/happy... and i feel like a majority of the time i, as well as others, are sad about *something*.

i have a paper due on monday (itâ€™s currently saturday evening) and iâ€™m going to be busy tomorrow. idk if iâ€™ll even be able to work on it. i havenâ€™t started the paper and it seems like it will be easy, but i work slow and itâ€™s probably going to take me a while. being a slow working, procrastinating perfectionist is a horrible trio.
i also have two other minuscule things to do but theyâ€™re not as important and will get done.
