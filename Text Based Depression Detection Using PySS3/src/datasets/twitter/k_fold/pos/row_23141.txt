Emergency situation here!! (New Zealanders Needed) Is there anyone from New Zealand who can call the emergency services for our friend? Sheâ€™s trying to kill herself. We arenâ€™t in the same country as her so we canâ€™t do much.
Iâ€™ll list some info that you might want to use:

Her username is so-soviets
Her name may be Avery, although that is unconfirmed 
She has a friend called Brooke
Her parents are divorced
She has attempted 27 times so far to kill herself
She has a bad history of counselling and doesnâ€™t like it
She has sudden outbursts

Use this information and see if some database has some logs on her. Please save her.
