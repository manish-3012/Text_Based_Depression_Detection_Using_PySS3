I think my middle school promotes gambling When I was in middle school, we always had in-school parties a few times a year. Within these parties, there were your average activities and games such as Dancing, Food, and basketball. The one thing that middle school parties are not know for is playing black jack and poker. While we were not gambling real money, if anyone who played one of these card games might get hooked and possibly have a gambling addiction when they are older. Itâ€™s not like we were playing a laid back version of these games either, the dealers knew what they were doing and were strict with the rules.
