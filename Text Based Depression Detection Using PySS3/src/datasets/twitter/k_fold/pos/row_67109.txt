confidence is confusing Can you be confident and still be honest about all your flaws? People who are all like â€œIâ€™m perfect and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with meâ€ give me bad vibes. You canâ€™t improve if you donâ€™t acknowledge that thereâ€™s something wrong with you and youâ€™ll be stuck in the same place forever since you think youâ€™re perfect. Maybe what Iâ€™m talking about is overconfidence. I see way too many people saying â€œIâ€™m perfect just the way I amâ€ and Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s a good thing. You donâ€™t wanna be that person constantly criticizing yourself but I feel like itâ€™s just wrong to think youâ€™re the best when youâ€™re not.
