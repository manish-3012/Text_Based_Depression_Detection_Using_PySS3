Do parents not understand the difference between joking and bullying? My mom was "joking" that I don't like to play sports and go outside and my dad added on and said that if it were another kid he would go on a jog every morning and "stay healthy" and not understand that people can like something other than sports. I told them angrily I found their "joke" offensive and I kid you not, they said, "don't you understand a joke? You've gotta take things more sportingly son."
