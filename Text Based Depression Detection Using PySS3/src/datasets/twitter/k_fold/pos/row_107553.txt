Feel down and I don't know who I should tell so I let it out here I'm just down right now, I fuck up everything in school, my cousin (about the same age) has a girlfriend now and is constantly flexing with it and telling me that I never get one. Teh only thing that made me happy in the last days is watching jojos.

And 5 minutes earlyer I found out the cat of my uncle has some sort of aids, and he just started to like me and run away if he sees me.

I know people have bigger problems and I dotn ahev depression or suicide thoughts but I just wantet to tell anyone because I dotn really have a person in irl I can talk too
