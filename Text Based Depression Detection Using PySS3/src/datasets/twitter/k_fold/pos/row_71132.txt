My hamster escaped :( My hamster escaped her cage while I was at my dads, and now my mom says that if I canâ€™t find her I have to get rid of my other one too. I understand taking responsibility but it wasnâ€™t my fault. I know that sounds childish but she literally chewed a hole into her cage, and escaped. Moms not exactly the best source of emotional support right now. Or ever. I want to move to my dads but he canâ€™t take care of me. Heâ€™s always in a financial spiral, and never has time to actually be home, so until mom gets home in tearing the house apart looking for my hamster so I donâ€™t have to get rid of the other one.
