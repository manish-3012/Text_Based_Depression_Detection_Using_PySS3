My friends ditched me the last day I could see them to feed rats Covid restrictions have gone up where I live so when I decide to move heaven and earth to meet up with my two friends (the two straightest guys in the group who are obviously in love with eachother), they ditch me to feed rats.

I need to take a look at my life choices.
