Tremendous value from listening to conservative podcasts I am very progressive and almost exclusively listen to people with similar politics. Recently, I listened to a podcast between JP and Jocko Willink. I feel like I just discovered the other half of our planet. There is so much wisdom to be found on the other side, when there is an incentive to be authentic. 

Listening to Bernie Sanders on Joe Roegan completely changed my perception of Bernieâ€™s idea of socialism. And it was due to the fact that there were no pressures to be inauthentic. 

If humanity is to rise above its fate, we need to be more curious about one another, and stay away from environments that reward deceitfulness. 

Give it a try, just be curious, even to people harboring the worst of ideas. Maybe weâ€™ll find that our goals arenâ€™t so misaligned.
