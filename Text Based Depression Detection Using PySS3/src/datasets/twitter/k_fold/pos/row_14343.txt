Pray for me, I have an Ip meeting today Today I have an Ip meeting with all of my teachers and my mom would have to be on there and, I have literally done nothing in some classes since I failed them cause of online learning. My Mom is gonna k- I mean make me unistall life when she finds out. But she kinda already knows but today we already some arguments so I'm legit kinda scared on her reaction.  So wish me luck (and no she won't actually kill me or abuse me)
