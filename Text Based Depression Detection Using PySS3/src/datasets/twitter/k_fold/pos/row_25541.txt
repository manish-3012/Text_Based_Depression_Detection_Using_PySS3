I am so fucking tired of these "vegan animal rights activists" I'm not allowed to be upset about any animal abuse without some one coming out the wood works and saying that I'm a hypocrite because I'm not a vegan.


 I'm allowed to be upset about a dog being mauled to death ffs.
Leave me the fuck alone and let me express human emotions after seeing an animal being fucking abused,dont guilt trip me it's not gonna help your cause
