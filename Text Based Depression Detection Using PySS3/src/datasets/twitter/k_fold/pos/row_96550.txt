I broke my femur On friday of last week I broke my femur skateboarding and lete tell you, it sucked. Every time I moved my leg, my muscles spasmed. The doctor said it was like giving birth without pain meds. The first couple of nights I kept doing that thing when you are trying to fall asleep and then it feels like you are falling. That tenses all your muscles so that hurt a lot. Right now I'm at home in recovery but I don't know what to do. I can't really move for the time being and am stuck in one place. Does anyone have any advice on what to do? It really sucks not being able to move my leg and it's starting to affect my mental health too, not just my physical health. Of anyone has advice it is very much appreciated.
