Can you guys make a list of good games that are for free on Steam/Epic Games Store or anything? My parents don't buy me video games because it is a waste of money and I would spend more time on it. I have a laptop that can support most of the games, so I think I can play a few games in it. Please help me, I'm losing my mind being locked in COVID.
