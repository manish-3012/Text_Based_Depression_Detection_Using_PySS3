Someone please help me (rant mostly but still this is really fucking with me) 
So I (18M) was away for Valentineâ€™s Day and am still currently away and my gf (17F) got drunk with friends back home which is fine. There plan (which I fucking hated to start off with) was to dress up as there exâ€™s and make power-points about why they sucked. My gfs was about her manipulative ex who made her do shit she was really uncomfortable with. It was going fine I was getting funny drunk snaps but then one of her friends starts talking about the rice purity test. I found out her score is 52 and mostly cause of jackass (her ex). After I found out Itâ€™s just been fucking with me and I donâ€™t know why. I have a 75 or something of that nature which may be why but like why is this fucking with me. It shouldnâ€™t matter but it really does to me. I texted her goodnight and havenâ€™t really spoken to her since. She asked if something was wrong I just said Iâ€™m tired. I really donâ€™t know what to do here and I know this is a stupid problem but itâ€™s really messing with my head. She hasnâ€™t really said so much about her ex cause she hates his guts which is totally fine and itâ€™s her right to but I really wish I didnâ€™t find out this way and that she had just spoken to me about it
