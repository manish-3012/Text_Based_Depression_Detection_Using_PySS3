I think I am way too thirsty than is normal but idk what the normal amount of desperate is. I've been doing meditation for a while now and in the way I'm doing it you have to visualize a natural setting after 5-10 minutes of focusing all of your attention on your breathing. After you are done focusing on your breathing, you focus all of your senses on every sense except sight. Finally you can open your eyes and if feels almost like you've transported somewhere else. Anyways, I've become quite good at this so now when I daydream, they are very vivid. The things I daydream about though are the best and most unlikely situations to ever happen. I just met some girl on a hike today. I only heard her say about 10 words and none of them were directed to me but still I visualize us together. For some reason I also try and block out certain thoughts as it feels like someone might "hear" me or something. Idk how but I get paranoid whenever I think of being with someone. I barely know the person yet I still imagine us holding hands. I dragged this on for way to long so just answer me this: Am I too thirsty and desperate?
