What do i even do So basically in school i feel nobody wants me and that everyone hates me, there is 22 kids in my class and only 2 are good and loyal friends, i feel like i dont wanna give up and atleast try to prove them wrong and to get me a chance but im not bothered, i have been back stabbed enough by these tremendous tiktok obsessed rats and i really wanna go further but at the same time i dont i feel weak, i dont wanna go but i also wanna confront them and show who i really am, this song describes how i feel pretty well without me using my shittyass voice https://youtu.be/50C7Sf0hcJQ  and the teachers do nothing its been the same since 1st grade and i cant let go of opportunities but at the same time om not bothered because of dumbasses trying to ruin my day
