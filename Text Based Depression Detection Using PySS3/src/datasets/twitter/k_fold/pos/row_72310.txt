am i being toxic if i get annoyed when my friends flirt with my crush? one of them knows that I like him, the other one doesnâ€™t. iâ€™m too afraid to tell the other one as I donâ€™t trust them enough. 

it sucks- he likes another girl. I feel like I technically canâ€™t get annoyed at my friends liking/flirting with him too, but i just feel like itâ€™s kind of disrespectful? if they know, ofc. 

I just hate it when the other friend does it, I just feel like she wouldnâ€™t keep it a secret. she always touches him and makes dirty jokes around him and omfg it never stops. 

what do i do? am I allowed to feel annoyed?
