Weeding is pain. I'm weeding my neighbor's flower bed for a (generous) $60. It's a rose garden with ants that I'm allergic to and Johnson grass. About 3 hours ina nutshell, I've been sliced, poked, and biten to the point of no return. I'm not complaining or anything, haha.

Yeehaw! 

How was y'all's Monday?
