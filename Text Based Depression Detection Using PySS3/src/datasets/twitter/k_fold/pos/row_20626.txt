Little do my friends know that they are the only reason why I haven't killed myself Every single day I'm being yelled at by my mom or my dad for some reason, and it drives me to the point where I want to kill myself. But then I remember "wait it's my friend's birthday tomorrow, I gotta live to see that" or "what would happen to my friends if I do kill myself." They listen to my problems and they find ways to help me. They are the only reason why I'm happy. They are the only reason why I can stand my parents. 

Thanks to my friends I've found ways to cope with what I am feeling. They might never know how grateful I am for them. 

I am proud to say that I am 1-week self-harm free. I am proud to say that I will live to see tomorrow and the next day after that. I love my friends so much. They make my life bearable. I hope that they feel the same way about me too. (Not the suicidal part, but I hope I help them when they are feeling depressed :) )
