Sorry for no Room Renovation Update We are currently still painting the Walls and we are gonna build the Furniture tomorrow, so that will take a bit of Time. 

I promise to get the Pictures uf the 2nd Update and the one that is supposed to be today on Monday.

These Updates won't be a daily thing, due to the Fact that renovating a Room takes a lot of Time.
