Idk how to exactly respond to this So basically, I was texting my crush right?  Anyways i was talking about how i didnâ€™t know half of the classeâ€™s crushs.  At one point this was her response in the middle of one of the messages: â€œI donâ€™t like anybody becuase noâ€. I canâ€™t tell which way to take this.  My friend said she could be lieing to ya know make a cover up, but idk.  When I read that part of it i kinda felt like i was dead for a second.  Me and her have been really good friends for many years and maybe itâ€™ll just stay like that.  I canâ€™t control all of the world.
