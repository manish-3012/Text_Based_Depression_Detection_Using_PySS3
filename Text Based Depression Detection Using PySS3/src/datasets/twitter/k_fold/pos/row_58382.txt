Can you guys chill out I recently posted a meme on r/meme and it turns out it was a repost. I didnâ€™t know I simply got sent a meme on Instagram from my friend and thought Iâ€™d share it, yet then I got harassed by multiple people simply because they saw it already. I even explained it in the comments but I still ended up deleting because everyone was being an ass hole in the comments and I even got some messages. Like just chill out.


PS: I decided to rant here as I feel like this is a community who would listen and understand my problem so donâ€™t take it as me targeting any of you guys
