"hahahah oh sorry, im just laughing, because isnt it funny that in the 1960s the CIA proposed a series of false flag attacks Against civilians, these acts including staged acts of terror against the American public. This was known as operation Northwoods. It was an attempt to justify a war with Cuba. Which was only shot down by JFK himself. And it was only a few years later that the gulf of Tonkin incident would occur starting the war in Vietnam. Now aint that a rib tickler?"
