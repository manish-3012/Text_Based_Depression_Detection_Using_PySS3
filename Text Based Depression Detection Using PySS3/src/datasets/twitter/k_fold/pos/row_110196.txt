Please appreciate when your family cooks healthy meals I'm pretty sure my step mom secretly hated cooking, so she always made sure to make some sort of frozen or pre-prepared food. I cannot stomach storebought frozen chicken anymore. I can actually identify tyson chicken nuggets by taste and smell, they're so gross. I'd go vegan before I ate tyson chicken again.

I eat good now tho, don't worry.
