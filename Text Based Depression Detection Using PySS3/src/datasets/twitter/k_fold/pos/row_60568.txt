I get socially worn out very quickly So I went downstairs to see my sister was playing on the Wii, so I decided to chill downstairs, comment on the game and just chill. She started a discord call with some of her friends and we were all just chilling. After like an hour I was kinda tired of it. We were having a good time and I was laughing a lot, but idk. I feel like my idk want to call it â€œsocial batteryâ€ gets worn out quicker than average.
