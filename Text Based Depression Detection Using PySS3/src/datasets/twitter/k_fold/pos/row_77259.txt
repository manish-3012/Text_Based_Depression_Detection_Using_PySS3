I hate everything Itâ€™s my birthday today and I just feel empty. I have be moving everywhere my entire life I have no place to call home every night I canâ€™t sleep because I have to confront my sins and see the ones Once loved dead hanging from the ceiling. This year my sanity has been rapidly spiraling out of control and I canâ€™t take it anymore. Last year on this very day I tried to hang myself. I wish I would of succeeded I donâ€™t feel like living in this world anymore
