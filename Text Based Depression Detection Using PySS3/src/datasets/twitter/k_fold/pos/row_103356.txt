Anybody know where I can find the original "doot doot" model? In the spirit of Spooktober, I wanted to take the original "doot doot" video and re-render it using more modern technology (essentially turning RTX on). Problem is, I don't know where to find the original character models. Is there a way to get them? Or will I just have to recreate it from scratch?
