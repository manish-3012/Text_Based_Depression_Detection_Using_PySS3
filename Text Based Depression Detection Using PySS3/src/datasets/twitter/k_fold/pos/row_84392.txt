Why do Americans poke fun at the UK for having a monarch, but never say shit about Spain, Sweden, Norway, Greenland etc? It's like they think we're the only country that still has a monarchy. Why are we the primary target on ribs for having a monarchy? Is it because Lizzy the second is seemingly immortal? There's are least 7 (I only know 7 that do) other countries that still have a monarchy.
