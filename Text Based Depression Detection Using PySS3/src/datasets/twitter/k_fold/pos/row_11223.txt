im going to post this on facebook for my entire family to see :'D  

Ever since I was little I have been discouraged for sharing my emotions. Every time I opened up about my feelings I have been laughed at or told to â€œMan upâ€ if I talked about my feelings. So at the age of 11 I started to suppress my emotions, I thought I was tough by doing so. I thought I was controlling them. It felt weird at first but slowly got easier and easier to do. And by the age of 12 I started to feel empty and hollow inside, and it got worse as I aged. At 13 I felt awful but I thought it was normal because it was what I was used to.  


I was also told from a very young age that being gay is wrong. Which I never agreed with, I felt that all people should get treated with equal respect and it made me sad when people were mean to gay people. And I thought I was just a supporter of them for a very long time until I was 13, I started to think I might be bisexual but I got scared by that because of what people thought of them and pushed it down as I did with everything else. Those feelings stayed dormant until June 1st, 2020.  
I woke up from a dream where I was bisexual, Nobody was telling me I was bisexual and I wasnâ€™t doing anything that hinted towards me being bisexual, I just knew that I was. And so I decided to search up help for it, help to see if this is just teenage hormones or the real thing. I started to read up on different things in the LGBTQ+ community, the terms, the people, the history. It all made so much sense reading it. It felt like a part of my body was becoming whole once I found a part of myself.  
But I was wrong, Iâ€™m not bisexual. I found out that there are more than 2 genders, fascinated by this concept I kept reading. 20 or so days later I came to the conclusion that Iâ€™m pansexual.  
In simple terms, I have no preference for who I am attracted to or who I date. It doesnâ€™t matter if they are a girl, a guy, or any other gender.  
And for the second part of this coming out,  
Ever since I finished puberty I hated every inch of my body. I kept growing taller and taller and people kept praising me and I just had to go along with it or they would ask questions on why. I hated my voice, I hated whenever people tried to impersonate my voice by lowering theirs, it felt like they were mocking me. It reminded me of what I hated about myself. I felt gross when people talked about my masculine features, my mustache, my leg hair, my voice, my height. I just wanted to go back to whenever I wasnâ€™t this hairy ape.   
And reading about the different genders made everything make more sense, I was experiencing dysphoria.  
And nobody cared. I tried opening up about my discomfort with my leg hair to my dad once before even knowing I was dysphoric. I told him that I hated my leg hair and it grossed me out. He told me that I will get used to it, and I believed him.   
Nope, every time I see my facial hair or my leg hair I feel like Iâ€™m going to throw up, I cover my legs with jeans to hide them and it works but every time I dont have jeans on and I look at them it feels worse and worse for me every time.  
So Iâ€™m not going to prolong this any longer.  
Iâ€™m Transgender.
