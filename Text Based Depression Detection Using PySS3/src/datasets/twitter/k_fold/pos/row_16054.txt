I just want to aDRESS something Lately it has become a trend, where girls (and guys) are posting selfies of themselves in outfits that make them feel like they look good. They certainly look nice in these outfits (guys too), but when you look at the comment section I don't really like it. We have people who compliment and reassure them and then the complete opposite way down at the bottom with like 30 downvotes. What I have a problem with really are these same repeated "rip ur dms" or "get ready for the simps" like come on we get it. They don't need to be spammed with something they are more than well aware of. Its definetly more annoying for them the fact the basically 80% of the comments say the same thing about their dms and they completely ignore the post. Like bruh say something about the dress/skirt(/butterknife the jokes about these simps in the DMs are way too overused and monotonous. Heck the original posters even say that they have none in their dms. They don't need to be reminded, they can deal with those losers easily anyway, they're way more resilient and stronger than guys in that sense. So please shut up about the simps and the dms, Just appreciate their post, appreciate their dress/skirt or butterknife skills. And please downvote me to hell if I'm wrong but this is what I believe.
