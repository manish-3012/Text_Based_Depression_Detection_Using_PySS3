We need to have hope for our countries and our own futures People seem so down in america with RBG dying and everyone says they want to leave the country. Like 99% of reddit users are pretty well off compared to the global average... we all have internet access.

We canâ€™t just give up we have to be the future, we have to be the change. 

Also have some faith in our government Us History has countless periods where weâ€™ve been in worse spots... the civil war, early 1900â€™s with political machines running everything, 1960â€™s with civil rights movement. We can repair our nation, the orange man getting re-elected wonâ€™t be the end of the world.
