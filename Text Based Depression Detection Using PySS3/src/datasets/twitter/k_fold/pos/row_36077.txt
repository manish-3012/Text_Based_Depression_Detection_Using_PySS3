Struggling hard. I'm 17 years old and ive never made friends in high school or a lot in general. I had two in elementary but i always specialized in talking to a girl. I speculate that its because i feel like i come off as attractive or could and when she does say she like that i feel like I won't be judged and i still have to hide some things because I don't wanna upset her at all, im scared to. I always found that im too nervous to be myself around friends, not exactly that but you can tell im awkward and uncomfortable in my own skin.


I found a dream girl who could roll and liked the same music and was real and bad bitch good lookin but idk. We found out we was related and they still my favorite person to talk to and be real with but the tension isnt there. They told me tho that they was talking and flirting with someone and it made me sad a bit and idk why. It feels weird. But i also have this worry that i won't ever find a girl who'll be like how i want her and real as i want her in my town.

Theres this girl and we dated before but the distance is too much and we cant satisfy each others needs.

I feel so sad dudes and i feel so lonely but i'm trying my best to enjoy myself.

I really f#cking wanna go meet and talk to new people, especially girls but idk how the f#ck id message them or what id say.

I need help but i don't know where to go or who to talk to. I feel so alone.
