I've been ruining my hair due to my anxiety... For quite a while my mental health has been worsening, and a thing that I have been doing recently is actually pulling on knots in my hair, this has caused me to pull out hair. After doing this for months my hairline has receded and my hair has lost a lot of it's "fluff". Before this I didn't like my hair cuz it was annoying, now I've been extra self conscious because it's flat and stringier... Idk what the point of this post is, if you have any advice I would love it, but if not I guess I just kinda needed to get it out there, it's been weighing on me quite a bit...
