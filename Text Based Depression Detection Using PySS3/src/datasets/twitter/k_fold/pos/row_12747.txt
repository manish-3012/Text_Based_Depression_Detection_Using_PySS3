The super straight thingy doesn't make any sense The LGBT+ community is supost to be a safe place for people that dont follow the cishet norm. Its a group made out of a bunch of smaller groups for safety. I dont understand how the super straight thingy could be apart of it. It just follows the cishet norm even more. Plus its transphobic. Not liking someone because of genital preference is ok. But not liking someone because they are Trans or tying to push Trans people out of the community even though they 100% belong there is.
