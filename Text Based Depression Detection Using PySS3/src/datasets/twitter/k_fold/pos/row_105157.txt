Today was the worst day of school ever for me There are only four girls in my grade (private school). So my best friend has been out sick all week, so I have been hanging out with the two other girls in my grade. (Imma call them Emma and jade for privacy reasons) So I have hanging out with Emma all week because she's nice to me. While Jade on the other hand is not so much, she's very sarcastic and has strong opinions. I am a relatively sensitive person, I wear my heart on my sleeve. So Emma left early today, I was upset about this because I was looking forward to eating lunch with her. And then during Spanish class we were playing Pictionary, Jade had gotten to draw the past two weeks, so I asked if I could and she said no, AND THEN PROCEEDED TO LET ANOTHER STUDENT DRAW EVEN THO I ASKED FIRST. Jade has been very rude to me all week so this was my breaking point. I sat alone at lunch and almost started bawling in the bathroom while texting my mom. I just wanna get this off my chest because it really hurt me/made me angry.
