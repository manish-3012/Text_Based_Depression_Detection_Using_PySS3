My friend is annoying me pls help me So like the title says me friend is annoying me but to be more clear. He just ignores the covid 19 guidelines. But thats not the worst part. He fake or real coughs at me touches me and sometimes removes his mask even tho we have to put them on.(we have some breaks where we can't talk tho)  And when I tell him to stop he just laughs and continues. This all happens in school. I sit beside him. Pls some one tell me what to do
