Thieves just sieged a neibour city. Well, I live in Brasil and crime and things like this are crazy rn. A few weeks ago we had a big Bank robery (they used explosives and everything) and yesterday a gang closed the entry to a neighbour city of mine with a truck and set it on fire. After that they proceded to rob the bank treasury. They also spreaded loads of bombs trought the city and closed of the police department.

Also a few days ago they found a few scape cars hidden in my city. I am kind of scared.

Also my state always was one, if not the state with the lowest crime rate, so it is not like things like this are usual or heard of here.
