I can graduate debt free! I just heard back from my second choice college about finances. While tuition, room and board, etc. usually costs $71k, I got various scholarships and grants (all renewable), that total to 62k per year! that means I'm only going to owe 9k a year for college! I know that's still a lot, but I've been working my butt off to save for college and I already have the first year's tuition saved up!
