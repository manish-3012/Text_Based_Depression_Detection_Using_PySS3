Yoooo bet So this girl said she used to like me and stopped liking me when I sort of rejected her, so then she said that she didnâ€™t like me anymore once a while after she was told that, and so I told her that I kind of liked her around that same time period but didnâ€™t realize that I liked her because I liked someone else, and sort of stopped liking her around the time she told me she didnâ€™t like me, but plot twist she was lying to me and turns out she still does and I basically exposed myself on the spot and now I donâ€™t know what to do ðŸ˜Ž
