Can we stop putting politics in kids shows? I just wanna see Bugs Bunny smash Elmer Fudd with a mallot is that too much to ask?

I don't want to see OK KO talk about gun control.

I don't want to see Gumball mock Trump.

I just want to see Classic Slapstick between Sylvester and Tweety.

I just want to see Wile E Coyote get crushed by a boulder.

I don't want to see cartoons being a way to get the writers political views out to millions.

I just want entertainment.
