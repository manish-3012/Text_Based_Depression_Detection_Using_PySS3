Things I find hot in a boy (because itâ€™s trendy now) When heâ€™s nice and caring. Not just towards me but like when heâ€™s generally caring

When he smells nice and takes care of himself

Cuddles ðŸ¥° 

When heâ€™s tall 

A mysterious kinda aesthetic but not creepy but still with things to discovering

When he asks me whatâ€™s wrong if something is wrong and also when he shows emotions himself

He doesnâ€™t act different around people

Open minded and caring for the environment and stuff 

And like when he just got that chill vibe that you feel safe and protected around him â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸
