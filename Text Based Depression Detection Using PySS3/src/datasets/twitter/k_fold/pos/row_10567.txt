Was talking to my friend about gun laws and he said "i don't care if gun rights are taken away, the constitution is just a piece of paper" Yeah, we were discussing how gun rights are important, i said if gun rights are taken away other rights can be, and he said "i really wouldn't care, in the end the con is just a piece of paper, plus it was written back in a time of muskets which means ite outdated."

Whats this world coming too
