Be honest, not based on popular opinion, what is the best Pixar movie? People keep saying UP because of its first 5 minutes. Personally if I was watching transformers and the first FIVE MINUTES was good and the rest was booty, I wouldnâ€™t like it. Up is great, but not the best. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE IS MONSTERS UNIVERSITY OR CARS/CARS 3
