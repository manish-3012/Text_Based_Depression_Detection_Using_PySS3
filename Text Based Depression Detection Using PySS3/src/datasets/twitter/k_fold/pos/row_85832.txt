I need advice But I put this under rant because its a Emotional disaster Bonjour fellow Teens, yep thats an introduction 
So I have an issue and maybe this should be under relationship but whatever. 

It all started with a joke my friend made Shipping me with this guy. 

I said- 

"you know im influenced really easily and if you keep Joking about me being with ____ then im gonna actually start wanting that." 

and she said something along the lines of- 

"that would be hilarious and so I will continue."      

so she did. we have a fucking ship name. I hate it but, I actually like him now so, 
*peer pressure kids!* 

I dont know what to do because He said something to me a while ago that made me upset and sticks with me and he jokes about mental health cause thats how our friend group is and it hurts me but for some reason I still think about him. 

At this point im shaking while writing this because I do not know what to do and he probably doesnt like me because i look like shit and i dont want anyone to see this that i know. 

any advice would be really helpful and you know im serious because I used fucking punctuation in this.
