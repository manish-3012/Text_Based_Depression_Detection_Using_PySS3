Heres a little message to you guys before the US election tommorow I see people who are freaking out way too much at the though of the candidate they dont support winning. People say if blank candidate wins im gonna spend all day alone crying, or that they are gonna be depressed if blank candidate wins. Let me tell you something I think a lot of people dont realize. While yes the election is important, no matter who wins, its not gonna change your life as much as you think. Heres a little mind experiment. Imagine that tomorrow went by and you had no idea who won, and even had no idea who was running. If you had no idea who was president, how much do you think your life would legitimately change if one candidate won over the other. Maybe a little bit, but Its probably not a whole lot. Its mostly mental because the media tries telling us that this election is the most important of all time. At the end of the day though, dont stress. They are only gonna be in office for four years. Also something you need to realize is that throughout your life, there are gonna be several times where the candidate you dont support wins. Instead of being all sad and depressed, the best thing to do is try to forget about it all together because at the end of the day, no matter who wins your life isnt gonna be drastically different. This is why we have the constitution so that no matter who goes into office, we still will always have basic human rights. Anyways I know people are gonna disagree and say that if a certain candidate wins, our whole country is ruined, but I think everyones overreacting. Its a big deal, but its not as big of a deal as it seems
