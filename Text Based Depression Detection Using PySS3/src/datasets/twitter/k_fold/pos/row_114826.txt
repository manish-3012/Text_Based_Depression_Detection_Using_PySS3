I feel like the only person that literally does nothing at all Iâ€™m being 100% honest. All I do is lay in bed, listen to music, and staring at my phone. Iâ€™m not on my phone talking to people, Iâ€™m on my phone looking up random shit and just reading what other people say. Iâ€™m not coming up with any original thoughts or contributing to anything. All Iâ€™m doing is watching what other people do and itâ€™s really sad. I rarely talk to my friends and I feel like I canâ€™t even open my mouth without being judged by someone. Even if they tell me they arenâ€™t judging me, I find that hard to believe. I just canâ€™t stand being around someone if I think they donâ€™t like me. Also if I actually talked about the shit I do on a day to day basis with someone Iâ€™d creep out anyone I actually like. I feel like I have to pretend to be something else to get anyone to like me.

Uhh so thatâ€™s whatâ€™s on my mind rn
