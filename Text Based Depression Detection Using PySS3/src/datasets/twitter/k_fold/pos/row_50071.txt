I had a dream and I was happy But like all dreams it comes to an end and the dream even went for a dark turn at the end. I had a dream and in it I had met a person that Iâ€™ve never seen before and she was a few years younger than me but we grew a connection and we seemed to be in love and I was happy to finally feel that way but then my mom in my dream got mad at me and screamed at me saying some things about just using her to get what I want and all that which I would never do bc if I even make someone feel sad I can go suicidal bc of how much I care about people but after that happened the person was no longer in my dream and I was just miserable again. I see this as Iâ€™m going to be alone forever and there is nothing I can do about it bc I canâ€™t even be happy and with someone in my dreams
