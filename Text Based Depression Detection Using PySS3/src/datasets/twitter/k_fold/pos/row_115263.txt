The biggest irony in among us So I was playing among us, and these 3 people kept being toxic towards me, so I was just kind of being toxic aswell, and when I died, one guy says â€fuck your homie deadâ€ and I was honestly just cringing, one of them said they had to vote and when the results were there it was one of those guys, and then he just left, ended up being kicked but Jesus Christ the irony
