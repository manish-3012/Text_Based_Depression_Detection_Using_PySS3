I feel like shit I asked my dad to play the PS4 but he said no just because I forgot to clear the litterbox this morning even though I have cleared the litterbox countless times. I know there are people that have it worse than me but I just constantly feel like a failure and the PS4 is the only thing that brings me joy.
