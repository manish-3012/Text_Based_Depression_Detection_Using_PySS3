Why are teachers like this? Iâ€™m in my last 2 years of highschool, by now I know how to take notes and review for tests. Why are you giving me an over 5 hour review and vocab assignment that will not help me and is for a grade over giving me the time to review in the way that actually works and helps me.

Hell, when we go back physically sheâ€™s gonna start doing journal checks and if she doesnâ€™t like the way the notes are done we get a 0 and have to redo them for a 50 (and knowing her itâ€™s going to be a very specific format that doesnâ€™t work for me at all)

Like sure, some kids donâ€™t take notes or review - thatâ€™s there fucking fault, donâ€™t punish everyone for it (and please stop thinking itâ€™ll somehow make the kids who donâ€™t do it feel bad, I can guarantee it wonâ€™t)
