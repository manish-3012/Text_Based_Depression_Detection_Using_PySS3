MY SURGERY WAS SUCCESSFUL!!!!!! Hey again, itâ€™s me and I had my surgery earlier this day and itâ€™s just a surprising how much I thought it would suck. I mean it did but maybe five hours later, my life kinda returned to normal. After two hours I could talk again and after three I could eat. Still no crunchy foods but soft things like soup. And if for what ever reason you remember me, my sister didnâ€™t end up coming to the appointment and I didnâ€™t say any weird shit under the anesthesia!!!! In fact I think I regained control after like 2 minutes of waking!!!!!
