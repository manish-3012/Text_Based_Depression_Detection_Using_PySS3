Online classes are really pissing me off!! Any Advice? Alright, so i am 16 (M) and last year, when i finished my 10th grade exams, i ended up getting 94% which is really good. I had that motivation to read well and score the same in 11th grade. But i lose all my interest due to this pathetic online classes. We students arent capable of understanding whatever the teachers are saying and the teachers are also really bad at taking classes. First few months i managed to listen a little but still wasnt good. And then later, i just started getting so distracted. I barely listen to the classes. I play Dota, or watch anime or just watch youtube but never listen to classes. My grades are going low and finals are approaching nearer. What to do??

Just wanted to get everything of off my chest. Any tips to study even in this condition?
