i have to wait til june to see a doctor for my damn heartðŸ˜ž my heart started to become weak/poor when i was 6, my family has it and it started out with my grandpa.
Then it became worse in October of 2018. i was seen last april but then the nurse told me i'll have to wait. last week i was informed that i'll finally go in june.
i hate living in a town.
