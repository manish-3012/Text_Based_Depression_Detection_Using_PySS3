I wrote a short story, let me know what you think! flowers are scared of the dark.

no one can see them.

there's no light.

 if they're unlucky someone will come by and steal them petal by petal.

 unfortunate.

flowers are scared of the dark.

someone sees them.

there is no light, only a heavy feeling.

 healthy flowers are picked, wilted for beauty. 

he loves me not. he loves me not. he loves me not. 

flowers cannot grow in the dark.
