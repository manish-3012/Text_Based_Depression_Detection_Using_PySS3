Something about mobile gamers Just because you can afford a $5000 pc doesn't give you the right to bully those who can't afford it and play games on mobile. It doesn't require as much skill and isn't as difficult as playing on pc but we're still gamers. We still try to compete. There are pro mobile gamers who play seriously but can't afford a pc like you rich fucks.
