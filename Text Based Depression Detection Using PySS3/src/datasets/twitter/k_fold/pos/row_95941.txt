itâ€™s 3am and all i can think about is how i need friends i have a handful of friends but none of them are close. we have superficial conversations about netflix and college plans but itâ€™s as good as nothing in my mind. i wish i was ok with being alone but i just need people in my life to function and it feels like i have no one. iâ€™ve had people in my life that i would talk to all the time but they just drifted away over time. those people made me so happy and i miss it.
