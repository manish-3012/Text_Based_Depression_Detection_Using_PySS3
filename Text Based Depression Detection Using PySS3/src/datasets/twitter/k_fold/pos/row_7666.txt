If you give your Wholesome award or laughing Snoo award or pretty much anything similar to a post where the poster is clearly grieving over an excruciating loss, you are being a colossal, piece-of-shit jerk that deserves to be thrown in a mental institution with your Reddit account deleted. After what happened with my friend u/FMITW17 â€˜s post about his grandfatherâ€™s tragic passing over 100 of you little shits decided to go RedditMoment mode and give your Wholesome awards and its variants, and another one of you threw in a Laughing Snoo to add salt to his gaping wound left by his grandfatherâ€™s dead body.

The Wholesome award was not meant for this shit and though I may now know what led to it being used for this purpose, people like you are abusing this award to make people feel worse.

Seriously, guys. You can think.

I donâ€™t want to blame people for the mental damage they caused to this poor young man. But for all of you, my fellow teenagers and the pedophiles who save our selfies and the kids who still havenâ€™t grown a strand of pubic hair who snuck into this group:

Please. **STOP.** 

Thank you for coming to my urgent Ted talk.

With all due pleasure,

Elson.
