Do you believe that it's worse to be racist, sexist, or anti-LGBTQ+, and why? TL;DR I'd personally say it's worse to be racist, as it's what has caused slavery in the past, and to this day certain groups are still abused by the cops and justice system. 

In 2021, especially through social media and the internet, it's obvious that a lot of society's biggest problems are rooted in racism, sexism, and/or being anti-LGBTQ+. All three of them are horrible, but things are rarely ever exactly equal, so one of them is worse than the other two. 

Personally, I'd have to go with racism, as it has been the reason several groups of people were enslaved, abused, and even killed in the past, and even today certain groups of people are still abused by the cops or justice system or whatever. 

Sexism is horrible too, but women of a privileged race still have an overall advantage in society over men of an oppressed race. Being a woman alone by itself at least won't get you shot by the cops or anything, though women on average are still taken less seriously than their male counterparts of the same race.

And of course, being anti-LGBTQ+ is horrible too, but a lot of LGBTQ+ people can try to hide their "gayness" when they need to, and some gay men or lesbian women or whatever are almost indistinguishable from straight men and women...but one's race or sex can never be truly hidden. Though that doesn't make being anti-LGBTQ+ any less worse.
