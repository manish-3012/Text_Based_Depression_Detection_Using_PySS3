I absolutely despise my username If you've read the title of this post, then I think you know what's coming. 
So about 8 months ago one of my best friends introduced me to Reddit. I just thought that it would be a fun place to look at memes and talk to other people. But since last Saturday I started posting and commenting too. In 2 days, I had already gained over 3000 karma. But here's the problem. I hate my username. I literally cannot look at it without cringing. So I googled ways to change it and of course as we all know, you can't. Yesterday I created a new account with a much "better" name in my opinion, but I don't have the motivation to start completely over again. What should I do? Should I keep this account or start fresh? Oh God I hate this username.
