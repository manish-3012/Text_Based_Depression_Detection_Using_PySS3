I'm putting this dream on hold for now. I am literally sobbing in the bathroom right now. This is not the first time this has happened but this time it hurt bad. I've been doing okay for the past few days because I have been constantly doing what I love. And then today, my parents just blew up and scolded me(I know part of the teenage life).

I love doing makeup, I've been told that I'm good by several people but never the ones near me. Still, I do it because I can escape for a while before I take it all off. Today I was doing a look and I again got disapproving stares. Then the scolding started. Not even talking, I was scolded. So I stopped for a while because I cannot continue with what is happening.

This whole session(yes I call them sessions cuz it happens often when I'm in the middle of a look) just got more aggressive and aggressive. They told me "if I can't get something from that, and they won't too then I have to stop doing it", I'm assuming money because that's all they expect from me. I'm 19 and had been doing this for almost 2 years, on and off because of these sessions.

If they see me pickup a brush next time, they'd break it. Which I don't know if they're serious because whenever we have kids over, they'd always have them play with my makeup. I don't have a huge collection and they're not that expensive but that's all I have. I have some of the broken palettes still because they still work, don't worryðŸ˜. But I have been hiding them because it hurts me to see my products get played with. But then they brought that up too and told me it was selfish of me.

This line never misses every session. "If you don't want to be in this household then go out, or I will." I will be leaving soon, I promise.(if you have any ideas on what to do, i just wanna go away, please)

It hurts me, I don't know how long this will be but I'm gonna have to keep this dream on hold for now. I will be the good boy they want me to be.
