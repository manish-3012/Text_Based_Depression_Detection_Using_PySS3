I feel like music stopped having the effect it used to have on me It used to communicate so many things to me, it used to make me feel a lot of things, it used to CHANGE MY MOOD. Now I just, idk, I donâ€™t feel as much when I listen to music. Maybe I should take a break and stop listening to it in the first place for a while...
