Aaaaaaaah why I met a girl exactly a year ago, we liked each other, but she lives more than 800km (500mi) from here, so we decided to not to get into a relationship. We had so much in common. Our last text is a birthday text for me, on january 18th. She is in my country rn, I really want to hang out with her, but im by a lake (where i met her) and she is not. She wont be here for long, so i dont want to ask her to come to where i am. Idek why i would like to meet her, i would be just hurt hard in the feels again. I want to let her go but i cant.
