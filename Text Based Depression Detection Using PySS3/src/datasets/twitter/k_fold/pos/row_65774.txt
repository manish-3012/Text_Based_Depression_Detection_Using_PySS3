y'all if you've been feeling extremely stressed or burnt out or unmotivated i highly recommend doing just a lil bit of exercise i'm not a very athletic person by nature, but even just moving around and breaking a sweat impacted my day in such a positive way. i just started college which is very stressful and i've really been living the couch potato life for the past few months... pushing myself to work out gave me the endorphins i could've been seeking out in other less healthy ways. 

anyways just try it. it really made my day so much better so it's just an idea if any of you people are in a slump like me rn
