Being gay isn't a personality trait. If you are that's great but for the love of God don't bring it up in every sentence. It makes me want to die Like honestly I'm happy for you and all but just shut up about it. You're not special. There's loads of gay people. My 2 closest friends are gay and the reason I'm friends with them is because they rarely actually bring it up unless we're joking about it. That is all. That's the whole rant
