This is probably an unpopular opinion but, There should just be one basic streaming service and then different companies could have packages that you just have to pay a little extra for like between Â£1-Â£5 extra. There could be a deal where you have everything so itâ€™s discounted a little. 

There could be a Disney package and a Warner Bros package etc. 

The basic service should have movies from companies that donâ€™t want their own package and exclusives made by whoever owns the service..

I think itâ€™s better than having all these separate services that add up in the long run.
