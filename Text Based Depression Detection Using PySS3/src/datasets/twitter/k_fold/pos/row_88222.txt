A finland fact for every day #18 In the dark and depressing winter Finland wants to kill everything. First, the ice. It is every where and you cannot see it below the snow. Second, the cold. It is always cold and... Yeah its cold. Third, it is dark so noone can see anything without electricity. Fourth, there is a lot of forest in finland so it is not impossible to see some bears or lynxses.
