I played online with my group of friends for the first time and I feel on top of the world Itâ€™s been a rough week, but everyone felt better once we decided to play some Among Us later on. We legit played for over 4 hours and although that may seem minuscule to some people, as someone who really struggles to maintain friendships and has been told to gain confidence, it feels like such an achievement!
