is this a bad sign? i am a gay guy (16) i would love a bf. there is this one gay boy (16) that i kinda know through our mutual friend. we will call her Sarah. I donâ€™t know him that well, but weâ€™ve talked in group chats, and weâ€™ve never met. still i see him on social media and i find him attractive. now i was going to start to reach and get to know him, but then i see this: 

so in sarahâ€™s social media story, she posts a screenshot of her texting the boy i like. in this texting conversation, the boy says â€œis (somebodyâ€™s name crossed off) the only other gay friend that you have besides me?â€ to which sarah says â€œyesâ€ i know that had to be my name, as iâ€™m very open about my sexuality to sarah, and the boy i like knows iâ€™m gay. so i almost take this as a sign that heâ€™s not interested in me, because he seems to be looking for another gay boy that isnâ€™t me. i still can see the two of us and sarah hanging out together as friends, but i really think heâ€™s attractive, iâ€™m feeling like he doesnâ€™t want me tho.

(sorry for this confusing story- english isnâ€™t my first language. while i speak it fine, typing it can be an issue sometimes.)
