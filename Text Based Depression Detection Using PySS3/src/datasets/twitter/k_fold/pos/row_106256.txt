I cant fucking take double standards this happened well over a year ago, but I still get mad. (talking in past)

So I have a 5 year old cousin whom I like to play with and we get along so well.

When in family reunions me and my cousin go to the visitors bedroom and I close the door behind us, we play, chat, etc.

After leaving the room my mom whispered to me and I quote:  
\-Stop going alone with your cousin.

**I HAVE 0 ACCIDENTS REGARDING MY COUSIN(S), OF ANY TYPE. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD PERSON.**

Later my sister did the same thing **same cousin** and no one said anything, not my mom, my dad, my cousin's parents **NO ONE.**

This is fucking ridiculous.
