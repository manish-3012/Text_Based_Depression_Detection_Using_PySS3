ughhhhh i'm so confused alright So I downloaded minecraft free NO VIRUS working all skins diamonds [generaotr.net](https://generaotr.net) and for SOME REASON, i'm locked out of my PC? that doesn't make ANY sense, they did say "no virus" so how come I got locked out? I think I did one of the steps wrong, I entered my credit card information wrong I think? Wait let me double check... yeah it's all correct, I don't know what happened :/
