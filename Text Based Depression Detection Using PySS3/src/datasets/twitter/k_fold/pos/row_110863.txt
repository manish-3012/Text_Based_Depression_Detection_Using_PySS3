No one in my class has standard and they disrespect the teacher. My math class had it bad from the start. After first month of high school our teacher got pregnant and went on maternity leave straight away. The head teacher didnâ€™t bother to get a a substitute teacher so we didnâ€™t have maths for a whole month. Later we got an objectively bad teacher who had no experience (and knowledge) to teach high school math. The substitute left as we finished year one. In 2nd grade we got a teacher who had just graduated. She is quite alright teaching-wise but she takes our failures very personally so most of the lessons are spent ranting on us. My classmates are pretty lazy. 
Yesterday we came back after a month winter break (we still take online classes) and tmmrw we have a test that we agreed to write before a break. Most of my class doesnâ€™t even known whatâ€™s the material yet they always nag at the teacher for being chaotic.
I find it annoying that they expect teacher to be perfect but they do not contribute to make her work easier/any bit pleasant.
