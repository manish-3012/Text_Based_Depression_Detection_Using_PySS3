I just moved out of my parents house!!! My parents werenâ€™t necessarily â€œabusiveâ€ but they were very neglectful. Never checked on me or cared what I was doing but more importantly they neglect everything. Theyâ€™re hoarders and they wonâ€™t clean. You could try to help em but they just get mad at you. You could clean for them and they just get mad at you and remake the mess in a day Iâ€™m allergic to roaches and dust mites, and those make up like 90% of the house. For years Iâ€™ve been living in a constant state of asthmatic breathing problems and itâ€™s only gotten worse. Now Iâ€™m in a new home with my best friend and no bugs. I can breathe. Iâ€™m so fucking happy!
