Anybody else wish they were born into a different family? Am I weird and ungrateful for wishing this?? Like if I was born into a different family I literally wouldnâ€™t have any the problems I have now. Hell I might even get to be happy if I was. If u wanna know why I then I can dm it to u privately cos lmao Iâ€™m wayy too insecure and paranoid to post it publicly ðŸ˜… anyway thx and have a nice day/night ðŸ˜˜ imma probs delete this later cos if anyone ik sees this then well Iâ€™m screwed
