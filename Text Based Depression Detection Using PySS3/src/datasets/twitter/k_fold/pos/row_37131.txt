This pisses me off Iâ€™m fine with the BLM Peaceful Protest in Rochester New York. I Emphasize PEACEFUL protest, not this bullshit of them ruining peopleâ€™s meals nor destroying buildings and businesses of hardworking families that have to come back to the destruction of their building. Everybody has the right to protest but not commit felonies while doing it. Yet people say that â€œtHiS Is A pEaCeFuL pRoTeStâ€ bull shit. I donâ€™t watch or read mainstream media but this chaos that is happening needs to stop. Protesting like that wonâ€™t change what this Country needs. But will cause more hardships for those family this looting and destruction will present itself.
