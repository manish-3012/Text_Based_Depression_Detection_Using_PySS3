Help me please I remember me saying a comment several months ago, on how i said, thats what you get with a boy doing coke, meaning me and referencing the beverage. Later, i was listening to lil uzi and futures song, dranking and smoking, and a verse said had a girl doing coke. I grew curious and searched it up, since it might be something bad. And it turns out another definition was cocaine. 

What do i do?
