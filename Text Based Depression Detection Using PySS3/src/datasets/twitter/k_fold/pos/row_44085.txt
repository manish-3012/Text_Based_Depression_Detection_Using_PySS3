why do i feel like my life has come to an end? i always been suicidal but lately i can smell the death in a different way. like i have lived enough even tho i am very young. i cant find joy in anything so why should i keep living. its not like i planning to do it tonight, or tommorrow, or after 1 week but my brain is always saying that after 2-3months i will definitely me dead, i just i cant remove that thought from my head. also there is no point of asking for help, friends wouldnt understand and they cant help at all, family too. l fuck this life, society really doesnt give a fuck about suicidal peoples. we all live in fucked up place, world of darkness
(sry for my english)
