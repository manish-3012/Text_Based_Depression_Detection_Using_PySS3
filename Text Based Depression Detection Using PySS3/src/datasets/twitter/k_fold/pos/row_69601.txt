Iâ€™m not feeling sleepy so uh... hello there American teenagers! Yeah, like the title says, I donâ€™t feel too sleepy (despite it being 12:22AM in the Philippines) mainly because I slept through most of the day due to a fever I had (it sucked big time) but, I feel ok now and at the same time, I donâ€™t feel too sleepy so, uh... I guess I just wanna say, hello there my fellow American and European teenagers!
