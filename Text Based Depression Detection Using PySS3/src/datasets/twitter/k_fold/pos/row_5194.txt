let's talk: reality shifting || if you know anything about it/are curious about it only please Here's the first reason why I don't just take word for it: it's something I've seen talked about mostly by teens on Tik Tok. Just being a teen, I know how trends &amp; all that stuff goes.

**In my mind it seems like either: imagination, maladaptive daydreams, dreams, hallucinations.** So I have hallucinations &amp; a large imagination. I often get very lost in my mind &amp; can't tell whether stuff is real or not. - At the same time not everyone does experience psychosis which brings me to dreams, maladaptive daydreams, &amp; imagination.

I do want to here other people's opinions on it though, if anyone here does reality shift - could you explain it more? (what it is, why you think it happens, etc.)
