Rant- Iâ€™m constantly bored because I only have one class right now Iâ€™m a senior and I literally only need one more credit that Iâ€™m taking next quarter so right now I just have this stupid drawing class thatâ€™s basically just a joke to me since I donâ€™t need the credit my school just couldnâ€™t give me all free periods so I basically donâ€™t do anything but log into class so my mom doesnâ€™t yell at me. I never realized how much of my boredom was overridden by hunching over my laptop doing homework and now Iâ€™m just ridiculously bored I have no hobbies and Iâ€™m currently jobless (looking for one) so :/ fuck man Iâ€™ll help people with their homework if they want ðŸ˜­
