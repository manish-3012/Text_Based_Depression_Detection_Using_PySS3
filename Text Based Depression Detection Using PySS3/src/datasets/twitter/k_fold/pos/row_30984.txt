I need help with something Hi, maybe this is a dumb post but i need to write this:

Do you ever feel empty when you have no exams nor homework, and you dont know what to do to kill time? Like, when i am busy with the exams season and have a lot of work i am tired, but when i have a lot of spare time i am more tired than when i am in the exams season and i feel very unmotivated to do something, yet i'm upset because i dont do anything.
