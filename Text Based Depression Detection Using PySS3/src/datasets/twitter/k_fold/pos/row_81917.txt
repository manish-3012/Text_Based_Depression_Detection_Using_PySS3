honestly at this point i dont care about Corpse's face, i just wanna give him a tight hug. like, i see a lot of people forcing him to do a face reveal and it just makes me sad, like,,, can you not?? if he doesn't wanna show his face, why the fuck are u  doing it. like, pressuring aint gonna do nothing. it just makes you look like a fucking asshole for not being able to respect his boundaries.

same with Dream. WHY THE FUCK DO YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT HIS FUCKING FACE IF HE DONT WANNA FUCKIN SHOW IT.

also completely unrelated, can people just stop shipping tommyinnit with others in the Dream team? like,,,the dude is fucking 16! HES A FUCKING MINOR.
