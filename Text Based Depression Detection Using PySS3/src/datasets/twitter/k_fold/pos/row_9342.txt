I'm writing 3 stories Part 1 is a story born from my depression and is about enduring hardships and forgiveness. Part 2 is born from my rage at injustices and is about how revenge doesn't change anything it just can worsen your own life. Part 3 is born from my fear and is about accepting death as a part of life and being ready even if you have so much left to do.
