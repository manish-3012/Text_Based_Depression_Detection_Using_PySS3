Please see this post to help a yt channel grow. If you like watching sword forging forging videos, then go check out faraway forge. He (obviusly) maies sword forging videos. He doesnt put stupid music over his videos as well, so you get the oddly soothing sounds of the metal hitting another piece of red hot metal. He has made an actual flamming sword, a viking axe and much more. he only has 16 videos, but they are very entertaining. He has been on youtube since 2008, but only has 266k subscribers. HE DESERVES MORE THAN JUST THAT! so please go check him out. For a friend and i. Please
