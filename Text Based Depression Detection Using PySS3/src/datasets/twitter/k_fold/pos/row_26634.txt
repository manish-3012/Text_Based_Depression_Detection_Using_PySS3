Why is every time I actually try in gym glass, Iâ€™m rewarded with pain???? I SWEAR I have the worst luck in the history of sports. When we where running for 12 minutes on the track, my clown feet (size 10) tripped me and I face planted directly onto the track. On basketball day, I was dribbling the ball, and tripped on it when I went to grab it. I decided I would actually try to shoot a basket, I did make a 3 pointer, but I got hit the face. Twice. When we did upper body day, I was doing dips on the bleachers and my arms slipped and I bruised my tailbone. Yesterday, we where playing â€œbelly tag.â€ This game is where everyone lays down in pairs on the ground. The person who is â€œitâ€ has to chase another person around until said person slides down onto the floor, then the person on the opposite end of the group has to run form the it person. If the it person catches the person running, the person running is now it and chances the other person until they lay down, and this continues. Well I, a slow, overweight girl, who unfortunately was tasked with chases people. They where all boys. (Iâ€™m a girl) I literally could not catch them and they mocked me the entire time. Well finally, one of them was slow to get up and I ran and layed down, practically dying  and out of breath. Well I slid right in really fast because he caught up to me and my knees on my legging now have holes an I have terrible friction burns. (think carpet, but on hard, waxed wooden floors) why do I have such terrible luck? And they wonder why I hate gym class.
