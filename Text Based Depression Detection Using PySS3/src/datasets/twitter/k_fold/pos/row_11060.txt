What does loneliness feel like ? It seems like of lot of you here talk about it.

I lost *all* of my friends from moving/growing up and I miss some of them a lot. 

Iâ€™ve been pretty much alone since August last year and I have 0 way of communicating with them so itâ€™s likely I wonâ€™t see them again or until a very very long time but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m actually experiencing or understand loneliness. 

I can make friends fairly easy but Iâ€™m not looking forward to meeting new people or making new friends anytime soon, so if I do understand that aspect correctly I have no reason to be lonely, right ?
