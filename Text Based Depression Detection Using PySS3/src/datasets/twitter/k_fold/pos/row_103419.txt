I dreamt that I had a girlfriend I am typing this out as I am feeling things so the language isn't perfect. 

I had never actually met her, but somehow we ended up video calling each other (dream logic lol) and we had a good time and became very friendly with each other. She wasn't THE prettiest girl in the world (she was still cute), but I still thought she was really nice and when we ended the call, I couldn't help but hope that I would get to see her again at some point in time. The second time we called, we decided for it to be a date, and we then we met in real life and had a lot of fun just being friends with each other. We didn't do anything sexual nor did we even physically touch each other but we really cared for each other and kept trying to help the other person.  I never felt pressured or nervous when talking to her - even when we met up in real life for the first time. It all just felt really natural and and we just went at our own pace. What I found interesting is that my love for her had absolutely nothing to do with looks, I enjoyed being with her her mainly because of her personality, which is different from my crushes or what I thought I liked. With the crushes I have tried to get to know better, I was always nervous and never felt like I could be myself, but with her, it was like we were already great friends who could freely be themselves with each other. She made me feel relaxed just by talking to her, andI can't imagine any dispute would ever come between us because of how natural we are together and with each other. I couldn't even imagine a future without her, there just didn't seem to be a way we would ever separate from each other. I know this sounds a bit cliche, but it was like we were actually made for each other.

I knew that she was someone who would always care for me and always had my back. We both had the same sense of humor and was interested in the same topics. Her name was sammie, or lawton, or lawie? ... or something, I can't remember it that well. I know she had black hair and was shorter than me, but I can't remember anything else. She was very gentle but therr was also confident, but knew how to respect other people's words but could also say what she wants to say. 

I just woke up and I feel kinda sad. I'm not heartbroken, but it is like a longing and an acceptance that I don't have nor will I ever have such love in my life -- it was just a dream.

I hope I get to see her again because I want to ask her name one more time so I can try to remember it, or look at her face and try to memorize how her she looks. At the same time, I don't want to see her again because I don't want to fall more in love with someone in my dreams and make myself more unhappy in real life. Actually, I think I do want to see her again because I want to feel that kind of happiness and feel that valued and cared for by somebody. I really, truly felt happy and now I realize that I don't truly know what love is, because the connection with her wasn't as 'deep'  as I expect love to be, but it felt like it was love. Sorry I'm having a bit of trouble putting it into words... these are just some feelings I am trying to capture.

After I woke up, I could feel my heart in my chest, and it felt like it was being squeezed, like it was looking for something that wasn't there, and it was longing for something that it felt it was missing. It sort of felt like something deep inside of it was hollow, and that was making in hurt. 

You know what, I think I do want to see her again. It's not like I am having love in my life or will any time soon, and things have been kinda shitty lately. I hope I don't fall too much in love with her, but I really want to feel that happiness and those emotions one more time and try to remember them better, so that way if I ever met her in *real* real life I would know that I am. Maybe it isn't so bad if I fall in love with her... as long as I keep getting to see her. 

As you can tell, I'm having some conflicting feelings about all this, but I tried to capture as much of it as I possibly could. 

If more things come to me during the rest of the day, I going to keep editing this post and adding stuff on.
