My parents laughed at me for my social anxiety. So the phone rings and Iâ€™m like: â€œIâ€™ll get itâ€ so I go to pick it up and the person on the phone is like â€œdoes [insert name] live hear?â€ Then Iâ€™m like â€œI donâ€™t think soâ€ so they hang up, and my parent start laughing their head off. Rip.
