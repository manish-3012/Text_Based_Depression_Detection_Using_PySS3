17 M indian, looking to study in germany for bachelors. It'd be cool if you're german and DMed me... I'd really use some advice and stuff Hi! So as far as I've researched, biggest thing, getting admission.Learning German.  I'm really having a hard time understanding that. When do I apply? How do I apply? Do I apply to every University seperately?! How many universities are there?!
I haven't even started learning German! Is it too late?? 
How much time do I have??

Also within my own country, almost every state has a different native language other then the national language. So even though that guy knows the national language, he doesn't know the native and that makes things for him a little difficult. People would straight up assume he knows the language. They would be stagmatised about him. Etc. Is that a thing to worry about in germany? Is learning Germany alone enough? I know the basics like ich bin ein jungÃ©. And du bist ein/eine dear friend who's gonna dm/comment. Isn't that right. 

rent there goes from anywhere between 190 to 300. 

I learned, you can earn 650 euros per month. But you've got a lot of stuff to worry about like settling first implying, in your first year you can only earn for roughly 6 months...

I was planning to get a job where I can study while I'm working... Like a shopkeeper or security guard lol I don't even have any idea if a student is eligible to become a security guard.

Internet. Internet is expensive and the kind of data consumer I am, imma need a really big plan and since imma study outside of my hostel room, wifi isn't an option I'll probably need internet anywhere I am. 

I know these aren't even the top things I should be worried about but pls halp.
