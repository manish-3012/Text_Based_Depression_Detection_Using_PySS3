Can i get some help So i decided imma ask out my crush but i dont know when to do it.

So my crush asked me to go swimming at her house at a barbecue with her dad and some of his friends. Im the only person she invited. I dont know whether to tell her i like her at the barbecue and should i ask her if she likes me or should i wait until after the bbq and say something like I had a nice time...
