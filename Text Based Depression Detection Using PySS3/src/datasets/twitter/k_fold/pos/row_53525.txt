Why can't i cry? I don't get it.

I just can't cry. I want to cry but i can't. Its been 3 years since i last cried and ever since then even through some of the saddest moments of my life i have only ever shed a single tear. I want to fucking cry. I want to be able to express my sorrow without having to say i'm really sad.

I don't understand why i can't just fucking cry.
