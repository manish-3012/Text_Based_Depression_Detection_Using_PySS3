What do yall think of my plan? I have this really cool and chill swedish taeacher, and every time someone has a hat on in class and refuses to take it off when he tells them to, he slaps the hat off ones head, throws it away and gives it back after class.

He always find it really funny and does it in a jokingly,fun and chill way.

Ones he took mine and hang in the roof and I am like 158 cm (5 feet 3?4? Inches I think?) so I cant fucking reach it then. He then gave me it back after class.

My plan is to take with me 8 hats and see how far I can go without getting in trouble and see how he reacts.

What do yall think?
