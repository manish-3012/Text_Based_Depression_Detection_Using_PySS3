I found something in my bathroom that almost gave me a heart attack. So, it's 4:33 am here in Brazil, it's too late so I went to my bathroom brush my teeth because I need to sleep, but I saw something in my floor, was something insanely big, I got really scared, it was a huge spider.

So I close the bathroom door (really fast), put the carpet on the door for the spider can't go to my room from below, I put a chair to hold the carpet, I took a new tooth brush and now I'm sleeping in my house's second floor.

Good night fellas.
