People get offended too much, like how people were pushing for fat models 
It wasnâ€™t always like this, models used to be people who were basically objectively attractive but Iâ€™m gonna keep this short and simple. So what your telling me is someone saw a model on a product and got mad because they donâ€™t look like the model who is typically in shape, what? People genuinely got mad because there werenâ€™t any big/fat models. Because they wanted a model, that reflected who they were? Iâ€™m gonna be honest I would never look at a pair of underwear and get mad at the company for having a buff dude when Iâ€™m a skinny average nonmuscular guy itâ€™s stupid, people get offended over everything, and no offense but this applies to overweight women who get mad when they see models, doing their job just because they are more in shape than them and the company isnâ€™t representing â€œfatâ€ people like grow up you can literally lose weight.
