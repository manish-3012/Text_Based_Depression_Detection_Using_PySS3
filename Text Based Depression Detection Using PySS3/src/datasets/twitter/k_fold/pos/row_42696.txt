Girlfriend[17] wants to go away to cottage with 3 close guy friends for a week, one of whom she dated briefly and I[17] don't feel okay with it. My girlfriend of around 1 year has 3 close guy friend, 2 she has known for around a decade and the other one, who she dated briefly only met around 3.5years ago. Just before we started dating she went one of their grandparents cottages and had fun. Now she wants to go again and we are sort of stuck. I trust her completely and I have talked with her friends before and they seem cool but I still know that if she goes I will feel miserable and paranoid. However if I don't let her go, then she is going to be miserable the whole week. She really wants to go but I just cant bring myself to say yes, cause she already went to a sleepover once with them and I was miserable the whole time. In my opinion it is a little to much. What should I do, it seems no matter what one of us ends up miserable.
