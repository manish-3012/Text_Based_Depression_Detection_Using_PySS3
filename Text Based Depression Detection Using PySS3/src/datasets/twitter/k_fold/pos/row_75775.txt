Its 10:00. I meandered down to the fireplace in my livingroom to warm up, but I ended up burning both my legs on the ash-catcher that juts out of the furnace. Let's go. I was cold because I got no mans to keep me warm. And now I'm sad because I have no mans to help me reach the vaseline... Also, y'all know any good shit to put on burns?
