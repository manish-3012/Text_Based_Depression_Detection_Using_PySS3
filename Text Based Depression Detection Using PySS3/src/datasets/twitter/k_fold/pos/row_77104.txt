I feel empty I feel totally lost . At first I wanted school to start to you know change .buy itâ€™s the same loop all again 
Everyone who doesent like me . People telling me they are there for me but when I tell them my problems they just say donâ€™t be sad .i wish I could be like the others and that my biggest preocupation was grades and that others like me . Iâ€™m always trying to change like to the point itâ€™s strange .I wanna go to another country .So people wonâ€™t know me and they will talk to me again , but if I do I feel like Iâ€™ll make the same mistakes and end up in loneliness again .i like to go outside all the time l because that clears my mind and it makes me thing I am doing something .when Iâ€™m home I feel like I donâ€™t do enough .i only feel happy when I am with people I like .if not Iâ€™m just overthinking my life I wanna make friends but I donâ€™t know how .i have signed up to some extra activities but will I meet people with interest similar to me or will I just have more things to worry about. I wish I could take everything back to when I was six when my life were skyscrapers .now they are just debris ,a shadow of what they were
