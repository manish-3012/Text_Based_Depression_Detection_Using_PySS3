How do I tell a girl I like her? Iâ€™ve had a crush on a girl in my grade for a year or so now, and Iâ€™ve been wanting to tell her how I feel. Iâ€™m probably one of the most socially awkward people on earth so I though I should ask my fellow teenagers for advice. You guys got any or am I just a simp?
