What was the craziest dream you ever had? My craziest dream was a dream where I was handed an alcohol wipe, and was instructed to wipe the wall clean. I looked over at the wall and it was covered in faces. As i wiped the wall, the faces screamed in agony, and then disintegrated away. Disgusted, I turned away and left the room. After I left the room, I was confronted by a tall and skinny man who said something unintelligible. And then I woke up.
