I retract my previous statement. Black people Are real. Hi! It's me, u/im_not_creative123, author of the theuri on Black people, in witch I concluded the Black people were not real and I am NOT being held at gunpoint by u/heathenumber4_, CEO of Big Racism. 

I have come to say that Black people ARE REAL and my previous statements were all done by A HACKER from Big Anti-Racism. There are not chemicals in the water that make you see fake black people. Black people are all real, please, continue to be racist towards them.
