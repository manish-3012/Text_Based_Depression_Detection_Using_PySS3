Does anyone know what song this is (good luck) Fifteen years later, waiting time has ended
Leaving the Earth behind is impossible
We depart from Heaven It's not a secret
Everyone will soon understand
The celestial country Heaven is on standby
That is a space station on Earth
Nothing compares with this
Use the ladder on Level 7

Sleep, my children
We will be waiting for your cheerful eyes
The celestial country
The celestial country
A group of children
The galaxy extends
Garden of imagination
I must say goodnight
Go ahead and you will live forever tonight
The celestial country Heaven is on standby
The celestial country Heaven is on standby
