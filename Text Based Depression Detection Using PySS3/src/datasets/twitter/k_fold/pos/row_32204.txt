Iâ€™m getting bullied. One of my â€œfriendsâ€ and a few others have been attacking me for numerous reasons.
1. I use reddit.
2. I donâ€™t look the best, and Iâ€™m not in the best of shape. 
3. Iâ€™m Bi.
4. I was a moderator on a discord server.
You get the idea. Lemme show you some stuff they have been saying (most bad shit has been censored.)
F*g, N-word (ALL of them.), Incel, r*tard, fat*ss, gay, you get the picture. What do I do? They black mailed my sister into posting pictures of me. Now they know where I live, what I look like, what I used to look like, and worse of all, my sister is trying to have one of the people come over.
