The boys My friend (I've been playing with for over 10 years stuck with me through the Xbox 360 days and into the PC days) passed away today. I dont think you realize how short life is until this happens. I wanted to spread suicide awareness. Too many people commit suicide every year and its horrible you have people who love you.
