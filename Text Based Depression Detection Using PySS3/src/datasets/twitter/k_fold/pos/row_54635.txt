My troubles are confusing me. Idk what to do Usually I would talk to my friend about this, but he left me :( 
Anyways. I hate the thought of being in a relationship, especially a relationship with boys. Sadly I have a boyfriend. Idk how to break up with him, today he told me "You're the only reason I'm alive." Idk what to do, I feel miserable in this relationship but I can't break things off
