It's honestly incredible how stupid people can be The leaps and bounds some individuals make in order to deny covid is amazing, it's honestly dumfounding that people think governments are trying to control you, ah yes let us just create near economic collapse because we need to control you more than we already do, because your oh so special and we need to make sure you and your big brain is kept in check. Fuck off, in convinced people like this aren't necessarily uneducated and most of them aren't stupid in the traditional sense, but just think if themselves so highly that they have to create a narrative where everyone else is stupid but they're the smart ones who aren't sheep. 

News was talking about a new strain which is more lethal and has a much faster incubation than the current one (South australia) if this got out, it would very likely cause a second economic collapse, countless unemployed and countless more dead. But they think a full lockdown immediately is pushing it, because 'there were only 2 new cases after the cluster' maybe, just maybe THERE WERE ONLY 2 NEW FUCKING CASES BECAUSE THEY TOOK EXTREME PRECAUTIONS EXTREMELY QUICKLY, FUCK OFF WITH YOUR ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE, DO YOU UNDERSTAND SIMPLE CORRELATION AND CAUSATION
