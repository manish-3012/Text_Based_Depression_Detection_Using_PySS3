My ela coass has no filter at all. So basically, this lady was telling us not to call her by her last last name (idk what to call it) it was like [First name] [teacher name] [name we donâ€™t call her]. Basically she explained it to us like it was her ex husbands last name, so I didnâ€™t think muh of that because thatâ€™s normal, not wanting to be referred to by tour exâ€™s name, normal. But then she says that her husband threw porcelain plates at her while she was holding her 2 and 3 year old kids. WTF. I didnâ€™t know what to say. I just said â€œI feel badâ€ in chat. Just when I thought it couldnâ€™t get any worse, someone whipped out the â€œthatâ€™s a lot of damage!â€ Card and my teacher AGREED!!! I am done with this class i swear.
