Hmm Ternion all powerful I know i am late to the party but today i noticed there is an award called ternion all powerful and it cost 125 fucking shmackeroons. How does one gather enough money when they start thinking giving a 125 dollar award is reasonable, but the weirdest thing is why did someone at reddit think implementing it was a good idea. Props to anyone that ever gave it. Like what do you guys think of it because i dont understand it.
