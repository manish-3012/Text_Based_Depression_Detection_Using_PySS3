Could someone recommend me some Good indie/alt music ? I want to hear some good indie/alt music. I hear a lot of people talk about how itâ€™s amazing and I believe them but a lot of the tracks they sent me donâ€™t feel that way. I feel like a lot of the music has only two types of moods, it either feels like commercial music or it feels boring/bland/ chill. Can someone recommend me some unique tracks ?
