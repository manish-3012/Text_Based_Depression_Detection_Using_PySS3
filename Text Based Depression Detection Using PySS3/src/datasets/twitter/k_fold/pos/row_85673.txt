Is it ok to leave people on read if hit you with the one word responses I was talking to someone new I added on snap and they just responded with â€œlmaoâ€ to something I said and I think iâ€™ve talked to enough people to know that that usually means they arenâ€™t really interested in having a conversation with you so is it OK to just leave them on opened?
