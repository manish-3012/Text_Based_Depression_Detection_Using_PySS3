Getting GCSE results today Bois Is anyone else just not stressing about it as I wasn't amazing in school but I pulled my finger out towards the end of last year. But I know we are being undermarked (we'll that's what I have heard) so I don't think i will do amazing but it's out of my hands now so I am not stressing,, anyone else like this?
