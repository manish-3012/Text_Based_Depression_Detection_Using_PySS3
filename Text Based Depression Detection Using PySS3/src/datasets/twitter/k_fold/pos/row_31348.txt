FriendlyEggâ€™s lyric collection: Tally Hall edition Do you hear the flibbity jibbity jibber jabber
With an oh my god I've gotta get out of here
Or I'll have another word to sell
Another story to tell
Another timepiece ringing the bell
Do you hear the clock stop when you reach the end?
No, you know it must be neverending
Comprehend if you can
But when you try to pretend to understand
You resemble a fool
Although you're only a man
So give it up and smile

-Tally Hall, Ruler of Everything

Life is short, things happen, make the best of it, and smile.
