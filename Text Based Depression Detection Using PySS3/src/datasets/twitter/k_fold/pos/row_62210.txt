Is anybody else intrigued by morbid stuff or just me? And I don't mean morbid like "Blood, guts, gore, hahaha" because that's just being edgey 

I mean like fetuses with birth defects. How did they develop that way? What would they have been like if they were allowed to grow up? experimental surgeries, cyborgification, that kind of morbid. Less "what's the furthest a human body can stay alive" and more "what's the furthest a living body can be called human".

Fringe science, I think it's called. Maybe this post was a little dark.
