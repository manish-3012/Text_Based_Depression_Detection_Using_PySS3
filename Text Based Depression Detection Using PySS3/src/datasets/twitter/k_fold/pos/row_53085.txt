Why do so many people want to harm/kill themselves? Life isnâ€™t that bad. Whether it be abusive parents, a bad day, or even a breakup, donâ€™t let that be the end of it. Find something you love, and eventually it will give you meaning. Eventually, when your high and mighty, that Judas in your life will resurface, and youâ€™ll laugh at how pathetic it is, and question why it even mattered to you in the first place
