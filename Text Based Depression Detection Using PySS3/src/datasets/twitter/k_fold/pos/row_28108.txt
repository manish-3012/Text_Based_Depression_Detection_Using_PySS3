School photo suggestions Due to the current conditions, my school has requested I submit a photo of myself for the yearbook, what is a good suggestion that would abide by these rules?


Color photos only

Plain/neutral background preferred 

Full face view, facing forward

Clothing and jewelry must fit school dress code guidelines

No creative filters or photographic treatments 

No weapons or hand signs of any kind

(Some of these are really stupid, but I have to follow them)
