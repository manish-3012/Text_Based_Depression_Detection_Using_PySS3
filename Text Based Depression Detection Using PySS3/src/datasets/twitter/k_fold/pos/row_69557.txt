lets climb a tree together in the fall breeze. Well wear light jackets and well have some hot chocolate. well listen to some lemon demon and they might be giants. I wanted to introduce you to my bird friends. This one is named David, hes nice. He likes to anger dogs and peck at the windows. Give him a handshake. And hes a friend for life.
