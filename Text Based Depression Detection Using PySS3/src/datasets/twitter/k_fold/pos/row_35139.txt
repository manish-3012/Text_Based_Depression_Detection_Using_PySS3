rickrolled by spotify ad I don't know if y'all use spotify, or if you get this ad, but I get an ad for frito lay at least once per day, and it rickrolls me. 

every time. it opens with "never gonna give you up, never gonna..." and then fades into the actual advert. this ad can go eat a chair and shit splinters for a week. I hate it.
