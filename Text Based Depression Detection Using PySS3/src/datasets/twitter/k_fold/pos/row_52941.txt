I was caught jerking off in online school FROM A light glitch, Well I'm in high school turning 15 next week, and yeah. I get horny as I'm sure many of you do. I'm chilling in my online math class, and I suddenly get the urge to jerk one. So I decided to turn off my camera or so I naively thought. This teacher was in her mid 50's old teacher, and she didn't know how to work the google meets well. Here is the part where I massively fucked up. Usually when my camera is on there is a bright small light coming out from my computer. When I "turned off my camera" that light went off. I usually double check to make sure. I was sitting in my bed which is by the wall, and there I put on some headphones and listened to some sweet porn. I whip my dick out, and start beating it after a little while  I finish up naively thinking everything was alright. After class ended I got spammed from a friend of mine in the class that the entire class watched me jerk off dick and all. He said that "dude your so fucked, you fucking idiot   how the hell did you not know that your camera was on" "I said no, no, you didn't it the light was off no way, everyone saw me. Then he showed me the video which he took to me beating my meat in front of the entire class. I naively thought that just because the light was off my camera was off. I think what happened was that I miskicked and thought I turned off my camera when I didn't. I proceeded to skip the rest of class, and sit in my room thinking about what i'm going to do when I go back to school on Monday. (I have a hybrid schedule 2 days in person 3 days online. Apparently I also heard that  the teacher tried turning off my camera, but due to her being old and not so great with tech she had no idea how. So everyone watched me jerk off dick and all in online class.   What do I do? I'm so fucked.
