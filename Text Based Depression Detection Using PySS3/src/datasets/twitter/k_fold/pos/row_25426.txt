I donâ€™t know who needs to hear this, but here is something Iâ€™ve been thinking about. Iâ€™ve been watching the world descend into the shit show it is today, just as all of you have. As Iâ€™ve watched, Iâ€™ve noticed that the amount of hostility in this world is obscene. So much could have been solved if people were more concerned about others, and less about themselves. If people could just BE KIND to one another, then so much could be better.
