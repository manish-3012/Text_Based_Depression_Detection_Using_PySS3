i... help. my parents just grilled me for saying something that was supposedly bad attitude, and now i'm in an online class. i want to cry but i think (i know i shouldn't but i do) that it gives them more power and i'm also embarrassed.  i have my camera off but they're just in the other room there, and i guess i just need somebody to talk to. i haven't seen my best friend since coronavirus started, and this loneliness is taking a toll on me. i don't think i've ever actually had a good cry since 2019. i guess i'm just scared about their reactions. i've googled a bunch of stuff and i don't think anybody on quora has this problem. any of yall teens out there feel my pain? &lt;3

edit: i think i should also mention that i'm normally the one who makes other people laugh, and i feel like i just need a good laugh and a real friend right now. sure buzzfeed is funny but it's not really helping right now.
