Online school is possible the dumbest thing there is. Half of my schools teachers donâ€™t know how to handle it. My AP World History teacher told us about a test one day in class, and never mentioned it again. She never put out an announcement or anything, she told us about it Once. And since the test had then left my mind by the time of its date, I missed the test. Bringing my grade down to a c+, which overall my parents wonâ€™t accept. I donâ€™t know what to do because Iâ€™m getting overwhelmed and just want to give up and ignore everything.
