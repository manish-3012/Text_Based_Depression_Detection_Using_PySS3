I feel like a failure for no reason I missed the bus and I feel like I disappointed my mom even though everything is online. I didnt want to wake her up and make her drive me to school cus she doesnt like waking up early

So when I said, "I'm just gonna dtay home and do scjool online today" my stepdad sighed and grumbled "She's gonna do that alot" to my mom and my mom told me I coulda woke her up but when J wake her up she either falls back asleep or takes forver to get ready. And since school ends at 1:30 pm now and classes are shorter I didnt think it would eb a bug deal but it is to my mom and step-dad

But the thing is, my mom never cares until it affects my grades or chores. She never pays attention. So why should I care what she thinks. I shouldn't. But being angry at her gives me a yucky feeling in my stomach. But I know she doesnt care as long as I do what she wants. 

I hate it &gt;:( and it doesnt help that everyone in my house is either a cpulsive liar or manipulative so I always get walked all over cus I don't say no, and I'm too chill with everything
