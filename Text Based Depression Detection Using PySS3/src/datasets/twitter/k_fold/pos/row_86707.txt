I'm tired of those ka&amp;mawh&amp;re posts about wearing a mask and other type of shitty posts For fucks sake if you wear it and if  do you  want to be a responsible person you don't brag everywhere. Same with girls posting pics with themselves and those weirdos playing the nice guy card and saying"oh no the simps are coming".should i talk about those posts with coomers? I tough y'all hate pervs ? There's nothing quirky and funny about being a wanker and neither wearing an ahegao hoodie
