You ever look back at someone you had a crush on some time ago and be like â€œew whatâ€™s wrong with meâ€ It just happened to me. And itâ€™s with a girl I had a crush on not even that long ago, it was only a year ago. But damn, what did I see in her? She really is just meh, why did I fall so bad for her? Guess itâ€™s my idealization of people, but still, damn son
