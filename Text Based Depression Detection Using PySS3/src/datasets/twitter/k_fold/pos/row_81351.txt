here's a hot take for the people of culture Itadaki seieki is an overrated hentai, the scenes are ok, but there's better. and the girl just seems to be a mixture of other hentai tropes like vampire, femdom, and others, not to mention it getting even more blown out of proportion by people changing there pfp as her and thinking they are absolute comedic geniuses. and the story is just meh, overall review, 6/10 (hopefully this doesn't get taken down)
