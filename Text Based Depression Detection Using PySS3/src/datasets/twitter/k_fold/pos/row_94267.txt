Guys help I discovered I like this girl in my class (let's call her M). Long story short, I was thinking more and more about her but today I was reading to the class and she sent the clap emoji on zoom. Okay, not a big deal, but when she sent it, it snapped. I like her. She's in my english class too (in my school there are different english classes based on knowledge, for who is curious I am on the best one) and I linda pay more attencion to her. Any advice of how to approuch her? (Whe're still in quarantine)
