How many of you actually religiously follow style trends? If you do, is it by coincidence? As in, you just so happen to like the fade on the side/ mop top hair cut or supreme clothing separate of trend culture, or is it because you want to seem trendy.

If the latter, why? is it for attraction from the opposite sex? prestige? or do you merely want to look fresh. satiate my curiosity
