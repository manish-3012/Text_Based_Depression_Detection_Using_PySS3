Fuck TikTok, cause theyâ€™re bad! TikTok has changed my little sister life. Before she knew about TikTok, she was an innocent girl who love to play around with her family, especially me. Everytime we visit our village, she usually go play outside with her cousin and socialize with my aunts and uncles. Now, after she discovered TikTok, sheâ€™s no longer play outside or talk with anyone else anymore. She just... scrolling down TikTok videos all day long. Whatâ€™s even worse, she already posted 10-12 videos of her dancing and roleplaying and gets 5 likes. She has addicted to TikTok. She donâ€™t care about her life, her family, friends, her cousin, and her own brother (me). She even doesnâ€™t do her homework anymore. So please! Tell your brother and sisters to stop playing TikTok before itâ€™s too late
