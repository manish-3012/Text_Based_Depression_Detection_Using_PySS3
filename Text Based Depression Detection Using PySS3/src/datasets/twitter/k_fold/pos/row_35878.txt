The volume on my [16m] phone was accidentally turned up while watching an adult video with my mom in the next room. I don't know if she heard because she was in a meeting and the volume on her computer was turned up pretty high and the wall between the bathroom and my parents room is pretty thick. But what do I do if she heard?
