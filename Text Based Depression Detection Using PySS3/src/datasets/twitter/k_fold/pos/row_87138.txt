Dont get too inspired y'all I was motivated from different posts here that said things like "i asked out my crush" or "she said yes!"  So i figured i 'd give it a try after hearing all the good stories, but mine said no. My message is to think well before you make a move, consider your chances  high enough and dont make my mistake. Thats is thanks for reading have a good one
