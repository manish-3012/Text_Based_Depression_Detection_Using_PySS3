I wish I could ever be home alone I mean sure its boring but my dumbass brother keeps walking in to grab stuff (we share a roomÂ¹) even when hes occupying another room, then we have my grandma blasting neo-political podcasts at full volume on her phone because her dumbass cant bring herself to use earphones or JUST TURN THE FUCKING VOLUME DOWN. Like bitch just let me fap in peace once in a while. Cant even do homework in peace without my brother waltzing in, rummaging thourgh his messy ass shelf, not finding what he was looking for and walking back out. Shit's annoying as fuck.

Â¹ This is completely ridiculous. My parents bought this flat when I was 2 (brother was few months old) and decided to TEAR A FUCKING WALL DOWN so 2 rooms became one big room. We could have had separate rooms, my parents spent extra money tearing down a wall so we couldnt BEFORE WE COULD EVEN COMPREHEND THE WORLD. Tf did you think would happen MOM? That we'd never argue? My dumbass brother hates me to his very core and i cant do anything about it.

TLDR: My parents took down a wall and now I hate myself
