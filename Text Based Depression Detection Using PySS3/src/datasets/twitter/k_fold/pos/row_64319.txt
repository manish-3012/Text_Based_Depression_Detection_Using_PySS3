I had a good day I know nobody cares (not saying that for attention, this just isn't that interesting) but today I kind of took it upon myself to unwind. Online schooling obviously sucks and I've spent my last few lessons just going through my list of songs that I've been meaning to watch and adding to my playlist. 

Mainly Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole but I also forgot how good Joyner Lucas was and I've basically double the number JL tracks I have.
