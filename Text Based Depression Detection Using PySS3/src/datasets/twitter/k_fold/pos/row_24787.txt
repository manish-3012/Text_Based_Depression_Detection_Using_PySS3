I (18f) feel stuck i a relationship with my (21m) boyfriend, what do I do? I (18f) am six months into a relationship with my (21m) boyfriend. We started dating not long after i started my freshman year in college and sometimes i feel really weird about it. Not even mentioning the age difference. He was in a very serious relationship that ended maybe two months before we met so when we first hooked up i thought it would just be a one night stand/rebound situation for him. But he kept talking to me and he was really sweet so i decided i liked spending time with him. He told me that he had never felt a connection that strong before. 

We started dating about two weeks after we first hooked up, and i was pretty happy, until he told me he loved me two weeks into the relationship. It was going WAY to fast for me, and i wanted to slow down, but I said it back because i didnâ€™t want to hurt him. 

He says it all the time, and i enjoy the love, but he compares me to his ex all the time. He always says iâ€™m better than her but it still makes me uncomfortable. Itâ€™s not that he canâ€™t talk about his ex, i just wish he wouldnâ€™t compare us. It makes me really uncomfortable. 

Ive wanted to break up with him since december or so but whenever i am late to reply he always messages me things like â€œdid i do something wrong. iâ€™m so sorry, iâ€™ll do better. it hurts when you donâ€™t message meâ€ even if we donâ€™t talk for an hour. 

He and I are very open about our rocky pasts with mental health, and he has made it very clear that he is right on the edge. I fear that if i break up with him that it will really hurt him, and i donâ€™t even know if my reasons to break up with him are founded in any truth. 

What do i do?
