Five more reasons I'm not depressed 1. I accidentally summoned Satan and he's chill and 
    listens to me when I feel down
2. The Original Doom soundtrack
3. The screams of the children tied up in my closet
4. The 40 liters of pure human blood I drink everyday
5. The sweet embrace of my imaginary BF

Help I was kidnapped by some guy with 5 ovens which is weird because he has 5 fucking ovens.
