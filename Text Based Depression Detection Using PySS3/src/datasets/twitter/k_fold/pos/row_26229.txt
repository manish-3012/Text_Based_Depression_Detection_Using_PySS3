my senior plan just got done with a meeting with a counselor. basically i have to do credit recovery for two classes and i need a full schedule next semester. 

i think if they had told me that i couldâ€™ve graduated this semester i would have actually gone to class and passed. now i have to take 4 classes that i dont need to pass next semester. 

also when i was making my schedule a couple months ago they said this one class was a requirement but that class wasnt on the little document meaning it isnt required !!!! i was so stressed for nothing. 

anyway i dont care. when i finish getting the 2 and a half credits that i need im not going to school anymore. my gpa can be as low as i want it to be bc im doing community college. 

lol uh i dont actually know what im doing
