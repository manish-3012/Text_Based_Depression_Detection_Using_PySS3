Reviewing water every day until I get a boyfriend: Day 11 Day 11:

Today Iâ€™m reviewing tap water again. Thereâ€™s not much to say, its temperature was quite good I guess but it had a terrible after taste so I just yeeted it back into the sink... overall score is a disgraceful 2/10

Also have a great day everyone :)
