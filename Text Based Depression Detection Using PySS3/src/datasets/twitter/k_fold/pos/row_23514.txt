I just had a continuation of a dream I had half a year ago... I'd seen a dream that I traveled on a foreign country and, among all the things that happened I met a guy who I became good friends with and he helped me with deal with all the insanities that happened during the dream (not relavant). Half a year later I dreamt of calling him and we started catching up like old friends, with me telling him actual life events and him telling me... I don't remember really. It even had that starting akwardnes when you first talk to people after a long time, like, holy shit brain, I'm impressed.
