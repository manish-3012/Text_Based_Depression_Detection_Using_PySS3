2nd post of the day: Introduction Hey everyone. My name is Noah Ramos. I'm a sophomore, and I've built enough karma to post and I couldn't be more happy. A little more about myself, I love talking to people, I love helping. I 3d print stuff for myself and others, and I hope 2021 will be a better year. If you wanna talk I am your person to come to if you want. Can't wait for the future. Love you all.
