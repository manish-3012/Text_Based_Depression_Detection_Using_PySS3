Honestly want a bi boyfriend Like... something about bi boys is so attractive. Nothing against straight dudes. Maybe itâ€™s because Iâ€™m bisexual and thats why I would want a bi boyfriend? I mean I donâ€™t wanna date anyone rn, but if I ever date a dude, I hope heâ€™s bi    




Especially if he has a **fat ass**
