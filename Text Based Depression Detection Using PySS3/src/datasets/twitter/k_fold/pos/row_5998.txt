I lost all of my selfasteam and confidence in middle school From grade 2 to 8 I have been bullied and called ugly all day everyday. Girls would always run away from me.

I have been called good looking and stuff but I never believe them.

I rarely try to look good. Like fix my hair wear nice clothes ect.


In high school I had friends and female friends which was weird for me. I still haven't recovered.

I'm still fat as always and currently because of my job I had to cut my hair short like super short.

Because some kids were mean, god knows how many chances I had to be happy or whit someone and all of them were lost.

If you are mean to someone or bullying someone stop.

People like me take it to heart and spend the best years of there life not enjoying anything.

I'm 17. I had one long distance relationship. I didn't have my first kiss. I'm a virgin. I can't talk to girls irl.

Im sharing this for people younger then me to know other people are going through the same shit
