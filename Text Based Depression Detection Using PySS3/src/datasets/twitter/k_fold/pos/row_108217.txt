I just cant take posts about memes seriously. Now, don't think i don't like memes but there is this one small thing.

My main language is Turkish and in Turkish "meme" means "boob". So if i want to share memes on phone i can't prevent the meaning shift. Just imagine someone telling you "Hey i find so funny boobs today let me show u" it's ridiculously odd.
