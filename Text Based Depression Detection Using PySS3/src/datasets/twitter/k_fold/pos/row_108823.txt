I almost slept through a test There was a test during turkish class. After the class before it passed I was so tired I forgot that there were any classes and went to bed. Woke up an hour later,had a wet dream but that's not the point. The point is that I felt SO MUCH BETTER after sleeping. I slept for 6.5 hours that night and when I woke up I had a headache and was a little nauseous. Damn now I'm planning to fix my sleep by sleeping at 10pm and waking up at 07:30 am (my classes start at 8:30am) .
