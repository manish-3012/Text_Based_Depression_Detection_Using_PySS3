Do you ever wake up after moving thinking you still live in your old house and you wake up to the neighbors screaming at the top of their lungs in Portuguese and youâ€™re like since when did the Finnegans learn Portuguese. And then it registers that your dad got transferred again and You moved to From the UK to Switzerland again, And the new neighbors are not the Finnegans you arenâ€™t proficient in Portuguese yet so you have no idea what youâ€™re saying plus the fact youâ€™re 11 So outside of the unwelcome wake up call you really donâ€™t give a shit...lol
