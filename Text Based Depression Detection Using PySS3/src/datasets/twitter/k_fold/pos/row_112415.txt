My mom said that if she finds me on the computer again then she'll smash my head on the keyboard lol yeah right, stupid idiot is so ignorant she isn't ever going to fihstsfwbsysuw  shahs wiwbksywgdve shahs Syd use us sfe waywu

you see, this is humerous because as I forshadowed in the title, my mother; whom is quite irritated and exasperated at the fact I'll be using the computer, threatens to "smash my head on the keyboard", Which is an unorthodox and quite abnormal act for a  parent to do since it's an unethical way to punish a child, however it's seen in the text post im bragging of how she is of the lower intellect and oblivious to the fact that I'm using the computer, however I don't manage to finish expressing myself since I ironically appear to get my head smashed into the computer due to the fact that there were random incoherent letters, which leads the reader to believe that my head, did in fact get 'smashed in my keyboard' contradicting my earlier claim.

(This took longer than it should've)
