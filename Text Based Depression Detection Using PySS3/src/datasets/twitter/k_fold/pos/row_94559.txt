moms when going to relatives house/receiving visitors mum says "careful what you say ok? So you dont embarass your mother!"

And then go "REMEMBER THAT TIME MY SON SHAT ON HIS PANT DURING A SCHOOL PRESENTATION??? IT WAS SO FUNNY HE WAS BULLIED FOR 2 YEARS ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"

the amount of times parents humiliates anyone in anything public but goes "careful to not say anything bad" is actually disgusting
