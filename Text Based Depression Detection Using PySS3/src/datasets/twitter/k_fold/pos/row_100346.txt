Alright, so i am so fed up of the protests happening in the US, Iâ€™m not even from there. Today I learned that a black man walked up to a white child, playing in its front yard and shot it point blank in the head.
The news? Donâ€™t speak about it
Protests? Donâ€™t happen about it
The BLM protestors? Donâ€™t try to say that what he has done was wrong, and the biggest fanatics say that itâ€™s good that the kid got murdered, that more white peoples should be killed.
Holy shit, where is ending racism in that pile of shit?
