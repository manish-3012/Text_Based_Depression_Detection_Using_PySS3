People say my girlfriend (16) looks 13, and while she's only one year younger than me, a couple of people have pointed it out. What do I do? I'm 17, and while to me she doesn't look so much younger than what she is, some other people think so. She's basically perfect for me, but looks youngish. Like that I'm attracted to someone who looks younger, could it be a serious issue? I'll be deleting this soon, but I want to hear you people's inputs on this.
