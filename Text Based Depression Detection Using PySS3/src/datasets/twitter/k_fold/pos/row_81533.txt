Here is a song I started writing about suicide, it really helped me cope with the thoughts better to be honest Well here I am at last 
About to let all these painful memories go
About to not be a burden to everyone else
About to let everything goooooooo

Mom, itâ€™s time for me to go
I know you will be very sad
But itâ€™s for the better
We will meet each other againnnnnnnnnnn

How was that?
