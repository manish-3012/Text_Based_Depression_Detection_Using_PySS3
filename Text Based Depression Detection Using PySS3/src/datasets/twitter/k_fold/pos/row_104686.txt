Does anyone know where I can ask questions about like, mental health? Iâ€™ve been experiencing a very severe fear of being looked at lately (and I mean being watched by something like a supernatural being or a person I canâ€™t see.) and I really want to know what it could be (Iâ€™m not trying to diagnose myself off Reddit btw.. just seeing if thereâ€™s anything I can do) because nobody is able to help me anymore because I can never shake that feeling away.
