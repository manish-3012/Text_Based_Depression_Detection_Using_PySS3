Please stop with the politics This sub used to be quite good, but as of lately it and been spammed with politics. This sub is supposed to be about teenagers not about random politics. I just feel it has been really clogged up with political posts. I mean there are other political subreddits which you can go to but it's being brought here for no reason. It's not even that the politics posts are memes, they are just random statements that most people agree on, idk why they are clogging a teenager sub.
