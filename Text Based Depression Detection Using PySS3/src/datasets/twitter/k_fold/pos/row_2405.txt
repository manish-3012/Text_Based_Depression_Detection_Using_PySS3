how would you describe yourself if you were the main characterin a wattpad fanfic? probably be something like "i looked at the mirror and stared longingly at my hazel orbs, which turned into somewhat of a mossy green color when I was depressed, and turned this amazing cerulean blue when I was with him, my best friend who I totally do not have any underlying feelings for. As I broke off the staring contest I had with myself, I put on the baggiest sweater I had and put my hair in a messy bun" that kinda stuff
