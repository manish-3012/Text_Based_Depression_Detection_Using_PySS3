Need some thoughts My boyfriend thinks I'm too attached to him
Which is true 

But I feel like he sort of... Isn't attached to me?
Or we have different perspectives on things
When I feel sad, I want to talk to him
But when he feels sad, he says he doesn't want to talk to me
And I can't understand it. I want to make him feel better but he just says "you make me feel worse"

He asked for a one week sort of "break"
And it was okay for a day, but on the second day, a lot of stuff happened in my life and I felt like absolute shit
So I messaged him and asked him to stop because I felt really alone and I needed someone to talk to 

He said I was selfish and that he felt the same way(as in absolute shit), which is why he asked for a break in the first place 

I don't know how to feel about it. Am I really being selfish in not giving him space? I think I am, but is it also right of him to ignore me when I feel like I need him the most? 

I'd appreciate any opinions, thank you for reading
