I honestly think that the people who want to achieve equality should distance themselves from the BLM movement. Hear me out. I do agree that black lives matter, all lives matter equally, but when it comes to protestors mobbing a 17 year old on the street, beating him up and throwing a molotov at him- thatâ€™s just fucked up, so fucked up.
The guy was forced to defend himself with an AR, he had no other choice against 6 people.

So, i do strongly believe that the BLM Movement has morphed itself into an ugly stinking piece of shit and the people striving for equality should, right now, detach themselves from this movement. They literally have 0 credibility and respect left now after all the violence coming from people who put themselves under the BLM movement as an excuse for violence.

Thatâ€™s my opinion, what do you all think?
