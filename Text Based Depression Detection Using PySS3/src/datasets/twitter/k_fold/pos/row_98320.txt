So my friend(12) and I(13) got assaulted by a stranger yesterday First of all, no, I am not a karmawhore, I am putting this here because someone will probably say: "wHy ArE yOu UpVoTiNg ThIs He Is A kArMaWhOrE". Even if some of you still say that, i don't care, i just want to share this to everyone for awareness and caution.




Most of you might not care and think this is fake, but it isn't, if there is any proof you wan't to see I'll show you, anyways here's what happened.





So, yesterday, Me and my friend were going out riding our bikes, and suddenly, i accidentally hooked a guy with my right hand, we just continued riding but the guy was pissed off, few minutes later, We're waiting to cross the road and the guy( looks like He's in his late 20's, or early 30's) sneaks up and sticks his finger in my friends eye and runs off, since a police car was near we decided to tell them what happened, so my friend was off to tell the police what happened, while i was off to take a picture of his so they know how he looks, when i was going around him, the guy, turned around, almost stole my phone, and and slapped me so hard that i almost fell on the ground, other people were walking around and just stared at me shaking, i got to my friend, who was next to the police car, as fast as i can, explained how he looks since i saw his face for a split second, as well as my friend. And I'm still shaking today.






Now We're waiting to see if they find him, and if they do, since they probably will, we will sue him and send him to jail (atleast that's how i understood it). Even if they don't find him, the next time i see him i will beat the living shit out of him. Thanks for reading.
