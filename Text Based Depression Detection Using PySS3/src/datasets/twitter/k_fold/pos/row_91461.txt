Am I the only guy who likes it when a girl calls you dude/bro? My girlfriend calls me dude and bro, and I really like it. She's been doing that since I first met her, and it really helped me develop a personal connection with her, and that's probably why I asked her out only four weeks later. Does anyone else get this same feeling or likes it?
