Today I just realized exactly how motivated I am for football. I was doing my daily workout and almost gave up. It was a really hard workout, so I tried to pump myself up by talking to myself, and the moment I said I was doing this for football, that got me right into gear, and I finished the workout. I didn't know i was motivated by football that much until now. (American Football for all you non american people out there).

P.S: I'm not like a jock or some stupid shit. I'm just a big guy trying to move from being a lineman to tight end. I got hella hands and can catch the ball, but I am slow and hobbly xD
