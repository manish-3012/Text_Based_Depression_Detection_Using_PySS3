Adhd and medication As a 19 year old who was diagnosed at age 7 with *severe* adhd and has taken medications for it ever since... I think I somehow would have been better off without the meds. See I never learned to deal with my adhd, I just took the meds. I remember clearly as a child the doctor telling me that when I grow up I wonâ€™t have to take my pills anymore.... well that was a lie. 

Iâ€™m in college, college is hard, made it even harder by choosing the hardest course I could pick just because I was good in high school and was told that I could do it and it would open up all the doors for me after. I regret that so much. I donâ€™t have the ability to study like everyone else does. I have a window of roughly 10h during the day where I can actively study. Me studying at 9 pm to get the last preps for a test done just doesnâ€™t exist. I have to wake up at 3-4 am and plan taking my pills in consequence of the day if I want to just be able to study before the test. 

The â€œadhd generationâ€ I feel has been helped to fit in society a lot better, but... Iâ€™m a 19 year old whoâ€™s literally dependant on pills to make me into any kind of productive human. I was never taught how to just find ways to deal with it. I was just given pills and thatâ€™s it. My dad has adhd, never took pills and heâ€™s functional because he learned how to manage it.

Like yes, I most likely wouldnâ€™t have finished high school without medication, in a way Iâ€™m glad I had it. I just wish I had been taught other methods than â€œtake your pillsâ€. Thatâ€™s it. 

If anyone wants to add to my experience, feel free, Iâ€™d love to know your stories or tricks or tips. 

Just needed to get this off my chest mostly.
