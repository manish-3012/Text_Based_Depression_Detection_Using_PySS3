Youâ€™re probably not doing it for attention I struggled with this for a while, deciding that anything that I did was for attention. heads up, if you donâ€™t tell anyone, you arenâ€™t doing it for attention. I didnâ€™t realize that until my therapist told me, it sounds so obvious but it really got me down. Thatâ€™s all, remember you are loved.
