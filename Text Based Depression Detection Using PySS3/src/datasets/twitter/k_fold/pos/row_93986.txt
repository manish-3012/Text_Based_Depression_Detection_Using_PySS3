Dear Reddit: Iâ€™m gay Soooo. Recently Iâ€™ve been questioning my sexuality. Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that Iâ€™m a homosexual. All of my friend group knows, but my parents donâ€™t. I will tell them eventually, but I donâ€™t think they need to know yet. Maybe theyâ€™ll even find out on their own. Thank you for reading this âœŒï¸
