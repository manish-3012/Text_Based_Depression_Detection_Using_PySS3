Thank You Reddit for Everything!!!!!!  I know you were scrolling through some memes but if you have time then please just read this, I was feeling like I was depressed as I recently fought with my brother, and my games in which I worked really hard all of them were deleted for some reason, due to that I felt very sad, so I had an inner self saying me what if you are depressed, now as this situation I know I am not depressed as I am that kind of guy who let go everything like for eg. If I am angry on anything I will let it go really quick. So I knew it but still, I was kinda sad I told this to my parents. Then now what to do I was sad, So I opened up Reddit, and voila some memes made me laugh, and then I was no sad more.  
At last, I just wanted to say that you guys who post the memes are no less than a doctor as at this challenging time, you helped not only me but also many other people who were sad and felt like they have depression.  
**So I big thank from myself**
