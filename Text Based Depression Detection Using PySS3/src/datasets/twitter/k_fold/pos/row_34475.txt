Quick question to Snapchat users Ok so literally nobody here in my country uses Snapchat regularly, they only use it for filters to post on other sites but they don't use it to talk. Like 0%.

What do you do? Do you just chat with friends and send others selfies of yourself?  

I can understand chatting with friends but I don't understand sending selfies of yourself and others sending selfies for you. For what? :/

if I had Snapchat and someone sends me a selfie of themselves I might say "oh ok nice!", And i'll be quite weirded out because they sent me a pic of themselves for nothing. What do I even do with the pic tho :/
