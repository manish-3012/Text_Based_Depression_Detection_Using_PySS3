(M19) Was I sexual assaulted? 
So Iâ€™m a guy, and Iâ€™m not comparing what happened to me as rape: but a few years ago, when I was 16, I was on the bus on my way home from college, the bus was kind of full, so I had to stand, and this woman kept rubbing her butt up against my dick.
Every time I tried to back away she would get closer, with every bump she would inch even closer...Iâ€™d never felt more uncomfortable in my life. 
The bus was full, but not to the point she had to stand so close to me. 

Ps. Iâ€™m not comparing myself with women, as I know they, unfortunately, have it much worse than I do.
