My gay friend is not part of the boys now I have a small group of 13 friends and half of them are boys. We hang out a lot and make sleepovers frequently. But since one of my friends turned out to be gay, things started to change. My friends slowly stoped talking to him thru text (Not completely) and stopped inviting him to sleepovers. Things stayed the same until one of my friends made a group chat for the boys and noticed that our gay friend wasn't in the group chat. I asked why and they told me he wasn't in the chat because he is gay. I was mad, but I could't do anything about it. They now consider him as part of the girls and he doesnt know anything about the chat.

Edit: The things I talked about in this text where things my friends did, not me. Ever since he came out as gay, I have supported him and is still one of my best friends.
