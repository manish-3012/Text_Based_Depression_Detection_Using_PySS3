Advice about girls from a guy Iâ€™ve seen a lot of posts from girls giving advice to guys about how to treat them and I feel like a lot of it has been awful. I am an expert on women and pretty much a godlike figure, so I felt like it would be good to bless you all with 4 tips that will make woman ADORE you. So here they are:

1. NEVER BRUSH YOUR TEETH OR WASH YOURSELF! Contrary to popular belief, girls love to smell your natural body odors. So try to avoid cleaning your body in any way. This has worked so well for me that some girls donâ€™t even come near me anymore, most likely because they think that Iâ€™m way out of their league.

2. JOKE ABOUT THEIR PERIODS AS MUCH AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE! Periods can be annoying and cause lots of stress, so your job as a guy is to relieve them by making them laugh. The more you tell these jokes, the nicer and cooler you seem.

3. MOTIVATE THEM TO EXCERCISE BY ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR WEIGTH! Maintaining a healthy body is very important to anyone, but can sometimes be very difficult. By constantly notifying girls of their appearance and weigth you will help them get motivated to workout.  A method that I have always found reliable is loudly adressing their looks in front of lots of people. 

4. SEND. DICK. PICS. The most important way to make a girl fall for you is to constantly send naked pictures of yourself. This will show her that you are serious about having a relationship and that you are confident. 

 I hope that these tips will help you seduce the girl that you like. Donâ€™t be afraid to ask for more help by sending me a message. Good luck!
