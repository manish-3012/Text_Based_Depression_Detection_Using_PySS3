My mom's 'special friend' yelled at me Sorry for the long read. My mom has a 'special friend' who was helping us move in to our new place. Me and my mom were moving my matress upstairs since I was tired and then her 'special friend' decided to help us by just watching us do it. We were making a path to push the matress through and I am putting things in this closet and I see this little box I could put in another corner. I ask where my mom I should put the box and the guy yells "put it in the closet!" at the top of his lungs. My dad used to be verbally abusive so now when I do something wrong or get yelled at I have a panic attack of sorts and start crying so my mom wasn't going to fricking tolerate that. She whispered "don't say that." to him and she plans to yell at him before he goes home in the morning. He came back a few minutes later and said in the driest, most insincere voice I ever heard "I'm sorry, Mercury, I promise I'll never yell at you again". At first I thought mother had told him to apologize bit she told me she hadn't yet. We theorized about it and came to the conclusion that he only apologized so he wouldn't completely blow his chances with my mom (which he probably did). Also my mom called his apology lame. *Everyone* is mad at the guy
