I just..why? I haven't seen a another  person in like 3 months and I just got into a elevator with another person, I just wanted them to ignore me but HE HAD TO SAY "hi, how are you?" me with my social anxiety had to make an inhuman sound along with a "I- uh fine I guess" he just left after that. (he was my age and goosd looking) why anxiety?
