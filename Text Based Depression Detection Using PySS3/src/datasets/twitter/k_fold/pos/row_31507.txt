Need advice for tests Hey so, looking for advice. I have lived outside of my home country for a while before moving back this year, and my school in the other country does things quite differently. Next week iâ€™ll be having my first ever assessment to last over 1h30min (and that was one time)

I donâ€™t know what to do. Is there anything i should know? Any tips or just general knowledge? (btw, i live in norway)
