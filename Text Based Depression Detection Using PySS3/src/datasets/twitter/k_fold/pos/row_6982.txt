So this back 2 school thing is kinda dumb I have quite a few problems with the back 2 school plan for this year but these are just my major ones

1.mask are completely and totally optionally 
It doesn't sound like a bad thing but without an authority figure telling us what 2 do nobody is going 2 wear a mask so pier pressure is always going 2 lean non-mask

2.the alphabetical seating chart
I understand where they are coming from that they will have certain kids sitting with the same kids all day but that doesn't work when you have classes with different people all day so it doesnt make any sense

3.the "social distancing"
They try and space us out which is fine but it doesn't make much of a difference when it's a seat apart or anything under 6 feet it doesn't feel nessicary it just feels dumb and along with problem 1 it make the no no virus a lot easier 2 spread 

4.if you teacher come in contact with the Rona they dont have 2 quarantine they just go 2 school with mask on what do u want me 2 say that's just fucking stupid 

I don't know this just all felt rushed and unplanned we'll probally be out in a week stay safe and stay healthy peace
