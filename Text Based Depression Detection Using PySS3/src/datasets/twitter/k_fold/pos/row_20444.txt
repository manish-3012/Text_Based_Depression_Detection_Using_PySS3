If you are on this sub you most definitely grew up watching Spongebob. Nickelodeon decided after the creatorâ€™s death to go against his wishes and make a spinoff, Kamp Koral. While we can no longer stop the show from happening, we can however spread awareness. (continued in body) A little over a year ago I created a petition to stop Kamp Koral, Nickâ€™s newest piece of evidence that they only care about money and not about the show or the community. The petition got very popular, peaking at 75,000 signatures, and hundreds of thousands of views and shares. But it died down. Today I am bringing the petition back not to stop the show, but to spread awareness of what Nickelodeon is actually doing when they decide to make this show. Link to the petition right below this and Iâ€™ll also make a comment
