so, this started in 2019, where i got my first crush and, honestly, I thought that I could never get a opportunity with her but she was the best friend of my best friend so he present me to her, it passes the months and we started to "play" but she already have a boyfriend and I didnt know that, so she was like fooling him? when I discover that she had a boyfriend I stop to seeing her like a crush and seeing like my best friend, but she was using me to put jealous his boyfriend, so that put me angry and I stop talking to her, and like a week later that I stop talking to her she starts to cry in mid of a class and I was known like "his best friend" so all the class was looking me just to talk with she and making her feel good, so when I talk to her she said that she was crying cuz we were not friends anymore and that make me feel like a shit so we start to talking again and now it seems like she likes me, but I already passed away with that theme and just ignore that but it happens the same thing she just say that to put jealous his boyfriend so since that happens I just think that having a crush is stupid
