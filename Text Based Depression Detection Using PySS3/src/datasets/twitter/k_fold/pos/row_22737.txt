What they never tell you about drivers ed is how fucking boring it is Sure my friends said â€œoh its all common senseâ€ but this is so boring how am i supposed to endure this

Also does anyone know what i do after i do all the learning stuff like do i take a permit test and if i pass the questions they lemme drive or do i have to drive and then get the permit
