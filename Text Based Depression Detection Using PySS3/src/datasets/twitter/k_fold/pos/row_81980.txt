I don't know why I made this This is completely unreasonable and I know that but my brain won't let me not make this post because irrational guilt. So I've always lived my life in relative luxury and I'm extremely grateful for everything that I have my family and material goods. But for some reason my brain has decided it's my fault that other people aren't as extremely fortunate I really don't know what I was going to say about this but I'm thinking you can put the rest together honestly I don't know why I don't just get rid of this and not post it but here I am trying to apologize for something that isn't my fault God damn whatever you get the point I can't articulate it.
