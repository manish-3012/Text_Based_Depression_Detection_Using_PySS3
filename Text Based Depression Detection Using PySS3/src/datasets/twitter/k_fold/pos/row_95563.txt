Has anybody here taken a drug class before? So basically I got caught up in a huge legal situation and part of the evidence shows that I did and sold acid so now me and my lawyer have concluded on me taking a drug class so they can drop my charges entirely. Does anyone know what it's supposed to be like? Thanks
