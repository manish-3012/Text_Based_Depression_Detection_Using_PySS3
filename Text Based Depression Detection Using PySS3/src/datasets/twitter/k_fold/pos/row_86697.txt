Posting everyday until I get a girlfriend. Day: 25 Been feeling worse than usual today. Even more empty and useless. Itâ€™s come to the point where when talking with friends Iâ€™m just straight up honest about how Iâ€™m feeling horrible and wanna just end it all (Iâ€™m not gonna do anything stupid. I promise) but they always just take it as a joke.
