I live broski So a few days ago I posted a very dark and depressing post and at that time I wasnâ€™t in a very good place in my life. Now Iâ€™ve relatively recovered thanks to some great friends on Reddit and my friends in real life. If it werenâ€™t for them I wouldnâ€™t be here. Now that emotional side is out of the way, I hope you have a great day you sexy bastard
