I got offered an internship! You probably donâ€™t care but Iâ€™m telling you anyways! I was at my local museum yesterday and the director found out I do genealogy (researching your family tree) and offered me an internship! I start on Tuesday and Iâ€™m so proud of myself. 

Quarantine was difficult and now Iâ€™m with people and itâ€™s amazing and life is just going really well. Itâ€™s just a change for me because thereâ€™s usually something wrong but Iâ€™ve never been happier!
