I feel like what I do is never enough (school) Iâ€™m talking about school here. I swear I try my absolute fucking best but I still feel like an idiot. My parents expect all Aâ€™s from me and that can get pretty stressful. I study all fucking day for an exam and I get 21/25. That may sound decent but to me it isnâ€™t. I know this ainâ€™t anything new but I. Hate. Schoooooll. Thx for reading if u did.
