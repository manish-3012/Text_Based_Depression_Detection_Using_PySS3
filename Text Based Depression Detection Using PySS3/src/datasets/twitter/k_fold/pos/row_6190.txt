I wrote this for my crush but you can pretend I wrote it for you I catch your eyes
And dive right in
Swimming deep into your soul

With every stroke
I learn more about you
Drifting down until
I can no longer breath

Struggling, I fight my way back
Everytime I get lost
Finally, I break from your gaze

But instead of breathing 
I find myself 
Gasping
