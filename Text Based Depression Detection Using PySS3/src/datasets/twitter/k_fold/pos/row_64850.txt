This has got to be one of my better weeks I swear this week has been so good. I got 100% on my maths specialist test (it's the hardest subject you can do in my country so that's a big deal) as well as what is essentially an A++ on my English narrative. And then yesterday I got invited to a party. My medication induced depression is looking real weak right now.

Anyway thanks for reading me being proud of myself (:
