Survey for Teenagers: How Difficult is it for Young People to Choose a Career? (repost) (Note: Sorry for the repost! I just need 15-20 more respondents and I'll have enough data!)

Hi all, I'd like to design an app that helps young people figure out what they want to do for a career, and connects them with the right resources to help them achieve their goal.

First I need to know what's working in the school and family system, and what's not. What are the gaps that need to be filled? I also need to know what young people are struggling with, as well as what's helping them.

Here is the survey! Thank you in advance for helping me out with this project!

Please feel free to post your thoughts / feelings / ideas in the thread too, if you like! The more information I have, the better.
