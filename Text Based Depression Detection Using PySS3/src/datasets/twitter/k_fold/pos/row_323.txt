I need some help yâ€™all Ok so basically, I have been dating this girl for about 8 months and for the past maybe month? She has been texting me on and off for the week. Like most recently she randomly stopped texting me about 3 days ago and hasnâ€™t responded since then and Iâ€™m starting to feel like Iâ€™m pretty much single again. She mentioned her phone was broken which is believable because it is a few years old I think so I have no reason not to trust her there but like, am I just being paranoid or what?
