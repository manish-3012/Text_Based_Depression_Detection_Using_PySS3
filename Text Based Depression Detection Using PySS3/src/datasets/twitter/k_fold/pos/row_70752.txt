Iâ€™m kind of sad I donâ€™t have a prom also my parents get mad at me when I say I donâ€™t have friends So my school canâ€™t have senior night or prom because of covid. All the other schools can though. But, I really was looking forward to looking all pretty for one night and just having fun. I guess I wonâ€™t have that or cute prom pictures. I talked to my parents and they were like â€œoh thatâ€™s okay, weâ€™ll rent out a limo and you can do this and this with your friends!â€ Now that sounds nice and fun except....I donâ€™t have friends. So when I tell them they get mad at me and say that all I do is go on my phone and text people. Like ummm yeah I text strangers off of reddit. Anyways big sad.
