hi i need help. would appreciate if you read this all so iâ€™ve been having this issue with sweating and it wouldnâ€™t be that big of a deal if it wasnâ€™t for the fact that it literally shows on my pants. this only happens at school (sometimes public places like the mall, etc) btw and when it does, itâ€™s because iâ€™ve been sitting in my chair for a while and when i get up it shows on the seat and iâ€™ve check in the mirror a few times in the bathroom and i found that it also shows on the bottom of my pants as well. iâ€™m not fat i donâ€™t think but i do have big thighs and for a while i thought that was the issue but iâ€™ve seen people with MUCH bigger thighs than me sit down for the same amount of time and nothing happens to them even on the hottest of days (back in early september for example, and even in june). even on cold days, like in winter time, in the past itâ€™s happened. also i donâ€™t have that much hair in that area so it canâ€™t be that. before i made this post i had already searched on reddit for help in case anybody else had this same problem and many people were saying that baby powder and something called gold bond(?) works so i got the baby powder but it literally has not helped at all. i guess i wanna know if anybody had/has this issue here and what do you do to help it?
