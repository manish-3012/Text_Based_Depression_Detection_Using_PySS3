Help and emotional support needed in my exam Guys I have got an exam tomorrow and I really did not study shit. It was kinda my fault but not totally though as I was changing schools and got accepted in my new school literally 15 days ago, and I had a full semister curriculum to study, also I got infected with corona virus which affected my studying ability so much. I don't know what to do and I am having a panic attack right now and I thought it would help me to share this. Most probably I am going to shade Cs allover my bubble sheet and hope to pass.

Sorry for the bad english it is not my native language.
