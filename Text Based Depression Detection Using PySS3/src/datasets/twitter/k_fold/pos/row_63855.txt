If you have a telescope, Jupiter and Saturn will be really close together over the next few days If you like stargazing ðŸ˜³ If you're on the east side of North America like me it'll appear in the evening. Jupiter appears as the brighter object, west of earth's moon, and you might notice Saturn slightly above Jupiter, but dimmer (or you might not, they might appear as one)

So that means, with an average telescope on a lower power, you can get both planets in a single frame at the same time! You can see the 4 largest moons of Jupiter as well and probably a few of Saturn's too (maybe) if you look closely, all in the same frame.
