Two big things might happen tomorrow and I am not ready. Okay so I have depression, anxiety, panic attacks and chronic migraine issues which I have been dealing for past 3 years and my family knows it I take medication. There is whole other story around it which is what not this post is about.
 Anyway so I have told one other person about all of this and which happens to be my best friend but today I told one of my okayish friend I think and I am scared like shit. I have no idea what got over me we have not met over a year and today when me meet I tell her every thing and on top of that tomorrow is kinda her birthday get together what if she ends up telling people about it? I have not told anyone about and I am still not comfortable people knowing. Shit what the hell did I do??  I am so stupid and dumb.

Soo this is the first thing that might happen also I have my results tomorrow which will decide if I will become a doctor or not and the above said issues fucked me over. I know it's all excuses and I could have done better but I am not ready for the result. I am pretty sure I won't get the courses required for me becoming a doctor and shit I have no idea what will I do.
 It not that big of a deal now that I am typing all of it and the title is stupid and thanks for reading it if you have till here. Heheheh
