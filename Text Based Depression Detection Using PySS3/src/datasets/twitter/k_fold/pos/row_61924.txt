Just saw a notification that someone commented something and tagged me in a random post on r/mildlyinteresting?? (maybe my personal info, idk) Like I got a notif from reddit and I just saw numbers and opened it right up, I didn't even think lmao I am stoopid

They like tagged me in an igloo post (idk) commenting my personal info, but I don't know who they were? Lmao

I am pretty new to reddit maybe it was a bot or smth idk it got deleted right after..
