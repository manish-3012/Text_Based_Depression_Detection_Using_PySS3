â€œSanta isnâ€™t realâ€ I will destroy all non-believers with facts and logic. So lets say, hypothetically Santa wasnâ€™t real. Then Christmas wouldnâ€™t happen. How else do presents get put under your Christmas tree.

Iâ€™ve heard some other non-believers say that parents do it. Bullshit. My parents donâ€™t care enough about me to buy me shit.

Facts: 1

Non-believers: 0

Also, â€œhow would his sleight even fly? It defies gravityâ€. Thereâ€™s a phenomenon called the christmas spirit. When this spirit is channeled across the earth, it was the power to lift Santaâ€™s sleigh.

Now with all of this presented, all non-believers should be cowering with my abscess of logic. Itâ€™s ok, Iâ€™m glad I educated you.
