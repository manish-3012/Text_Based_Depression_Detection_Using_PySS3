Oh my Little Genius! My mom used to think that I was some kind of born genius or something because of this one time. When I was little I used to be obsessed with Tom and Jerry. We had the old Tom and Jerry movie in which Tom and Jerry are left alone in the house that's gonna be demolished. I tried to eatch the movie but the CD wasn't working properly. So, I took the disc and went to the computer and typed in the title of the movie which was already written on the disc, and i was watching it on YouTube.  My mom walked in and was like wait who put that on for you? I was like ummm...I typed it, I was kinda confused if I had done something wrong. She rushed in and checked what I had typed and saw that i typed the whole Movie name without any sort of mistake. She was like omg we haven't sent you to school either but you can read and write! I was like oh no I typ-...but my mom just interrupted me and was like omg omg my son's a genius! And after dad came home she was talking to him about how "smart" I was, and the next day when we met the neighbours or when she talked to her friend on the phone she would tell them that I was a born genius. Looking back ig it was kinda sweet of her, but now there's a shitty amount of pressure on me cause she won't listen that i typed in from the disc, and that I didn't actually know how to read or write, she thinks that I'm destined for greatness so I should work extra hard, and cause of that, no amount of marks I get is good enough. Like bruh...
