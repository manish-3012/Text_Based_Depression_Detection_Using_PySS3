Ok itâ€™s rant time, so extremely sorry if I annoy you guys. Letâ€™s see where to start, how about my never ending fears for the future.

Context: Iâ€™m a heart transplant survivor of 5 years and will continue to need medical treatment all my life.

Fear number one, Iâ€™m scared of one day Iâ€™ll need another heart transplant or heart related surgery, Iâ€™m now older and understand a lot more about what Iâ€™ve been through and what couldâ€™ve happened back then, now yes Iâ€™m extremely happy and grateful to be alive today, but the thought of having serious medical procedures done to me scares the hell out of me.

Fear number two, like most people in the world Iâ€™m scared of what is going to come within the next few years, idk if this is true or not, but a friend told me thereâ€™s going to be wars if either Biden or trump wins, and Iâ€™ve been watching an older show called M*A*S*H witch is a show depicting the war of the 1950â€™s in Korea and the doctors and surgeons doing theyâ€™re thing in a mobile army surgical hospital and i think it does an extremely great job of portraying what these men and women went through with any war, so yeah war scares me.

Fear number three, the world coming to an end soon, with climate change and the oil reserves being dried up itâ€™s going to change the world as we know it, Iâ€™m a gear head so I like the sound of a good sounding car, now call me old fashioned, but some of the cars made now are ugly as frick example Tesla cyber truck, not bashing on Tesla itâ€™s just everyone knows about the cyber truck.

Fear number four, not finding love, now yes I know we all feel this way and I will eventually find someone to love me, but in my eyes I donâ€™t exactly care who is my future wife as long as she understands my medical stuff and will cuddle with me every night, heck Iâ€™ll even cook when I get off work.

Fear number five, scared of losing my friends, I tend to get attached to them, theyâ€™ve always been there for me and I know I probably wonâ€™t lose them it will just be just someone I used to know kinda feeling, itâ€™s only now Iâ€™ve had friends tell me they cried over me because when I went into heart failure 5 years ago they thought I was gonna die and they cried some nights because of that, and itâ€™s only now I truly understand why and how they feel.


Anyways Iâ€™m sorry to have bothered you guys with my problems it just feels good to rant, when I first started typing this I was crying my eyes out, but know Iâ€™m calm itâ€™s like everything in the world has fixed itself, I hope you guyâ€™s have a truly amazing life no matter what life throws at you, you guys are strong, I know you guys will make something of yourselfâ€™s one day.

Anyways Iâ€™ve gotta get up in like 7 hours so I can take a dumb test, so good night I love each and every one of ya. :)
