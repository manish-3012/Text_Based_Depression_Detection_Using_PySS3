Could use some serious life advice here So I just turned 14 this year and I am also just got promoted to Year 9/Grade 9 every night all I can do is only think about how I will never experience the fun times again and my childhood and how I am getting old it feels like I was in grade 5 yesterday and cry over it and I just feel pressured and stressed that I am in 9th now and I am not as smart as 3/4th of the people in 9th grade should be and I won't be able to pass and the subjects just keep getting tougher and I might not be able to understand them and by next year I will have more responsibilities and stress and less time
