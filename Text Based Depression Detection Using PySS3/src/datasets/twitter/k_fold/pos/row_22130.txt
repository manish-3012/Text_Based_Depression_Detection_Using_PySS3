Do any of you guys also have adult (30+) friends? I know this sounds weird/sus, but I legitimately have friends that I talk to/work out with/hang out with who are in their 30s

It was never weird to me, but thinking about it, it does sound kinda weird if I were to see the relationship from the outside.

Do you guys also have these types of friends?
