Writing something positive about my day, day #290 Currently on the way to the airport so I can actually physically be at the boarding school Iâ€™m going to to and Iâ€™m really excited tbh. Iâ€™ve only ever attended this school online and most of the other students are physically on campus so Iâ€™m missing out on stuff and the time zone difference has meant I start school at 3:00 am so yeah, Iâ€™m excited to finally be going.
