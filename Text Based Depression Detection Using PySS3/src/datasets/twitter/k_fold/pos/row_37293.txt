Yall ever just have that one dream I usually have this one day dream where when I move out, I can make myself a Namco arcade machine using one of my old plug and play consoles. I already have 2 namco plug and plays and an old CRT but I need to fix the battery corrosion from both consoles. It may be difficult thinking about it but I dream about it anyway.
