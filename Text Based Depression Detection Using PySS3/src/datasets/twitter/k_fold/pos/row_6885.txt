I Got Myself Into A Situation You Probably Would Only See On A Sitcom I go to a private Christian school and my Spanish teacher always talks about her husband and his YouTube channel. We beg her but she refuses to tell us the name of it because she says he plays bloody video games. She makes up all they stories about how he streams and asks her to be apart of it. She says he has 20k subscribers and has sponsors. That part is the only thing true. After a night of searching I finally found his YouTube channel. And it was definitely not was I was expecting.

If you are familiar with the Anime's FairyTail, Hentai, Is It  Wrong To Try And Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon, and That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime then you probably know they aren't the most appropriate Anime shows. In fact, they are practically Anime Porn. And this is what he does. His content consists of Anime Porn, and looking on her FaceBook page, she watches it too. I have already told my friends and now I am faced with a dilemma. Should I tell her I know their secret or should I just keep it among me and my friends?
