I haven't felt suicidal/pointless since I was in 8th grade, but I started feeling so every other day after I joined this sub I mean, it cannot be a coincidence! Everything was kind of grate, but a few weeks ago I started feeling in a constant cycle of 

"I am so awesome/I hate myself/I am going to get a girlfriend and we are going to be happy/I look att he mirror and don't see myself/ I will have a good life in the future/ I would not be able so satisfy my girlfriend as I don't want to have sex/ I am not capable of having a girlfriend/ I will be forever alone/ I can be happy alone/ I will never do anything/ Is there a point to still being alive?"
