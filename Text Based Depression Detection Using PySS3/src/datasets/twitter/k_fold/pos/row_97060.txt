My dad's car is heavenly My dad has a Porsche GT4, and he let her drive it in a parking lot today, and it's absolutely amazing

Just the start, the steering wheel is great. It's just simple suede leather, no buttons, just a few stalks.

The car goes where you point it. It just knows what it wants to do. It sticks to the ground, and has instant throttle response, due to the naturally aspirated engine. The road feel is amazing, you feel every little bit of road through the steering wheel 

The gear box is my favorite part. It's a 6 speed stick, and it is incredible. The stick clicks right into place, and it feels impossible to click the wrong gear. It's truly amazing.
