This is just a rant (kind of), you can keep scrolling Im just done with my life, it just so boring, every day just blends together, I hate being alive and I hate myself, and I'm sure almost everyone I know hates me too, they only talk to me because they feel bad for me because I'm weird and not very social, I can't even keep a conversation going. I'm worthless, I don't even have any talents, and the nearest thing to a talent I have is drawing and I'm not even that good at it,

If you read this, sorry for wasting your time, I just needed to say this because I barely ever talk about this.
