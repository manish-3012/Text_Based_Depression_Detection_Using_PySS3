Day "I stopped counting after 200" of not going out aka quarantine I'm sitting here swinging my old Karate batton. I have no will to do anything. I'm tired and bored. I'll not make this post too long but long enough for it to be posted and I don't have to use the word "filler" again and again. Because, the word filler is really boring....yet again I'm really bored so I can relate to the word "filler". He and I have a few things in common so it's chill.
