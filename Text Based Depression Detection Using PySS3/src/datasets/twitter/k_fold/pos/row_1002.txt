To all the guys out there, remember: It's ok to cry :') Just a friendly reminder to all you guys (and girls!) that it's ok to cry and be emotional! So many people think it just isn't "manly" to cry, but that really isn't true. Bawl your eyes out, be emotional, be human. I love all of you reading this and have a wonderful day!!!
