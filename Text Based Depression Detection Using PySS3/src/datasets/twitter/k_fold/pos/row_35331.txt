Some people are acting like pets are a right and it deeply upsets me I was having a good day and just scrolling TikTok then thereâ€™s this one of a guy whoâ€™s cats in heat and heâ€™s trying to stop them from mating?
##THAT SHOULD NEVER BE AN ISSUE WITH YOUR PETS LIKE WHAT 
If you have cats they should be spayed or neutered. People in the comments are pointing this out and everyoneâ€™s just like â€œokay you pay for itâ¤ï¸â€ like no??
#if you canâ€™t afford to get a cat spayed or neutered donâ€™t get it??
There are so many cats in the world already who need homes and we donâ€™t need more people breeding cats especially when they have no background on their families. 
Same thing applies to dogs. Absolutely fuck adults who have un spayed and neutered dogs. I work and manage to pay my pets vet bills. Iâ€™m aware not everyone has the money but like donâ€™t get the pet if you canâ€™t afford it?? Obviously lower income people deserve nice things but that isnâ€™t just about them Itâ€™s about the pet. Itâ€™s just so stupid.
