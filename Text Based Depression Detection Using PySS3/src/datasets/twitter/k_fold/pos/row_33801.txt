I want this to stop. I guess tonight is one of those nights. 

I honestly feel exhausted. I don't know what to do anymore. I am tired of people telling me how I should find a meaning to my life myself. There is not. I will be forgotten in a generation, maybe two if I get lucky. Everyone I love will die eventually. I will be alone again. I don't like being alone. I don't think anyone really does. My boyfriend always tells me to be realistic, that there is no point on lying to yourself. One part of me knows he is right. I have been lying to myself for years, telling myself that everything is going to be alright, that I will be happy. But that is not the case. I can not be happy knowing nothing matters. I'm a really emotional boy, and I despise that with all my being. Giving someone like me feelings was the cruelest joke there could ever be. I wish I were dead, but don't get me wrong, I'm too afraid of dying.

Watching YouTube, or, movie. Reading a book, talking with my boyfriend, or with the last friends I have. Those are just temporary distractions from my reality. There's a void consuming me, tearing apart my being. It is a void which can not be filled, it can merely be left to grow.

I hope that in a few years I can look back and be glad that I'm doing better. But it seems it will only get worse, and worse.

I'm lost.
