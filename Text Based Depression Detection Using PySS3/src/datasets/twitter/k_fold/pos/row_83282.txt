I got my first ever girl friend, and Iâ€™m so happy! Last night I got dared by my friends to ask out my crush after losing a bet. So, after an hour after the dare, I finally got up the courage to ask her out. I texted her out of the blue, and told her how I felt about her. I admitted to liking her for a few years and how I wish we were together. Then she said how she didnâ€™t feel the same and that she just wanted to stay friends, which is cool because she is my first girl friend.
