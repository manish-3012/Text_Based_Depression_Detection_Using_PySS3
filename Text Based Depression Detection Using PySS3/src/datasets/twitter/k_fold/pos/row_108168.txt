I feel so stupid About a year ago for around a month I actually agreed with ben Shapiro (Abortion, Gay, Trans rights) I have now come to realization that the decision I made in listening and believing what he said was an inconsiderate thing. I have no idea how I believed in these lies that were centered around religion. Ben Shapiro is Right and when I took the political compass test my results were Libertarian left. The fact that I believed this is stupid, What did I do to myself
