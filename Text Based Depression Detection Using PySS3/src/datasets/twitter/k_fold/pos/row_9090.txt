This is the worst thing I heard in a while. So as some of you maybe know, fortnite wants to add FNAF to the game (animatronic skins or something). I don't believe it. Scott Cawton would never do such a horrible thing like collaborating with such a sh**** game. If it is true my feelings will be broken for Five Nights At Freddy's. We should make something like a tag on Twitter to prevent epic games from breaking such a masterpiece. What you think about that?
