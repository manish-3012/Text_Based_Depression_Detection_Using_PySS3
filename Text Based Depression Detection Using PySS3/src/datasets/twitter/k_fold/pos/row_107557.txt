Dc is actually a lot better than marvel in many ways. Iâ€™ll make it clear now that I like both companies equally, Iâ€™m simply going to state a few reasons why I think dc has advantages over marvel, a lot of these are my opinions. First off, they are way smarter when it comes to their comics. Comic books are often very hard for new readers to get in to, but dc has actually managed to have an advantage over marvel for a long time now. Unlike marvel, dc does a full scale reset of their universe every few years, in order to allow new readers to hop on and start from the beginning. Marvel has sorta done this before, but theyâ€™ve never done it to the same scale as dc. DC also has better movies, and I know that sounds crazy, but take into account all of dcs animated films, and then compare to the MCU. Heâ€™ll, compare the dark knight trilogy to any marvel film trilogy or hell the MCU as a whole. Imo, even though marvel releases several movies a year, only one of them is ever anything special. In all honesty, marvel movies are all mostly hype, theyâ€™re alright films but they arenâ€™t anything extraordinary. Then look at something like the Nolan trilogy, or the dc animated movie universe, all of which in my personal opinion are far better than the films in the MCU. Donâ€™t get me wrong, phase one and half of two of the marvel films were good, but after that they declined in quality. And also, letâ€™s not even mention tv shows, dc wipes the floor with marvel, I mean just look at the dcau. Again, Iâ€™m not saying one is better than the other, but both companies have their strengths and weaknesses, and dc deserves a lot more love, and I feel like the dc cinematic universe left a bad impression on people.
