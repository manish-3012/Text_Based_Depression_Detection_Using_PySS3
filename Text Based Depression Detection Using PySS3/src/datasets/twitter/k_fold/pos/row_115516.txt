a few opinions no one asked for but theyre here anyways 

this subs dry rn and i wanna debate so heres a few opinions that may be controversial:

pls keep it civil, and any personal or derogatory attacks will be blocked and probably reported :D

1) trans people (who have gone through both genitalia surgery and hormonal therapy) arent obligated to tell you theyre trans. 

take it this way: a trans woman used to be a man, that is in their past. no sane person is gonna go to every date and spill out all their hot juicy trauma on the table for you to determine whether you wanna date them or not. dont expect a trans person who completely looks and passes as a cis woman/man to tell you right off the bat that theyre trans. 

in a way, its kinda like getting plastic surgery. most times (if it goes well at least) you cant tell theyve had surgery. so unless you specifically ask â€œhave you had plastic surgery before?â€, that person otherwise has no reason to tell you, unless of course they choose to, which is completely fine. 

base line: if youâ€™re uncomfortable dating trans people (which i think is kinda okay, with some exceptions), just straight up ask people, dont expect trans people to immediately know that you dont wanna date them because theyre trans, we arent mind readers yknow.

2) cringe culture is the single handedly most annoying thing ever ngl. calling something you simply dont enjoy or are interested in â€œcringeâ€ is annoying asf. i wish we could go back to the days of â€œif youve got nothing nice to say, dont say anything at allâ€.

literally what benefit does it give to anyone to comment â€œlmao ur cringyâ€ or â€œcringeâ€ on a post of a topic YOU specifically dont enjoy, but others do? 

and yes i know you want to comment cringe under this post :|

3) most people here on reddit hated on tik tok before it was even widely known that there was spyware. this is mostly connected to my previous point, most people hated on it for being â€œcringeâ€. 

dont use that â€œit sexualised kids!!â€ argument on me, tik tok did not invent twerking, they did not invent lip syncing, they did not invent pedophilia, get your head out of your ass. 

if youre gonna hate on tik tok for supposedly supporting/advertising minors being sexualised, i hope you put that same energy into literally most websites/apps/forums/groups/videos/photos/compnies etc. on the internet. 

4) not everyone is able to get professionally diagnosed, stop hating on everyone who self diagnoses. sometimes there is genuinely no other option. yes there are people who self diagnose for attention and they are quite literally the scum of the earth, but dont generalise the ones who make the premise of it look bad with everyone else. 

5) fuck reddit, this place is a shithole with constant toxicity. not to mention the upv*te downv*te system makes it easy to not have an opinion and practically force people who care about k*rma to only comment widely accepted ideas rather than what they actually wanna say. 

ew this was so long im sorry, im just bored asf. ill probably delete this if the subâ€™s too dry and no one responds ðŸ˜”
