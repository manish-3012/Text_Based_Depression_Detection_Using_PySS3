I FUCKING FINALLY LEARNED HOW TO SHAVE Finally, thanks to my awesome Grandpa, I learned how to shave (which is a thing I didn't know how to do since I grew up without a dad) after months of practice. It really means an important achievement fo me, because it remarks how many times my grandfather has helped me in 16 years of my life. Thank you grandpa, I love you!
