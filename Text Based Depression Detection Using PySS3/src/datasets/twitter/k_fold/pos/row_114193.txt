I am a *totally* competent programmer Can't even fricking do scratch, i tried making a game but forgot to code the part in so that you can actually play it, i wanted to show it to my friends but yea.. It's broken and i can't fix it because I'm on mobile.. This sucks

Oh btw link if anyone here knows how to use scratch, they can probably fix it by doing "if flag is clicked" set "touched bullet" to 0
