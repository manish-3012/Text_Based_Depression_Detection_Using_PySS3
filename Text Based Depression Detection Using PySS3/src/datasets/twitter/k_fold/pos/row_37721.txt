I got locked out I guess Apparently one single thing I forgot is enough for me to get locked out. My brother had told me to bring in the trash can as soon as he left the house but I ended up forgetting about it. Iâ€™m usually pretty good on doing all of my chores but itâ€™s that one time I forgot to do so. I wanted to take it a bit easier today since I have work and wouldnâ€™t get home until around 11. My brother gets home and rushes into my room yelling at me why the trash can was still out. I try to tell him that I forgot and that Iâ€™ll do it now since I was already at the door but he just kept shouting. Anyway I go to bring it in and in that instant I hear the door close so I try to go back in only for it to be locked. Guess Iâ€™m out of the house for a while. Wonder what Iâ€™ll tell my manager if I donâ€™t make it on time?

I live with my older brother btw so any sense of authority goes to him.
