I need help So Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl since last year I never really talked to her if that makes sense a few days ago I gave her my number and we started really talking and Iâ€™ve found out she has abandonment issues like real bad and she has always been hated because she seems clingy but in reality sheâ€™s just scared of being left so does anyone know how I could help her Iâ€™ve got her to relax around me and not to be that afraid Iâ€™ll leave so if anyone has advice Iâ€™d like to hear it.
