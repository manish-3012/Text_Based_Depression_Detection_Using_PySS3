Why is life so hard Im 14, male,  58kg, 5'4. I honestly believe im very kind and people love to take advantage of that. This might sound unbelieveable but i also have anger issues, though it usually ends in me having a mental breakdown and nobody cares. My Father likes to take out his anger on me, and only me. Everyone loves my younger sister because she gets better grades. I also used to get good grades but that changed the day 2 years ago when my mom found out my dad was cheating. Alot of fighting and screaming later, they didnt get divorced but it still affected me badly in an emotional way. I think i might be deppressed and i have no belief in myself. My sister and i used to be best friends and i would share everything with eachother. Secrets and all that. But one day she decided to take advantage of it and started to blackmail me, saying she would tell our parents my secrets and i did what she told me to do because my parents already didnt trust me. Today i decided enough is enough and told my parents about this whole blackmailing thing. Instead of helping me out, they berated me and said that its my fault i shared secrets with my sister and that she is not at fault at all and im the bad one. I honestly dont know what to do i have locked myself in my room and i dont know how long until they come screaming to my door to beat me even more.
