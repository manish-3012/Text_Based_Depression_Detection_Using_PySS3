Happy DÃ­a De Los Muertos/Samhain! Iâ€™ve seen a lot of memes saying you guys are sad that spooktober is spooktover, so I just wanted to remind you that the spookiness isnâ€™t done yet! November 1st is DÃ­a De Los Muertos, or day of the dead, and you guys can still be in spooky moods by making Ofrendas and dressing up as Katrinas. Not only that, but Samhain started last night, and ends tonight, so you can still feast on your leftover candy with the Dullahan, next to a bonfire (or just your stove, remember to be safe!), and welcome the spirits of the other worlds into this one.

Staying safe doesnâ€™t mean the spookiness has to end! And neither does the end of October. So have fun!
