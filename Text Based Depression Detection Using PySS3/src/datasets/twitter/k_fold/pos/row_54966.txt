I might actually get a girlfriend/advice? Dude, for years Iâ€™ve been the kid with only a couple close friends, but no one else really liked me. Iâ€™m now in 10th grade, and a couple weeks ago my best friend started dating a girl in eleventh grade. They seem pretty happy, and I was happy for him. But last week, that girls twin (not identical) sister started talking to me out of the blue. My best friend says that apparently she thinks Iâ€™m cute ( :) ),  and to talk to her. Guys sheâ€™s really nice and we have similar interests and she from Romania and sheâ€™s really cute this is amazing. But I also wanted to ask, would it be kinda weird if we started dating too, since my best friend is also dating her twin (again, not identical) sister? He brought up the fact that if this was serious and they were right for each other, we could potentially be brothers in law in a few years, and that would be fucking sick. Anyway, I finally won one and I thought you guys might like to hear about it.
