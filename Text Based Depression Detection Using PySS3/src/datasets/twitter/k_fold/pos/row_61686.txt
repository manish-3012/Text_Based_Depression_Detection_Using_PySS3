I just had the best among us round ever.  So it all started with us finding deaths (i was crewmate), and eventually we pointed it down to lime. By this point only 5 of us remained. Brown, orange, pink, cyan, and me. Brown did an emergency meeting to make up a teaming system, brown would follow pink around, I would follow cyan around, and orange would be alone. If brown went missing with pink, it was pink, if I wnt missing, it woud be cyan. And orange couldnt kill because he wouldnt be able to take down 2 people. Then Brown saw pink doing a visual task which ruled out pink. Pink did a meeting to make up new teamings. Brown would go with orange, and pink and me would go with cyan. We were wondering around the place when we saw orange alone. Orange killed brown. We rushed to emergency meeting button, took out orange, and won. this all with randoms. the smartest randoms ive ever had
