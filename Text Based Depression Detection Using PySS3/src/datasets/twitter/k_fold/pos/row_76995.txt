Almost force fed I recently went to mc Donald's for breakfast and I wasn't really hungry. I asked my parents just for a hashbrown because I wasn't a fan and plus I was on a diet. They refused and ended up buying be a bacon egg and cheese my griddle and orange juice with the hashbrown. I was pissed and when I "finished "( i hid it in a non transparent cup)  I was going about. I did ate the bacon and eggs but I still felt terrible. Then they asked if it was good and I gave them this look like wtf I'm not hungry . Then they went about on my attitude and how they're gonna take away my privileges. 

I do exercise and they're trying to excuse it by saying I can burn it off SMH. That's not how exercising works.
