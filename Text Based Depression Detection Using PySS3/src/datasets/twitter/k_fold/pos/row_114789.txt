why tf am is my brain so dumb my mom asked me if i wanted to go to the store with her. i said nah, i would rather chill and stay at home. she said ok, sheâ€™ll be back in 40 minutes just to grab a few things. she left and my brain goes â€œbro what if she gets into a car accident and fucking diesâ€ and bruh i straight up start crying ðŸ˜Ž. so i call her and ask if i can go with her, she says no, sheâ€™ll be back in a bit. so i get even more sad. why tf you gotta be a fucking pussy, brain? bruh
