Day 365 of recommending songs I like to r/teenagers: Anniversary Edition https://youtu.be/sMmTkKz60W8

I've been planning this song recommendation for a long time. It means a lot to me. Happy year everyone, here's some fun facts

Fun fact #1: I've missed 10 days of song recommendations, so technically day 365 was 10 days ago.

Fun fact #2: On day 217, I recommended Burning Down The House by Talking Heads. I did this because a fire was coming dangerously close to my house at the time and we almost had to leave. Luckily, it was put out before any damage could be done.

Fun fact #3: I try to upload each song recommendation at 12:22 in the afternoon. I don't know when I started doing this, but I know I've been doing it for most of the time I've recommended songs.

Fun fact #4: There's a very inconsistent rule I adopted very early on, and it's to spread out songs that sound similar or are the same genre. I did this because I didn't want the songs I was gonna post to become predictable. I think the closest I've recommended 2 songs from the same band was extremely early on with the band Pain, and those songs only had a 3-4 day gap between them.

Fun fact #5: I have YouTube premium, meaning I can download videos. Almost every song I've recommended I have downloaded. As of writing this, I have downloaded 2,390 videos, all of which are music. The number isn't exact because I've downloaded some songs twice, but it's pretty close.

Fun fact #6: This series has encouraged me to find and listen to more music. So much that one time I listened to 8 albums in 7 days over the summer. Those albums being: Foxlore by the Crane Wives, Volume 1 by Amigo the Devil, The Wall by Pink Floyd, Honky Chateau by Elton John, Era Vulgaris by Queens of the Stone Age, Fragile by Yes, 90125 also by Yes, and Is This It by The Strokes. I liked each and every album, and I've listened to many more albums since then. 

Fun fact #6.5: I've also found my favorite song of all time because of the new music I've found. That song is Catch The Rainbow, by Richie Blackmore's Rainbow. 

Fun fact #7: One time a guy dm'ed me asking me to make a small playlist for him. This made me happy :)

Fun fact #8: This song recommendation has been planned for the better part of a year now, because it's a song that means a lot to me and why I love the music I do.

Fun fact #9: On day 35, I recommended a whole album, meaning I've actually recommended 372 songs.

Fun fact #10: I don't know when or how this will end, but I think when it gets to the point where I'm just recommending songs by the same bands over and over I'll just recommend everything I have to speed up the process. But that won't be any time soon. 

That's all the fun facts I can think of. Thank you to everybody who checked out one of my posts, I hope you enjoy the music.
