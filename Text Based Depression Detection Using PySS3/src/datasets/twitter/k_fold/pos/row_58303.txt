I am a dead man walking. &amp;#x200B;

Today someone hit me on my head. I stabbed him with my pencile and he proceeds to hit me on my head even more but with much harder punches. The teacher comes and sees this

she calls a higher up teacher which then talks about it with me. I lied so that it made it look like i started it but god damn was that stupid as hell. I thought I could form some kind of a deal with him

but no, i bet if i asked him he wouldnt even take it into concideration and would just joke about me being his bitch.

after that he tried scaring me more and more while we were having class. I wanted to just go home in my bed or on my pc just watching something and forget about it all.

We then went home, he went with his "boys" and i dont know what he did but he was still in the school, i thought: "Yes! this is my chance to run!" so i asked my friend to drive me home on his bike and now here i am

I think that the bully probably was speaking to the princible but i think that the princible thought that "he is the victim" while he was annoying me the entire time.

honestly I feel like killing my self and never having to go back to school. online school can be fine for all I care.

thank you for reading it feels good speaking this out here, I honestly dont know what to do anymore and I will probably delete this post
