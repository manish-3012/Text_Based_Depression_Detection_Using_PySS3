The most decent girl in my class is now awkward whenever she is around me. My class is 60% girls and most of them act sexual, are plain stupid or hate me (the last one is fair, but still). The most decent one that is not any of the 3 and I sat next to her for half a year was actually learning more about me and I was actually making friends with her. No romance or anything like that.

One day my friends (rare. I know) and I were joking and suddenly we made inappropriate jokes near her and ever since then she just tried to avoid us and always brings a friend along for protection. We noticed this and we didnt do anything to stop it we just let it slowly continue until our relationship was awkward.

So I apologised and my friend also apologised and she said something I never expected. "It's fine. We're not even that close"

Ladies in the subreddit, what does this mean. I am dumb in social interactions.
