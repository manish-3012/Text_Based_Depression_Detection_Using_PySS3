Days 41 and 42 (?) of recommending songs to the bois Um so I may or may not have forgotten to do this  yesterday so here I am with multiple songs. 

Gotye feat. Kimbra - Somebody That I Used To Know

Any of you remember when this song was popular? I totally forgot this song existed until earlier today. Still hits hard. 

Ellie Goulding feat. Juice WRLD - Hate Me

Well I canâ€™t say I saw this collab coming. A little more pop than I usually like it but still good.

Bandlez feat. Armanni Reign - Heretics

I donâ€™t know how I found this. I just know that I love it so much. Can someone recommend me more music like this? Goddamn. 

Zero - Leave The Light On

SO UNDERRATED OH MY LORD. This man is incredible.
