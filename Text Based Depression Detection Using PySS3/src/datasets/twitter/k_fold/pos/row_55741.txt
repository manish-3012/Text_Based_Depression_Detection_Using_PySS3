I donâ€™t like that some people here canâ€™t get obvious satire/sarcasm I comment on a meme with something a buzzkill would add, added at least 10 emojis and tried to sound as sarcastic as people.

Yet I got a woooosh, downvoted and told that I didnâ€™t understand the joke.

*sigh*, some people today smh
