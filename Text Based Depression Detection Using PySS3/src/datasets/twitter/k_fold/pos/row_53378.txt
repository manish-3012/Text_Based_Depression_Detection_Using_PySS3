A good friend of mine interned herself in a depression facility that's suppose to help her get better. Today, she asked me for a razor. For confidentially reasons I won't share why she is here, but she has has a pretty serious problem that marked her. She interned herself in the facility a few months ago, and since, nobody has heard from her. She was a good friend of mine and I hate to hear she is doing awful. 

Today, a few minutes ago, she texted me to **sneak in a razor** (obviously, you can't have one there) "because she needs to shave her armpits". I told all her friends to be careful and if she asks them, to make up an excuse, but I can't figure out what I should really be doing. What would you folks advise?
