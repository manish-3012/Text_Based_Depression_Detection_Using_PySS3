So I was on my phone all class and at the end of class the teacher walks up to see my work... And I had nothing open on my laptop and I told her it was done but she wanted to see so I opened my browser and went to the page and I tried to tell her my laptop was bugging and I sneakily hit alt f4 but it DIDNT work and she saw I had nothing done

In the next class I tried again and it turns out I have to click fn + alt f4 AHHHHHH

Now my math teacher is mad
