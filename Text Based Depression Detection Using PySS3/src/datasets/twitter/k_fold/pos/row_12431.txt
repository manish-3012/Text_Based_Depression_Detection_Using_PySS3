I'm close to edge Alot of things have been going on in my life and it's like everytime I start to bounce back from my suffering something comes along and fucking kicks me right in the balls, like seriously why do I exist if I'm just here to suffer no matter what I do, I know its pretty cause there is people out there starving and homeless and who have lost loved ones but seriously why is everything in my life completely and utterly fucked, I  have approached my parents about my constant anxiety and depression and u wanna know what they fucking say "Everyone feels like that at ur age, it'll pass", it wont fucking pass cause I've been like this for six fucking years, fuck sake, things were starting to get good as well, I asked out a girl she said yes, then 2 weeks later she breaks up with me then I approach another girl who I absolutely love to fucking pieces and she airs me, literally didnt even say anything just ignored the fact that I said that I love her, honestly I'm fucking finished with life now, the only thing from stopping me from grabbing a rope and ending it is my fear of death and thank fuck I have that.
