I have no idea what Iâ€™m going to do with my life. 1. I have no idea what I want to do yet and Iâ€™m going into senior year. 

2. My family is poor so Iâ€™m either going to have to spend a lot of time making money to go to college or just do something else. 

3. My girlfriend who I donâ€™t even think cares about me is going to go off and fulfill her dream so I wonâ€™t get to be with her if she even wants me.

4. Iâ€™ll never get treatment for my depression.
