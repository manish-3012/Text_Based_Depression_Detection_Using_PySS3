Job interview fail So I had a job interview at McDonaldâ€™s, and I walked in and talked to them and the employees said the manger just ran out and would be back in a bit.  So I waited for ten minutes (super nervous as this was my first interview).  The manager arrived and interviewed me and it went really well until the end.  She said she was going to hire me and asked if I could come Wednesday for orientation.  I said sure, and she said I needed to bring a few things, she listed them and all was good, then the final one: proof of age......Apparently Iâ€™m 1 year too young to work there.  See you McDonaldâ€™s in a year! Wa wa waaaaa
