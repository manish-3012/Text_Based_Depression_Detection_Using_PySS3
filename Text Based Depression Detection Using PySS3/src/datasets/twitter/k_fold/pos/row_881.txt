Iâ€™m very socially awkward how do I make friends I met this guy at school and he actually reached out to me first and started talking to me, it was during a biology lab and it made me happy af cause Iâ€™ve had no friends for 2 years and nobody barely notices me. I wanna be his friend cause heâ€™s funny and heâ€™s super chill but how do I not seem pushy or cringe
