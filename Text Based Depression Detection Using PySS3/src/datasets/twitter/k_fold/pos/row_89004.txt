Me and my online friend had been working on an online community type thing for MONTHS and some cunt who used to be friends with my online friend somehow DESTROYED THE ENTIRE THING. I donâ€™t know how he did it but the whole thing is permanently down. Iâ€™m so fucking annoyed. And now I have to go to online school. WHY. WHY WHENEVER I ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING OR DO SOMETHING GOOD LIFE ALWAYS PUNISHES ME FOR IT.
