Today was my â€œSweet 16â€ Sorry if my flair is wrong, but I think its the most appropriate one, anyways on with my post.

Today was my birthday, specifically my â€œsweet 16â€ I didnâ€™t really do much today, and I guess I feel... kind of disappointed? Itâ€™s not like I really have any friends or am good at socializing so I couldnâ€™t have a birthday party anyways, but still not doing much other than getting Dennyâ€™s has left me feeling like I didnâ€™t get the magic of a birthday, especially one thatâ€™s typically considered on of your landmark birthday (your 1st, your 10th, your 13th, your 16th, your 18th, and your 21st are the ones I think are typically the big ones.) my birthday is almost over anyways (itâ€™s 11:31 PM here) so Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m really posting anything, but I kind of just felt like making a post somewhere where others may understand. Maybe Iâ€™m just getting older or something and birthdays lose their joy with age.

Anyways, thanks to anyone who decided to even just read this far, I hope everyone else has a more fulfilling birthday this year and onwards, and that this week turns out well for everyone! :)
