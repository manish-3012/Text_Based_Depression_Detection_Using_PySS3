Anybody wanna be friends/penpals or vent? If your venting I'm best with philosophic and family related things, not the best with relationship advice but I'll try. I come from a pretty dysfunctional family, so that's where i excel.

If something is bothering you and you wanna talk, even if its just the way your parents look at you, I'll listen. I want to hear what you have to say.

For friends/penpals, a bit about me

I'm a 14f, ace/aro, freshman, American (I'm partial to people from other countries, but I'd love to talk to my fellow countrymen, women, and gender neutral/fluid knights as well), and I'm a coffee addict. My music taste is all over the place, as are my thoughts. I have depression and ADHD, and I'm a paranormal investigator/cryptozoologist. My favorite thing to do is learn. Also 80s movies

My style is also everywhere, but I'm always wearing a pair of Converse and from that you can probably deduce I'm a skater. I'm not necessarily religious, but if that's your thing, then that's alright. Your choice, not mine.

I'll talk to any race, ethnicity, gender, age, etc. If you're somebody who discriminates for any reason, dont dm me. I have no interest in you whatsoever. 

I've mentioned this before, but if you start a conversation with "hru," dont. Tell me about your passion, why your little sister is pissing you off, or how you're gonna change the world. Describe your favorite memory, what home is to you, or who you want to be. I'm here for that.
