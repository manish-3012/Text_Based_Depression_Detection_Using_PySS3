Well I'm in a bit of a pickle So I just recently got a gf for the first time a couple weeks ago. We've only gotten to see each other twice bc I have a busy schedule and she has a strict dad. Meaning we haven't rlly gotten all that close. Just texting. Well yesterday I found out that her best friend that happens to be my friend too, who happens to be the one who introduced us, has had a crush on me the whole time. Now my gf feels extremely guilty and I was told by one of her friends that she feels so guilty she wants to break up. I have already talked to her friend that supposedly had a crush on me and she seems fine, nothing is awkward between us at all. I don't get why she feels so guilty abt it when its rlly not a big deal. And breaking up wouldn't even solve anything bc I'm not gonna date the friend out of pity, i'm not into her like that. I rlly hope she gets over this bc I haven't even kissed her yet and I don't want to break up already over something so small. Thanks for reading my rant I can't talk abt this to my brother cuz he'll call me a simp so this is the only place I can get my thoughts out.
