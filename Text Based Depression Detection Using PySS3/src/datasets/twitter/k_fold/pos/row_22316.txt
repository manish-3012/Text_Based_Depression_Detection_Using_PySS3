day 2 of giving y'all girl advice until everyone stops posting about how single you are hello friends im back. so today i wanna say that you should literally be yourself. Girls have fake friends already (don't come at me boys can have fake friends too) so they don't need another fake person in their life. Plus,, if you have to change yourself for a girl, she's not worth it. And girlfriends aren't mandatory when you're a teen so there's no need to rush. Just be yourself around girls and you will find one who really likes and appreciates you. I wish you all the best in your girl hunting. mwah
