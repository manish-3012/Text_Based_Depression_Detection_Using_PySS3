Schoolâ€™s giving me massive anxiety. I need your guysâ€™ honest opinions on whether Iâ€™m smart or not because I honestly feel so stupid whenever Iâ€™m at school... Iâ€™m going to keep it brief, but I go to a private school ranked 71st in the nation. Iâ€™m a sophomore taking four honors and an AP, and this semester, I have three B+s and two one A, and one A+. Writing that, those donâ€™t feel like bad grades, I feel like my low self confidence comes from the peer pressure every one puts on each other... I also got a 1250 on my PSAT this year, I didnâ€™t study at all, though, so next year Iâ€™m going to prep like hell to try and get National Merit. Since none of you know me personally and donâ€™t feel a need to sugarcoat anything, please give me your 100% honest opinion on my standings. Iâ€™m so not gunning for top schools for college or anything, Iâ€™m honestly just hoping to go to a really good, small, liberal arts school.
