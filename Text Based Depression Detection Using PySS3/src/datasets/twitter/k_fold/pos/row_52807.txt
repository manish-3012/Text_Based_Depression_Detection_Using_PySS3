Got back into my old hobby I used to make cardboard weapons for example I have a sword a giant butcher knife a scythe a shoulder guard a shield and like 15 explode on impact popsicle stick throwing weopons  and I just made a giant boomerang and added yarn strings at the end like tassels it's great throwing weopon that I just made today amd started playing lord pains theme and challenged my brother to cardboard war so I'm think of some new ideas but I'm lost I dont really need a theme just a new weapon or something to add to the weapons it's really a very fun hobby and pretty cheap just buy a big pair of scissors tape a pencil and sharpie and your set was originally a war we were gonna do 2 years ago but never we went  through with it with  three freinds so I'm going to ask my friends to make weopons and armor and just have a group chat to post new stuff we make so as I said any ideas?
