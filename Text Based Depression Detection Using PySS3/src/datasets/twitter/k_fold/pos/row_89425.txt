I get to play minecraft instead of going to school school My school picked me to join some meeting for smart people and because of corona we are doing the meetings online. We get divided into groups and have to present a project. The thing is that project can be built in minecraft.
So basically I get to skip school to do smart people stuff in minecraft for 2 days :)
