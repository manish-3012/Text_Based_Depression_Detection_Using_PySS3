I want to talk about self harm for a minute. **Trigger warning** well i am talking about self harm, not really going in any graphic details but still, i may dip my toes into depression scuicide ect.. so i am not going to suggarcoat things if this can be a trigger for you i recomend finding another post. Stay safe kiddos

Also second warning. I am just one teenager online. ***I am not a proffesional*** this is mainly from my own personal knowledge on the matter 

Why am i making this post ? I think allot of people donâ€™t know the extent of what self harm is and or why people do it. So i wanted to talk about that. Again. Not a medical proffesional. I am talking from my personal experience and from what i read online.

**1) what is self harm ?** 

This may seem like a dumb question but honestly itâ€™s one of the reason why i wanted to make this post in the first place. Honestly self harm has been ascosciated with cutting way too much nowadays. Self harm at itâ€™s core is simply well.. "self harm". And that goes way beyond just cutting, yes cutting hurts like hell and is one of your most damaging and dangerous options thatâ€™s why itâ€™s talked about allot but hiting yourself, scratching yourself, eating harmfull things, hiting things with no protection to cause harm... basicaly anything that you do to harm yourself. Honestly if i cought my concerning behaviors and talked about them before it became "too much" to talk about i could have saved myself allot of pain, this is why itâ€™s important to talk about.

I know this may sound dumb and obvious. But it may not be obvious to everyone.

**2) why self harm ?** 

Again may sound like a stupid question but itâ€™s something not everyone understand or realise.

*Self harm is not nescescarly used with scuicidal intent.* In allot of cases itâ€™s more of an unhealthy coping mechanism. If one of your loved ones self harmed that does not imidiately mean that they are scuicidal. Like i said. An unhealthy coping mechanism. itâ€™s used as an escape, so what they try to escape from can come with things like depression and scuicidal toughts. But it doesnâ€™t mean that they are.

**3) what to do**

This one is one to take with a grain of salt. Because i am not a medical proffesional. And everyone is different. But in the end itâ€™s important to make use of your own judgement and knowledge of the person 

Self harm is a touchy subject for the one who inflict it upon themselves in allot of cases. So itâ€™s important to be sensitive. Show care but donâ€™t push for answers. Be gentle. If you cought someone self harming (especialy if itâ€™s some form of self harm with severe physical effects ie bleeding) they are likely in a fragile state and itâ€™s important to remeber that.

Self harm doesnâ€™t come out of nowhere so there is an issue and or a reason behind it. There is a reason why someone feels an itch or a need to hurt themselves human brains arenâ€™t made to hurt their host body without a good reason. So talking to a proffesional is important. Talking to thoses close to them is important. 

Remeber that self harming usualy starts in small mudaine ways, it usualy escelates from "more gentle" form of self harm like scratching ect... So if you do that to yourself itâ€™s *very important* to talk about it. Because even if it isnâ€™t really harmfull... there is a reason why you feel the need to do that. And the reason behind it canâ€™t really ever be good.. it may be a mild problem but even then itâ€™s good to take care of it before it becomes worse.

Itâ€™s something serious and itâ€™s very important to talk about it. Remeber that there is always help. 

So thanks for reading my post. I know some things may sound obvious. But for the few that it may help, itâ€™s there. I sure do wish my past self would have tought more of some things.
