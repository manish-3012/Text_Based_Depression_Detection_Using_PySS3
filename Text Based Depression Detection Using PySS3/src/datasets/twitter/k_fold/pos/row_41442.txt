Honestly idk if I should tell a close friend of mine this Did I hear talking shit at 1 am because no one else will listen to my insane ramblings and Iâ€™m slowly pushing myself down a hill Iâ€™m not getting up from. No? WELL TO FUCKING BAD. Today I was a bit in a bad mood so I went on a 5 mile walk to clear me head. Would be nice but I walked somewhere and I nearly jumped and kms. Not smth Iâ€™m proud of but Iâ€™ve gotta get it off my chest. I honestly donâ€™t know what stopped me it wouldâ€™ve been one step half a step even. I just donâ€™t know man. You probably donâ€™t need to hear this. Honestly idk if Iâ€™ll tell you this. Guess weâ€™ll see at 2 am. Iâ€™ve considered this for a solid 3 mins so basically 5 hours right? Eh Iâ€™ll tell ya I need this off my chest. You donâ€™t need to hear this tho itâ€™d just be more stress on you. I canâ€™t tell my therapist this so here we go. 

I feel like I should but feels kinda selfish. Idk man
