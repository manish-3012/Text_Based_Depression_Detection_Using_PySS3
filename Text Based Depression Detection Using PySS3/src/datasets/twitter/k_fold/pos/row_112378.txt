i dont think its going to get better i sit here on reddit for hours and hours, days and then weeks. it distracts me but also is the only thing i can do, leaving the house is a privilege i have lost. i see peoples stories, their humor, their traumas, their faces, it all disgusts me. i am so mentaly broken that EVERYTHING i see fills me with hatred, and hopelessness. i am so vile, so unhuman, so fucking gone. nothing brings me joy.

i had a girlfriend, it didn't give me joy

i (was pressured to) had sex, it didn't give me joy

when i see a beautiful girl, i feel like shit

when i talk to people i feel gross

when i jack off it feels bad (lololololol funnyyyyyy cummmmm hahahahha)

and jesus christ i hate myself 

so i sit here, confined to my room for months feeling my mind rot more and more, i wish i could just feel sad, sadness is great compared to this fucking decay.

please someone talk to me SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, i feel like i am screaming into the void whenever i post something like this.
