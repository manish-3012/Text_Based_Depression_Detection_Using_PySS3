Is it just me or is it weirdly uncomfortable when they use shirtless kids in advertising Like some of them got their chest and nipples and everything all zoomed in like damn chill 

Im not attracted to kids but like twinks got the same body type. And my eyes "muscle memory" was like zoomin in at first like woah. And then was weird when it's a kids face ðŸ˜·
