My school is being stupid again My school thinks 20 people can get an internship (sorry if google translate fucked it up) in one and a half weeks. Like seriously, how the fuck will anyone accept someone to basically work there in one and a half weeks and during corona! And now my teacher wont even respond to me when it starts. Also how is a kindergarten supposed to just let some random kid in and think nothing of it? Or the dentist. Or any other doctor like job. This school annoys me on many different levels
