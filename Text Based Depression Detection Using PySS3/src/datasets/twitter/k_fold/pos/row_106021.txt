Just finished watching Avatar the last airbender and I gotta say this show really deserves being number 12 in the list of every show of all time on imdb I knew i was missing out on something very important but it was even better than i expected, the animation, the plot, the character Developments, the fights, and basically EVERYTHING. It made me laugh and made me cry and made me want to punch *some* characters through the screen. Not to mention the cutest fictional animals ever. 
In short, if you haven't watched it, you're really missing out.
