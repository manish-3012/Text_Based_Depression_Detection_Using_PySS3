So I wrote this poem for my crush and sent it to her on anonymous email... Truly your beauty is like none other 

And truly richer than those of princesses and queens

For in their beauty they boast an flaunt

In which it is now less worthy than even a grain of sand

For truly even in your modesty your light shines brighter

Brighter than even the moon and the stars and the sun!

For even they are envious of your being

Your skin is comparable to bronze and your eyes like diamonds

Your lips as roses and your hair, pure gold

But truly even these things of great worth are incomparable to you

Why then does my heart grieve?

For it is not your love that causes it to grow cold but perhaps a lack of

For truly every moment with you is bliss

But every moment in absence is suffering

Why then must my heart love you ever so stubbornly?

For it is hard for a peasant to be with a queen

Yet even in knowing such my heart endures

It cries out, and is yet ever so shy

For truly rejection is comparable to death

But so innocently my heart loves you

With not even a glimpse of deceit I so righteously persist

For truly I seek no other

And for this reason, I ask only for satisfaction

For truly like you, there is none other
