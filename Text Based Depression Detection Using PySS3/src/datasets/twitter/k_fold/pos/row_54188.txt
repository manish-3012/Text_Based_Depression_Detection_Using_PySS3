Mom threw a glass bowl at me It didnâ€™t hit me it hit the counter and she said she meant to hit the counter not me but I was standing right there so I donâ€™t know but the glass flew everywhere and I tried to run outside maybe to a friends house but she said if I do she will pull me out of my college and Iâ€™ve worked really hard t get there so I need to stay in 

I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore I know Iâ€™m a bad daughter and I make my familyâ€™s life a lot harder but I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore I donâ€™t know what I can even do I guess just lie here and wait for time to pass me by until January when I can finally go on campus except she probably isnâ€™t even going to let me go anyways 

Iâ€™m sorry mommy I love you so much and I know you love me and everything you do for me I just donâ€™t want to fight anymore
