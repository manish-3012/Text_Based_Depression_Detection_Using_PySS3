Anyone else have a lot of facial hair and get mistaken for being older cuz of it I had a full beard since 16 , and people always thinking im 20 something. It kinda cool being thought of as older. But it sucks cuz when i try talk to girls at parties or night club they think im a nonce unless Im with my friends.
