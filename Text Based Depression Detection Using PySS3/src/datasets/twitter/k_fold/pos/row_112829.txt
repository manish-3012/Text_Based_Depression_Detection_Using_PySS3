Cooking tips &amp; tricks for all teenagers who find themselves alone at home Greetings, I'm Nuri, and as someone who has lived 80% of my puberty on my own, I'd like to share something crucial for other teens when they find themselves at home alone.
Cooking. 
There's no excuse for being trash at feeding yourself, and no matter what, one day you'll need to eat more than just quick noodles and pre-heated meals. 

While I would love to just dump all I had learned about cooking, I'll restrain myself by just giving some slight tips, and if I get enough attention, proper cooking lessons that won't leave you fetching for dinner/lunch/breakfast.

1)Boiling pasta:
For the love of God, stop slamming your pasta in a pot with water and burn it for 30 minutes. What kind of savage are you? 
Instead, fill a pot with water, let it boil (You'll know when it's ready, bubbles will form and explode all over the place), and sprinkle some salt in it (a small pile on your palm will do for a single portion). *Then*, and only then slam down your pasta (To measure quantities, just fill an empty plate, but not fully. If it's spaghetti, grab a fist of it, and that's it). Let it cook for 9/10 minutes for maximum deliciousness, and make sure to regularly mix the water to avoid having your pasta stick on your pot. 
2)Sauces, the real deal that gives pasta some flavor:
Oil, tomato paste, half a glass of water, a slice of garlic is all you need to make a good pasta sauce. Salt and rosemary if you want to treat yourself like a king, and minced meat if you want to conquer the world. The secret to a good tomato sauce is *To let it fucking cook. Low fire, start preparing it in the morning, and you'll get something edible*.
Mix it often, so you don't burn the damn sauce, and keep an eye out if you see that the paste is becoming too liquid or too solid. When you see that the sauce is "spotty" (lots of empty spaces), add a little bit of water and tomato sauce. If it's too liquid, let some of it evaporate. Smash the garlic with your fist, or using a spoon, but don't slice it or drop it as it is. It's the right balance (I hate garlic, but you'll see how greatly improves the taste of any salty dish). 
Golden tip in case you burn some of the sauce (If it's black, don't eat it bonehead). A drop of milk will cover the burned taste, and it's a nice addition to the sauce. 
3)What condiments go where:
-Oil, preferably olive oil, is used to either not make your meat stick on the pan, or to give your dishes some extra substance. Only a spoonful, because too much oil sucks ass;
-Salt is what you use to flavor anything that is not sweet. It actually works when baking sweet stuff but only if you put a pinch, making your dishes much more... "Interesting".
-Rosemary is what you dump over meat to treat yourself like some Roman Emperor, and it's tomato sauce's soulmate;
-Pepper should be used with discretion. But it pairs well with anything except salads. Stuff that you are going to eat hot should be hot, and pepper might be a neat trick to make dishes that went cold feel " hot" (For example, that steak you didn't eat yesterday);
-Garlic (Fuck onions) is a nasty tool you deploy to add flavor. Slam it with a spoon, or with the might of your hand;
-Butter, just like oil, gives substance to dishes. Goes obviously well with sweets, but paired with oil, might make your dishes taste better(Except salads pt.2);
-N u t s, that's what you put in salads. Trust me, they make all the difference;
-Milk is used only when you make creamy sauces, and when you want to cover up the stuff you burned, like the savage you are, also useful when cooking chicken;
-Last but not least, the god amongst them all, and my main tool to make my pastries and cake taste better. H O N E Y. Unlike sugar, it has its own taste, and it's a literal upgrade except in terms of money. If you used honey over sugar, to sweeten anything, and to bake stuff, you'd live a happier and longer life.
