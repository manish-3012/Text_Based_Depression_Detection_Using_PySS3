I Got Banned From A Discord Server Due To Pedophilia **To Clarify:** I did not â€œgroomâ€ or did any act that would fall to the same category as it. I am a underage individual and I know this isnâ€™t a topic I should joke about but still, yeah.

Sorry for my bad england, on mobile etc. you know the drill.


So I was in a roleplay server on Discord, doing casual stuff and fooling around. I was known as the â€œhorny guyâ€ for some obvious reasons, I got my first warning on day one due to sexual content (which was just some horrible copypastas), I wasnâ€™t serious at almost any moment. You got the picture. So a converisation started between 2 guys as a joke that a character was a child and to act appropriate around him. So the conversation was going and I decided to bomb it with my great humor:

This Guy: You know he is a child right

Me: Fine for me

This guy: kiddy cummer gtfo

Me: Kiddy Tiddies ðŸ¥µ

As dumb I am, I decided to leave the message there. 10 minutes later, my friend pings me on another discord:

Friend: Well Done

Me: well done what?

Friend: You managed to get banned due to pedophilia

Now everything hit me at that moment, but I couldnâ€™t help but to laugh my ass off due to the events, getting banned from a wholesome roleplay server on day 4 due to pedophilia.

TL;DR: Got banned from a discord server for writing â€œKiddy Tiddies ðŸ¥µâ€

Now if you read so far you are free to judge me. Thank you.
