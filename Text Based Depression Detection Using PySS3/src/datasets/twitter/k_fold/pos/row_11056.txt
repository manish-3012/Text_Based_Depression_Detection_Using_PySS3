We got in an argument ..and... Me and my boyfriend got in an argument this morning (like most couples do) and we put each other on the silent treatment for a few hours because we werenâ€™t at a point to receive what the other one was saying. I got in the shower and came out to this. I know itâ€™s nothing huge in gesture, but we havenâ€™t talked it out yet and he still lies my pjâ€™s out for me. He still cleaned the kitchen a few hours ago, hung up my laundry that i was going to do, and vacuumed the living room and the stairs. Things arenâ€™t always perfect, but he never stops loving me and showing me.
