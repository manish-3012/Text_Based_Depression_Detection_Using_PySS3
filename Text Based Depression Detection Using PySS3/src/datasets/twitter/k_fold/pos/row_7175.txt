Is this wierd? So, basically, I'm a big fan of true crime. One thing, however, some images I cannot look at.


For example: the black and white true crime photos I can stomach. Like the victims of Jack the Ripper, Elizabeth Short (Black Dahlia), the axe murders of Lizzie borden's parents, etc

But the colored images, I just can't stomach.
