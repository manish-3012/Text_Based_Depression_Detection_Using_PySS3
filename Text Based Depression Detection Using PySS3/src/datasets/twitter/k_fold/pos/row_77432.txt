I have started a book club for teenagers like me, looking for more members.  As the title says, I have started a fun hangout with other teenagers who enjoy reading on Discord and we have around 15 active members. We're currently reading "Scythe by Neal Shusterman" (fantastic book so far!) If you are interested in joining or want to know more about the club, feel free to message me, thanks! (Only teenagers)
