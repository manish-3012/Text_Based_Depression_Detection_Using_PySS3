My boyfriend canâ€™t sing Ok so I was playing the game with my boyfriend and all of a sudden he was like â€œlet me sing to you I can singâ€. So of course Iâ€™m happy because I thought he was actually going to be good. Yâ€™all when he started singing it was so bad that I thought he was joking at first but noo he kept singing for like another 2 mins. Iâ€™m just sitting there trying not to laugh the whole time. At the end I told him he was so good and that I loved it lmaoo. Is there any easy way to let him know that he canâ€™t sing without hurting his feelings?
