If you could go back and time and do ONE thing, that you have the ability to do by yourself, what would you do? I would steal the Pen from Thomas Jefferson before he writes the Declaration of Independence and write:

#â€ð“¦ð“±ð“®ð“· ð“”ð“·ð“°ð“µð“ªð“·ð“­ ð“²ð“¼ ð“¼ð“¾ð“¼â€

Then the British Empire will collapse.
