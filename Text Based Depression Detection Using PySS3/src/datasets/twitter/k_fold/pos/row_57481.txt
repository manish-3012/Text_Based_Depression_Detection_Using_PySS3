My brain is square and I hate myself That's all. Like nothing else. Thank you for reading. Good bye.


Jk the actual reason I'm not going to vent is because I don't want pity. It makes me uncomfortable. I do hate myself and feel like I'm undeserving of love, but I don't want people to know that because they can and will use it against me. Yes. People have used my thoughts and mental state against me. 

Not talking about my problems doesnt fix them but it also doesn't add to them! :)
