You can scroll, this was more for me than anything. But putting it down feels as though itâ€™s helping. I am never able to sleep because every night I lay down and my brain runs and runs and runs for 3+ hours every time. I know a lot of people, and a lot of people know me. But I still donâ€™t have any friends. Iâ€™m not unique. Iâ€™m average. Very average. I used to have sports. But now I donâ€™t. Best thing about me is Iâ€™m very smart, but that doesnâ€™t really matter. I, feel. Insignificant. And even though this is categorized as an existential crisis and is very common it doesnâ€™t make the emptiness leave. Idk, I feel Iâ€™m losing emotion. Iâ€™m definitely not sad, but Iâ€™m not happy either. However I do feel I have found a passion, dirt biking. I have rode almost my entire life but have never been good and itâ€™s been an on off thing. However I went riding today, and I feel it helped me. Just a solo ride around for an hour or two with music in. Idk. But I think Iâ€™m going to continue on this path. I feel if im able to pull myself out of this â€œmoodâ€ thatâ€™s lasted way too long then maybe Iâ€™ll end up going back to the old me. The me that was happy, the me with friends, the me that I liked.
