I'm like 97% sure... that I'm a disappointment to my dad. so I called him today a while ago and he was like what's up, whatcha been doing. and obvi I was like I'm just vibing playing minecraft with some friends. me and my dad do not have the best relationship but we are chill I think. and he was like well have you been outside today it was pretty nice and I was like no I haven't left my house all weekend. and he sounded so disappointed and everything he hung up 3 minutes into the call and I dont call him for another 2 days amd I dont see him for a week. idk I just feel like a disappointment to him but that's fine bc I'm making me happy.

thanks for reading my tedtalk have a good night/day and be careful

sincerely,
