I need to stop telling bad jokes in my class's chat. I'm in chem and the teacher asked how many electrons is in an electrically balanced phosphorus atom, which is 15, so I said "number 15, burger king phosphorus. The last thing you want in your burger king burger is somebody else's dirty phosphorus. But as it turns out, that might be exactly what you get." Nobody appreciated it :(
