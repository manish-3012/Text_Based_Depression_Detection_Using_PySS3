I think a kid in my class is 10 years old.... So Iâ€™m my agricultural science class itâ€™s a all grade class which means there are 6th to 8th graders in that class but thereâ€™s one kid in particular that looks like heâ€™s 10 I really am suspecting that he is but idk how to find out what his age really is, he looks short maybe around 5â€2 ish. I have to go teachers mad
