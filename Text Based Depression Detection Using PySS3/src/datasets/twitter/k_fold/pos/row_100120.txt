Am i an addict? So I was telling my friend about me going through a rough time and the topic of addiction came up. He asked if i was addicted to anything and I said masturbating i guess jokingly. He kinda went on a rant and explain that he is basically no fap. I mean i guess doing it everyday could be bad. Am i the only one who does it so often?
