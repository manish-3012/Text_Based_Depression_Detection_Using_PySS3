I have started to like my best friend and i am in a fix what to do    About a month ago i broke up with my gf, i was really stressed for the first week but then after that i was fine but from the last week i am having a strange feeling for her(my friend). I mean its super weird for me because i never have these kind of feelings for her. I don't know what to do and the worst part is i have no one to share these thoughts.
