It's been 6 months since we've been in lockdown and i'm starting to lose my sanity I'm really starting to lose like half my sanity, it's been 6 months here in lockdown, and even though I'm more of an introvert it's really lonely.

it's even worse because there's been a heatwave here in Britain the past few days, and last night was 24C (75.2F for Americans) which makes me too hot for the covers and so I twist and turn in bed until 4 AM, at one point I even started to have a sleeping schedule where I would fall asleep at either 3 AM or 9 AM. Half of the time I can't sleep at all due to the extreme heat in my room, and we don't have aircon in this house.

I would open the windows but that would let flies in my room, and I have a terrible fear of anything that buzzes anywhere near me in fear that it might go into my eye(s), mouth, ear(s), or even my nose.

I haven't had any social interaction with any of my classmates because I just ended up leaving my online classroom. It's probably because most of my classmates are absolute idiots and I can't keep up with the work at all because of my simple-minded nature. I can't have too much on one plate or I'll vomit and throw it all in the trash.

I also generally don't like being outside at this time due to the bees, wasps, and flies. It's also because of the really hot weather.

I really had to turn 13 in early 2020, didn't I? Talk about an introduction to teenage years.
