Please don't bully Please in all seriousness do not bully. I have an amazing friend, but she has ZERO self confidence, thinks sheâ€™s fat (sheâ€™s not) and ugly (once again: sheâ€™s not) because she was bullied in 1-5 grades. I just wanted to say, please, if you ever have an opportunity to make someoneâ€™s day, or break it, say something nice. It doesnâ€™t have to be something huge, just, â€œnice shirt!â€ Or, â€œhave a good day!â€ Please guys I know we all have social anxiety, but letâ€™s make sure the next generation doesnâ€™t.
