Yakuza 0 has some amazing karaoke songs, sure, but Kiwami 2's karaoke songs make me feel some shit. Shiawase Nara Ii Ya makes me cry bc im getting flashbacks of how Majima can never be with Makoto and you can still hear the pain even hidden behind all the chaotic energy he's putting out (being Majima, you know, he's batshit insane). Zetsubou Cho Pride is basically what would happen if Judgement from 0 sounded metal asf and instead of Nishiki backing up Kiryu it was Majima.
