Feeling depressed M16

Not actual depression but i've been feelin sad cause im not doing anything productive in my life rn.


Like i literally wake up and start online school which lasts like 4 hours, and for the rest of the day im mostly on my phone doing absolutely nothing(youtube,music,social media...) or playing video games on my xbox. Its the same cycle everyday and i feel like im wasting my time and my life lol.

Does anybody know what i could try doing at home thats actually productive ? (Other than working out because i know this one)
