Be vigilant guys Today I just learned how shit my parents are.Today I learned that whoever comes in this journey of life , thereâ€™s just gonna be one person at the end, me. I learned that nobody gives a shit about me unless they need something.People lie.They stay with you for privilege.Iâ€™m not saying that Iâ€™m the purest soul on the planet, I wouldnâ€™t give a shit about you too. But remember to achieve what you want and enjoy everything in life including shit people.
