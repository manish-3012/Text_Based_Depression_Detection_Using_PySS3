I've seriously, never felt happier in my whole life. Some of you may think that you have the best girlfriend, or boyfriend, or nonbinary or whatever the f elsefriend because I don't want people to feel left out, but it's physically impossible for there to be multiple bests, so I'm sorry to say that my girlfriend wins. Better luck next time. I'd say I'm rooting for you but we all know I could care less.



On a different note, for any single people reading this, I hope you find what you are looking for as soon as possible, I hope you can find the endless supply of happiness I have found as well.
