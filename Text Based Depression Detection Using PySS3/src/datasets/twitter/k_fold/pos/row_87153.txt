So... I have to rename my discord server. I need help finding a new name A little about it:

It's a Jurassic Park themed server for Jurassic Park Fans.

Its current name is Jurassic Discord.

I found out today that there was a much older and considerably larger server with the exact same name.

Some things to consider:

I want the name to by eye catching and be pleasant to say.

It needs to be around the same amount of letters as "Jurassic Discord" because I have to change my logo, and would rather not have to come up with a whole new design.

It has to make you think of Jurassic Park when you hear the name.

Any ideas?
