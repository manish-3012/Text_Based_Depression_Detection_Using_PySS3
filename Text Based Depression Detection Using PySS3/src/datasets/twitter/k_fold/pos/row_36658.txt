This happens bout once a week I'll be sitting in bed, enjoyed my time off watching something and then one of the characters will say something and I'll get sad. I'll start thinking about losing my grandmother, my mom, my dad or stepdad. 

I'll start sobbing like a baby imagining things that haven't happened yet, and I'll be like: "I should say I love you more often." And then I think about how I'll never see someone again.... and life is meaningless when you think about it. What is there? A couple hundred hours of joy but other than that? Just loss, pain, sadness and disappointment. 

And then I'll remember I have school the next day and be like: FUCK I HATE SCHOOL
