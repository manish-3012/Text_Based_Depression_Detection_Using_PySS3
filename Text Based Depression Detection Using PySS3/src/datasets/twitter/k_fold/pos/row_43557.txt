Its so stupid when people consider mask mandates â€œ1984â€ 1984 is nothing like mask mandates. Most people who believe have probably never even read or heard of it until recently. It was literally made a democratic socialist. Doctors and surgeons wear it so much longer than these people its laughable. Critical thinking and rationality is dead in anti-maskers. People are so fucking braindead. I think I need a break from the internet...
