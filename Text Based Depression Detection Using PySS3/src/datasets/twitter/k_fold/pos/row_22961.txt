does mental illness get better? it has ruined my life for 15 years. the only thing that itâ€™s done is got worse. i canâ€™t live like this anymore. iâ€™m a slave to my own brain. iâ€™m not strong enough to tell it no. i canâ€™t keep the thoughts away. i live in fear of what will happen to me. my brain says iâ€™m disgusting every other second, tells me iâ€™ll get kidnapped if i see someone drive by, iâ€™ll get murdered if i sleep over at someoneâ€™s house, that my dogs will die if i touch them. that iâ€™ll never amour to anything. i canâ€™t take it anymore, i want out. i want to be my own person, i want to live, i want to be fucking normal.
