Best way to meet new people at this time? School is 100% online and I literally have no friends. I don't know how to meet new people when its a big zoom meeting and everyone can hear your convo. Not to mention I am the nerdiest of nerds that hides in his room all day playing Monster Hunter and reading about Paleontology. The only thing I can talk to people about is my pet chinchilla.

(Here he is with our rabbit [https://imgur.com/gallery/FynVYUQ](https://imgur.com/gallery/FynVYUQ) And our 2 birds.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/pERQFQZ](https://imgur.com/gallery/pERQFQZ)) 

Does anybody have any ideas on how to get to meet people? I could really use some help.
