Hey I had a question about something Hey so I am depressed as hell.   
And honestly I think I just canâ€™t do it any longer and am seriously considering just dying as I feel like that would be easier then living. And yes I donâ€™t care that itâ€™s the easy way ya out and that I am a coward.   

But I am curios people I have talked to say that worrying about all the people in their lives who would be sad and stuff about you if you killed yourself and well I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t care if they are sad or Brocken by my actions cause I will be dead so it wonâ€™t affect me I will be in the void and they could cry there hearts out but I would be dead so why should I care.   

Do people think this makes me a bad person or what.
