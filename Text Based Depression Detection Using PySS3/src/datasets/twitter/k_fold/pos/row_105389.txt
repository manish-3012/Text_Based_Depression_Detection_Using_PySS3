What should I do? So last week I told Sara (from my last post here) that I like her and she liked me back and I was ecstatic for a day or two, until she got electronic restriction for the weekend lol, and during it i sent her a semi-long (think 6 lines on a fullscreen discord chat on a laptop) message basically complimenting her and telling her i miss her and so when she returned yesterday morning she saw it and had a pretty neutral, frozen (from her description) response and since I've been sending her a lot of medium sized messages trying to make conversation and she's only responded in like one or two word responses?

She's said she isn't mad or something about the message but her behavior has changed from the norm and im still scared i fucked up. what d'you think happened and what should i do? I don't want to be silent because i cant do that i like her too much lol i don't want to ask her about that because that sounds complainy and a couple much smaller things have already popped up and i feel like im being too complainy and i don't want to do nothing because i want to know what's up, what should i do?
