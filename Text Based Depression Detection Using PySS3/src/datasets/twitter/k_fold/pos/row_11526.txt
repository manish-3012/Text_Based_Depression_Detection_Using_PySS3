I might delete this later So few days ago someone on the reddit pm me and told me to add him on discord and we talked for a little bit. Then she told me she's a girl and I said ok then after 3 days she told me to rate her thighs. I was like whyyy? She said she feel very insecure about her thighs so I agreed. I regret doing that because she literally send me her thighs with underwear and I felt uncomfortable and later she told me she's transgender and I blocked her ("Not because she was a transgender I was just telling you guys what she told me")Hey if you are seeing this I ONLY AGREED TO SEE YOUR THIGHS NOT YOUR UNDERWEAR.
