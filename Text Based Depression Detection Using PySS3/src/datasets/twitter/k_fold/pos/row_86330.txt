There were a lot of moms protesting quarintine in my area This was at the start of quarintine like 20 years ago
They all were like â€œopen school!â€ 
They didnt do it for their kids grades or anything
They were clearly doing it cause thry hate their kids and are annoyed withem
Most protesters had teenagers
The reason you want them in school is not because of grades but BECAUSE YOU ARE A BAD PARENT
You clearly raised them poorly if you hate them in the first two weeks
