I really wanna take a boy on a date so bad Sadly I am a fan of the whole boy ask girl first; however you best believe ima plan the date right after they do. I have so many good spots that no one else knows about in our town so they are always empty. Also, tons of ideas for activities if we wanted to like do something. I would do such a good job and make it so magical and perfect and picturesque. I just need a chance. Just one chance.
