Today was a really good day So, after classes when I was walking out of the school this girl that i really like and want to get to know her more asked ME if I want to go out WITH HER and her friend to eat some Chinese food! SHE ASKED ME! I was planning on asking her to go out and eat somewhere, but there were always a lot of people around and i was too nervous to ask her, especially today, because i didn't look the best, you know? I had not the cleanest hair and bags under my eyes and i was tired, especially because i had a lot of work to do.

I'm so happy! It's the best thing that happened to me in the last couple of days
