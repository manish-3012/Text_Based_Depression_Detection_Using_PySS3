So yeah, might get drug tested tomorrow I just got my eye surgery the day before yesterday, very painful btw, and now my eyes look bloody and red. I look high as a kite and worked this morning. I could tell what my shift manager was thinking when I clocked in. 

It's alright though. I don't do drugs. My card didn't decline and happy I don't have to rely on glasses anymore. Also saw my favorite manager after a while, wherever he went. He's a cutie.
