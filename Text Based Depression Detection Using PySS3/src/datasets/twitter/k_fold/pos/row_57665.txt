Idea that would LOVE follow up, solution to BIG teenage annoyance You know how it's REALLY annoying when your parents order you to do something when you've done,is doing or is about to do that,or them not believing that you've done said thing when you said you have and many other versions of this? It's SUPER annoying for both sides since they don't know what they did wrong and probably feel in the right or they think we're just being lazy while we feel like they didn't trust us to do something that's our responsibility?

Well I've this got a solution for the first two situations.(the one where you've done or is doing the thing they ordered)
Instead of ordering it like usual, you could ask your parents to instead say Have you done said thing, then if you have or is doing it you'll get a reasonable amount of money, like a dollar and if they don't believe it and you have prove they'll have to give a larger sum. If you haven't done or aren't doing it you're then forced to do said thing immediately except if you're busy with something else. This would only apply to daily chores and tasks that have been assigned earlier since those deal the most damage when they think you haven't done them. New chores like o serve tea to the guest don't count since they're sudden and other exceptions

This would solve the irritation we get from being distrusted cause money while our parents gets the chore or errand or something done immediately. It's only weakness is if you're about to do it and get ordered to it and that it could probably be exploited.

Thoughts on how to improve this before presentation to parent would be appreciated.

Other problems you can think of solutions too in the comments:

Parents ordering us when they just ordered us to do something and getting mad when we can't finish it all

Will add more if more problems are presented
