Why are so many redditors against hunting? I'm a hunter and everything I kill I eat. As a hunter my biggest passion is conservation. There are laws, regulations, licenses, and stamps in place for hunter to fallow and buy if the want to hunt a specific game animal. We try to get the most ethical shot so the animal wont suffer for long. Just think of it as a way to get organic meat. Try not to curse in the comments cause I dont want a all out fist fight in the comments.
