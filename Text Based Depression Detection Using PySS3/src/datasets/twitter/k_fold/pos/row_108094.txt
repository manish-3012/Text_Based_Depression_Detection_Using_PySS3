I think I'm in love with someone I've never seen the face of. (TL;DR at bottom) Okay, so one day about 2 months ago, some girl added me on snapchat (she's 15 and I'm 13 btw) I never met her, but I always accept requests anyways. She immediately texted me and asked if I was down to play minecraft and of course I said yes. She replied and says she can play in a few days. 

So after texting her a few days later and asking if she could play minecraft yet, she said yeah, asked Java or bedrock and she said Java (she was on bedrock) so we had some complications after I made a whole server until I realized she was on Xbox. 

Next day I start a world with her on my switch and I died. I lost my iron and food, but she was kind enough to give me 20 steak and some iron.

We play for a while, I get her discord, learn more about her, etc. etc. And learn her parents are really strict and she sneaks discord on her phone to talk to me and her friends. This Is where I started developing feelings because  she keeps thanking me for being her friend, and for me being there for her.

About a week later her friend starts a server and adds a bunch of her friends and they were really nice, and we still use the server quite a lot. A few days after this, she asks me to talk in DMs and asks me if I ever felt anything towards her. I was confused and asked what she means, she said she liked me and she thought I never felt the same, so I told her. We then became "minecraft boyfriend and girlfriend" but never started doing anything really. 

(We only mention it every once in a while, whether to ask if anyone knows or if they still feel, but we haven't asked each other out on an online date before or anything)

So about one week later, my dad died. I told her. She said she was sorry and things, all that. Blah blah blah, not very important.

2 weeks later were in the server and bragging about who's cock is bigger with everyone and whatnot because were just like that then one of her friends says "yeah ___ you're my gf so you should know my cock is big" and I went to ask her in DMs if that was actually her girlfriend. She said no and it was a joke, she says she still likes me and stuff, I got relieved but still kinda have trust issues so...

And even if we do become actual bf/gf, I don't want it to end like other young relationships, an early breakup.

#TLDR:

I already know she likes me,, but nobody has done anything.I think I'm falling in love with a girl I met online but I really don't want to ruin the friendship we have as well as have her parents find out because they're strict. We met and played minecraft a lotz and she's probably my best friend by now. I also think her friends would see me differently afterwards.

And if you're still reading, thanks. I want to ask if I should say anything about asking her on an online date or something. If you could tell me how or if I should say anything, tell me.
