I figured out how to play any game for free I've done this 4 times, not sure if it works on PlayStation though. Xbox and Steam have a refund policy where you can return any game if you owned it for less than 2 weeks and have less than 2 hours played on it. So what I do is just buy a game on an alt account, gameshare it to my main, then just return it within 2 weeks. All the play time is on your main account so you're still eligible for a refund. This is only useful if you want to play short games or test some out though. Just wanted to share this.
