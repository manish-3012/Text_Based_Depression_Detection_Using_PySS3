I want someone to talk to about a issue. Ok so I (13m) have a big imagination. I get insulted and mocked about everyday and that has led me to stay in my imagination for happiness. I pretty much have imaginary friends ( Iâ€™ll explain more in DMâ€™s). This would be fine with me but the problem is is that I sometimes feel irl what I feel in my imagination. This usually happens with the feelings, excited, embarrassed, and loved.
