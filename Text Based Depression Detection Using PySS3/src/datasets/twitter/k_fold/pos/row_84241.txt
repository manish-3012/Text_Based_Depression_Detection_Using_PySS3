I think I still love my ex, after 3 failed relationship attempts! I met this guy in Facebook 3 years ago, since then weâ€™ve been trying to have a formal relation but when things are going well something stupid happens and we break. Our last time was almost 5 months ago, we havenâ€™t talk too much since that but when I start thinking about him and all our past I canâ€™t avoid feeling something. Itâ€™s very dumb, but i really really loved that guy and i know he also did it, but i donâ€™t want to go back to the same shit
