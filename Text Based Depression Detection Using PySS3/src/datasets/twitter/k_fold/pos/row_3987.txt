I lost my friend today Yesterday my two friends were going home and they had an accident, both of them were on a bike. The one who was driving the motorcycle had his throat sliced open by a pillar he was taken to a hospital where the doctor pronounced him dead but after a few seconds his heartbeat started again he needed 25 bottles of blood which we glady gave to the hospital but the doctor already told us to be prepared because he was losing blood rapidly and there was no chance of saving him and he couldn't do anything about my friend's throat. And my other friend who was riding with him on the back had a head injury as well as some other damage like his face is badly injured, and some of his ribs are broken and some other things but now he has memory loss and can't remember any of his friends (including me) or the accident but he still can remember his family. But the doctor said that he will make a full discovery, which we are thankful for. I honestly don't know how to explain it
but today around 5 or 6 am i found out that my friend who was in the front passed away, he was a really caring person and was always helpful, he was a great friend but he shouldn't have died that young everyone is devastated but i honestly have no idea what to do now.
