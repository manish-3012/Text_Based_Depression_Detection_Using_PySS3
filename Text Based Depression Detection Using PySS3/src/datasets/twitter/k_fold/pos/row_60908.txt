my mom told me that she is going to die relatively soon My mom is already in her late 50â€™s.

This morning she told me she doesnâ€™t have much time left and wants me to be more independent so she can do what she wants to better. That is great for her and all, but the doesnâ€™t have much time left bit bugs me a lot.
I feel nervous, anxious and cant stop thinking about it.

What should i do about these thoughts?
