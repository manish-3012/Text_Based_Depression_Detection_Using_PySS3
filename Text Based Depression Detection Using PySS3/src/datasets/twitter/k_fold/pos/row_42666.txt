Random argument that was pointless So me and one of my friends were talking about my phone that wont charge, she said "I would never even TOUCH an android".  I said "why" she said. "The quality was horrible, It's so slow, and MY iPhone 12 can zoom in and out" she went through about 3 phones already, they didn't break she just wanted the *newest and most expensive Iphone she could get* I was still glad with my Moto G7. So idk she just thought androids were the worst phones ever. She never touched a android so me being he messy haired red hair dude said "Your argument means nothing and is invalid" she didn't care.
