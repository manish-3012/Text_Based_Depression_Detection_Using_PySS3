Does anyone remember those biker group in Elementary school that would come in and try to stop bullying? I remember every month weâ€™d go in the auditorium and watch an assembly about these guys that rode motorcycles and would be like â€œbullyâ€™s arenâ€™t cool, manâ€ It was kinda cringy but kinda wholesome at the same time. Also, it fucking worked. No one in my school TO THIS DAY bullyâ€™s other students
