I took my crush on a motorcycle ride today Today my older brother got a Honda cbf 125 from a friend and I was allowed to drive it.

 So i took it for a ride since it's been a year since my last ride after ~20km I went back home and asked her if she would like a ride since she likes motorcycles too and wants to make her license soon.

She said yes and we went on an hour long drive for about 40km around the town and it was awesome and she loved it too.

I am so fcking happy right now.
