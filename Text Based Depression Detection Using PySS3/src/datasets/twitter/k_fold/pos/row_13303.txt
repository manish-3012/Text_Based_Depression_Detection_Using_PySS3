My mom won't let me play games My mom's against games cuz it's supposedly "addicting" or "distracting". Since my mom's been so against games the last game I played was years ago and now she's got a problem with that. My brother is failing a few subjects and he plays games all day so that doesn't help my case much. I've never failed a single subject in my life and the lowest gpa I've ever gotten is 3.14 and that too cuz I missed a few papers(I was sick) and my school wouldn't take re-tests. She keeps comparing me to my brother and apparently everything that I say is like my brother and I'm gonna become like him. I've tried to convince her but she just won't listen. My mom never brought me a PS4 or xbox or something like that growing up and I'm fine with that but how's playing games once in a while a problem? The only thing that I've gotten addicted to before was reading but I stopped before the exams and they got over like 3 days ago and the next exams aren't due for another month or so. She even has a problem with me reading now. What tf am I supposed to do when I wanna have fun? Study? I literally don't know how to convince her otherwise.  
Thank you for listening to my rant I guess (â€¢â€¿â€¢)
