2+2 is... four, minus one that's three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block, smoke trees
See your girl in the park, that girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack, you man were ducking (you man ducked)
Hold tight, Asnee (my brotha), he's got the pumpy (big ting)
Hold tight, my man (my guy), he's got the frisbee
I trap, trap, trap on the phone, movin' that cornflakes
Rice Krispies, hold tight my girl, Whitney (my G)
On the road doin' ten toes, like my toes (like my toes)
You man thought I froze, I see a peng girl, then I pose (chilin')
If she ain't on it, I ghost, hah, look at your nose (check your nose fam)
You donut, nose long like garden hose
