How do I support my friend in this situation? My friend doesn't have the best family life. He told us about the favoritism and how his relatives hated him. He didn't do anything to them yet his relatives make it seem like he did something wrong. From what I've heard from him, his relatives were entitled and were like leeches. It doesn't seem like his parents do anything either.

His family is rich and some of his relatives live with him. He told me about the times that his relatives felt like they owned his things and owned the house. It might seem shallow but I know how much his things meant to him. Not because of the prices and how expensive they were, but because it was the only thing he could put himself into.

He has an Ipad. It was the only gadget he had. He uses it for everything like online school, music, reading, etc. His relatives deleted every single thing he had enjoyed and used to distract himself. And now it was taken from him. It wasn't my problem but I cried when he told me he lost the one thing that made him happy. He had always told me he had always felt like the world was against him.

For tomorrow and the next day, we have a test. A major test he couldn't even study for. And the fact that his relatives did this in a time where we stressed and buried our heads in modules late at night made me really angry to the point where I can't even focus on studying.

I'm not good with words and I find it hard to express them. I need advice on how I can comfort him during these times and hopefully make him feel a bit better.
