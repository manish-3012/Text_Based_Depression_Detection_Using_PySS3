Is it wierd im not hungry? I usually wake up and do t eat until dinner (like 5:00pm).started happening like a month ago. Iâ€™m just not hungry in the morning. I eat dinner then I snack after that. (Like I eat a good bit them because I donâ€™t eat during the day) even if my stomach growls I just donâ€™t really feel hungry
