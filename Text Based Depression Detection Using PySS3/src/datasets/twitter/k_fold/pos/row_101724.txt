does anyone ever feel like despite having friends you dont really connect with them yeah i talk to people but i never feel like we click. I havent clicked with someone in years (probably because ive moved so often) I always feel like an outcast in a group, just ever so slightly weirder then everyone else. Like i open my stupid fucking mouth and the conversation is over. Ive never felt a part of a group throughout high school. I like them at all I just dont want to hang out with them really. I just want it to be over, i want to go to college.

I just have to get though my senior year but GOD do i want it over. I just want to meet people i actually relate to so i dont feel like such a fucking weirdo all the time.
