Why are English teachers so annoying? They inject their political beliefs and rant about social structure and oppression theory in more twisted way than the history teachers do. Their grading is subjective and often enforce arbitrary class rules like making you do or not do certain things that aren't really a deal in other classes. They seem to lack foundational historical or scientific knowledge. And in case of AP Lit teachers, some of them don't really have strong composition skills like AP Lang or other English teachers do. Only if my county didn't force me to take 4 years of English, I'd have probably taken more useful classes like journalism and science.
