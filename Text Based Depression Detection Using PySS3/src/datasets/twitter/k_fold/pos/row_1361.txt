I drunk texted my dad that he's my hero I've always wanted to say it but never found the courage to. I don't know why. I've always been very close to my dad but through the years we've been somewhat drifting apart with the distance but I'm determined on keeping close to him. So I call him every week. But I was still unable to do it. Guess I did it when I had no shame lol. He called me this morning and told me it was the best thing I could say to him. I feel weird now
