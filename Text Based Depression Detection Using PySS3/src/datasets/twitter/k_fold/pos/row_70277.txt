(Tw suicide) not like anyone gives a shit Tbh I'm already done with life. I'm tired, stressed I'm sad

And now I know I will have to live the rest of my life in a masculine and ugly body.
I'm already 15. I might be done with puberty soon
But my mother wants me to wait 2 years from autumn (so when I will be almost 18)
To let me even TRY to go to a gender clinic

I can't look at myself anymore, every time I see those nasty big eyebrow the mustache I've grown, the hair all over my body, and 'it' being there plus being fat and ugly makes me want a bullet in my brain every time I look at myself

Maybe the transphobes are right...I guess I was part of that 41â„… after all
