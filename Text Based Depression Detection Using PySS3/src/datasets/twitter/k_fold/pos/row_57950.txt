I can't tell Am I depressed?

Am I coming to terms with my situation (see one of my last posts on this sub)?

Am I "Fine" status from the Sims?

or am I Empty inside? (no thoughts head empty included)

i miss talking to my favorite people, and my radio silence with them is only of my own actions. i would sadpost on twitter or whatever but im afraid of even coming close to guilt tripping them... rather One of them.

if you knew me between August and Mid-October of this year, no you didnt &lt;3

i'll say it here again on the off chance that any of the relevant people see it: im sorry for everything. i miss you guys.
