I went through all of today thinking it was Friday I think I just had such wishful thinking that it was finally Friday and that I was finally done. This week has been hell for me and I just want it to end. Iâ€™ve gotten bad scores, Iâ€™ve had to deal with all of my friends coming to me about all of their problems, Iâ€™ve been stressing over their problems and the tests so Iâ€™ve been up until like 3 AM every night, plus my mom and stepdad are starting to fight. Iâ€™m truly done. Iâ€™m just tired, stressed, and done with people. Right now I just find everyone and everything annoying. I guess I was hoping that maybe a day of doing nothing on Saturday would be perfect. Thatâ€™s just what I need right now. But no....... of course not. Of course I have one more day of hell. Idk why Iâ€™m so mad about this. I feel like Iâ€™m being over dramatic but like...... Iâ€™m just so done.
