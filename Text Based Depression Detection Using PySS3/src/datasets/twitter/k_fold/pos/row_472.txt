I accidentally killed a fly with olive oil I was making a salad and poured some olive oil to add flavor. I was holding the bottle kind of high from the plate, pouring a line when a fly came flying across the plate and ended just right under the splash of oil. 

I got it out of the salad, it couldn't fly and ended in the floor. When I looked back, it wasn't moving.

 I assume it drowned with the oil.

No, I didn't step on it.
