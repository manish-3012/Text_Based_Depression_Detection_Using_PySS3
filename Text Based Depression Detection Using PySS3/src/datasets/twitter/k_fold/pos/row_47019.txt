Should I add this girl on Snapchat? There's this girl who i've been in school with my entire life, and I've only ever talked to her a little bit during a group project once. This year, she's in one of my classes, but since It's all on Zoom, I haven't been able to talk to her. We are both very shy, and I assume that we share at least somewhat similar interests because the class we are in together is an elective that took two years of other electives to get into. Like two months ago, she appeared on my Quick Add on Snapchat, but I didn't have the courage to add her, mainly because it was mid-semester and if something went weird on Snapchat then it'd be awkward to sit in the Zoom class with her. Now, there is only two more days left of class, and I'd like to add her, to keep in contact with her. I have one problem though. I have her Snapchat username, from when I saw it on my Quick Add, but I feel like it'd be very weird/creepy if I were to add her by username, especially when she doesn't have it in her Instagram bio. I have been checking my Quick Add every day for like two weeks now, hoping that she'll appear in my Quick Add so I can add her that way, but I haven't come across her once. Perhaps since I've already searched her username, it won't show up in Quick Add anymore because it assumes i consciously didn't add her? Either way, I'm debating if I should add her via username, or just not at all. I feel like we could genuinely be friends.

Thanks for any advice
