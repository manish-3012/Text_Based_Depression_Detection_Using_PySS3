Is anyone elseâ€™s friends throwing birthday parties even though there is covid? A couple of my friends are throwing birthday parties for some reason even though there was covid. One of them had theirs in August and I only became friends with them last year so I wouldnâ€™t know if they did it every year.

But, I just got an invite to a birthday party from a friend that Iâ€™ve known since probably elementary school or kindergarten. They havenâ€™t had a birthday party since 5th or 6th grade and weâ€™re both juniors this year. Iâ€™m hoping Iâ€™m right because I could have just not been invited but Iâ€™m pretty sure they just didnâ€™t have a party.

So should I go and does anyone else know anyone who is having a party even though they havenâ€™t had one in years?
