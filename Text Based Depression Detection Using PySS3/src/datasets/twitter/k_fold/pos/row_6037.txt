Do you guys ever go on a phone detox 
Iâ€™m going on a social media detox and also trying to use my phone less at least until like thanksgiving break, I was wondering if anybody ever does the same because iâ€™ve only recently started taking it seriously. I was doing pretty good with this at the beginning of quarantine but I got too depressed and lazy a few weeks in. I just saw someone on tiktok who reads 3-4 hours a day when thatâ€™s how much I read in 2 weeks, it inspired me. Iâ€™ve lost progress on all the hobbies I started at the beginning of quarantine but itâ€™s cool, as long as i donâ€™t spend half my day sliding my fingers across a piece of glass or listening to music, which is all the timeâ€”workout, shower, cooking, homework, walking dog, during sleep

Cold weather makes me motivated for anything so i def got this, anyways you should try it out if you donâ€™t
