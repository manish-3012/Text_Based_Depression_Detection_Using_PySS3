interestingly depressing dream so last night i had this dream, i knew i was dreaming, i want to be good at sports so in this dream. i decided that i wanted to have a dodgeball match with a person i remembered from the 7th grade and lost (still 9th grade btw), so i woke up sad so i guess im a failure in my dreams and in real life
