Being a teen is way overhyped I used think I would be cool or smthng and it would be like the movies. Nope itâ€™s literally me staying home everyday watching Dumb videos on YouTube then procrastinating and being stressed abt having school work due and wishing I was a kid again. How ironic. This is not what I signed up for.Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
