Zoom classes are wack my math teacher called on me during our meeting but my dog was outside my door barking like crazy it was so embarrassing, especially cause I was using my laptop mic and not headphones. everyone who was in class in person definitely heard it, but i mean i just muted myself and he answered the question for me
