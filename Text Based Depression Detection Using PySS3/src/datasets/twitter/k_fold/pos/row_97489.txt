I'm done with everything. I have diagnosed depression and severe anxiety, which my family dont even know about.
Its draining to put up a front and act happy around them.
I went to our school psychiatrist but he just makes me lock up with questions and I hate it.
I only have two friends and i only really like the other one.
I think about suicide every fucking night.
I dont selfharm right now but i understand why people do it.
There's no reason for me to live...
I get called a failure a lot, my family dont support me at all.
I dont wanna get a job where I will work for the rest of my life, I hate everything and everyone. 
It's so fucking dumb how I feel this way and why cant I ever open up?
Every day I try to cry but I cant, i have nobody i can talk to, I'm so lazy and boring.
Its been a year and it's only getting worse
I cant/wont open up coz if I do I feel  weak.
I will probably delete this post anyways, I cant get help coz it's up to me and i dont even go to the shower coz why would I? Nobody cares about me so why would i?
Dont say that you can relate coz i know u do, it just reminds me how not special I am.
Dont bother upvoting I just wanted to write this somewhere.
