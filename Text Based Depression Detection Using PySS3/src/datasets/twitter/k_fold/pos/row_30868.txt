So guys Iâ€™m kinda exited and scared Iâ€™m getting a visitation form to see my dad whoâ€™s in prison. Iâ€™m kinda scared and afraid. Iâ€™ve had emotional trauma from him leaving me and my mom since before I could remember. Iâ€™m extremely scared and kinda happy to see him. I donâ€™t know if I could forgive him for what heâ€™s done to me and my mom. But I want my dad to love me and I want to love him. I want him to be happy. But idk if I can do it.
