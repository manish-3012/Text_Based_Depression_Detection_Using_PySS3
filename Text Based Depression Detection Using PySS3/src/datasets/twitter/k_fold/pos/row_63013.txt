Anyone else hate getting into bed because they're sure that spiders or some other insect is in or around their bed and/or room? I know this isn't important, but I found a spider that somehow got in between my window and the screen, but I haven't opened that window in a while and the screen doesnt look like it had any holes big enough for that spider to get through. This is kind if concerning. But it almost validates my mild anxiety about getting into bed because I always think there are spiders or other insects either in my bed or nearby...
