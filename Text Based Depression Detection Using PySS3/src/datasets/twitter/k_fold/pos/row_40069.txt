I have a favor to ask of y'all. Could someone with access to a video editor please help me? Hi, this is really really stupid, but I'm feeling real sad about not being able to watch the new episode of Helluva Boss on YouTube. Without going into to much detail (because it's a cringey story that REEKS of how nuerodivergent I am), one of the voice actors for the cartoon makes me incredibly uncomfortable, and hearing his voice is really hard. My question is, would someone be willing to go through the and edit episode to mute the audio when he's speaking? I know this is a dumb thing to ask in Reddit, and I'm probably gonna get flamed for being "triggered" or smth, but that's alright, I know that's the way of things. I would ask my friends but I'm too embarrassed to admit that I cant stand to listen to that VA talk. Please DM me if anybody is willing to do this, it would mean the world. â¤â¤
