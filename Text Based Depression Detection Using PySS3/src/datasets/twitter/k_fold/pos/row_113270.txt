anyone wanna take a stab at what just happened?  

i saw a post in new on this sub saying they were a female looking for a friend on reddit, and their DMs were open. i DM'd them and talked to them for a bit. this is what happened

**me:** the reason i DM'd you is because i am female too, and i figured i could talk to someone the same gender as me

**them:** oh

**them:** i usually end up talking to guys

and then she just stopped responding. i'm not upset, i'm just a little confused. any one want to take a stab at what just happened?
