Sooo... I recently realized why I grew up to be such a fucked up individual Apparently, Iâ€™ve been reading the original Grimâ€™s fairytales and Andersonâ€™s fairytales when I was young where the endings are usually really messed up. Always thought those were the versions that everyone knew, guess Disney didnâ€™t want to show the kids that the little mermaid actually turn into bubbles instead of ending up with he prince.
Just want to know if anyone else also has this experience.
