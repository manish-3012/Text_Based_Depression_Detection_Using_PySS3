Worried I have a yeast infection but too scared to tell my mom. If I go to the doctor will the doctor have to look at it?? I CANT EVEN HANDLE TALKING TO DOCTORS I DONT WANT A STRANGER TO LOOK AT MY COOCH.

I keep it clean though.....itâ€™s literally the one place I make sure to clean in the shower-

What do I do??? Iâ€™m too embarrassed
