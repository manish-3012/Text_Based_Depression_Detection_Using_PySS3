The first one of my friends left for college today. I thought I'd be okay, but I'm an emotional mess now. I'm super happy for my friends' accomplishments, but I can't stop crying. We've been friends for around a decade. These people practically raised me. I'm embarrassed of how emotional I am. It's not that I don't want them to leave and live their lives, I think I'm just having trouble coping.

I might delete this later.
