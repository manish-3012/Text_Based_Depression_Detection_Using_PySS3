Questioning morality I guess that title's pretty vague. What I mean is that I worry sometimes about if I'm actually a decent human being. I don't know if I do what I do based on my own moral perceptions, or just because I listen to my parents' (who ARE good people) guidance. Am I actually doing what ***I*** think is right, or deep down am I vile and my parents' are the ones keeping me afloat and doing what's right?

The only way I can know is when I am out of my parents' influence. It can be grueling.

I've had this talk with my mom, and she says that because I even have these thought proves were my morality is. Others have told me the same thing in response to general moral questing, outside of the child-to-parent dynamic. This has helped me, but sometimes I still worry.

I know that was kinda brusque, but I felt I should share in the case that anyone else here has experienced the same ordeal.
