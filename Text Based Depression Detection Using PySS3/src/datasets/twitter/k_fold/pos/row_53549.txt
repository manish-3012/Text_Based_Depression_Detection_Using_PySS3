im slowly realizing my life is becoming a sad and pathetic attempt as a human being every day, i get up and do the same things: get up, go to school, and play video games for the rest of the night.  no social interaction, unless with my family, and nothing other than that.  however, i have some friends, who dont do anything, and all i do is talk to people on discord and reddit.  i have a sad life.
