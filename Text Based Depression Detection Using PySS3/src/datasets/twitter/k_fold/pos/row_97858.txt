parents are assholes smh i am going to be (f)16 in december and my parents still wonâ€™t let me take my phone upstairs.,,,,,,...,,..
i will be legally allowed to have a kid (england) and yet still not allowed to go on my phone upstairs. like bruh
i havenâ€™t even done anything to break the bond of trust 
they also think 2 hrs screen time A DAY is way too much

just to clarify: 
-theyâ€™re allowed their phones upstairs 
-â€œtheir house their rulesâ€? come on bro 
-also going on my phone helps me to distract myself from doing the bad stuff during the sad boi hours that normally happen at night, when i do not have my phone 
-iâ€™m not telling them about the sad boi hours or the bad stuff any time soon lol
