I had a really dumb idea for a comedy sketch character Ted, who is definitely not a reptilian disguised as a human

Ted scuttles up to you on all fours and goes "Hey there fellow placental! Sure is nice that our bodies perform thermal homeostasis, right?"

\*keeps one eye looking at you while the other follows a housefly\* "Lovely day to to have external ears, isn't it?"
