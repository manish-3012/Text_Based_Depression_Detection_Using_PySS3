I havenâ€™t self harmed in about 4 months I made a post similar to this around the start of quarantine. Thank you all for the support, itâ€™s whatâ€™s been keeping me to not fall back again. You guys are truly wonderful and I want to thank you guys. Since that post Iâ€™ve actually gotten friends who share interests in Weezer and mcr and other bands I like so thatâ€™s great. I also started a band. Weâ€™re called drunkenconfessionsofjonas on Instagram. We havenâ€™t really done much yet but weâ€™ll do some stuff soon. Sadly I canâ€™t post another picture for you guys but I have lost weight so my face is slimmer and my hair is longer and I added blue to it. Cheers :)
