I got tagged in something for girls by one of my friends I'm a  transgirl but closeted to most people about it. They're asking for selfies of beautiful women. They either forgot who I am or just looked at the profile pic and thought that's a girl who will contribute because I changed my name to a more feminine one and profile pic to a girl. Idk why I'm sharing I thought it was funny I guess. I'd do it if I passed and was actually pretty but I dont. Sorry for sharing this it was stupid
