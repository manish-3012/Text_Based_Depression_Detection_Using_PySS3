I feel like I have finally reached happiness But oddly enough i feel like wanting to be sad again, I guess my body is confused on wether to be happy or sad. For some reason I kinda liked being sad. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m in purgatory

I feel empty and hollow, yet happy at the same time. I guess once I reached happiness I donâ€™t know what to do because I was sad all the time 

What is happening? Iâ€™m scared
