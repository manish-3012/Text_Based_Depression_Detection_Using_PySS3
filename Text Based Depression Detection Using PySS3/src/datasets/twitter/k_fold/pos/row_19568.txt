Kill me if Iâ€™m wrong But thereâ€™s only two sexes imo Male, Female, with the acceptation of non binary for obvious reasons 

Second there is no transgender you are either male, female, or non binary if you were female and now youâ€™re male just say youâ€™re male and vice versa not trans male or trans female just your preferred pronouns 

Is it transphobic? I feel like it is but I mean it in the most sincere and empowering way possible
