To the person that pissed on the floor at Red Robin last night, fuck you I don't know if you're a kid, teenager, or a grown ass man, but sir, if you ever come to see this post and you know that **you** were that male who peed on the floor between the times of 4pm and 6pm last night to which I ended up stepping on, go to hell. I was wearing *Flip Flops* and that shit splashed like a puddle. I hope you step on your own piss a thousand times down there in a burning hell. And to everyone who didn't pee on the floor at Red Robin last night, I hope you have a fantastic day.
