Should I post my knowledge about astronomy on here? I was a huge astronomy nerd growing up. I watched a lot of space documentaries and learned a lot about astronomy through them. Now that I'm in college, I'm wondering if anyone here is interested in me sharing what I know?
I'm considering this because I want more people to be interested in astronomy, and I think the best place to start is with young people.
