I couldve written this on a doc like how i normally do, but its too cute for me not to tell you I dreamt of you twice today. 
I won't explain much of the first one but it was of me 
Worrying about you.
 after you told me what happened with your mother, 
I guess I just dreamt of talking to you and cheering you up.

My last one of you was my favorite one that I ever had of you.
I had it when I had my nap.
I invited you to â€my houseâ€ 
I actually don't recall being in the house before but it reminded me of my grandma's house in Utah.
I invited you to my house and we laid and drew together. 
I remember leaving to another room, and then going back to check on you, you had a computer,(wearing my headphones) watching a video on YT Learning Japanese.
It was so cute, you had a pen and paper and you were writing down the letters. 
When I came up to you, thinking you left without saying goodbye &gt;:(, you looked up at me while you were sitting crisscrossed on the couch and said with the cutest smile â€hiâ€ T-T
UGHHHH 
IM SORRY FOR LEAVING YOU, I DONT KNOW WHY I DID.
