Quite the conundrum for a small boy like me Basically in November 2020 I started talking to this girl, to most people this is normal shit but little me Doesnâ€™t get this much so this was pretty hype. We talked for a bit and In December 2020 I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same. While thatâ€™s all fine and well about 5 days later (on Christmas Day) she disappeared. Gone like a fine fart in the wind, and then a month later in late January she came back with no reasoning for the absence, tbh I didnâ€™t care I was just happy to talk to her agian, then like 3 days later, gone. then a month later, Poof she back the  like 5 days later gone then back gone then back on and on and on. I asked her a month ago (last time we talked) why she kept leaving and she just avoided the question. I assume sheâ€™s being grounded or sum but I just wish I got to talk to her more. And thank you for reading this
