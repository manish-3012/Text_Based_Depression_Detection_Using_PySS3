I have a homewrecker rep and it seriously sucks Last year I became really good friends with this one girl who had a bf. Me and her were such good friends to the point that people thought she was cheating on her bf with me and spread rumors about it. Then when they broke up (due to already existing issues) some people blamed it on me trying to sabotage their relationship. It didnâ€™t help that I actually did used to like her but since then she was more like a sister to me (donâ€™t take that the wrong way lol). Now Iâ€™m in a kinda new friend group and thereâ€™s this one girl who got close to me too. Sheâ€™s got a bf as well. My friends and I realized this is looking like a repeat of last year, this girl has gotten way too close and comfortable with me and itâ€™s scary because this time I donâ€™t know her bf. Last time i was best friends with the girls bf so he knew he didnâ€™t have to worry. So after last year people think of me as some homewrecker and i donâ€™t even try to do these things. And now I gotta try and distance from the new girl so i donâ€™t worsen the rep even more. I donâ€™t mean to sound arrogant saying this Iâ€™m sorry, but I donâ€™t know wtf it is that attracts these girls to me (as best friends) to get close and comfy with me. Especially with them having fucking boyfriends.
