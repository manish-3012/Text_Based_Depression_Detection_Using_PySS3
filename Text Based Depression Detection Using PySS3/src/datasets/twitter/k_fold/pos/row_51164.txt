NYC Storytime I was in NYC for a trip with some friends. While riding back to where we were staying on the subway this tipsy hooker comes on and starts swinging around the poles on the subway and dances a little before deciding to sit down across from a lady with an eye patch. The hooker asks the lady with the eye patch, "Yo why do you have an eye patch on your one eye?". The eye patch lady looks up at the hooker and says, "My boyfriend gave me  HIV in my eye but he didn't mean to give it to me.". Only in NYC lemme tell you.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
