People won't trust me So when I'm in school a lot of people spread some shit around me. By that I mean things that aren't true about me.
I don't really talk to people about myself (not even with 1 friend) because every time I try "open" myself it, I instantly regret it. As soon as I tell a girl I like her everyone ones it. Got bullied fuck tons of times.
Even if I talk to strangers(online) they don't trust me what I'm  saying.
And yes I do a small of self harm so little no one can notice it. My school grades are getting worse and worse.
Also I don't trust anyone if they like "that's was good" or other stuff which should be positive...
I don't really feel emotion only sometimes.
This post was written on a second acc of mine, I don't want that my only friend is reading this.
I don't know why I wrote this but I ended up doing it tho, I hope someone can give me "advice"
