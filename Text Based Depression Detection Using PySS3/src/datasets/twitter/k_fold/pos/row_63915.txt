I might have coronavirus, and my mom doesnâ€™t even care,. I got sick over the weekend, and now iâ€™m showing several coronavirus symptoms, like shortness of breath. My mom works in a place where thereâ€™s been a large outbreak, and she denies the possibility that i could have corona. She says iâ€™m fine, as long as i donâ€™t have a fever.
