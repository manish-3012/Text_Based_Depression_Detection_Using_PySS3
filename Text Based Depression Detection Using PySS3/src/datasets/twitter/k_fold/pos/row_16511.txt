I love reddit I don't how to say this but I am gonna say it, reddit is the best social media app I have ever used or installed. 
I have social anxiety and I never post anything on Instagram/Facebook because I feel peaple are judging me behind the screens but on reddit I can post anything with my identity hidden. 
Just an app were no knows another and just bunch of peaple sharing the same interest.
This might get buried but I just wanted to say to anyone who is reading,
Thanks for making reddit a great community.
