Teens who live in the UK whatâ€™s your life like compared to American teens? For a while now Iâ€™ve been doing research on the UK and really appreciate it as a nation because of how successful it has become with things like (education, healthcare, ending income inequality, not having a two party system, equality) and in general just seeming to have a lot of nice smart people of all ages. So why do you think the UK is so successful also whatâ€™s it like being British?

Did your parents raise you differently then what American parents often do? also whatâ€™s school like is is of better quality the the American education system? Oh and I would also like to ask what you think of Americans and the USA as a whole.

P.S also are any of you Posh or grew up in a Posh family and life style. Also if anyoneâ€™s here is also from Ireland Iâ€™d love to hear your responses.
