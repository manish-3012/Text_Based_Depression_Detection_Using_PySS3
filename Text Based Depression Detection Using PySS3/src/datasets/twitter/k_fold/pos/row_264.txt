Why do people put on the sarcastic voice? Adding tone to sarcasm sucks all the dryness out of it. For example, if you had a resting neutral face and said "Wow, that's amazing. I'm ecstatic." That's dry. It's witty. If you were actually acting ecstatic and throwing on a "this is blatent sarcasm" tone, it just comes across as trying too hard and the sarcasm falls flat.
