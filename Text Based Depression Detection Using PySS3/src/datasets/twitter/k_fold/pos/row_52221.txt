Online Friends How do you make them easily? 

My anxiety is pretty bad so I'm always scared to engage in conversation but I really want to make some online friends.

I've tried talking in Discord servers but I always become worried that I'm being too annoying or talkative (this sounds really stupid I know).

I just want to know how everyone else does it so easily.
