Maths is a death cult theory Maths is a cult. Proof? All dem symbols like Ã· or = are symbols devoted to strengthening Algebrath the blood lord. The teachers are really its lunatic disciples. They teach "maths" to indoctrinate students into the inner circle. Mathematicians are really the head priests, in charge of indoctrination, preaching, and making it seem plausible to the general population. The sums - like (x+2) Ã— (2x-xÃ·21) are secretly secret chants to summon Algebrath. They get angry when you make a mistake because it actually weakens Algebrath to say the wrong things. The primary school teachers are more lenient because they are not as important and do not know the true power and importance - only to them, of course, is it important - of Algebrath's total dominion of this unfortunate, unlucky Earth. 





Of course, this is all only a theory - A MATHS IS A CULT THEORY!!!!!!!




And, of course, I do want to graduate in the future, and so this is all in good fun.
Byeeaaa!!!
