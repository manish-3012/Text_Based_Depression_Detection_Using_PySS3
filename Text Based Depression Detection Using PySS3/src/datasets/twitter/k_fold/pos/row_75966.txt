My dad and I have more in common than I thought and I couldn't possibly be happier about that We're both gamers, we both like anime (except he watches it wayyyy more than I do), we both like programming (except he does it as a job and I'm only planning to) and we both even watch the same youtuber! I really don't take that much time to appreciate the good stuff in my parents, but I should, just like you! Even if your parents can be stressful or annoying, just remember that after all they still are your parents and there is SOMETHING that connects you. And if there isn't anything, try to think of other family members or friends, or even complete strangers that just did that tiny little thing to make you smile, even if it was ages ago! It might not seem so, but out there in the world is something that made, makes or will make you happy!

And so I used my skill of completely turning the subject into something different.
