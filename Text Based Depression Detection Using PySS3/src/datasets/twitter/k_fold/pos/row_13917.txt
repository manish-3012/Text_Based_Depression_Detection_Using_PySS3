How can I show my emotions more? I've been having this problem at least since I was 14 where I want to help someone and be there for them but I'm just not there for them as much as I want to be. I wont say too much but especially when ppl talk to me about deaths in their families and friend circles,  I try to be there and say "oh I'm sorry for your loss", " they're in a better place", and "they would be proud of you for doing this/they would not want you to do this. I thank you in advance for helping me.
