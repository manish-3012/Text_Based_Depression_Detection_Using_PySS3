Stuck At Family Gathering. Help. FFS, the only free day of the next 2 days my parents kidnap me. 

On a tolerance break so I didn't bring weed and no one's leaving the table so I can't sneak any drinks. The only thing I've been doing is sitting and scrolling reddit (+a few min of talking to the 7 y/os).

Help, what do for the next 3-4 hours.
