Do you post snippets of your daily life on your stories? Are you trying to impress people who don't care about you or is there some other meaning behind your actions? Like for me, when I do something cool I like to tell the people around me and sometimes they are interested in hearing it (some times they're like "ok" or a"big deal no one cares" which  sucks): but it's ok I guess focus on the positives) which feels nice. Is that what u want to happen but in an online manner or do u just wanna show off, if it's the latter then why do u wanna show off? 
P.S: I'm not trying to be rude, sorry if it seems that way. I'm just genuinely curious
