Please give me advice please So there is a girl I dated last year, and she is in 2 of my classes, but the thing is I both hate her and love her, she had ghosted me right before April, I want to both kiss her and punch her, stare into he eyes for hours, and never see her again, hug her and push her away, and to make things worse, I like another girl as well, and I'm just so confused on what to do, because like I said I both live and hate her, and I don't know why she ghosted me, nor do I know if she still likes me, please give me some advice on what to do?
