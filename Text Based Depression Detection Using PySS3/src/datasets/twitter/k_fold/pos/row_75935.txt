so this terrifying memory came back to me.. i was like 10 and it was 5pm, so everyone in my house was either napping or in their rooms. i was alone in the kitchen making food with the TV still on from whatever my parents were watching. what was on was some discovery channel type show with this guy and this girl who looking for missing people (or something to that effect? idk). in this one they were looking for this missing kid who apparently went missing near piranha infested waters (shock horror). they dive into the waters to try and find the body and almost get eaten ALIVE by these piranhas, and when they get out they pull out this limbless, near skinless, mutated childâ€™s corpse with like no face and are just like â€œwell guess heâ€™s dead lolâ€. looking back it was totally fake but iâ€™m still scarred from that
