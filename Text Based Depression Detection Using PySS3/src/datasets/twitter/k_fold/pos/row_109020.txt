I made a sub for sharing you builds and getting help in minecraft It's called r/minecraftbuildbuddies and I would really appreciate any help getting it going. My goal for the sub is for it to be active and have a good community. We also have a discord server you can access through the sub. Thank you to anyone who helps out even if you just took a look it is very appreciated.
