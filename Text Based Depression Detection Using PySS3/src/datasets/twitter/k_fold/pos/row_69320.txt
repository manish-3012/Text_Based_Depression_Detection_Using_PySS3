Do you guys ever mutter to yourself out loud? Now Iâ€™m not crazy or anything, itâ€™s just that sometimes I have so many thoughts that some of them come out out loud. I guess you could consider some of these thoughts talking to myself. Sometimes in my head Iâ€™ll refer to myself as I or You when thinking about certain things. I donâ€™t really consider it talking to myself, I think of it more as thinking in a certain way. Sometimes when I mutter thoughts like these out loud my Father will hear me and say â€œwho are you talking to?â€. Iâ€™ll say â€œmyselfâ€. Heâ€™ll often respond jokingly â€œyourself talking back to you.â€ I know heâ€™s just joking and Iâ€™m not really hurt by it,. but what do you think? Do you do this sometimes or is this just me?
