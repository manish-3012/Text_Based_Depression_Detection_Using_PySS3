Iâ€™m anxious so Iâ€™m gonna vent!1!1 Iâ€™m mostly anxious bc of an eye appointment but yadda yadda yadda Iâ€™ll be fine, the dilating drops sting for like 3 seconds, hopefully I wonâ€™t have glaucoma 

ANYWAYS I want to vent about this too bc itâ€™s always on my mind: Iâ€™m afraid of getting my wisdom teeth out 
And itâ€™s not really because of the actual surgery itâ€™s because of the medication Iâ€™d have to take before, Iâ€™d like to not take liquid medicine and try pills bUT 

I havenâ€™t swallowed a pill before, Iâ€™ve been practicing with foods similar! And Iâ€™m going alright but nothing like the size of advil and Iâ€™m so scared I wonâ€™t be able to swallow any pills before surgery

So this is making me VERY stressed
