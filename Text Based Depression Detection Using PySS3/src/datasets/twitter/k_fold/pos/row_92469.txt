Is dating a girl that is 2 years younger weird? Thereâ€™s this girl I like and we have hanged out and got lunch once. Iâ€™m pretty sure she likes me and I like her the thing is she is a junior and is 16 and Iâ€™m a senior and just turned 18. Some of my friends say itâ€™s fine because your both in high school and she is just a junior, while some say that itâ€™s too big of a difference and looks kinda sus.
