Hey all, just a word from someone who has scrolled this sub for the past 2 years Hello all, I've scrolled this sub mainly for 2 years, and this sub is the reason I decided to get a Reddit account. I've read a lot, scrolled a lot, and all. I just want to say this, though I've never said it before, some of the things on this sub have truthfully (not April fools) changed my life for the better. At the very least it's reminded me that I'm not alone in some of my personal struggles with depression and all that. I joined at one of the lowest points in my life, after I lost almost everything in life I held dear, and all the people I thought were friends turned their back on me. I'm doing quite a bit better now, though I definitely do struggle sometimes. I may post a couple of advice posts soon, just to get some advice.  I'll be turning 20 soon, and there are some aspects of my life I definitely need some advice, because in some aspects I really feel lost in life.

Anyway, I really do appreciate this sub, and I've appreciated some of the advice I've read. 

And to anyone that reads this whole thing, thank you. Means a lot to me.
