I (17F) just started talking to this girl (15F). Is the age difference weird or is it okay? I just found out she's 15, i thought she was a year or two older. My head and my heart are telling me it's okay because we really click but I know that liking someone can make my brain go nuts. Is the age difference something that should make me stop talking to her or is it okay?
