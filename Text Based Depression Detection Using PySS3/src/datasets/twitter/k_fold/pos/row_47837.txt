I just needed to express myself I am 13 years old
Im really fucking lonely, i had a girlfriend for two weeks and she left me bc she liked someone else.
Since that iâ€™ve done nothing but to sit in my room playing videogames and cry
I have lost all of my friendships and i dont have anyone to talk to
My parents are getting concerned and try to talk and relate with me but it doesnt work or help
I just want someone to talk to or hug
Im posting this here bc i have nobody to talk to
Sorry
