Help! I need to ID this freaking tv show Basic nick show, group of maybe friends? Something similar to Icarly, sam and kat, you know the drill. They make this stuff to put on/in vegetables to make them....taste better? Iâ€™m not to sure, but anyways, itâ€™s blue, similar to blue 3D puffy paint, they eat it and itâ€™s great! So they go to a uh,,,I wanna say boardroom, to pitch it, and then proceed to projectile vomit puffy paint alllllllll over the place, and like, itâ€™s fucking disgusting. I need your help as when I was young and saw this, it made me actually vomit, seriously, and I need to know the name of the show/episode so I can re-watch this scene and see if I was just a huge pussy, or, hell, maybe Iâ€™ll puke again.
Thanks!
