Never have I ever taken an Uber/Grab/Lyft I simply wonâ€™t. I hate private hire cars (or minicabs for our British teens) with a burning passion.  
  
Theyâ€™ve always drove as if they were playing GTA, and today wasnâ€™t any different. I was turning out from my driving school when I saw one of these cars signal left, so I told myself he was turning in and that I could drive out.  
  
Then, he cancelled his signal as I was coming out and stepped on the accelerator.   
I couldâ€™ve hit him if I didnâ€™t react fast enough.  
  
I grew travelling in taxis. And thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ll keep getting around when I need to be somewhere urgently.
