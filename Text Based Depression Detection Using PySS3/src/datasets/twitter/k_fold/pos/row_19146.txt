Dad ought to stop complaining I am so sick and tired of my dad's shit, he constantly complains that school doesn't communicate with him. Thing is, they do, (we use a platform called smartschool) but he never checks it. Add to that every time I tell him something about school he doesn't listen (case in point, I told him about a project I'm working on five times, he didn't know shit about it when I told him about it this morning) but oh no, it's all school's fault, totally not his for not knowing how to fucking log into a really fucking simple website. I should tell you, students and teachers are required to check it every fucking day, no exceptions, and parents are supposed to check theirs regularly. Now dad would tell you that he knows nothing about that, but he should, it's in the (physical) letter he gets from school at the start of every single school year, and in the school rules, but of course he has never read those, it's not like those are legally speaking a contract he has signed

but what can I do, I can't exactly ask someone from school to message him about it, he wouldn't read that!
