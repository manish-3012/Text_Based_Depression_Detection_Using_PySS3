I feel so ignored I dont feel as noticed as i used to. I feel like i used to be in the spotlight and appreciated and i feel like ive been pushed off to the side. I make humor and it gets drowned out by whats newer and better. Its real sad boy hours. But the music is good when youre sad. I just wanna feel as important as i once did to people ... instead of irrelevant
