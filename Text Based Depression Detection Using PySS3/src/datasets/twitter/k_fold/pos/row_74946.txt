Israel fact #3 In 2010, the Carmel mountain burned down. The fire started near a prison, and as an attempt of saving the prisoners' lives, a bus came with wardens to the prison. When they tried to escape, they found that the road was blocked with flames, and they bus driver decided to keep driving, seeing as just standing there won't help anyone.

They didn't survive, if you haven't figured that out already.

A total of 44 people died, including the prisoners, the wardens, the bus driver, 3 cops and 3 firemen. A monument was built for them near the prison, weighing 44 tons, one ton for every person that died.

Yes this one is a bit dark, shut up.
