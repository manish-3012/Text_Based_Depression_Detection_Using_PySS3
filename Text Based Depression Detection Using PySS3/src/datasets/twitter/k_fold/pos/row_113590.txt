Yep, No, Goodbye. This sub is getting too misandrous and misogynistic for me. I'm done until this is cleaned up. When i joined this sub, I expected this sub to just be random stuff you've done, rants about stuff, Relationships, Advice, but no. Ever since that "\[expletive\] Girls" post, you've all been naughty, and I even got into it. So, It's been fun for the few months.

But Jokes on all of you, [I hate everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME).

See you guys.
