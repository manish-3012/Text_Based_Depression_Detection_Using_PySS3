Quote Marc-Uwe Kling I've heard a quote by Marc-Uwe Kling recently, saying it's weird that the stupid people in our world are happy, while the smart ones are depressed and it hit me hard. I have been thinking about it since. What do you think about it?

The full quote is in german and it's a little poem:

"Es sagt viel Ã¼ber die Welt aus, mein Kind,
 sagte der Vater zu dem Knaben,
 dass die Dummen glÃ¼cklich sind
 und die Schlauen Depressionen haben."

Basically translating to:

"It tells you a lot about the world, my child,
 said the father to the boy, 
 that the fools are happy
 and the smart ones are depressed."
