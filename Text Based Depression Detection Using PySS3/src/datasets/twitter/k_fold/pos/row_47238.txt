Anyone find it offensive when someone whoâ€™s below your level looks wise finds you unattractive I consider myself a 8.5 and conventionally attractive and recently some girl on yubo that my boys and me were trolling said Iâ€™m ugly and I couldnâ€™t believe it especially coming from her and I know itâ€™s not true cuz girls who are way hotter have liked me and Iâ€™ve got with so thatâ€™s false like Idk how she can actually think that. If I was to go for her it would be a honor
