Very annoyed with my teacher I signed up for CAD as an elective. It stands for computer aided design. That sounded interesting to me and I thought I would enjoy it so I took the class. The teacher however is very annoying. He said that he doesnâ€™t like how kids these days donâ€™t tinker around like he did as a kid and how he wants to make the class old fashioned and only using pencil and paper. Thatâ€™s cool and all, but I signed up for computer aided design. Not whatever heâ€™s teaching. I havenâ€™t touched a computer all year for the class and I hate whatever heâ€™s teaching. There was one assignment where you could optionally use the CAD software, but he never taught anyone how to use it so I had to do it on paper for it to look good. I seriously donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve learned a single thing all year.
