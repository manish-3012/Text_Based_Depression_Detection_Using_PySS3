I got friend-zoned :(( So, first of all i do have to apologize for bad grammar /spelling cause im gonna be typing this pretty fast. Anyways, so a bit of context till i get to the main part of this story. Im a girl and im bisexual. My bestfriend (who is also a girl) just recently came out as bi herself. I think i've always had a crush on her, but since she identified as straight i thought i just liked her in a friend sort of way

boy was i wrong

So my crush/ friend (lets call her E) has a crush on another girl (lets call her N) I knew and i guess it was kinda my fault for catching feelings for E. Anyways, I told E over insta yesterday that i had a crush on her, and she said that she had already knew it since i make it VERY obvious unintentionally. She told me she was fine with it and even said stuff like "Im cute admit it   ;-)". It was maybe a bit discouraging but I dealt with it fine.

But what really hurt is today in class she just randomly said to me "im such a simp for N". She kept talking about how much she likes N and I acted all smiley and happy on the outside but im tearing up on the inside. She knows I like her, why does she do this? idk. Do I hate her for doing this? sorta wish i could, but i really can't. Both E and N are having a hangout with some other friends this weekend - and I'm coming. I kind of don't wanna see there faces ever again and yeah, I'm definitely a bit jealous of N, but I'll really never let it show. 

And I know this sounds really stupid and childish but both N and E have matching pfps on discord and im really jealous - why can't I just be happy for them? ;-;

Oh and another thing N is an online friend who lives in the same city as us so we've never actually met her irl. But i feel like she's replacing my spot in the friend group, It took me SO long to get friends and now this happens. I just really wanna be important to them but nowadays i feel like im not. 

oh, and if N or E see this post (you know who you are) act like you never did.
