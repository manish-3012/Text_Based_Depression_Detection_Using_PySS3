A big portion of Gen Z are way too apathetic and ignorant when it comes to mental health. Iâ€™m gonna get shit for this no doubt, so Iâ€™m posting on an account I donâ€™t care about:

(I said a â€œbig portionâ€ because I donâ€™t want to discredit people who arenâ€™t like this.)

EVERYTIME a person from gen z talks about their mental health like legit problems that anxiety or depression causes, or trying to raise awareness, people comment â€œThis is whatâ€™s wrong with Gen Z.â€

Problems with anxiety and depression have always fucking been here. Itâ€™s present in every generation. We just talk about it more (With technology and such and more mental health awareness.)

Someone could post about how depression makes hygiene hard. (Which it does) And gen Z will SPAM â€œJust do itâ€ â€œStop blaming everything on your depressionâ€ â€œWeakâ€

The worst part is that the people saying that shit DONT EVEN HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS. So theyâ€™re invalidating people who have them.
