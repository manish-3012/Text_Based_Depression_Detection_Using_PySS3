Because I'm bored I'm gonna tell you a dream I had last night So in this facility there was a robot with a girl like aesthetic, "she" had  doors on some part of her body. some were gray but some had a yellow stripe on them (the yellow stripes were signs of importance). These kind of doors were located on her wrist, forehead and on the chest. These doors had some kind of meaning: the forehead means "open your mind", the chest "open your hart" and the wrist IDK, the robot was really tall, like, two adults.  "Her" primary use was to scavange different biomes but "she" could do that only with the help of someone because of anxiety. And I can predict your lines, so I'm sure you'll say "isn't this an excuse to tell a kink?" TOYU
