Why do i want to feel pain? Let me explain, sometimes i have these thoughts about me in really painful situations: getting cheated on, sad, depressing stuff in general, and sometimes i think to myself that id rather want to feel pain rather than happiness.

I don't know whats happening, i got  a few years ago rejected by a girl and i was happier when i got home beacuse of the rejection and that I was hurt.

Maybe i need therapy or i don't know.
