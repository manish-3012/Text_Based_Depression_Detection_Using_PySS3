Okay so my friend is rewatching AOT with me, this is my first time through tho (SPOILER STUFF AOT SEASON 2 EPISODE 6) I totally didnâ€™t read the reveal bit where &gt;!Reiner admits it to Eren, because it was so quick and off handed !&lt; and I was drinking my shamrock shake. But like the thing that annoys me most is that I JUST WANNA KNOW &gt;! THE TITANâ€™S MOTIVES, LIKE WHY THO MY GUY !&lt; but I have to wait forever supposedly to actually find that shit out
