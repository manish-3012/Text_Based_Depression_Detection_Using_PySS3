In my school they taught us how to find job So everyone from my friends were complaining that school cannot give you something for life, but last week on Public Education our teacher taught us what do you need to find a job. He also ask us opinion on topics like Belarusian protests or Elections in USA. I hope he will teach me how to pay taxes.
