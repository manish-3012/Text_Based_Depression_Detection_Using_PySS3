I know this is a long shot but, Ok so I had a childhood friend and he lived in a apartment building and I lived in an old historic house across the street. We used to pretend that the Zombie Apocalypse occurred and we lived in the houses on the top floors of the apartment complex. He had a little sister that had a crush on me. His mother worked in a thrift store. We first met when he moved in and me and my sister were hanging out on a large sign in front of the apartment he moved into. His step father told him to go say hello and we became friends. I moved away to the other part of the island. My question is that if my childhood friend is out there, hows life?
