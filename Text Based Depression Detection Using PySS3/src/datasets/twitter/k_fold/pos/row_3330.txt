My Christmas All nighter Im a skeptic. I didnt belive in Santa Claus, didn't seem to plausible to me becuase it was so unrealistic.

To finally debunk for those around me his exsistance, I decided I would pull an all nighter to really see if he was real. 

At time or writting it's 3:54AM EST and I can defeintly say Santa is real. I was on the phone with my friend gaming for around 2 hours and when we were done it was 2:02 AM EST. I then sat on Discord for around 20 minutes and at 2:25EST, I went back in the basement. I then played Mortal Kombat 11 for around an hour until 3:35 AM and when I came upstairs, there was a big box full of Oreos and a note.

I guess the Christmas spirit is real huh.

Merry Christmas to you.
