guys i did something today... so basically theres this guy in my class that ive been talking to and idk i like him and he likes me but doesnt matter. after school, i got a watermelon slush and he complained that i was drinking too slow (hehe) then i held it up to him and was like if youre gonna complain then drink some. poor dude blushed so bad but he took a sip hehe :) and we hung out for a while and when i had to go i spread out my arms signalling him to hug me and he was like flustered so damn much and i just hugged him but it was awkward and then i walked away like :c then he runs up to me and hugs me back and i was like HDJDHSKSHSKSHDKD sorry i had to share this im used to being alone hehe :)
