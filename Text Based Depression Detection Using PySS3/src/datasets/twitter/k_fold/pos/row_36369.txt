hwo to deal today I was dropping my sister from school to home. on the way, there was a taxi driver who unexpectedly applied brakes, he mf had his back glass covered so he did see me, I applied brakes so hard, and just missed crashing into him. then I pulled over and told him, "watch the road when you drive." he was like ready to pick up fight with anyone in the world, even the terrorists, he came out and started abusing me real dirty in front of my sister, I didn't wanted to say anything back because my sister wouldn't want to see me like that. he then said I have a melee weapon sort of in his taxi, I didn't wanted to be abusive in front my my sister so I said, "put that in yourself" and then left. after few metres I saw he was driving like crazy beside to make me pull over to lick up a fight. this sort of thing never happened with me, some random stranger abusing me and then following me for a fight. I slowed down and took a turn at the intersection going behind him and since that mf had his back glass covered he didn't see me. then we lost him, but the whole way I had this feeling in my stomach. im home now but I'm sort of disturbed,  can't focus on anything. this had never happened to me
