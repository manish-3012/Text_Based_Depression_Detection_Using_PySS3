You know that thing where you hit your nuts or something and then they hurt and every time you take a step the shock goes right into your groin and hurts like bloody hell? Well I had that yesturday while marching in band camp. Not fun. Your body just screams to stop moving but you have to or else everyone else will no so you just have to like run a few yards without just dying.
