Happy Valentineâ€™s Day yâ€™all! I saw my gf last night and I got her a homemade card and a wolf pup plushie, she loved it. She got me a momento of our first date, on which we watched HTTYD: The Hidden World. It was a yin-yang pin with the two dragons on it and she drew me a picture of them on digital art. We had a really fun time,
