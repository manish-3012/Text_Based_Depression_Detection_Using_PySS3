Join my DC group chat if you want. We dont have ant censorship so swearing is allowed, racial slurs are pretty frowned upon but i and my staff are pretty lenient unless it becomes really out of hand. We have places for things like memes, pictures, bot commands and much more, we have a lot of roles and emotes you can use. If its important to you we are okay with lgbtq+, honestly nobody really cares or judges. I do no recommend this server for people who get triggered really easily. If you want come check it out or what not. The code is TwKR9cBUvt just copy and paste that at the end of discord. gg/ no space between the . and gg
