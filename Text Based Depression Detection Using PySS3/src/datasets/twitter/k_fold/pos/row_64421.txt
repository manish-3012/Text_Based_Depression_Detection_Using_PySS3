Is it ok to be a quiet and lonely kid? I'm not really sure if it's ok to be a quiet and lonely kid. I've like this since I was 14 and first started high school. I did have a traumatic experience before with someone close to me so it has affected my trust issues. So it ok for me to be alone and quiet? Sorry if I wasted your time reading this.
