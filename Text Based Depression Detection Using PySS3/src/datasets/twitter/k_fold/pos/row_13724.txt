I am tired of this weeb shit So, before anyone says anything, i donâ€™t have anything against weebs, BUT there is something I do wanna say, I donâ€™t expect anything to change after I say this, but I still want to say this somewhere.

Now, the main point of my rant. Why do so many people have to turn everything into anime? It might sound weird, but you see it everywhere. Artists turning everything and I mean everything into anime people, not just that, anime girls. And even worse, (now Iâ€™m not saying all weebs are like these, there are some I still respect) some of these artist like to draw lewd drawings, and like really lewd drawings. Now this may seem unimportant or maybe Iâ€™m just overreacting, but seriously, its like getting out of hand.

You see these like of drawings everywhere, and what Iâ€™m trying to get to here is that: If you want to fantasise about animated pixels that look like women, do it on your own or post it in like your own group of degenerates or something, donâ€™t put it out on the internet everywhere. I donâ€™t even have anything against anime, its just weird and so disturbing that some people like to draw this kind of stuff. 

And then thereâ€™s the anime art, many like to draw other say video game characters as anime, now this is fine and all, but why do they have to turn them into anime girls and focused on sexual desires? Why all the uwu and owo shit? So all in all, I just wish these people will stop, Its disturbing, and Iâ€™m sure there are others that are tired of this weeb shit. 

Sure my rant wonâ€™t change anything, and the large bunch of you here are probably weebs too, but Iâ€™m just going to leave this here, at least Iâ€™ve said it.
