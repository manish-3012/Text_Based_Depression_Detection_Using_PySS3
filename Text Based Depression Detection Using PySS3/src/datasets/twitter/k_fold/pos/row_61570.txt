I do nothing but hurt the people around me im just a burden to everyone around me. everyone would be better off if i wasnt here. 

The word worthless implies that you have zero worth. I feel like i have even less than that. negative worth.  The world would be better if i... did something i dont have the strength to do...

my parents cant be happy because of me. ive hurt everyone ive ever interacted with. ive pushed people away who used to be my friends because i hurt them. 

i cant think clearly. i know ive never been able to think clearly. my brain hates itself. i hurt myself too. sometimes on accident sometimes on purpose. 

if youve read this im sorry for hurting you too. i just needed somewhere to put these rambling thoughts other than my own head.

dont spend your time worrying about me. im too weak and too scared of not existing.
