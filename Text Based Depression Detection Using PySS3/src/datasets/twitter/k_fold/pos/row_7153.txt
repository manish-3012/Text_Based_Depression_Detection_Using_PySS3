have you guys ever watched your best friend turn into a stranger? I used to be best friends with this girl. we were so close and used to talk all the time, and then she downloaded snapchat. I have nothing against snapchat, and at first I thought it was cool cuz we could snap eachother and stuff. but then she started talking to the more popular girls in school and less to me, and started talking to all these boys online (which she would've never done just a couple months before). her snap score went up by over 200,000 after just having the app for a couple months. she went from the weird quiet girl that I loved to a complete stranger. we stopped talking as much as she turned into just another one of those popular straight white girls. she talks about and makes jokes about all her other friends that she's made over quarantine when she posts to her whatsapp status (which all of her old friends can see). this was probably really poorly written but I just had to get it out.
