everything is just so absurd One moment Iâ€™m cool with everything being sort of meaningless, and then in the next, my mind confronts me with the time in my old philosophy class when I said something really cringe. Or at least, I think it was cringe? Why am I even thinking about it, it was like half a year ago, and nobody in the entirety of the universe other than me remembers that experience, let alone in vivid detail. In imagined, re-constructed, and falsified detail

Ugh, I just feel so neurotic and hollow tonight

Being a human is hard sometimes, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll agree
