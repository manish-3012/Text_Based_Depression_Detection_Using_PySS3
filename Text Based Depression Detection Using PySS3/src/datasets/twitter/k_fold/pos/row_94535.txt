Weird DÃ©jÃ  vu So the other day I kept on having this weird dÃ©jÃ  vu where I would have it for like a split second and then it would be gone. And like a dream I can sorta remember some of it but canâ€™t pin point what. So like I think there was a purple background or landscape or somethings. Anyways just thought it would be cool to have you guys give me crazy theories like itâ€™s another dimension calling for me.
