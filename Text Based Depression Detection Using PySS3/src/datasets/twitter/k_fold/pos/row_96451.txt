Insta makes me feel like shit so I tried building an alternative I always found Insta and TikTok flexing made me feel way more isolated than connected, so I decided to try make an app [https://www.discovercoolshit.com/](https://www.discovercoolshit.com/) all centred around finding and doing stuff with friends IRL.

The idea is you â€œcurateâ€ a suggestions of things to do with friends, and discover new things to do from following people you havenâ€™t met.

Some of my mates who've used it think its pretty neat, but any feedback from you guys would be really awesome [ðŸ¤—](https://emojipedia.org/hugging-face/)
