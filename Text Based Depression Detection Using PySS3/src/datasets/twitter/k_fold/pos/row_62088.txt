Whatâ€™s the worst way the universe has said no, and given you the middle finger. So I had a crush on a girl, but not having confidence really shuts you down in that department. I told myself that a week from that day I was going to psych myself into it and ask her to be my gf, but the day I was going to ask her another dude asked her the day before. And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m pessimistic.
