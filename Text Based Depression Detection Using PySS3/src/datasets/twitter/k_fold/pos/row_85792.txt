I am so angry right now I could generate energy with the amount of anger I consist of My fucking sisters ate the entire box of cereal this morning and left none for me. 
 
We literally bought that box yesterday and my fucking sisters ate them like they were doing a guinness world records. 
 
I'm so mad right now I could actually just explode right on the spot and then implode into a black hole after that.
 
My entire fucking day was ruined now and this is the worst morning I have ever experienced I actually want to cry right now please someone help please.
 
I didn't even get a fucking chance to get a spoonful of them and my asshole sisters just didn't think at all that maybe there are more people THAN THEIR SELFISH FATASSES IN THIS FUCKING HOUSE.
 
I will actually just kick them out of the house if this ever happens again oh my god.
