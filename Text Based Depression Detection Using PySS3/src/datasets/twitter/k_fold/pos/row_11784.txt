Every Skyblock Player Ever... After consuming hours upon hours of Skyblock content I came to a determination. There are certain characteristics that all of these YouTubers share. 

I did make a video about it if you are interested I will link it down below. 

Most of them tend to do some building off camera... and we all know what that means.

Also I used a certain map that you'll see if you watch the video and I did not create it. Credit for that map goes to Madnes64.

I get that people might think I'm just self-promoting and I can understand why they might think that. I just thought you guys might find the video entertaining which is really all I care about. **You are obviously free to just ignore this and downvote if you want.** With that out of the way I hope you all have a nice day.
