Can somebody please help? My friend (12) has been completely restricted from anything gorey, edgy, or anything trauma related. Apparently their parents restricted them from it because â€œtheyâ€™re too youngâ€ or something. Itâ€™s also possible they restricted her form it because they donâ€™t want her becoming violent or depressed. I really want to help her. Sheâ€™s not allowed to talk about trauma, killing, death, or anything along those lines. I can kind of understand that rule, but at the same time, I think itâ€™s ridiculous. She knows gore is bad and would never actually kill somebody. But now she canâ€™t even draw anything with blood in it. She canâ€™t listen to songs that are violent or edgy or talk about killing. Her father apparently doesnâ€™t listen. Please, *please* somebody help. (I donâ€™t think CPS can help with this because itâ€™s not child abuse or anything like thatâ€™s itâ€™s just very strict rules) 

Is there any way I can help her talk to her parents about this? They usually donâ€™t listen to her apparently. I donâ€™t want her to have to feel like sheâ€™s a little toddler because sheâ€™s not. Sheâ€™s 12. Sheâ€™s technically still a kid but sheâ€™s knows good from bad. Any advice on this?
