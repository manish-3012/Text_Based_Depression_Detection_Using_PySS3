Best way to get the interest of a guy Just show that you like him, thatâ€™s it, donâ€™t act crazy or too forward, but give him compliments and try to talk to him and get closer, chances are heâ€™ll catch feelings right back, unless heâ€™s some kind of douche or asshole or if things just werenâ€™t meant to be.

Donâ€™t play hard to get, that shit comes off as extremely immature and rude.
