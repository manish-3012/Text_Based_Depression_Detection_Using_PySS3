My mom was telling at me because I don't feel good So my step dad's mom died and they went to there house to split up the stuff between my step dad and his siblings and I didnt feel well (dizzy and a headache) and I had passed out TWICE so I went and sat in the car and took a nap because my mom said it would make me feel better. After we left and got home she then proceeded to YELL AT ME for being "an antisocial ass" (she know I have social anxiety to the point of completely shutting down) but that wasn't even the reason I was in the car. It was because SHE TOLD ME TO BE. Tldr; my mom yelled at me for being in the car after she told me to be in there because I didn't feel well
So yeah fml
