How many of you guys didnt really grow up with social media? Alright for a little bit of context, i grew up in Africa before moving to europe in 2014. Im currently 19, almost 20 and my coming to the West has made me realise how out of touch i was. I mean the first time i heard the word "youtube" was late 2014, early 2015. I ended up downloading it at 15, twitter at 16/17 and reddit at 18. I hadnt even played video games before 2014. Are my the only one has made such an experience?
