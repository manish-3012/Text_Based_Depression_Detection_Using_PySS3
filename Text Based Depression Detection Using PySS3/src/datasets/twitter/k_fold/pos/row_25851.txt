A sci fi story idea I have in mind Jane Meitner, private eye

-A science fiction detective novel 

Some rough outline draft idea something or whatever it's called:

Jane Marie Burnell was a former science officer and astrophysicist in the Galactic Federation research vessel *Wanderer* Due to a false accusation of falsification of data in one of her papers, Meitner is expelled from the scientific community.

Meitner soon sets up a private investigation office in the Pleiades Deep Space Station, where she solves cases of mysterious disappearances unsolved or abandoned by the Galactic Federation. Meitner soon finds herself embarking on a galaxy-wide journey on the small starship *Centauri*, encountering strange planets, creatures, and new dangers that lurk in the darkness of the universe and man.
