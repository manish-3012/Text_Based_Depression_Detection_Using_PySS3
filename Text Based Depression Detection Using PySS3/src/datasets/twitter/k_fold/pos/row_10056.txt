Weight loss day 17 Iâ€™m losing weight and gaining muscle!! Iâ€™ve been passively working out and strengthening my arms and my waistline has gone down! Iâ€™m eating a lot of protein and almost zero sugar, as opposed to overeating and eating a lot of sugar! My impulse buys are for better food like jerky instead of candy for treats, and Its getting easier to say no to sweets. Thank you guys for all of your support, it really keeps me going. Also thanks to my partner who has been with me the whole time supporting me
