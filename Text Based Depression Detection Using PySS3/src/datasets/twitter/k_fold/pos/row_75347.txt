So there is someone that likes me...... So there is a girl that i have been with since 2017, (we're batchmates, same school). So we're in 10th grade now and we're classmates and before that, around 2 months before school she told me that she likes me (or i'm her crush idk can't tell) then i also told her that i like her (a bit). so what do i do? tbh, i don't want to have a GF. I'm already satisfied with my life i can do almost anything i want anytime and anywhere. I'm happy with playing Kerbal Space Program and watching Sci-fi shows and stuff.
