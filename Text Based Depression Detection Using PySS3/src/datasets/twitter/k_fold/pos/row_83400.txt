Petition for teacher being forced by district to retire Hey!
I donâ€™t usually post, but I am asking for support. 
My history teacher is currently being forced to retire by my school district. They are forcing him to go back to school. He even offered to take unpaid leave until he gets the vaccine, but theyâ€™re still making him go back to school without the vaccine. Itâ€™s extremely hard to go through online school, but heâ€™s one of the teachers that makes it better. Please sign this petition, it would only take a second of your time and I would really appreciate it!
