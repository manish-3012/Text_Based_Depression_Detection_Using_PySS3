Stinky winky socks Me and my sister were home alone once, as our parents went away to visit some relatives idk why(relatives sucks anyways)

So her having a boring sibling, decided to invite some of her friends for sleepover. Usually i wouldn't have allowed this but her friends included this one girl who i had a crush on for years

So they arrived at our door at like 7pm  and all we did for few hours were partying and eating the pizza we ordered and messing around.

Then i had the bright idea to play the unholy game popularly known as truth and dare, we started playing the game in my sister's room and you should have noticed the change of colours in my face when all i got were boring dares about eating gross food and stuff while other were kissing and other fun stuff.


So i bailed making a excuse, i went back to my room and started looking for my phone, it was nowhere, i then hitted my head againt the wall and remembered that i left it in my sisters room.

So i went back there and firstly i took a sneek peek to see what my crush is doing, but holly molly she was half naked dancing in front of them, i -

I couldn't move for a second, then i bailed as soon as come to my senses, but it was too late i was full of those emotions, i was ducking too much horny, you cam say ungodly amount of horniness was running in my blood, i have to do something, i couldn't use my hands as they were still paining from last week accident so i started searching for anything, anything that i could use, all the stuff toys were in my sister room, i looked in the kitchen but all i could find was knife, that didn't seemed like a good option so o went into my parents to find something of some use, but all i could find was a used sock, that smelled reallll bad, it was a bit sticky but i didn't care


I tried washing it first but the dopomine got the best of me and i just went back to my room

The deed beagn, But as god hates me my crush sneeked into my room at the same time, at first i got surprised, then she looked towards me and got more surprised, our eyes meet, then her eyes meet the socks then her smile dropped like the bomb dropped in Hiroshima.

she ran away, i was in too much shock, she then made a excuse to my sister and went back home.

she no longers talk to me or looks at me, any advice will be helpfull
