Just thought of the best thing ever Thereâ€™s this thing the people doing their last year at my schoon do called the Suck Train (not related to sucking), and itâ€™s essentially every person whoâ€™s leaving, dressed up in a funny costume, then they play this drum theme at the front and back, and they walk around the city, dancing and showing off their outfits

So iâ€™m white, and iâ€™ve got kinda red hair, and iâ€™m a meme lord, and i thought it would be funny if i bought a speaker, played Never Gonna Give you Up, dressed as Rick Astley from the video, and i danced that iconic dance
