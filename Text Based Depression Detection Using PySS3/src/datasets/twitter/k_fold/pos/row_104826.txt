Texting girl So thereâ€™s this girl that Iâ€™m pretty sure is into me, or at least thinks Iâ€™m cute. She asked for my number and has initiated every conversation but the problem is her texts are super fucking dry, only a few words, and itâ€™s normally a while between my texts and when she responds, even if I text right after she texts me. So, like, wtf? Is she playing some sort of game or something I donâ€™t get it. Weâ€™ve only had a couple conversations about school and sleeping, which are pretty boring topics so maybe thatâ€™s why but idk it seems pretty stupid and itâ€™s really fucking annoying and if it is boring conversation Iâ€™m not quite sure how to change the topic. Iâ€™m so fucking confused on whatâ€™s happening, any help would be great
