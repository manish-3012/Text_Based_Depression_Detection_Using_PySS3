I feel so bad My mental health is at an all time low at the moment, the pressure from school, and not being able to do something (because of Covid), really got to me. I have no motivation left, to do any work for school, i have no motivation to talk to my friends, and i just feel like shit constantly. I started to fucking cry, because I saw a dumb stock image of a person looking like he is sad/depressed. I constantly have the urge to cry and I overall have no motivation or energy to do anything.

I dont feel like im at the point where people say they're depressed or suicidal, but it really fucks me over.
