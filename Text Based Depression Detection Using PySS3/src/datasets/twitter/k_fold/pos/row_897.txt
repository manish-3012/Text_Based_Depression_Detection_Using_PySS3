What am I in store for? Concerned parent here. Hey everyone, I figured this would be a good place to ask so here goes. I am a 39-year-old father of a 13-year-old daughter who currently lives in Atlanta, while I reside in Philadelphia. To be honest, I wasn't there for 12 years and we recently reconnected and have been talking on Facebook. She came up to visit and it blew my mind how pretty she is and how cool she is at such a young age. I know I wasn't there for her as a father for 12 years but I have a second chance and I'm not going to blow it. And I know I'm lucky that she even talks to me.

My question is this, she just became a teenager recently, and she is starting seventh-grade in the fall. What do I have to look forward to as far as angst, depression, acting out, sexual experimentation, hostile behavior, etc.? I have a 22-year-old son, but I know what it was like to be a teenage boy. Teenage girls is unfamiliar territory.

I love my daughter, and lucky to have her in my life, I don't want to blow it, what can I do to be there for her? Lucky to have such cool kids and just trying to be a better dad. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks everybody, Ron from Philly.
