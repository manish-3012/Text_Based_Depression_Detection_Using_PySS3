First post here(true story too) So I just have a funny story so I decided to share here. So last school year I was in eighth grade. I got a gf(wow but youâ€™re on Reddit) and that went well for like eleven months. Then we had this wonderful person in China eat a bat and now no gf. But it gets better. This year i have her sister as my history teacher. Every. Single. Day. And that same teacher is my class sponsor so sheâ€™ll be with my grade level for four years. So you know itâ€™s a really fun time and not awkward at all.
