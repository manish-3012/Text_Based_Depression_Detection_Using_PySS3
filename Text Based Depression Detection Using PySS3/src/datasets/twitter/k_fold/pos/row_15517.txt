it feels off so i uh... i recently got into a relationship with a girl who is 12. i am 14. weâ€™re exactly 2 years apart (we have the same birthday) and i mean like, itâ€™s not that big of a difference, and sheâ€™s really mature for her age but something still feels off. when i asked her out i thought she was 13, because of a typo. 

i feel like a pedo, even though iâ€™m technically not, reddit hivemind? can you help me here?
