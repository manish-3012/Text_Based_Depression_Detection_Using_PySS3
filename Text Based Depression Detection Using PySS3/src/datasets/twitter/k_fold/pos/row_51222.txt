Why it's hard for the society to undrestand that men and boys are victims of rape too ?!?! " You know what be better? If we just taught young boys that rape isnâ€™t even an option " Anna Akana.

Imagine if someone said "  You know what be better? If we just taught black people that rape isnâ€™t even an option" everyone will see this as bigotry but for some reason making this generalization about men and boys is okay ! men and boys already know that rape is not okay, only 0.0001 % commit rape.

And also why ignore male victims of rape ?! Center For Disease Controlâ€™s â€œNational Intimate Partner [**Violence and Sexual Violence Survey**](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/11/sexual-offending-by-women-is-surprisingly-common-claims-us-study/)â€. In 2011, for example, this survey showed that equal numbers of men and women reported being forced into non-consensual sex (either raped themselves or forced to penetrate someone else). Extrapolated to the US as a whole, this would represent 1.9 million victims among each sex during the preceding 12 months.

But men are only raped by other men ? NOOOOO. in 79.2 per cent of cases the perpetrator forcing the sexual act was a woman.

Most men are harassed by women at work. Four out of five men are sexually harassed by women at work - but are too afraid to complain to their employers - according to researchers. A study by the [law firm Peninsula found](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2234298/Most-men-are-harassed-by-women-at-work.html) 85 per cent of employers admit they take a complaints of sexual harassment from a male employees less seriously !
