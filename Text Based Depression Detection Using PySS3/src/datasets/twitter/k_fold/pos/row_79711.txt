My niece is home. Iâ€™m officially an uncle now. My sister, her husband, and their newborn baby returned home from the hospital today. Words cannot describe how excited itâ€™ll be to help my niece grow and thrive many years to come. Today, I have officially become an uncle.

I canâ€™t wait to share my life advice and hobbies with my niece. 

Welcome to the family, Emma.
