Today I messed up with a girl Iâ€™m talking to TIFU: Iâ€™m talking to someone and I made a crappy joke.

Iâ€™m 16M and the girl Iâ€™m talking to is 14F. I was on r/amiugly and there was a girl my age and I made the mistake of joking saying, â€œIf I wasnâ€™t talking to someone I would simp over youâ€. I wasnâ€™t implying that I didnâ€™t like the girl Iâ€™m talking to, but I know I messed up. I didnâ€™t really mean it because itâ€™s Reddit and Iâ€™m bad at talking to girls anyways. I really like this girl and she really likes me. I donâ€™t want to mess this up because I want to be with someone, even if we live in different states. What should I do to make the situation better?
