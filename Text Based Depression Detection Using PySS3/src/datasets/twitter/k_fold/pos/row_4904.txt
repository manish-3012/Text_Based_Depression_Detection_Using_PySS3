My grandad is gone I dont want to think of what I've lost anymore, I want to think of what I had.

He was as stubborn as they come and loved all to watch as much football and cricket he could. He followed Ipswich which we liked to take the piss out of him for but he always had a comeback and his sense of humour was flawless. He gave no shits what you thought of him, if he had an opinion you better be ready to hear it but due to his wit he'd insult people to there faces and they'd laugh not knowing he was serious.

He'd come out with comments sometimes that would stop us in our tracks, teaching my brothers and I words we shouldn't have known and laughing his arse off when he found out we used them from my mum who was telling him off.

Everyone loved him and as we said our final goodbyes and told him we loved him he said "Well of course you do, I'm just so loveable"

Im so lucky to have had him this long, im so glad we had one last birthday with him.

 Miss you, Grandad. Life won't be as full without you.
