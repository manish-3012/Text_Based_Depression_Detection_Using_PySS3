Questions about me changing my sex (becoming a transsexual person) Before I start talking about this, I just want to add the definition of transsexual, for anyone unfamiliar with the term. I left the Wikipedia links in if anyone is interested. (Quote from the first paragraph of the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexual).)

&gt;[Transsexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexual) people experience a [gender identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) that is inconsistent with their [assigned sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_assignment) and desire to permanently [transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitioning_(transgender)) to the [sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex) or [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender) with which they identify, usually seeking medical assistance (including [sex reassignment therapies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_therapy), such as [hormone replacement therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_hormone_therapy) and [sex reassignment surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery)) to help them align their body with their identified sex or gender.

I was thinking about being transsexual for a while now. I mean like fully changing my sex from male to female biologically and legally.  However, I'm not sure about it yet, for a few reasons.

First, I don't know much about the process. I have never gone through whatever you have to do to change your sex, nor have I had any friends or family that have done it. It would be nice to know if I can still change my sex. Even though I'm still only 15, I have probably finished puberty by now (major changes: a pretty fast-growing beard). From what I can figure out, a lot of complications can arise from even partially maturing. Such as removing male parts and replacing them with female ones? Is that even possible? As for the legal part, I googled it, and it appears that it allows you to change your legal gender in my state (California is good about that kind of thing.)

Second, I'm still not entirely sure. I start high school as a freshman on Tuesday, and I feel that it would be weird to suddenly become female in the middle of my first year of high school. Maybe I wait until next summer? I don't know.

Third, I'd want to change some habits. For example, getting used to periods, not taking my shirt off in public, et cetera. As well as buying different clothes (because I want to go all out or nothing.) Getting used to referring to myself using female pronouns instead of male. And remembering which bathroom to use. Now that I think about it, there's a lot of changes.

Fourth, my sexual orientation is towards females. It might be different after turning female, but I don't know how that would work out. That makes me sound like some sort of trap (a lesbian "girl" that was a boy?) but I'd be full on female. (Yes, private parts and all.) I'm not too concerned about this one and don't have any questions about it, but it might be important to note.

I think what I'm trying to ask here is:

* Is the process harder with my current situation? Or is it even possible?
* Should I do it now or later, and why or why not?
* Does anyone here that has gone through the change (or had a close relation with someone who did) have any advice on this? As stated above, I am completely new to this.
* And is there anything else I missed that might be handy to know and consider?

TL;DR: Want to change sex from male to female, don't know anything however, asking for help.
