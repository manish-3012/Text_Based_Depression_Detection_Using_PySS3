I've been playing Lego Harry Potter years 1-4 every weekend at my mom's house for old time's sake. Currently, I'm halfway through year 3 with 35% completion. I'm hoping to get 100%, but I know that's gonna take a while. REALLY looking forward to obtaining Reducto and a wizard with dark magic as those are the only two abilities I need left to completely explore Hogwarts.  


Wish me luck bois.
