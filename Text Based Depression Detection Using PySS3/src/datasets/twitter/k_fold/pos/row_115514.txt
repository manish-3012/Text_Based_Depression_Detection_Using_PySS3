Well... fuck. My boyfriend of 6 months just broke up with me. over text. through a friend. you may think that i shouldnt be surprised, and frankly im not, but it hurts really badly. and heres why:

We were both depressed as fuck (still are). We would stand by each other in the lowest points and make sure the other was ok. When i wanted to tie a fucking noose and hang myself the thought of how devestated he would be kept me alive. I stopped him from killing himself once. When he was in the mental hospital i would always call his parents and make sure he was alive. i stayed awake at nights praying he was ok even though im an atheist. I made him a jar of things that i loved about him so when he was feeling extra depressed he could read one of the slips and know there was at least one person who loved him. and he didnt even bother to tell me himself that he lost interest. i just.... i have no words. i want to sob uncontrollably but i also feel empty. I really loved him. Theres just.... a hole in my heart. Im probably overreacting given how this is just a middle school relationship, but he meant so much to me, and he didnt even bother to tell me himself. Thanks if you read this far. have a good day. sorry to rant on the internet but i dont have anyone else to rant to.
