Need some crush advive So there's this girl I like I plan on dating her at some point, but I dont know when, I dont know if I should ask her in September when we eventually go back to school, or maybe next year as, this may sound bad but, I got exams to concentrate on and maybe a partner will distract me on revising. Any advice?
