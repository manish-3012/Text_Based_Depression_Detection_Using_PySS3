Failing a road test 4 times without even driving. Im so tired of this. For months now I have been denied taking my road test because of â€œbroken or malfunctioning equipmentâ€ or for some other universal middle finger.

My dad drives a 1998 Buick Regal GS. Its slick asf, has a 3.8L supercharged v6. Ive learnt to drive on it for the most part.

Every time I get to the DMV for my road test, they turn me away for some reason or another. and its something different every time. 

First time its for a broken window switch. OK no problem, we fixed it.

Second time the highway was shut down to 1 lane, there was traffic and I missed my appointment 

Third time they email me saying my test was canceled for â€œâ€â€Unexpected reasonsâ€â€â€ 

FOURTH time (today) I drive an hour away to a DMV that will take me the soonest. They fail me for a thrid brake light being out which neither me or my dad knew we had. (Note that this wasnt noticed any of my other times) 

So yeah, im just really beat and upset right now. The universe seems to not want me to get my license. Anyone else struggle like this? Ill be here all day reading stories.
