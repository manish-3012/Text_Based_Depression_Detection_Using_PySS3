My wild experience for the past few days... So, a while ago I was super depressed for a certain reason. I was so desperate that I asked reddit for help. Alot of people helped me and got me out of it, which inspired me. After a sometime I found a guy also asking for help on reddit. I helped him as much as I could. He was so happy after it. And I felt so good for helping someone. I've seen alot of posts from people in trouble, having serious problems and need help. So, I put up posts daily for 3 or 4 days offering help and listening to people in need. And I helped a lot of them, which also felt great. But a girl really needed help and I was too late to reply. I know I couldn't solve her problem by talking but she deleted her comment and it felt bad. I told my mother and she told me I should stop because I am not professional and hearing all of these bad things might depress me. She's got a point but I am willing to keep on helping people. overall it was a great experience and I hope it inspires someone.
