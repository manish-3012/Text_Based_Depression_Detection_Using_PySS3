my mom is a dumbass today, we were listening to the radio and my mom said to me: "why don't you listen to your own music more often". i said that i didn't know if she would like the stuff i like or not (i like Billie Eillish and Dubstep), and she told me that she didn't care, but i should listen to music, because (her exact words):

&gt;"you are a teenager, you're supposed to be listening to music on full volume, while wearing earbuds, and ignoring the rest of the world, right? isn't that what teens are supposed to do with music?"

she assumes that's what every teen does when they listen to music
