My grandmother just passed away As the title says, my grandma passed away. It was this morning as my dad was leaving to see her. I only have one grandparent left now and I know that everyone goes through this eventually but it I'm not asking for sympathy. My dad is really broken up on his mum dying and I was wondering if you guys could help me come up with an idea to make him feel better. Any recommendations will be helpful
