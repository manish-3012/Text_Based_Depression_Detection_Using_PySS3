Sometimes I wonder why I even try. I just want to let this out. I feel like no matter what I do I'm not good enough. I've tried my hardest to be the best at whatever I do but I still feel like I'm at the bottom of everything. No matter how many achievements/awards I get, I still feel lost inside. This really sucks because I'm applying to college rn and I don't think I deserve to get in at all and idk why I even bother applying when there are 1000s of kids with perfect grades who probably deserve it more than me.
