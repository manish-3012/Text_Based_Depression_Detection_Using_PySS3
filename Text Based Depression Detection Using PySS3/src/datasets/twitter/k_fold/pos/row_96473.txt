Unpopular opinion, Girls are allowed to feel uncomfortable if a guy has a boner I know during puberty guys can't really control it but you aren't allowed to dictate whether we feel uncomfortable or not.


Of course it's a bitch move if a girl mocks you but she's is allowed to feel uncomfortable and is allowed to leave 



I can already see people down voting me and getting upset cause this sub is mostly male

Edit: I say it's unpopular because all posts about the topic are made by boys and most of them get upset if a girl feels uncomfortable and don't consider how the other party feels
