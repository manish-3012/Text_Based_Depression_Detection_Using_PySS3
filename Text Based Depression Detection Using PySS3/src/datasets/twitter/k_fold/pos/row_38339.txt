A girl just asked me to go to prom with her. I have known her for a while now and we've been pretty good friends for the past year and a half, i just feel so joyous. Don't get me wrong, I don't have a crush on her and i doubt she has one on me either, but daaamn i can not wipe that smug smile off my face i just can't help myself.

That's it, just wanted to share.
