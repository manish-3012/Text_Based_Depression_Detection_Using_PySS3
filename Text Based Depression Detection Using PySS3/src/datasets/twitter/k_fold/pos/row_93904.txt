How do you find your place in life ? Rant/question Iâ€™m tired of people saying that eventually Iâ€™ll find my place 
Iâ€™m tired of people saying life isnâ€™t a cycle . That you can break out of it 
Because I donâ€™t see any of it . Iâ€™m just being told things will get better 
And they do for some people , but seemingly not for me
Is this just a waiting game . Maybe youâ€™ll be lucky someday?
But until then . Damn you ? 

Or is there something to it . Something Iâ€™m missing ? 
LIke a key or something idk a way to get out 
A way to find my world . To anyone out there who may know this 
Is there an awnser to this questions . If there is , could you help me ?
Bc Iâ€™m tired of waiting and every now and then running up a hill just to tumble down a lose all my effort . Just to repeat again 

So if you know I will be pleased to hear from you
