Now more then ever I hate my body for looking like a female teen So you seen the title, I started hating my body. Not because Im slightly overweight, no because I look like what I am a girl. This used to not be a problem back when I was like 5, but now Iâ€™m older and look more and more like a women I am starting to hate it. I kinda wish I stayed not looking like how youâ€™d expect a teenage girl to look. So any advice or anything? I donâ€™t really know if I should just try waiting this out or doing anything about it.
