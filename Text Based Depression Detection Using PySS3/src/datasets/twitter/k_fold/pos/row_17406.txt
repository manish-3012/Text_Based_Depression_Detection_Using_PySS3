I was at a boba place and this college student only had 5 bucks. He wanted one drink which was $4.75 plus tax which resulted in $5.10. The dumb fucking lady wouldnâ€™t give him the drink because he only had $5 and he needed 10 more cents. This is the same bitch who charged my dad 7 more dollars on accident because she canâ€™t do proper math. My dad gave him a dollar, guy got his drink and the extra 90 cents.  Some people dude.
