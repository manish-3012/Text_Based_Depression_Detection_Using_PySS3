Brain why I think about breathing a few times a day, because I had a panic attack where I was going insane over breathing for a full night about a month and a half ago. Tbh Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll think about it the rest of my life. Like I ainâ€™t as happy anymore, and at times I try to believe I am. Anyways thatâ€™s just why Iâ€™m feeling sad today. Ignore lol
