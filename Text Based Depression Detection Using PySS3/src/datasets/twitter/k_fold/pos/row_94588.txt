There is world hunger and over population. The only answer is this. Make it where couples can only have one child, and do it for 2 generations. Ta da! World population is 25% of the original. Less people too feed and more food due to the decrease. Plus side: no killing from genocide, less homeless people, more housing 
, and just have 2 kids after that to keep it like that.
