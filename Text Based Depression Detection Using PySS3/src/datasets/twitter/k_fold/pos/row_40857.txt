Im a bad person Im a bad person because when ever someone hurts me emotionally i feel that i need to hurt them too and i do then i feel awful about it for a long its the reason why im depressed because i feel like im not allowed to be happy after giving others a lot of pain and I've done this to my past two gfs who i still care about a lot still and now i refuse to be in a relationship with another person because i dont trust them or myself
This is something i wanted to say for a long time if you want you can spam hate in the comments i deserve it
