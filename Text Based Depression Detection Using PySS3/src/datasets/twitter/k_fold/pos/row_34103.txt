I've been thinking about my dad a lot recently and I just need to vent So my dad is a nice guy on the surface I guess, he's a slightly overweight American guy. He had a very rough childhood because his dad left the family when my dad was only 8 years old, and he ended up never knowing his father all that well. On top of that, his dad died in 2012 without ever saying goodbye to him.

My dad is a pretty bad alcoholic, he drinks every day, he gets a bit grumpy when he's drinking and yells a lot. A lot of the time I mess with my younger brothers and we make a lot of noise, and out of the blue my dad can go from being in a good mood to SCREAMING at us. A few times I have been doing jumping jacks in the room above our sitting room when he's watching TV, so he hears banging on the ceiling and his first instinct is to start yelling at me to shut up before he even knows what the noise is!

The few times he has ever done stuff I can't forgive him for has only ever been to me, thankfully none of my family. One time when I was 8 or 9, I didn't want to go out with him when he was going shopping and I started arguing with him, and he PICKED ME UP AND SCREAMED IN MY FACE and told me to come with him because my mom was out. I have mild cerebral palsy so I've never been the strongest person in the world, but I am also pretty brave! I stood up to him and said "FUCK NO, STOP PUSHING ME AROUND!" and he apologised.

But on the other hand he's a super kind person and a good father a lot of the time, and way better than some other alcoholics I know. I have such a mixed relationship with him and it's really annoying. He's really improved in the last year or two so honestly I just can't decide how I feel about him.
