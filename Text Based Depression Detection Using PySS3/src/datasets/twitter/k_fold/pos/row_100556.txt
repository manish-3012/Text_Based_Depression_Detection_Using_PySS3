I'm gonna ruin your childhood if it hasn't already So if you already know good for you but if you don't stay.

So you know Disney is a breeding ground for awesome childhoods but they had some dark shit in there like how simba and nala are half sibling (blood related) and got married and had a kid.

But today im talking about finding nemo. In the beginning scene a "barracuda ate the eggs and coral (the wife)" but with some research i find out barracudas don't eat fish eggs but I did find out that female clownfish sometimes eat their eggs.

And since female clownfish are stronger than male clownfish so if a female clownfish wanted to her eggs the male cant do anything but watch. I still dont know what happened to coral but since shes gone marlin (I think that was his name) became a female due to the nature of the clown fish. And since he was traumatized by his wife eating their kids he made up a pretend barracuda. This is also the reason why he has trust issues

Well that was that bye im gonna sleep now
