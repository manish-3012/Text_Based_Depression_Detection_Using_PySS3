I can't take it anymore So, I'm an 8th grader, and my class hates me. Everyone. Literally everyone. When I enter my class, and say "good morning to everyone!" They just repeat "fuck off". I literally have no friends, no one wants to even talk with me. And it's not even my class, the other 8th grade classes hate me too. I can't take it anymore. Please guys, be serious, this is really a problem, and like I heard from nearly all my classmates that they hate me.
