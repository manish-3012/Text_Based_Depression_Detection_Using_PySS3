i am FURIOUS behold, a pile of shitty events happening at my school:

my classmate went to a fucking anime convention called "free hugs" a couple of days ago(I can't express the amount of rage I felt when I heard this), she doesn't want to get tested for covid and continues going to school.

not to mention she proudly told me that she hooked up with a 28 year old guy there (bruh that's literally *twice* her age...).

i'm the only one who knows this because she said she could trust me:/

also my other classmates keep making offensive jokes about black and gay people and I want this to end I'm so so tired lol haha
