So online classes are awkward They are at least for me, during math today it was just me, the teacher, and three other students and when the teacher asked a question nobody answered so I felt like I needed to fill the silence. Sometimes I wouldn't answer and nobody else would say anything and it would just be awkward silence. Even when the teacher was asking questions that could be answered with a yes or no, nobody would say anything, like dude, just say yes and we can move on. I'm glad we didn't have to turn on our cameras though.
