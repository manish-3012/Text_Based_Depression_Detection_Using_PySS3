I witnessed a wholesome moment between my mom and dad So I'm a Christian so are my dad and mom.
Now this new year they enrolled in a online Bible study group.
They have a WhatsApp group too.
Nowadays they act like high school couples
They gossip, they share homework
Idk why but I feel really good..
Every new year for the past 5 years my mom and dad have been fighting....
Feels good seeing them Happy...
