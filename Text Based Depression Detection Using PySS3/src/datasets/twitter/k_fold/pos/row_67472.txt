Anyone wanna talk I've just moved to a new college and I have a few friends from my own school there but I cant really talk to them cuz none of them are in my class, and I really just wanna make new friends but cuz of vivid I can't. I'm gonna post thing I like and if you like them too or also just wanna talk I seriously wont mind unless theirs like over 50 different people coz I only have so much time and people I ca keep track of.

Things I like:
â€¢ Memes (oviously)
â€¢ lord of the rings
â€¢ star wars
â€¢ marvel
â€¢ lego
â€¢ "old music" 60's to 80's
â€¢ The beatles ( I know that's music but it's a who thing on it's own
â€¢ Animations
â€¢ myths and legends (I'm starting my own book)
â€¢ guitar ( learning to play)

And that's about it, sorry if it sounds cliche or boring, I know I've had it that bad but I'm feeling lonely.
