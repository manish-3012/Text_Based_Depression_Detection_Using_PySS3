Just because a girl does not dress super girly does not mean sheâ€™s a lesbian Ok so Iâ€™m a girl and I donâ€™t really like wearing dresses or very explicitly girly clothes. At parties or fancy events youâ€™ll likely catch me wearing a dress shirt or a suit. 
Is this off putting to guys? I mean I donâ€™t like wearing dresses because they limit my range of motion, theyâ€™re hard to walk in, and I hate being told to sit a certain way. I also donâ€™t really like showing a lot of skin. 
I cannot tell you how many times Iâ€™ve been asked if Iâ€™m gay or lesbian just because I choose to wear clothing that doesnâ€™t conform to how womenâ€™s clothing should be. I have to clarify every time that I simply donâ€™t like wearing dresses. 

tldr: Fuck gendered clothing.
