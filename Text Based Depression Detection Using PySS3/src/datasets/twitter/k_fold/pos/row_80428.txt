I felt like a girl So something kinda funny, but also a bit creepy happened to be last evening. Long story short, my mom sold a cake for this girl's 18th birthday (let's call this girl Martha) and while handing it over joked how she should have sent me, since I'm also 18. Later one, while I was with my girlfriend, Martha sends me a message on insta.

At first the message was pretty normal. She told me to congratulate my mom on the amazing cake, nothing weird. Then she started joking how it's a shame I wasn't there to hant it over. That's when I became suspicious. Then I saw that Martha's friend posted a story that said "Martha is looking for a boyfriend hahahahaha"

At that point there was no doubt about it. My girlfriend wanted me to just tell her I'm taken, but that felt too direct and rude and also I was afraid I might be wrong and it's a coincidence. I ended up more or less just leaving her on seen.

Later one, I saw she sent me a video. I knew from her stories she was a drunk because she was celebrating her birthday. She sent me a video where one of the figurines that was one the cake is beheaded with text that said "this will be you if you leave me on seen hahahahaha." Of course I knew she was drunk so i didn't see it as a serious treath so I sent her a message saying "this is a threat and i doubt my girlfriend likes it..."

When I woke up today I saw she apologized and everything is okay, but I did realize that this is the type of stuff woman deal with all the time in all their conversations with guys. I myself have been that guy and I am deeply sorry for it. So guys and gals, be civil!
