thinking about making a commentary channel for hahas basically i might make a verified leafy clone channel on youtube for shits and giggles, and i like the subgenre of commentary all in all, with youtubers like Cr1tikal and diesel patches and i like shitting on things that are just fucking stupid and or really messed up, ala the cesspool that is twitter and commenting on thing the happen of recent like "oh look at what fuckery Youtube pulled on us this time" and no this does not mean Keemstar level horseshit, i don't think the skies are gonna split and God will show his face and say 'Keemstar is the way' and 2021 will be saved. Thats it. peace
