bullying stories Early on in preschool Iâ€™d get made fun of bc I was always quiet, tho that was the whole reason for me being quiet anyway. Kind of stuck with me thru elementary school and middle school, barely talked, had unbelievable social anxiety, no one knew my name and if they did I was honestly super surprised

just wanna hear different versions of stories like this, ik mine isnâ€™t as intense as the word makes it out to be, but sharing never hurt anyone
