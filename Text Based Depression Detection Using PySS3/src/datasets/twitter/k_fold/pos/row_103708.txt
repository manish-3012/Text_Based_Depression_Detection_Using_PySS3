We don't have to all be mean to each other. I hate scrolling threw Reddit knowing that there is going to be lots of liberal stuff and I'm conservative but I don't mind that I just read it and scroll down but sometimes I wonder if you guys even think with your head or did you like lose your brain. What do I mean by that, I mean that when you say that blacks are treated unfairly by the U.S. you right but your also wrong. I'm not going to talk about employment for blacks I'm going to talk about cops and blacks. Before you think I am anti-black  I just want to say that I actually really don't hate like anyone unless it is for a personal reason. I don't just see a person and be like man I really hate that person. No, I give everyone a chance cause that's what I would want them to do to me. Okay, now yes there are bad cops but, there are also good cops and by hating on the police you ended up hating a lot of people that are out there actually trying to help people and saving lives. How do you think a firefighter would feel if a few other firefighters didn't save someone when they ran into a building looking for people but just didn't save them because of there race and then everyone hates on firefighters. They aren't going to feel good and then they're not going to be proud of what they are doing. I don't suggest hating on anyone but instead, dislike them hating means you just want them dead gone for good but that is a human life and just wanting them dead isn't very nice. Sometimes it is hard not to hate, but defunding the police and getting rid of them lets gangs grow faster do more, and kill more but with the police that isn't going to happen as much. If you want the U.S. to end up with wars going on in every town it is going to be way worst then having some bad cops. It would be way better to put the bad cops away for what they have done and not let them back on to the police force. I know that no one on Reddit pry has the same point of view as me but for the past 4 to 5 months I thought about your point of view and seen what it is like on that side so I'm asking you to consider what I said and if you disagree explain why so I know what the other side thinks of this point of view.
