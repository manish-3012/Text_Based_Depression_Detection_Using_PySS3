Holy shit I just saw the lyrics to NEW MAGIC WAND by Tyler the creator Itâ€™s so goddamn dark. He is saying that he will kill the girlfriend of the man he wants to be with. 

â€œPick a side and if you donâ€™t I will pick you bothâ€ if his lover doesnâ€™t leave his girlfriend he will kill him. Itâ€™s basically â€œif I canâ€™t have him no one canâ€

Super fucking wholesome
