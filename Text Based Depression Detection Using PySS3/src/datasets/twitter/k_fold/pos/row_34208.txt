California wants to legalize government discrimination on race and sex for employment and education with prop 16. So I was given an assignment by my government teacher to go over propositions 15 and 16 and say whether the ads were truthful or not.  So I was reading through the two props, nothing unusual, and then I reach this line in prop 16.  "Permits Government decision-making policies to consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin..."  I'm sorry what?!  'Scuse me.  You want to make racism legal again do you.  So I continue reading and it tries to justify this by saying that this would make life fair by giving minorites an "equal footing," which is just the most backwards thing imaginable, but whatever.  I find it really disturbing that they're willing to throw away 6 decades efforts worth to end racism, but that's California for you.  Fighting racism by instilling more racism.
