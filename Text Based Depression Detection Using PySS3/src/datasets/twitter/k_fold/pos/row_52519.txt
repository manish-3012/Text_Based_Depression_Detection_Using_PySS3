We have a workplace training thing coming up and its making me nervous for no reason â€Workplace training thingâ€ might not be a very good description, but basically its this thing where you go apply to a place, and then you work there for a week instead of having school. Its meant to introduce you to what being at work is like.

I have some places im interested in, but it makes me really nervous for some reason. The places im thinking of applying to are: a kebab restaurant, the grocery store, and a hardware store.

It all feels really weird to me and like it shouldnâ€™t be happening and Idk why when its been a thing for years now
