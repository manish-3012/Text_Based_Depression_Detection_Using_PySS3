I feel like I've messed up but I'm not sure? Basically I really like this guy but I found out that he's done some bad things in the past. I know it's in the past but it was really bad and I relate to the ' victim' because I went through something similar at their age so I can't help but sympathise and get angry. I don't know if I'm over reacting tho because I just felt so disgusted and blocked him across all social medias. 
In all fairness he did try to justify what he did which only made me more angry. Please help, I have no idea whether I'm being too harsh and I can't help but feel bad about the whole situation..
