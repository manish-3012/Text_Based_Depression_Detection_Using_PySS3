Im freaking the fuck out idk why Im having a mini anxiety attack realizing that we can die any second and how crazy it is, what will I feel after I die?? Will I just dissapear? Im christian or atleast believe in god that way bht am just thinking wtf happens if there is no god?, will I just nothing. Thinking about these things are normal but ths thing that gave me the little attack was thinking about how tims flies, and I instantly thought of life passing by me in 1 second and I was at my deathbed. Ah who cares, Ill die anyways
