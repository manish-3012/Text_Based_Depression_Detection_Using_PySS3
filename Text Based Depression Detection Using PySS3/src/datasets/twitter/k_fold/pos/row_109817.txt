I feel like I'm being ungrateful at times Where live some of our neighbors and like half of the town (if you wanna call it a town) use some kind of haystack as the roof, and using horse as a way of getting around, and have to go and look for resources at the jungle and stuff like that, meanwhile I'm here playing games at my room and complaining about school suck and all while those people are working hard for their children to go to school, idk just a random thoughts on my mind
