Biggest save i ever made holy shit Texted my crush/bestfriend some photos of the conversation between me and my old crush where i had a fight with cus i really needed help.

I forgot that one picture contained the sentence of me saying â€œi dont like u anymore, i love[bestfriend]â€

Luckily it were 20 photos so the chance that she saw that line is very small, atleast she didnt say a word about it. So i asked her hows shes doing and if she still has some nice netflix series to recommend.

I see that she likes it that i care about her hobbys, shes a fan of marvel movies. I told her which i watched and asked her which she watched and and would recommend. She acted pretty happy and all.
