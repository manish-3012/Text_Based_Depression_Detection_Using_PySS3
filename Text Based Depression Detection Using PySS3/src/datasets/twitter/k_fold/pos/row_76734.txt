Do you speak english as second language? I do and my english is getting better than my mother language. I'm portuguese and has been years that I feel like I have a deeper connection with english than my mother language. This is probably because of my bigger contact with english.  I play games, watch shows and have online discussions in english. I even feel safer speaking in english than portuguese with my friends. I would love to know if you feel the same and if it is common in teenagers this days, because I'm positive that not eveyone here has english as their mother language(and sorry for any spelling mistakes)
