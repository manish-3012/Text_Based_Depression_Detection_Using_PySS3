My mom and stepdad are so weird in their political views They follow Qanon and are trump supporters (my stepdad less so), but they are in favor of taxing the rich and free Healthcare.

They are pretty homophobic (mostly my mom, Sdad doesn't care) but all of my mom's male friends are gay, and 2 of my stepdad's sisters are lesbians

My mom said black babies are not as cute as white babies (we're not even white, we're Honduran) to, giving him credit, my stepdad said is completely ridiculous, and they agree that institutionalized racism is real.
