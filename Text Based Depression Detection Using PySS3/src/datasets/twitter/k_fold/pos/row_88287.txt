If you tell other students that they like other people or anything this. pls stop. Like its really annoying when it happens to me because I am not interested with this kind of stuff and its just weird in general.

Your basically shipping your friends.

Also if you tell people that other people like you. STOP. If I actually cared about having a relationship I would have a anxiety attack if that person ever talked to me.
