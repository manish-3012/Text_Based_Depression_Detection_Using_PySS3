To all of you who are going through depression or suicidal thoughts You are loved, cared for, appreciated, and needed by at least someone in your life. Although those people might not appear to feel these things, and those people might not even be in your life yet, they are out there. I feel especially prompted to write this because last week, my second grade teacher died by suicide, which was shocking and heartbreaking for many people in my area. In the same week, a seventh grader at a school in the town next to mine also fell victim to suicide.

If you're going through any of these problems, experiencing them at all, please reach out to someone for help. There are so many people out there who have been through what you're going through, and people that can help you out a lot, and there is so much hope. Please, tell someone. You have a future, the things you're going through now will go away someday, and there is so much waiting for you in life. You matter, and you're existence will impact a lot of people, and you'll get the chance to do so much good for the world. I am here for you, people you know are here for you, and there is hope.
