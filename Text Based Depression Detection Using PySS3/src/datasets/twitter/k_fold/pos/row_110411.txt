Why does everyone in my generation complain so much? Like Jesus Christ I get it, things arenâ€™t completely perfect for you, in fact *gasp* they actually require a bit of challenge. Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s always been since humanity started. Complaining isnâ€™t doing you any good. So Instead of complaining about it perhaps you could, yâ€™know, actually do something about it. Maybe try to solve your problems or something. Your probably going to call me a boomer in a teens body arenâ€™t you? Well guess what, boomers arenâ€™t stupid, theyâ€™ve made it so far in this world so you can too. Sure maybe theyâ€™re not tech savvy but at least they know some basic life skills.
