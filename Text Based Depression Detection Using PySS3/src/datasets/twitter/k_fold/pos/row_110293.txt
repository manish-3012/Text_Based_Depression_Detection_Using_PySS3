aAaaAa heLp mE oUt So like, I have this sort of â€œstateâ€ in which  depending on what Iâ€™m doing, one or multiple of my senses become more advanced I guess. Like for example, if Iâ€™m doing hand stitching or embroidery my ears will drown out most noise ( I guess cause this sense isnâ€™t needed to do this) my touch will become highly sensitive to the point that at times I can feel singular threads of fibre and my sight makes it possible to see pretty small threads and exactly where the needle will poke out of. This also happens to me while Iâ€™m drawing (like motor skills during fine lining just suddenly become great) I can also observe the exact colour, shape and size an object is. So my question, is this normal? And even if itâ€™s not, itâ€™s not bad, right? Just as clarification, I have not had this ability since I was born, and feel free to ask any questions
