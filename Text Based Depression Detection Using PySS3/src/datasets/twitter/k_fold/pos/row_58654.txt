Does anyone have any exotic pets? Me personally I only have an iguana(if that counts as exotic) and I love this little guy, I know they get huge and canâ€™t wait until he gets big. My aunt had an iguana and his/her enclosure was like 15 feet across and like 8 feet tall and probably 4 feet deep. Never got to meet said iguana because I think it either died before I was born or she got rid of it before I was born I canâ€™t exactly remember. And I have never had a pet quite like a iguana and itâ€™s definitely a challenge for me. Iâ€™ve only ever had dogs and cats and a hamster one time. 



Also I know I post a lot but thatâ€™s just because I kinda feel safe here because I am surrounded by like minded people and people in my age group.
