When you reminisce someone you liked and talked to But now they donâ€™t talk to you and you imagine what things would be like if things were different :((






The guy I was talking to stopped when I wasnâ€™t optimistic about Covid getting better (this was in May) &amp; I knew Covid wasnâ€™t gonna be over soon (especially bc weâ€™re in America!)
