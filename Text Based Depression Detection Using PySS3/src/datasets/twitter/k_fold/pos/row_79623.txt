My sister just said she saw someone shoot themselves from a tiktok thread by accident. She said to imagine the demogorgon from stranger things. TikTok is fukd up, Who knows how many teens will have that image stuck in their head. "OMG don't ban me here it is"
"DO NOT WATCH DO NOT WATCH". Just another reason for it to be banned. IMO if tiktok isn't banned they should change their age limit to 16.
