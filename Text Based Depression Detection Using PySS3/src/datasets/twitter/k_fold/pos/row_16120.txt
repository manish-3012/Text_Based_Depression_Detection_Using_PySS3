Wanted to make a post explaining BLM and racism So I saw a couple of posts in hot and people arguing about All Lives Matter and BLM. I just wanted to make this to explain it quickly (Iâ€™m white but I support this).

All lives technically matter. But saying all lives matter is against the point. [This comic I found online ](https://imgur.com/gallery/lEABeYC) really helped explain it to me. Not that other lives arenâ€™t important, itâ€™s just that black lives need attention right now because theyâ€™re being treated unfairly by everyone.

I know the BLM movement has some bad parts, like the rioting and looting which is terrible ofc but it also has a lot of good. Peaceful protests for black rights. Thatâ€™s amazing. All races are trying to change the system for the better, and thatâ€™s really cool. But the reality is, black people are not treated equal right now. They should be. So the main focus right now is black lives mattering. Because white lives already matter, now we need to make black lives matter too. And every race. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
