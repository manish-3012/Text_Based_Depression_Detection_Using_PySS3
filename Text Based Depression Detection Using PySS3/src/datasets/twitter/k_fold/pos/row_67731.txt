You ever watch a show so good that you don't know what do do with your life after you finished it? So, a little bit of backstory. My dad was one of the many who pre-ordered cyberpunk 2077 (still loved it). However, he pre-ordered it from Amazon, and apparently the physical copy had some kind of deal with warner bros and came with a free month of hbo max. At first I didn't think much of it, until I saw that all of my childhood shows were on there. Chowder, amazing world of gumball, all the studio ghibli movies. I was excited. To make the most of my time, I started watching regular and adventure time at the same time because I didn't know how long we were gonna have it. But then I decided to add Steve universe to the mix because the same reason. And that show, just stuck with me. Man was it something different. I watched over the course of like a month and it was pretty much an masterpiece. Afterwards I watched the movie and it was only okay. But then I saw Steve universe future, and man was it also amazing. But yesterday I finished it, and now I don't know what to do with my life. Normally, I'd just rewatch or replay the thing in question. But for Steven universe the main message was about how moving on is important and now I don't feel like rewatching it. Anyone else just feel like this sometimes?
