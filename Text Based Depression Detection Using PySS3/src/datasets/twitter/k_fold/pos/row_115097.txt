I canâ€™t make my decision so time to ask you guys So I my high school we have a crap ton of clubs that we can sign up for and I promised myself that I would do volleyball once Iâ€™m not a freshman but there is a wrestling club at my high school and I really want to try it but my mom looked at me and laughed at me :â€™) so Iâ€™m conflicted at the two of them 


Long story short: I want to try wrestling but still want to do volleyball
