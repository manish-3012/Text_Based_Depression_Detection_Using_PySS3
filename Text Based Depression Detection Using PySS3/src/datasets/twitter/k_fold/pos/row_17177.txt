Why are there so many sexualities and genders? Like I under homosexual, I understand bisexual, I easily understand heterosexual, but then there is like pansexual and a-sexual and just too many in my eyes. So there is male and female, but then there is non-binary and the rest of the however other many there are, which I cannot wrap my head around why you couldnt settle with one the first two. I'm not trying to attack anyone, I want this to be a extremely neutral question so no ones feelings get hurt
