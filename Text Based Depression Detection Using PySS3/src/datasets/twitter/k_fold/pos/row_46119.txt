Voice Journal I got a lot of dreams, and one of them is being old enough to be a big part of my grandkidâ€™s lives. I realize that Iâ€™m not gonna live forever and I donâ€™t want them to be sad at my funeral. Thereâ€™s this one video where this man made a voice message at his funeral like he was actually alive and in the funeral, and I kinda wanted that. And my grandkids probably wouldnâ€™t know what I sounded like as I do now, so why not start a voice journal. Instead of a regular journal, why not embrace technology and have my voice in there instead. Itâ€™s gonna be really fun and can bring some smiles for when my family wants to hear my voice one more time even when Iâ€™m not with them anymore.
