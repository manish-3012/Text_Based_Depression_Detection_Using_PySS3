A fix for riots Ok. You can call me a pos if you want but I just really need to get this off of my chest. My fix for the riots is to have stricter welfare. Now donâ€™t get me wrong thereâ€™s still going to be welfare but itâ€™s going to be for HOMELESS people and DISABLED people or whoever CANT get a JOB. What Iâ€™m saying is these people out there rioting and looting could be fully capable of a job but instead theyâ€™re using welfare. If they had a job they would need to WORK to have essentials the same way we do. Again call me a pos but if the welfare is more strict, there wouldnâ€™t be time for riots because everyone looting would be working like everyone else.

If you would like this removed please DM me Iâ€™ll understand
