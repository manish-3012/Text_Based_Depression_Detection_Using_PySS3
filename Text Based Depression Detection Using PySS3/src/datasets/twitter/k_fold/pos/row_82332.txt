My pc stopped working and iâ€™m really stressed out. i spent the entire day yesterday researching how to fix it, Iâ€™ve literally tried every god damn method. i actually feel like fresh hot death. Most of my friends are online. I canâ€™t even play games with them cus my biggest source of happiness has decided to quit on me. 

I might just take it to Best Buy and see what they can do, but iâ€™m worried itâ€™s gonna be real expensive. I spent $500 on my graphics card so i hope i donâ€™t have to replace it entirely. It took me 5-6 months to finish my whole setup. This pc means a lot to me so if itâ€™s fucked, idk what to do.

anyway,thanks for coming to my TED talk.
