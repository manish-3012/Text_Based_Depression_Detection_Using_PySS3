Fellas is it racist to speak your own language I was on Twitter (the embodiment of hell on earth) and some â€œwokeâ€œ person got mad at my for speaking my own language. claiming itâ€™s â€œcultural appropriationâ€œ and got super fucking mad when I continued to speak my own language. Because I said â€œnegroâ€. A fucking word. I donâ€™t know why people have decided that negro is a slur without the opinion of Spanish and Portuguese speaking people who say it on a daily basis.

twitter= a gold mine for comedy.
