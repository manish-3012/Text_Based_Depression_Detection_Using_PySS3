My 17y/o sister blackmails me to get her way and also tries to get me in trouble This may be long. So yeah,as the title says. My sister blackmails me to get her way and tries to make me trouble. This started about 2 years ago when me, my sister, and 3 of her freinds. One freind suggest we should play truth or dare. So I plays along with the game. I picked dare, and one of the freinds says that she dares me to go make out with one of their other freinds in a vacant lot by a bush. Keep in mind I was a 13 y/o boy who's never kissed a girl before. Well me and the girl really didn't want to do that's so we both play a prank and she puts lipstick on my mouth so it looked like we made out. Well fast forward to when we leave and go home. Ya when we get home my sister says oOoOo YoUr DiSgUsTiNG fOR tHaT. So I go along with it and says yeah I did that. That's one of the things that she blackmails be with. Whenever my mom asks my sister to do a chore or something, she doesn't wanna do it. She will tell me to go and do it. And if I say no she screams TALYOR MITCHELL (that's the girls name that I "made out with". So yeah that's blackmailing me. Then I have to go do that task or chore bcause I don't wanna get in trouble with my parents. (Don't worry their no abusive) There's another thing she blackmails me with. So about two days ago my bitchass sister went snooping thru my phone. She went through my snapchat and found where i had a gf for 6 weeks. Keep in mind that im not allowed a girlfreind (i know its sorta crazy) well obviously im scared that shees gonna snitch on me like a little 5y/o bitch. So i have to go do that task/chore. So yeah thats the story. Well i gues i just felt a little left out at school bcause everyone else had a gf. So why couldn't I have one? Sorry if you had a fucking stroke from reading this. I cant word things right.  Today I almost had a panick attack bcause I was scared she would tell on me
