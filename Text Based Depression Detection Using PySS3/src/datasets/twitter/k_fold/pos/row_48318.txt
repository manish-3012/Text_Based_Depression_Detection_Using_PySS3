I just accomplished a life goal! I got into my dream college! I had worked my ass off for it for three-and-a-half years!

I am a girl in STEM now and this is just the beginning of all the things I have planned to pursue.

This was a big slap in the face to all my horrible, horrible school bullies who hated me, and only me, with a burning passion. They did everything they could to lower my self-esteem since the last five years but I fought back and left them in the dust today.

I've never been more proud of myself and I shared my achievements with my friends and family for a little bit of appreciation. However, a lot of them became extremely jealous and didn't even congratulate me. The only people who are genuinely happy for my success are my parents.

I thought I'd share this here. I'm kind of a lurker, but this achievement means a lot to me, so I thought of sharing it with you guys, since y'all are genuinely nice people.

One life goal down, hundreds more to go! I am not going to be a nobody in this world, mark my words.
