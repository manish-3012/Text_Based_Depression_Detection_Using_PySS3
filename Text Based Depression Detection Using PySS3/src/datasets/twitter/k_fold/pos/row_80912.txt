Anybody got any idea what i should do? Kinda in a tight spot. My brother suddenly gave me a packet saying "give this to (one of my very close friend's name)" Now thats strange, because neither she knows him nor he should know about her. Maybe he checked my messenger i dont really know.

Now here is the funny part, **we. are. not. a. couple.** Only thing i can do is give it to her, which is awkward, which she also feels kinda awkward to take. So do i give it to her?
