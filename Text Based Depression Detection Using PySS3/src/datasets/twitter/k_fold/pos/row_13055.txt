I like your cut G  

**young supposedly African American male is playing a digital video game on a cellular device** **old supposedly African American male walks up to him while recording on a cellular device**  Supposedly older African American male : Oh, I see and understand that  you (younger African American male), are partaking in the enjoyment of  playing the digital video game made by mojang studios widely known as  Minecraft. I particularly enjoy your new haircut, g. I will now proceed  to slap you in the back of your cranium with the palm of my hand. **older supposedly African American male proceeds with the action he said he would do** **younger supposedly  African American male proceeds to shriek at a very high pitch with his vocal cords** **the video recording then ends, with the younger supposedly African American male screeching**

This  is humorous due to the fact that the slap in the back of the cranium is  very unexpected, and also the unorthodox conversation as â€œoh you playin  Minecraftâ€, and, â€œI like ya cut gâ€. Overall, this is a 7/10 on the  humorous scale.
