Am i short? I'm 15 turning 16 very soon, but I'm only 5'4, I feel highly insecure bout it since most kids who are 12 are already at my height or past it, all my family averages 5'8, I'm the only one that's stuck, and what makes me more insecure is that I'm in high school which all the students are 5'7 + and were only in 9th grade, growing up I didn't get a lot of food since my parents didn't make much back then and what they did make was spent on rent, bills etc. Is it because i didnt get enough food back then that im stuck as i am?  And would there be any way to get taller naturally and gain weight ?
