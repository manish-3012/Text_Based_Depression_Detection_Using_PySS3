My bored ass just though of a std version for the first part of eye of the tiger Rising up, not on my feet

Spent my time making bad choices

Too bad I couldn't handle the heat

While my tiger is fighting for my life 

You see



My eye of the tiger couldn't handle the fight

He left and went Back to church

Eye of the tiger couldn't last the night


And he left home and went to sleep

*The eye of the tiger*







Yes I'm very bored
