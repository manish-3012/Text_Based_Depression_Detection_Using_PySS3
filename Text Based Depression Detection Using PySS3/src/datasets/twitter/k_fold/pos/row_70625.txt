Please tell me Iâ€™m not the only one with this fear Iâ€™m terrified of going over to a friend/ girlfriends house and saying â€œnice to meet you mr/ ms _____â€ and itâ€™s actually their grandparents. Like now you insulted her parents saying they look old and you just embarrassed yourself. Iâ€™m terrified of this happening ahhhh.
