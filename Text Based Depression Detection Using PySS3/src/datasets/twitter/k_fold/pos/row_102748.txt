If any of you would like points on how to approach a girl, i'd be happy to make a post about it. I'm 19M and, from the kind of stories i read on this sub,it seems most of you dont know how to approach girls. I wasnt excellent with approaching girls when i was younger either but these last two years have helped me learn how to better approach women/girls. and,i would like to help some of you with this,if indeed, you feel like you need some help.
