3am- Psats In three hours and no sleep. Iâ€™ve been working non stop for the past weekend and am exhausted. I had three tests and an 4 page essay due yesterday on top of my constant studying. I really havenâ€™t had a good sleep in awhile and am legitimately sure Iâ€™m gonna fail this morning (ahhh I almost said tomorrow, itâ€™s creeping up on me). Plus letâ€™s not mention Iâ€™ve been either camping with scouts (dealing with vv young scouts) or working my ass off every weekend for the past two months. I will say I am extremely lucky to have my bf but weâ€™re long distance and havenâ€™t been able to talk much bc heâ€™s moving cross the east coast and itâ€™s very stressful for him too. Idk Iâ€™ve just had too much on my plate, Iâ€™ll be able to sleep in Sunday but then have a shit ton of work to catch up on. Thought itâ€™d be nice to share since I bet some of yâ€™all are feeling the same way.
