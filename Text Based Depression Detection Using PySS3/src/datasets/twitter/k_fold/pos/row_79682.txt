I'm seriously worried about the usa No matter who wins the election, it is going to be a total shit show.

If trump wins, everything is going to collapse, ad Corona will only get worse.

If Biden wins, the Republicans are going to loose it.

Gun sales have reached a new record high.

Also antifa and blm are still a thing.

Luckily, I don't live in the US.
