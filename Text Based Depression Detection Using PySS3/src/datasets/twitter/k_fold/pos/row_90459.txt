I hate my step mom My dad is engaged to her. Everyone in the family knows sheâ€™s using him. She doesnâ€™t have a job and has a drinking problem all while my dad wakes up at 2 AM to begin working only for her to complain about how â€œstressfulâ€ her day was. And then he cleans the house. 

Yesterday I got a message from her that I was â€œspeedingâ€ when I was going 78 in the passing lane. She told my dad and now my dad and I are not in good terms. 

I know theyâ€™ve been fighting but why TF do you have to take it out on me? She never gave me shit in 2-3 years and now sheâ€™s being a total bitch. Regardless Iâ€™m in NYC now and blocked both of them.
