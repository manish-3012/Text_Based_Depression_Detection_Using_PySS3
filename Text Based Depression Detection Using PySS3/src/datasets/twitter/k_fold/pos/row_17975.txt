The current situation in Belarus Iâ€™m an American thatâ€™s been following the recent developments in Belarus, I think more people should be informed about the ongoing situation there. 

Belarus is currently led by dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, and the most recent â€œelectionsâ€ were held on August 9, where Lukashenko â€œwonâ€ &gt;80% of the vote. People are angry because their freedoms have been superseded by the regime, and also because of the fact that the Belarusian government has consistently rigged elections in Lukashenkoâ€™s favor. 

The government has come down hard on the protesters, with riot police leading a brutal crackdown of dissidents in Minsk with sheer force, and even firing live rounds of ammunition at the protesters. The Lukashenko regime is committing numerous human rights violations against their own people so he can continue to stay in power. 

By making this post, I hope that I can spread the word about the ongoing protests in Belarus and shed some light on the situation. And to the people of Belarus, I hope that yâ€™all can topple the dictatorship and hold free and fair elections.
