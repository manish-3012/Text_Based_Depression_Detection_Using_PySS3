Iâ€™m straight, but... Iâ€™m a straight guy but I prefer the company of my female friends more than my guy friends. I have a girlfriend who Iâ€™m very happy with, so Iâ€™m not looking for someone to get with. Just curious how many other people are like this too.

I bring up the fact that Iâ€™m straight because most of the time when people see a guy hanging out with a female friend group, they think heâ€™s gay or bi.
