I fucked it up with my crush I joined high school a while ago and I've had a crush on this girl but she's bi and has a girlfriend, I was getting along fine with her but one day I was dumb as fuck and one of my friends wanted to record me asking her out and I did and things became kinda akward, im drawing a super detailed sketch of her cause I'm decent at drawing and I plan to give it to her and I was begining to finally talk to her again , I was having a convo with her on snapchat and I didn't know it showed that I took a screenshot and she asked why and I just responded with "If was a accident lmao" and then she said "sure." So obviously she knows I like her and I'm not sure if my chances are fucked or not, Advice?
