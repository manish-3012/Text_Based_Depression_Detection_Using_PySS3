Staying awake Many seem to say before their slumber they envision a happier future for themselves. I often think different. Well, a happier future definitely, but the intricate details change from the popular dreams.

I often imagine not a spouse or significant other. In fact no people seem to be near. A many distorted futures can cross the mind. In these futures I do have a spouse and sometimes children. But children are messy and annoying. So are people in general. In makes no sense.

Sorry I started rambling. Iâ€™m very tired I canâ€™t really think straight.
