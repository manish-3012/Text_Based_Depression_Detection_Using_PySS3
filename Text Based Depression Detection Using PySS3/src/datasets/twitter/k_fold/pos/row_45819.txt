Why do people think we have never heard of things that existed before we were born. It's so fkn annoying, it's like they think we have never heard of a phone with a cord. I feel like this happens all the time, my teacher actually just thought we didn't know what a phone both was and it ticks me off for some reason. It doesn't even realy matter it just seems like they're talking down to you, as though there so much better because we're to young to know what a fkn telephone with a cord is. Sorry for wasting yr time. It kinda sounds whiney, Probably because it is.
