Ok so please listen All right so thereâ€™s this kid at my school he canâ€™t really speak but if he were to say something you couldnâ€™t really understand him I donâ€™t know why? But anyways I found out that his mom had died in a car crash a couple years back from a car crash I wonâ€™t say how the crash happened but she died on scene, what was weird is that I watched a tik tok of someone saying that their phone was destroyed but that phone had photos of his mom. Whatâ€™s funny is that it nearly happens to him but one of the seniors came up to the dick head trying to destroy it and put him into his place I know you might not care but it reminds me of him and I hope heâ€™s doing ok
