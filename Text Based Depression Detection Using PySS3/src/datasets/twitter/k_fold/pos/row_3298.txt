After many failed attempts I have finally fabricated the perfect suicide solution I've failed 2 times in the last week. This time I surely cant fail. I have fabricated a bracket that goes from ceiling joist to joinst. It will hold me and not rip out the drywall. I bought heavy duty rope. I will never be nothing so I give up.
