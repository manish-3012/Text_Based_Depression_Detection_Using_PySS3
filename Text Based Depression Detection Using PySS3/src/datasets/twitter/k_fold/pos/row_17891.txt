I gotta say somthing I wanna say that this server is kinda shitty. Tbh, I feel everyone here is just some giant stuck up so that he/she could get reddit gold. Every time I go here it feels like everyone has to reduce their personality into some cookie cutter nice guy so that they can have 15 minutes of fame. It kinda just shows me that teens now are slowly becoming sociopaths. And I just hope that their is one person on this subreddit that isnt a stuck up.
