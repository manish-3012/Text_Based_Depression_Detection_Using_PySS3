any advice on studying/producivity :( i am sitting at a hotel lobby, alone.  i have an essay due in a few hours that i haven't started. i feel like shit. i know - just get ur shit together and get the work done. trust me, i've been trying. i really wanna do well. but my brain just isn't working and i feel like such a failure to myself, family, and everyone who cares abt me. i should be better than this but i keep falling behind and this isn't like me at all and i know my friends tell me that i should be worried my ass off and i am but also.... i don't wanna do this. fuck school, and fuck everyone who has the privilege of  having a solid work ethic and not having mental illness who belittles me and acts like my inability to focus or get shit done is something wrong with me.

i'm so. i wanna cry in someone's arms forever.
