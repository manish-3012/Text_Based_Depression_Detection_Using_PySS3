I talked to a guy who bullied me for 3 years and I think he's changed I unblocked him (because apparently bullying at school wasn't enough for him I guess)

My dad told me that I need to talk to him because his father caught COVID (His dad is my father's friend and he needed to get info about how his friend is doing) 

I denied. I just didn't want to talk to him. He is one of the most toxic people I ever saw. My dad wasn't satisfied and he made me call him any way. 

His voice was different (too quiet). I felt that he changed. He didn't call me with any of the stupid nicknames that he gave me, he didn't even sound the same.

I now feel bad that I didn't want to call him.

He could've also caught the virus and I feel like shit now because I got blinded by our past. 

I really don't know what happened to me. I was so selfish and I am sooo stupid for thinking that he couldn't change
