Would love some new best friends Accidently write live instead XD

Hey I'm 17m. Recently I lost a couple of my best friends because I messed up and I want to turn a new leaf and make sure I don't mess up again. I need some new best friends. Here are some things about me

I love to play video games specifically valorant among us apex legends and Minecraft java edition

I am a programmer and am working on my first ever game at the moment.

I live in California and it would be cool if I could get some people from there as well

If anybody is interested please PM me. Oh and also I would love people that are in the same age range as me and also in the same timezone which is PST. Thanks :)
