Legally a child dosn't believe in... The Setting: About 14-17 months ago at school.

I went to go grab something from my locker in the middle of class and I over hear someone muttering to themselves.

"I can't believe [my science teacher] believes in  evolution!" He muttered.

"Do you even believe in the Water Cycle?" I replied.

He gave the most bewildered look, said "No", closed the locker, and walked off. 

Well that's the gist anyway.

I never saw him again as far as I'm aware.
