Idk how you guys handle how much work you get when i just get 1 task per class and i still dont do it Man, i wish i was born a couple years later just so i can experience that amount of work.

Im fricking lazy when it come to work and learning, physical thing like going on a walk, doing dishes and other basic stuff i have a better time doing but work.

Yesterday i was going to do 1 piece of work and i didnt do it, like come on, it would just take 1 hour, you shouldn't just put it off FOR A WEEK.


This is why ill be a failure because you need to do stuff to not be lazy but you're lazy so you dont want to do stuff and ill have to keep on doing stuff just so i dont fear becoming lazy again and all that.

I wish i was just a normal kid but nah why dont i just have so many flaw that i want to fix and then have a big ambition that i want to do before im 30 so yeah let just make it where ill hate myself forever and possibly not want to live anymore for the sake that life is too damn hard and that I'd rather take the easy way out because im lazy.

Imagine wanting to die just so you dont have to do work haha my whole life is a joke.
