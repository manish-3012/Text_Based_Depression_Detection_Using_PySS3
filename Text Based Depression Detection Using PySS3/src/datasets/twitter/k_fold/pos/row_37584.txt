My girlfriend broke up with me in a pretty rough way and idk what to do So this Monday my girlfriend texts me at like 9pm and says she cheated on me, and I really love this girl alot so I forgive her, and she just acts like nothing happened which I didn't mind it did sting kind of though, and then the next day at 10pm she texts me and says we should break up and that we could still be friends, and then she tells me who she cheated on me with and it was my friend who I had been talking to about the whole thing and he had just been acting normal. It's just if she was gonna break up with me anyway why would she tell me she cheated on me?
