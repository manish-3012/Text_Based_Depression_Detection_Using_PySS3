Need advice Today I found out my friend has abusive parents. They threatened to kick him out of his house because he is failing one of his classes. He told me he gets hit every now and then, but gets yelled at and called names frequently. His parents took his TV, and sold his Xbox, which is how we mostly communicate. Hes thinking of running away and staying with his friend. I know there's not much *I* can do, but what should I tell him and what advice could I give him?
