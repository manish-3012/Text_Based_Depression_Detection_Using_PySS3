I need some help So me and this girl just got off a 3 hour call, during it we confessed they we both had a crush on each other in 7-8th grade and we didn't know(we are both freshmen now), later when we where talking she started blushing and then admitted that she still kinda did and i said I felt the same but, I don't think we should get into anything because of the pandemic and I want to talk to her some more in person. Me and another friend where texting and he said that I did the right thing, but I just want to get some more conformation, I have now clue when this will all be over and that is why I am asking. Thank you in advance for any advice you could give.
