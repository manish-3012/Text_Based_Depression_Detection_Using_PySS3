I'm trying to help my friend realize something So my friend is 13, and he is dating an 18 year old girl, I've been trying to tell him that I disagree with the relationship and that I think she might be a pedo. I made this post to see what you guys think and I can show him what people other than me think.

 is the relationship bad? And do you think the 18 yr old is a pedo?
