I hate the way my voice sounds Like, I can understand people not liking their voice in recordings, and how it sounds better when they say it in person, but for me i don't like my voice even when I'm the one saying it. Like, sometimes I think I"m just so annoying because of the way my voice sounds, I sound like an 8 year old in the eight grade :/

I turned 13 in may of 2020, how come my voice hasn't changed yet? Is it normal for voices not to change? All of my friends voice changed to really deep and mine hasn't changed one bit
