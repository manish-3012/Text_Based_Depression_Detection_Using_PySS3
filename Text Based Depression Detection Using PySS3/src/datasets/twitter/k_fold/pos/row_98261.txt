The only reasons Iâ€™d break up with a girl are these 
Bland and boring. No matter how many times Iâ€™d try to have a conversation. Granted, this happens in the first few weeks of dating, but Iâ€™m talking about a month or two in.

Insecure. Nobody likes people who are insecure and make life hell for their partner

Clingy. Clingy people make you spend most of your time on them instead of yourself or with others this also goes in part with...

Jealousy. I donâ€™t want to get angry messages after I spent time with one other girl or talked with one

Severely depressed. This just makes hell for the partner because it all takes a toll after a while
