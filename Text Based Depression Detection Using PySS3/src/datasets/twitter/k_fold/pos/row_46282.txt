Time going faster? Times been going faster since I first started high school (high school In my country starts in year 7)  It feels like I went to sleep, woke up and now Iâ€™m suddenly year 11, nearly 17 and already knowing what Iâ€™m doing with my life. Itâ€™s stupid and I hate it. I am NOT prepared for the real world.
And if Iâ€™m being honest, itâ€™s scary knowing that youâ€™re getting older and thereâ€™s nothing you can do about it.
And yes, I know Iâ€™m young and still have my whole life ahead of me.
