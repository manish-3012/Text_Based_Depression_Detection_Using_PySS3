I am presenting a show After a really unlucky course of events and some bold decisions I made in the prospect of getting over my extreme shyness, I ended up presenting a part of a show we do at school this afternoon (obligatory, we are a boarding school isolated for 3 months now, covid is not really an issue here but we still do masks and social distancing). The thing is, it starts in 3 hours. I've got to entertain people. Spontaneously. I am like the dullest person ever, and the shyness person ever. How the hell am I supposed to get up there and speak to more than 200 people without getting blocked and having the whole venue laugh at me? Helppp
