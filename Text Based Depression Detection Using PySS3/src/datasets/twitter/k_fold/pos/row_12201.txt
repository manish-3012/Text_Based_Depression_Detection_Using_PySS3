my friend didnâ€™t have enough karma so he wanted me to post this here, here is what he askeded how do i start looking more beautiful?

hi, iâ€™m 14m and i just started to care about my face and body, i just started puberty and my voice has gotten deep but i wanted to find a perfect hairstyle and stuff... i donâ€™t wanna use makeup, i have a oval shape face and i donâ€™t have slim cheeks, short hair fits me well, also iâ€™m starting to grow some facial hair, i donâ€™t want a beard yet so i try to keep it small but my mustaches have grown and they look kinda ugly with my white skin(my hair is black but somehow iâ€™m not brown as all of my family so they look strange at first glance, iâ€™m not looking for something that will make me some celeb, i just wanna look decent, oh also i have big eyebrows, their not unibrows but iâ€™m conflicted if i should cut them
