anyone else feel like this? so basically if i want to rn, i can be in a relationship itâ€™s not hard for me and like a part of me wants to be in a relationship but the pressure of having to keep up with another person and constantly keep contact with them just stresses me out. idk maybe iâ€™m just selfish but itâ€™s hard to keep tabs on anyone consistently when i can barely look after myself? or maybe iâ€™m just dumb idk :/
