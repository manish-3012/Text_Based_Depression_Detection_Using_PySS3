So she said yes and I need help So last Sunday, I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j97e5u/this_is_a_followup_post/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) that I asked my crush out, and she said she would think about it. Today at lunch she snapped me saying she had half an hour before her driving lessons, and asked me if I wanted to spend that time with her, of course I said yes. Now we meeting again for my bday on Wednesday for a date. I need some tips on how I can avoid talking about myself. I'm naturally egocentric, today when we were talking, I couldn't help myself from just adding my story to everything. She laughed at those but I don't wanna seem egocentric. What can I do, to prevent myself from doing that, and any other tips for a coffee date would be great.
