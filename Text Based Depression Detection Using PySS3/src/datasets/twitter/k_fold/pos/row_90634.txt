A warning if you ever get a staph infection on your skin Do not *under any circumstance* put aqaphor on the infected area along with the ointment.

â€œYour face might be dried out causing it to itch moreâ€ they said.

â€œMix it with some aqaphorâ€ they said.

Today I learned that this causes it to feel like your skin is being burned. The feeling does not go away after watching your face.

Please take the advice of the one in pain.
