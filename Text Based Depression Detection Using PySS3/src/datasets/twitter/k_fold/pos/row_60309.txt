Come on guys, have some respect for the Duke of Edinburgh. As funny as you may think it is to joke about him being dead already, being used as a puppet etc., there are people out there who are genuinely upset and hurt over this. Not only was he an extremely influential man, but he was kind-hearted and caring for his people, not to mention he served his country well. Have some respect.
