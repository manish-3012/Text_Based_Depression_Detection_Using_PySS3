i wish my friend good luck, my friend says no So my friend has exams right now, and I wished them good luck and I told them they could do it. They just replied with "no", which kinda just idk, made me feel bad or something. I mean, they could've just say thanks right? am I an asshole for feeling like it was kinda disrespectful?
