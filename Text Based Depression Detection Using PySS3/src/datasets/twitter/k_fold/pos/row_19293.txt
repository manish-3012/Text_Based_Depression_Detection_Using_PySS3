will probably delete this but how the hell do you get over someone? ive had this crush on this guy for forever and some months back i finally took the steps to cut him out of my life and all online contact and nothing has changed. is there anything i can do that this point? would telling him how i feel help me get over it? im stuck on the version of him i liked a couple years back and hes a completely different person last time i knew him and it does hurt. we never dated and i told him i liked him almost two years ago at this point and he didnt feel the same but im still stuck on the idea that it definitely felt like he may have liked me back just a few months prior but things were rough then. i dont even care if he were to like me back, i just want to get over him. it genuinely just hurts at this point and i want to find someone new but its not even about finding someone new at this point, its just about trying to replace the thought of him and it just hurts. is there literally anything i can do? he wont leave my head and its just eating me alive. i literally havent contacted him since the beginning ofseptember. i deleted instagram so i couldnt see his posts or anything anymore. nothing has worked. im sick
