So I am doing Basketball this year. One note I go to a sister school of where I play  basketball so I donâ€™t get all the info. So yeah title were socially distancing and wearing masks and all that jazz. So practice is usually 3:20-5:30 but today there was a half-day I didnâ€™t know about, me and another kid from the sister school show up and no one is there. So RIP.
