I wore socks on my hands My hands are hella cold and I wore socks on my hands. It's only my hands that are cold but it is now fixed. I'm studying phisics with socks on my hands. If you ask; is it not hard to use keyboard and mouse with your hands being in a pair of socks, I'd say trial and error and you''ll get the hang of it. Sock days for y'all, I'll keep on studying.
