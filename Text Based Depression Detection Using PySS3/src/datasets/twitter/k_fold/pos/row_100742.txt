I need feedback on my plan with my crush. I am going to an escape room in a week with a group of four friends (me included), and my crush is among them as well. I need opinions on how I plan to confess. I'm going to go through the escape room, and have fun with her and my other friends. At the end of the night when everyone is getting ready to leave, I plan to give her an origami crane. In one wing pocket is a small origami heart and in the other is a small folded rectangle with my phone number and a "text me?" message written inside. I originally planned on giving it to her, thanking her for coming, and leaving hoping she will find the number and hopefully the heart and the fact I took time to make it conveys that I am into her. Being the overthinker I am, I am having doubts. I do not know If I should give her the crane and then do a small admittance; something like "Hey \[Name\] I had a fun time. I made this for you and I wanted to just get it out there that I have a crush on you. Would you like to go see a movie or have lunch or something?". I would like opinions, as I do not want to be too forward, creepy, or weird and I don't want it to come off like I am pressuring her into it. I really like her; we talk through discord regularly, she is pretty, funny, smart, she is caring and sometimes sarcastic. Even if things don't work out romantically I still want to hang around with her as a friend. Thanks for anyone who read this paragraph about a stranger (me)'s life. I am excited to get others input as well.  


EXTRA INFO:

I am a sophomore and she is a junior. I've ventured into flirting with her over discord and she seems to take it positively; even returning it at some points. I do not know if she is just being polite, but I'd reply to any comments with some of our "flirts" if wanted. I will be sure to answer questions if I missed some critical stuff.
