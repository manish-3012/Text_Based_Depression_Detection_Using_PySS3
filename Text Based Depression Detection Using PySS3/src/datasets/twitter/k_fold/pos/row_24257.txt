My gf gets jealous of the bodies of celebrity women I mean my gf is lovely and has above normal features but

She discussed this with me that she felt jealous of their bodies and I told her she's perfect and all but

Is there some other way I can tell her she's amazing and doesn't need to be like them?

Cuz I don't really care about the body or something but being jealous of that isn't really a thing I think is positive for her mind as she overthinks a lot
