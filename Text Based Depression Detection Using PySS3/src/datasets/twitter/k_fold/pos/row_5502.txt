Is saying I expect minimum wage a good idea? Ok, I am going job hunting and am filling out applications. For some background knowledge, where I live minimum wage is 7.25. McDonald's I have been told pays 8 dollars. My parents told me when filling out applications to say when it asks for expected wage to 7.25 because I have no work experience. But I also am thinking if I can get paid more at a McDonald's than working somewhere at 7.25 is not worth it. When looking on the website I am using to find jobs it says similar jobs pay 7.80 to 8 dollars, I don't know if saying 7.25 is a good idea. Any input is appreciated.
