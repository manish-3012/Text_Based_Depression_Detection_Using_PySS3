Should I go buzzcut? I already went with it during the quarantine and I gotta say that not caring for your hair is amazing but now as quarantine is over and my college is starting soon I was thinking of doing it once again.

My hair is wavy curly messy. Itâ€™s wavy when I brush it and curly messy when I wash it and leave it but my hair isnâ€™t the best not gonna lie. Got a beard and an oval face shape.

Now I personally like the buzzcut but I also like my current hair and everyone I asked around me is 50/50 with some saying it didnâ€™t really look good and some saying it looked better so I came here without you seeing my face or hair. Do you think a buzzcut looks good on an 18 year old? (Yes Iâ€™m keeping the beard)
