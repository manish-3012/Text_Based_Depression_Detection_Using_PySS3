Feeling like my old self in a weird way Does anyone else feel like they have no trouble remembering what happened in 2020? I don't know if this is the right sub to say it but 2020 was one of the most if not the most impactful years out of my 15 so far. I almost turn 16, but I cant help but feeling like I am still my old self, and it is hard to come to peace with what I am now, and the stuff that I have gone through. Mainly a lot of relationship troubles.  I guess I wanted to write this somewhere. Eager to hear if anyone else has anything to say?
