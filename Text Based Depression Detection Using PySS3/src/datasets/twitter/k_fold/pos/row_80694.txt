My advice to you all Life is like a roller coaster. It goes up, and down and around. I know sometimes the down are really bad, but remember, there is always a rainbow after a horrible rainstorm. Just remember that even if you can't see it, there is always a good in everything, even if it seems it's not there. That being said, I strongly, STRONGLY insist you keep going, even if it seems the drop is bad, because when you decide to stop caring about things, and avoid responsibility, that is when your life falls apart. That is when everything goes downhill. Even if you think it's going up, it's an illusion, it's still going down. At that point you become senseless. You stop feeling emotions like sadness, or even happiness. You subconsciously start forcing yourself to feel those emotions of happiness, because if you don't try, you won't react to anything. And that is when you are unsure if you are still going down, or if it's going up. 

TL,DR: Even when things are horrible, keep pushing on, because when you stop trying, things fall apart.
