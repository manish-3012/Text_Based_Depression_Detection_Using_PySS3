I have an awesome thing to say! So yesterday i have received an awesome pc! It is a gtx 1660 ti and it can run Fortnut for 69 FPS! which is nice!. Am i right guys? It's so dope seeing my frame counter displaying 69 faps per second! it's so unbelievably smooth! It's like an equal to jacking myself with a right hand!
