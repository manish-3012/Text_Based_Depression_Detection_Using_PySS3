The meaning of WAP in my country. kinda fucking hilarious tbh So basically we went on our second 2 week lockdown countrywide after like 6 months. To go to work for essential workers they need a work access permit to be able to get pass the police. it is kinda wholesome to know that nobody in the government knows what WAP means. You will basically hear people saying \~ you got your WAP. and even a main chief police officer said on the radio \~ "Although you have your WAPs you will not be able to... ". I always lmao at those and i guess i will not tell anybody. i dont know when they will notice that but it is fucking funny.
