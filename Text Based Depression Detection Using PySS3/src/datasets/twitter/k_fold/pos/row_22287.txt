Morals or Marks So I have received this test and I got marginal marks. (Like getting a 50 out of 100). I found out that the teacher had marked two questions wrongly, and if I point them out, I would fail and have to give it to my parents to sign. But if I don't, I could still pass the test, and could hide for a little while before my parents discover it.

My dad had said when I was studying for that test that I would not do good, and as a competitive person, I said. "Just wait and see." Now I screwed up my test, and what am I going to do?

PPS: This subject costs a lot of points for my report card, which is especially important this year because I have to choose electives, and everyone is crazy with their studies.
