Iâ€™m in my depressed mood again :/ I donâ€™t have depression. Itâ€™s just that I always feel depressed from time to time. I just feel sad but and at the same time emotionless. I am a happy person though. He

Every time hearing lovely-by Billie Eilish and Khalid makes me feel depressed. And like I said, I donâ€™t have depression. Iâ€™m just feeling sad. 

Let me just say this message for the people who couldnâ€™t here me.

FEELING DEPRESSED â‰  HAVING DEPRESSION. 

Have a good day :|
