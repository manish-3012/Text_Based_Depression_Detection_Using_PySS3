If you ever want to confuse a â€œwokeâ€ blm activist just sayâ€I wish slavery never happened so black people would never be in America.â€ Then theyâ€™ll say some shit like â€œwhat no thatâ€™s so fucking horrible they should be hereâ€

Once they say that you have officially tricked them into defending slavery.
