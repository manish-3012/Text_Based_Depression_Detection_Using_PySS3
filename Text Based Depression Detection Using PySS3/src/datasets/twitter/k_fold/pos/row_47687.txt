How on earth do I date in distance learning? I'm in distance learning, and I really wanna date someone. But I can't tell what someone looks like. I don't really have access to their socials. I can't contact them. Idk how not to be weird. I don't want someone to be ugly. How tf am I supposed to date during distance learning?! 


(P.s. I'm a straight male, and I don't have a specific person in mind)
