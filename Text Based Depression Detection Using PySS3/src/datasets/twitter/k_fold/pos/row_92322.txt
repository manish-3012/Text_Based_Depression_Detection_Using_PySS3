Everyone freaks out when the Simpsons predict the future, but why isnâ€™t anyone looking at what else they could be predicting? To rephrase myself...

I havenâ€™t seen that many people look at early simpsons episodes and see them predict the future. They only go crazy when they see them do it. So why arenâ€™t we watching more simpsons episodes? What can we predict?
