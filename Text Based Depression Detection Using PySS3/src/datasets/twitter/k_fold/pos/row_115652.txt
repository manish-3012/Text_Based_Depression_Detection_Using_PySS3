Im bored Anybody else bored? Is that even how you spell bored? is it just bord? Who knows. Anyways, Happy halloween. So my counselor says I'm "lonely" which is bullshit. Then she suggested I might be depressed. I dont give a fuck what you call me. You can call me schizo, scizoid, borderline, avoidant, or psychopathic, but I am not fucking depressed. No fucking way. Lots of anger? yes. Lots of self hatred? Yes. Lots of guilt? Yes. But depression? FUCK NO! No way in hell am I depressed. Or lonely. I don't think depression causes a hatred for someone so much that everyday you wish to open the news and she how the person you hate got murdered. But thankfully my next meeting with her is in person, so I don't have to worry about my parents hearing me tell her the things I really need to tell her. Fuck boredom. I've lost interest in my games. youtube is no fun. And, sence I got in trouble, the games I would want to play are taken away
