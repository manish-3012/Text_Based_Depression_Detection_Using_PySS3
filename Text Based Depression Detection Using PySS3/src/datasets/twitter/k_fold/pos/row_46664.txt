I lost so much weight my clothes are all oversized I'm happy I lost weight really am and I'm not as close or near where I want to be but I hate my clothes being to big for me.

I fell like a girlfriend stealing her bfs hoodie when I wear mine.

My pants fall down so much you can see my underwear.

I'm a have to buy a shit ton of new clothes now.
