So, my cat did something smart Throughout the day I give my cats dry kibble. Every night, before I go to bed, I give my cats wet food (the stuff that comes in cans with gravy). My chonk of a cat, Inara, loves wet food and is very persistent when she's hungry. Inara is already pretty smart. She has learned that clawing at the curtains is a good way to get my attention, knows how to turn off a movie by stepping on the remote, and more importantly can open doors. Usually, she opens the bathroom door and walks in, and I promptly close the door, ignoring her. Today she was waiting for food and opened the door, but instead of walking in, she stood right next to the doorframe so I couldn't close the door. I had no choice but to finish up and get her food. 

tldr; my cat learned to stick her foot in the doorway
