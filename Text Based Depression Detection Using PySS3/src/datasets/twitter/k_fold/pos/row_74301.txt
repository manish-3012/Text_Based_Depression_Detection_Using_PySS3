advice regarding my mother and my grandfather For some context, my grandfather was diagnosed with terminal bowl cancer 9 months ago. He was given 4 months to live, but he lived through it, and could go any day. For the past week he's been having vomiting episodes and we are worried that the cancer might have come back and my mother is getting worried. My mother fully admits she has no way of showing emotion other than anger, and she's turning my household very toxic. She wants to go see my grandparents IN INDIA, but because of COVID she is worried to. Whenever me or my sister are worried, she'd always say 'i could die tomorrow, but if you think about it like that you'll live a terrible life', and we're trying to apply it to this situation. She says that if she gives my grandfather any kind of negative germs, he will most likely die, but we know that he isn't coming back to England (where i live) ever again. My mother won't be able to live with herself if she's responsible for the death of her father, but I'm stuck on the issue. What do i do? what does she do? Does she go and see my grandparents and take the risk while also receiving closure, or does she stay here, and see her father die while she's 4000 miles away, but also know that she could have had the chance to see him one last time? Please help me as i dont know what to do and neither does she
