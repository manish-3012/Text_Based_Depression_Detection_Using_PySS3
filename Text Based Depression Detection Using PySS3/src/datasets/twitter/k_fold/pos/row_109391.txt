Guys, let's talk about depression Depression is a very serious thing and you should not be joking about it, a lot of depressed people have killed themselves. I know I'm saying the obvious but the reason I say this because teens on tiktok or Instagram casually say they have depression like it's not a big deal. Yes of course some of them might actually have depression. 

And that's really about it, I'm the not type of people that would type a very long post so if you want to have a say about depression than feel free.
