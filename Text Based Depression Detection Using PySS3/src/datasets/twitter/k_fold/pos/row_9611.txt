I need help to make an egg drop device So yesterday (Thursday) my physical science teacher told us that we need to make an egg drop device and itâ€™s due on Monday.


The only materials I can use are: unlimited tape, unlimited paper, one paper/plastic cup, one plastic bag, one egg, yarn (150 cm)


We can test the device as much as we want with our eggs, but when we go to school sheâ€™s going to give us an egg and we have five minutes to â€˜installâ€™ the egg in the device, the egg has to be visible from outside like a window, and the drop is 4 meters. If it even cracks a little bit then itâ€™s an automatic F.


Any help?
