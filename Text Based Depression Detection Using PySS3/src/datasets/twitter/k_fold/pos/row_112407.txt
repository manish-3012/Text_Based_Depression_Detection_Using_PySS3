Why is life like this Why does it seem like no girl will ever want me? I just see couples in the mall and I get really sad because it just seems impossible for someone to feel that way about me. I know that most girls at my school don't find me to be attractive because they tell me I'm ugly all the time. They all don't take me seriously and treat me like I'm a little kid basically. I don't get it. I take care of myself. I take care of my hair, skin, and I make sure I smell good. I even choose my clothes out to make sure they are good fitting and they look cool. I even play multiple fucking sports for gods sake. Idk it's just when I see stories on this sub of people getting in relationships I just cry a little on the inside. Maybe it's just me self loathing idk.
