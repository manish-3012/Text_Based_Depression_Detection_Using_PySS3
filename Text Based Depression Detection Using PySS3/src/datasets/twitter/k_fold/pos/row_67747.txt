Iâ€™m ashamed of asking this but Iâ€™ve never really been a gamer cus I never had a pc until now,the only game I played was msp and Minecraft on my iPad,and I started playing genshin impact a few months ago (Iâ€™m mid sucky)
And I wanna try other games too but I donâ€™t really know what, I also donâ€™t wanna pay 20 bucks for a game but Iâ€™m always too scared of downloading them for free.
I wanted to try Yakuza cus of the gambling but yh scared to download it off some sketchy website .

So well, actual gamers on here, could I get ny recommendations?

Iâ€™m not really into fighting stuff that much, like soft like genshin is alright but itâ€™s not my favorite thing either, as mentioned before I like anything around gambling, horror is fine ig, romance is okay but not my fave either. Iâ€™m not really picky since yh donâ€™t  know much .
