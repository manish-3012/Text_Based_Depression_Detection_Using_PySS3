How do I enact a discord crusade These fuckers Iâ€™m in a discord server with are really fucking annoying. They always try and fight me IRL but are worthless pieces of shit and hated by the whole school. 

TL; DR: one has mod powers, keeps muting me for no reason, straight up admits to abusing mod. They both spam the chat and have scared away basically the entire server (basically only they talk) and I wanna some how deal with them but Iâ€™m good friends with the server owner who canâ€™t do anything Bc of conflict of interest. What do I do?
