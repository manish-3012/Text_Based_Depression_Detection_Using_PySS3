I wish I had more people to speak nigh incomprehensible verses of speech towards. Speaking in a clear, mostly understood way is close impossible for me. However it would seem I am required of such for social events to play out well enough, not yet to mention the force upon me known as School. If you ever need a moment to reflect, find an old, near forgotten local and stroll. Where? Back and forth through out the place, stumble slowly like you are first discovering an old Aztec ruin never before seen to creature. This will help.
