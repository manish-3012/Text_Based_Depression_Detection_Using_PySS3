My great grandmother complains about everything I mean it 100%. An example would be you'll offer to help her or do something like sweep and she'll be offended but if you don't she'll still be offended. She complained about the type of apples we got for the pie I'm making she complains about cooking for people but complains every time we cook. There is actually no winning.
