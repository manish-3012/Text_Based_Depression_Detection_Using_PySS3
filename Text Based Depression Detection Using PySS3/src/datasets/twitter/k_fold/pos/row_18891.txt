My mom judges me for what I like So I am very into anime and Japanese culture. It just fascinates me so much. It is my dream to go to Japan one day, to visit shrines, to wear a kimono, and to just experience everything. I play the Sims4, and they just announced a new expansion pack that is inspired by Japanese culture. So Iasked my mom if I could get it for Christmas. I explained what it was and said "I really want it because I really like Japanese culture". Then just asked "why?" in a very demeaning way. This also happened awhile ago with my stories. I like to write my own fantasy stories, and I started to write one that I was really proud of. I wrote a "bloody" battle scene, and my mom just asked "why do you write such dark stuff??". It just hurts to know your own mother doesn't support your own interests.
