I need a nickname for my boyfriend and I canâ€™t come up with one and it is really bothering me He calls me Ace because we wanted to give each other nick names but we canâ€™t seem to find any that work for him. His name is Jacob and we tried Jojo but it just isnâ€™t sticking how we want it to. Any suggestions?
