I think I'm having an anxiety attack. I have school work to be done but the options to choose from are so dumb. It's not a part of my grades but my teacher really wants me to do it. But I can't bring myself to do it. And also my science teacher wants us to answer our question paper for the exam that recently happened. but its triggering my anxiety because I don't like knowing what I've gotten wrong. I hate my anxiety attacks. They tend  to get very ugly. Its also really damaging for me. I haven't told my mom yet, but i don't know why I'm scared to do that also.
