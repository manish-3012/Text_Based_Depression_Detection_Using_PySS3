I wrote another song , hope yâ€™all like it 
Is there somewhere I can live ?
Is there somewhere I can be ?
Is there somewhere just for me ?
Is there somewhere ,is there somewhere 
Is there somewhere for me 


I am addicted to pain
Donâ€™t know how to put it down
This whole thingâ€™s making me drown
This is life,it canâ€™t just be this right?
This is what you get for Thinking you differ
This is what you get for just being unique?
If this is what I wanted I donâ€™t want it anymore
But where do I go , Iâ€™m stuck here,
I am looking for a better place
Thatâ€™s what I dream for 
They says chase your dreams 
I would chase it ,but 
Does a place like that even exist?

Is there somewhere I can live ?
Is there somewhere I can be ?
Is there somewhere just for me ?
Is there somewhere ,is there somewhere 
Is there somewhere for me 

Lately I say I have questions
Who am I ,where am I going
But the most important
What do I want
I like to say I donâ€™t know  what it is
Shrug it off like it out of my hand
But I know what it is ,
I just donâ€™t want to commit 
So I should stop saying that I canâ€™t reach it
I can reach it the problem is. 
, but is there even a place like that ?
Or is it something I made up
To keep from giving up 

Is there somewhere I can live ?
Is there somewhere I can be ?
Is there somewhere just for me ?
Is there somewhere ,is there somewhere 
Is there somewhere for me 

I canâ€™t reach this paradise
And even if I did
You know me, how could I hold
A perfect thing, and not let it burn
How could I not let myself down
So if I canâ€™t reach it
Is my life pointless
Do I have to keep on working
To get nothing in return
Suicide thoughts keep talking to me
I donâ€™t know how to get rid of them
Life is beautiful they say
Itâ€™s been 13 years, and Iâ€™m still waiting for better days
More than ever, I feel like I should pour the drink
Watch it go down the sink
I canâ€™t drink it anyway 
So what am I doing it still holding it

I am clinging to hope
Thatâ€™s my only rope
Hope that Iâ€™ll find this place
Hope that someday,Iâ€™ll be happy
That someday Iâ€™ll find this life Iâ€™ve been chasing
My whole life , but I feel hope dying
Because ,is there even somewhere 

Is there even somewhere I can live ?
Is there even somewhere I can be ?
Is there even somewhere just for me ?
Is there even somewhere ,is there somewhere 
Is there even somewhere for me
