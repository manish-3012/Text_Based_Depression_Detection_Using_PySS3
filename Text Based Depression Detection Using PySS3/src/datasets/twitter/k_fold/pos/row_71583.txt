The one time my ass actually saved me I was playing a game of some European handball yesterday and this dude comes running at me full speed and throws the ball and runs into me accidentally.

I fall straight onto my ass then my back but like, if it wasnâ€™t for my ass my skull would probably be cracked or some shit ðŸ’€ 

Only received a shoulder injury and a grazed elbow but sheâ€™ll be right.
