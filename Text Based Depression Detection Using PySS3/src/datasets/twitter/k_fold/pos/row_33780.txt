Here's a note about potential happiness Last year,  I was mentally in the worst place of my life... by what felt like on purpose

I wanted toxic shit to happen to me, I wanted to feel more than just neutral. Such stupid shit.
I constantly felt like shit and fucking romanticized my own pain. External forces like fuckin tik tok and my friends only made this feeling stronger.

Then, I started therapy. Maybe cause I wanted to be quirky ahaha mentally ill or maybe just cause I realized something was fucked up, I honestly don't remember. But, 

It helped! 
Not necessarily sure how exactly but omfg man
Its crazy to think how much I've matured and learned in a year. Life is boring, but that's the pain of being somewhat stable and happy. Its currently 2 am and I'm so happy for no reason.

Its weird, sometimes we bathe in our own sorrow and negativity like its a rose petal bath when in reality its a tomato sauce bath. Feeling shitty isn't better than feeling meh and it took some work for me to see that.

I know everything is different for everyone, but I really recommend trying to better yourself. Don't make excuses for yourself, but also don't hate yourself for making you like that. Everyone goes through shit, everyone is figuring themselves out

Love yall, If anyone ever needs to talk im literally ne v er doing anything
