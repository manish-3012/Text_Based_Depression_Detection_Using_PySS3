I feel like i'm a bit homophobic :( So when i was younger (i'm still young lol) i was homophobic, but that quickly changed when puberty hit lol. 

I'm now bi and i like boys more than girls, but i still feel weirded out sometimes, like if a boy gently or seductivly thouches me. I get like small goose bumps
