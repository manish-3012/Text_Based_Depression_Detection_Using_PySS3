I need advice on if I should end this friendship or no One of my best friends has been showing some really toxic traits for the past couple months. Like for example, when sheâ€™s off at college sheâ€™ll constantly say how much she misses me and canâ€™t wait to hang and have fun nights at the beach. But when she comes back home she doesnâ€™t seem to care about me at all. We didnâ€™t hang out once the entire break and if we were around each other it was cause of a party and she never showed any interest in even talking to me. She hung out with my friends but never with me. 

She literally only talks to me now when Iâ€™m not doing good and she finds out from another source. Like I appreciate you being here for me, but I donâ€™t need you saving me. But actually be here for me when things are good too. She acts like we are still close even though we are not. She makes me question our friendship so much, and I feel like itâ€™s so toxic.
