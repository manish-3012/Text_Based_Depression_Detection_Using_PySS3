Fuck my life is literally ruined. all my colleges rejected I got rejected by every single one of my damn colleges. I gotta go to a fucking community college or state school.

the thing is I've always been told I'm a "smart" kid even tho I'm fucking lazy. so now I have an image of being smart, and I have to tell people I didnt get into any good colleges, and they're gonna judge me for it and think less of me

the girl I like got into UCLA and is asking me to tell her when I decide where I wanna go. how the fuck do I do that? shes gonna think I've been a fraud this whole time...
