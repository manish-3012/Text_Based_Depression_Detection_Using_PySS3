Do any other girls have this issue with guys? I love men. Theyâ€™re so nice and handsome and gorgeous and kind. Most of them. 

But like at night and stuff, I still cross the street if Iâ€™m waking by myself and see a man, and I automatically get scared when a strange man looks at me. I feel really guilty because I know guys arenâ€™t all like that. 

Anyone else?
