I wish COVID would end Iâ€™m 18 and doing college online, easy enough since I did online HS when I moved during sophomore year. But holy fuck, I wish I could go to physical college. Not even to socialize, but so I could be in a new environment and actually feel like Iâ€™m starting a new page in my life. God Iâ€™m so fucking stagnant.
