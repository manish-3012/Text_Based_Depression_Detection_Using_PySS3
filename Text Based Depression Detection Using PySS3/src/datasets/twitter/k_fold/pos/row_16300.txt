A teacher accidentally showed a group chat with other teachers.. I saw a post by the AP Bio teacher asking if anyone else was noticing a decrease in the quality of turned in student work (we use google classroom).
He proposed many solutions (weather, other priorities, etc.), but the one he was most concerned with was Student Mental Health.
Just the fact that he recognized this as a possible issue made me feel hopeful for the rest of the school year. This was the teacher who was known to get stuff done and heâ€™s by far one of my favourites.
Thanks for reading and I hope you have a fantastic day.
