I need help breaking up a friendship Ima set the scene first

Me: me (duh)

S: "friend"

W: other friend

J: other guy from class

&amp;#x200B;

So I have this friend who I share a lot of interest with, we get along pretty well, and he's an all around nice dude. He's a dick sometimes, but, like, everyone is (in fact, I am probably a dick more often).

But this morning something happened.

I walked into class, said hi to the teacher and to S who was the only other person that was early.   
We talked for a bit and then J came in, greeted us and the teacher, and then started talking to S.

They talked about a group project they had with W (for a subject I don't have) and how W plagiarized his part.   
They said something along the lines of "he's going to learn this by friday and he's going to present it in front of class an if he doesn't he's gonna be the one with a bad mark."  
They were bummed cuz now they had to do extra work, and then S did something unexpected.  
The conversation went in the direction of giving presentations and S said   
"you know what i hate the most about him? the uehh thing he does in between words."   
I'm not entirely sure what J thought of this remark but at first he responded with   
"the EEEE thing right?" which is a thing W does every once in a while in an attempt to be random funny.  
But S then continued to mimic the speech impediment of W and J was like "... yeah yeah", so i'm not sure if he agreed or not.

so, TL;DR, S makes fun of W's speech impediment behind his back, what do I do now?

By the way, if this gets out of new theres actually a chance he sees the post and recognizes the conversation, so that's a thing.
