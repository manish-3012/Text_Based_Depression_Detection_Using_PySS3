damn i fucking hate going to private highschool i go to an all boys catholic highschool (not by choice, my parents are making me go for all 4 years) and while im thankful for the opportunity not being able to socialize with girls my age fucking sucks. I think the last time I saw and talked to a girl my age in person was at the end of 2019, but itâ€™s not like thatâ€™s gonna change at the end of covid, thereâ€™s a school dance or something every year but you can imagine how thatâ€™ll go considering itâ€™s a catholic school. Itâ€™s just not a natural environment and feels forced. 

Another thing Iâ€™m missing already is being able to walk home with friends. I remember in 8th grade I would always have a group of friends to walk home with and it was always great, but now that we have to drive a good half hour to my school means thereâ€™s no chance of me ever walking. I get that public schools are going through a similar thing where they canâ€™t go in person, but once covid restrictions are lifted people will just be able to socialize with one another easily. Not me, though. Pretty much my entire social life is fucked up for the last few years of grade school. 

Iâ€™ve tried talking to my parents about this, but like most parents, Iâ€™m sure, Iâ€™m told that education is more important than meeting girls or having a social life. Why tf do I need to get an above average education, anyways, when 80 percent of the shit Iâ€™ll learn wonâ€™t be applicable to what I want to do when Iâ€™m an adult (programming)? It sounds like a first world problem but jesus I would do anything to be in public school.

Oh yea and the grading system is dumb, you have to get a 94 for it to count as an A, anything under 84%  is a C, and anything under a 78 is a D. How tf does that make any sense?
