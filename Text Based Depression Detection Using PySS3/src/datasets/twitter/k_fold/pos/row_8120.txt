would anyone else do this So I'm a coach at a parkour place which is basically like America ninja warrior it has obstacle's and things but one of my favorite things to do is when I have a class full of young kids maybe 6-13 I make them do this one obstacle which is where you jump to a rope then you swing and grab a cargo net and the most fun I have some days is to just watch kid's face plant or just fall on the mat and my question is would anyone else do this.
