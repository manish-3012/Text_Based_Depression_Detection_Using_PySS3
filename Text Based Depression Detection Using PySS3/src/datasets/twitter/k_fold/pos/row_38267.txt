Do any of you have a tool collection? Im curious if/how many of you have personal tool collections. Mine is a culmination of growing up in a WW1-era farmhouse and constantly helping with remodeling and improvements. If you do have a collection I would love to hear what is in it and what tools you think are must-have items! [Here's my collection](https://imgur.com/gallery/gbun49T)
