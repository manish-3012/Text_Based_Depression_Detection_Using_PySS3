Can I have your attention please!! Have you guys heard about the rape and murder of junko furuta.  If not then please don't google it. You will have nightmares of weeks.

I was browsing reddit on some crime subs. And I found account who is searching for Junko Furuta's killers.

When I browsed his profile, he had some things related to that case.

He found the twitter account of Shinji Minato, who was one of the four monsters who killed her. I know that there are many people wanting to know more about that case so I deceided to share it here.

He even messaged that monster and has shared some facts about Minato after getting released. 

Since its against the rules of this sub to share someone's social media profile, if you are curious about it then message me and I will tell you the username of that profile I found today.

That profile only few (banned word) on the posts so I thought ot would be better if more people knew about the people who are dedicating their time to found out about those monsters and maybe one day give them what they deserve.
