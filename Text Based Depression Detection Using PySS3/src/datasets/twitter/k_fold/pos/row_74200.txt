what should i do so i have had a girlfriend for a few months now and havent told my parents, i want to but i just cant bring myself to do it, i was hoping someone here to tell me what i should do. im pretty sure my parents think im gay, im not, if i tell them itll be a huge deal and they will bring it up in family gatherings and all that stuff. thank you guys!
