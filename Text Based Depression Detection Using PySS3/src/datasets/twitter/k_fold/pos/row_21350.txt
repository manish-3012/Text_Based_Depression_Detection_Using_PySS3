I have a dilemma I want an aegishjalmur tattoo on my forehead but i also wanna join the marines. Idk wether to just put it somewhere else or just not join. aegishjalmur if you don't know is a nordic rune (object) that's also referred to as the helm of terror, its painted on ones forehead to strike fear into an enemy its supposed to bring out all of your might. (Yes im a pagan, and yes im the only pagan in my family)
