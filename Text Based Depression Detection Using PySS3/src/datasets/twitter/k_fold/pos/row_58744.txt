This week has been fucking wild So first of all corona is annoying, and I honestly hate online learning. Second my cat that I have had for 10 years died and it fucking hurts like hell, he was a dumb fat cat, but i fucking loved him anyways. Lastly I turned 16, which is pretty cool, but it just feels really meh, like last year I was really hyped for my birthday, and I could barely sleep, but this year I just watched some dumb YouTube videos for a few hours, and then just fell asleep, and I really just wanna be fucking happy again, but i donâ€™t really feel like thats gonna happen anytime soon.
