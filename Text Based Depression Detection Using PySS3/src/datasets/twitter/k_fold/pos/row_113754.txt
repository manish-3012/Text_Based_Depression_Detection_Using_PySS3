my crush was joking that she likes me for 6 months uhhh so my crush randomly asked me out after saying that she likes me and pretending we have common interests for around 6 months  
when i said yes, she said that it was a joke and she lost a wager, and i got blocked everywhere

i just wasted 6 months of my fucking life, i dont know what to do anymore, being an introvert without any friends was cool

also idk if flair is accurate, let me know and i'll change it to better one
