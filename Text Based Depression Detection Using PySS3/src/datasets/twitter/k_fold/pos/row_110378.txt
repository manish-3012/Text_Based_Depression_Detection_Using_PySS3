Guys i think its happening My 17th birthday is in 25 days. I was a playstation kid so i never had a PC, yet it has been my dream to get a good gaming PC. And now in covid times, where the only fun thing i get to do is meeting once a week with my friends on discord and playing games (on my very old laptop) this dream has only gotten bigger.

My parents made some good money after they sold my moms flat she rented to some guy. So in the last few days, i've been dropping some "Hey dad look at this PC here" you know and he didn't said the things he would normally say when i show him stuff i want but will most certainly not get.

Soooooooooo i am pretty hyped and really hope to get a PC :DD

I dont think anybody here will care but reddit is a nice community and since this is for teenagers i thought i just drop by and tell yall.

Sorry for any spelling errors, i am german and I am typing this on my phone :/
