How should I talk to my mom about this? So my mom has not exactly given me permission to be here on reddit and judging by my account I am pretty sure I have gone against that. In my opinion being here with you human beings has been beneficial to me but I cant tell her that because well im not supposed to have an account. But thats besides the point. A few weeks ago on a saturday I asked her "hey mom can i download reddit on my phone to just browse around reddit?" and she hesitated before telling me we would talk about it that school week. We did not. I am thinking that she doesnt exactly want me on reddit but I would like to be because one you all are awesome and really helpful, and two, memes. Theres also a third point that my sister has a tik tok account (given its private but its not like I go around posting my face or my body on reddit in photos) but I am scared of the possible fallout from that. What do you all think I should do?
