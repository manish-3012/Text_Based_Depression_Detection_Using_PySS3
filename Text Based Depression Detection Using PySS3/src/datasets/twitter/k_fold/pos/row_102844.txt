Should I have my first kiss? CONTEXT: this happened after school right now and its happenning tomorrow. 

So there's this girl that confessed that she liked me and I like her too and said that i love her too. she said that we could walk home together and have our first kiss behind a dumpster so no one could see us because we're 14 and its kinda werid to kiss in public unless you're an adult. But thing is I'm worried  about corona because when you kiss your breath goes into the other person's mouth and COVID is airborne and she said asked me if we could make out/ tongue to tongue . I said yes but then when I got home I was like oh shit I might get corona because we're gonna be breathing into each others mouths.

what do I do?

do I tell that we can just hug each other?

do I say that we shouldn't make out cuz of corona?

what the fuck do I do??????
