Got really progressive today My mom is out to buy some stuff, and she usually go for REALLY long


So a while after she left I decided to take out the trash as she told me to just before leaving. But the trash bag had a hole, so some of the trash fell out. Good thing there weren't much, but I still had to clean it up. So I took the mop and started cleaning. About half way through, I went "Fuck it, I'll clean the whole house" so I did.

Afterwards since my mom was still out, I decided that I'm kind of a weak and skinny twink so I started working out a bit. I used Meathook from Doom Eternal as workout music, which is very effective. And managed to beat my previous push-up record (the record was like, 2 and a half but still). I lost count on how many I did cause I was carried away by the music, but I'd say it is MOST DEFINITELY more than 10!

My arms were like noodles afterwards, but I'm really pround of myself.
