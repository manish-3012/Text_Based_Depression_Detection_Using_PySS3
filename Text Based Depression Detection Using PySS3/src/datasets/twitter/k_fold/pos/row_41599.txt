How to play D&amp;D? My younger sister got a DnD for her birthday, she has been asking for days now, for someone to play with her, and I do kind of hate to see it, I have told her that I will play with her tomorrow, consequently, her face brightened and she is now super-excited, the problem is that I don't have the faintest idea of its rules and gameplay.

She got a D&amp;D starter pack with about 6 kinds of dice, 6 character sheets, and I think 2 missions or quests (idk)

I tried looking up online but it wasn't quite clear. So I hope anyone of you can help me
