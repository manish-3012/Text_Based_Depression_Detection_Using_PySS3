I just want to talk about how awesome my crush is. If you wanna listen that would be pretty rad. For context to this part of the story her name is Aurora, but I always mess up the pronunciation and say it like uh-rour-a not A-roar-ah, and every time I mess it up she does this little giggle, and its just so cute!!! And she is kinda shorter and I am a bit taller and she does this thing (bc she is a little older than me) where she will get up on a little stepping stool and put her hand on her head and then my head and say â€œWhy are you so much taller than me, I thought I was supposed to be the older one!?â€ And It just melts my heart every time. And she does all these little cute things and they are just so awesome. And she is so funny, and smart, and sometimes she gets really serious and its really cute because she is always defending her friends and always sticking up for them. And she just is so cute and I like her so much and just wanted to talk about her because I am to scared of telling anyone irl.
