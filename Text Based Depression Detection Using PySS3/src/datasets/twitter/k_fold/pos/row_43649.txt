Why is life so boring and sad and eh? Your probably thinking , oh it's another teen complaining and crap, but over all it true, life is boring without friends and stuff , right imagine urself in a small room with a chromebook (not touch screen) and a phone , that's all  , all day everyday and the only thing you can do is watch YouTube cause non of ur friends want to play mobile games and the only thing u can do apart from sitting in ur room is going to school with 2 friends to chat.
Fuck me if I'm wrong but tbh I'm probably not.
