Pranked my BF(best friend) so imma use reddit to say it's a prank The start:
Ok so yesterday my friend messaged me that no one was gonna be at his house till late now one thing about my friend is that he dosent talk to girls much

The prank:
 so for fun I said I will hook him up with a girl so he said thinking it's a joke "ok tell her to message me" now my aunt was at my house so I used my aunt's phone to message him .At first he thought it was me who messaged him (which it was ) and messaged some super embarrassing stuff but somehow I convinced him that it was actually a girl and he started going "sorry I really thought u were my friend and that he wasn't intrested" .now I thought I will say it to him it was a prank but some work came up and I didn't tell him .skip to next morning

The aftermaths :
Now the next day he messages me that he felt so embarrassed to the point that he had a nightmare now I thought the prank went to deep and thought let's say it's a prank but then he started talking abt some intresting topic related to it and I thought I want to hear all this before I say it to him and now I am so deep into the rabbit hole that I couldn't say it to him directly cause I feel like he will kill me if I say it now lol .so I thought imma say this on reddit cause he is new to reddit and it would be fun .

To my friend:
Dudee look at the camera there .IT WAS A PRANK DUDEEEEE.

Tldr:- pranked my friend to think he was talking to a girl(it was me) he felt embarrassed to the point he got a nightmare and now I am too scared to say it to him directly
