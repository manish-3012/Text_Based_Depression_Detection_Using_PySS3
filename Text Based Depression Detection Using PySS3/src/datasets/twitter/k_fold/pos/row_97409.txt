Iâ€™m 2 cool foâ€™ these Fools! Guys I literally have nothing in common with teens my age. Like NOTHING and it makes it hard for me to socialize with ppl becuz there isnâ€™t a lot of relatability going on. 

I like collecting board games and talking abt philosophy or science. 

Now hereâ€™s the tricky part. Iâ€™m not a nerd, like I donâ€™t build my own PCs or Jack off to anime. Like Iâ€™ve tried communicating with the nerdy kids becuz at least we share common interests but they make weird jokes and wonâ€™t stop showing off their world war 2 equipment and itâ€™s weird.

So basically Iâ€™m being annoyingly picky and I just want at least one normal human being that doesnâ€™t talk about World War 2 all day but shares at least one of my interests and I literally wonâ€™t want any other friend in the whole world, just need one!

Who has advice on how I can trick someone into becoming my friend ?!
