can't meet friends due to covid New school rules have closed the cafeteria and stopped us from being able to go to other friends classrooms. We can still go outside, but it's starting to get colder, and they haven't been going out. I'm an introvert and haven't been able to text them, nor have they to me. I don't wanna ruin my relationship over some virus and stupidity. anyone in the same situation, or got any advice.
