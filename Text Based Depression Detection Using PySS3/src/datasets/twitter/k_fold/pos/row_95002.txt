So is this normal? Okay so i turned thirteen this month. I've heard that boy's and voice changes when they grow but I didnt really care about that. So like my family met up and everyone's just telling me my voice has changed

Like what! I literally just became a teen and just all of a sudden my voice just changes. I don't find any difference.. My parents are also just noticing the change. 

Is this normal?
