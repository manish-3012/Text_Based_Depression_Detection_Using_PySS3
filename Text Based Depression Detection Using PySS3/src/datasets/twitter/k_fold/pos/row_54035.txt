its depressing that you dont become perfect when you become an adult. kid me believed that adults are just perfect. i believed that they have the problems to all solutions. 
then you grow older and realise that the only difference between 16 year-old me and 18 year-old me is a little bit of time and others' expectations. thats sucks. it sucks to know that life wont figure itself out. it sucks to know that ill have to better myself on my own. its sucks to know that ill have to make an effort to do that even though i have no motivation to do so. it sucks to know that hope doesnt change shit.
im scared that when i look back at myself on my 18th birthday, ill see that i havent changed a bit. im scared because everyone else around me is growing and im not.
