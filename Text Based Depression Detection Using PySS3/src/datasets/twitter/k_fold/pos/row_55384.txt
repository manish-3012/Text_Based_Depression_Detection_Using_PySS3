I think I am in big trouble when I go back to School on Friday So to explain why I think im in trouble we need to go back to September last year. I dont want to go into detail because its complicated but someone I knew stole my bike and sold It for drugs (I'll call him paul) Paul asked me for a shot of my bike and I said no. After he asked several more times I said he could go on it for 10 minutes. (whats the worst that can happen I thought) It turned out that he stole my bike and sold it for drugs. I then called the police becuase what else was I supposed to do in that situation and they confirmed that he had it and sold it and gave him a criminal record. 

At the time Paul stole my bike he was already expelled from our school so I haven't seen him since but apparently when School starts back up on Friday he will be returning to school. According to my friends who I deeply trust paul is out to get me when school starts up and I know he will batter the duck out of me the first chance he gets. What do I do? 

Ps I cant fight him because I would get excluded and he will definitely win
