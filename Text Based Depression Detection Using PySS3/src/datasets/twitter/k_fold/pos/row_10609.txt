I hate Dora the explorer 1- the way she says shit like "are we going over the bridge?" is filled with attitude and I don't like it. 2- she takes so ling to open a fucking backpack, and the map is so annoying. 3- she's fucking blind, doesn't see shit right in front of her. 4- I never give her a verbal answer, so how does she know? The bitch reads minds, I'm not fucking with that. Poor boots honestly
