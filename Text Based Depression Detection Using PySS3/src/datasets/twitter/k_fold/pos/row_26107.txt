I got a weed shirt I kind of want to wear it to my college campus but idk if I'll get in trouble for it or not. I know my mom definitely won't like it but I can hide it from her. 

Btw I've never even done weed before. It's a shirt of a band I like and one of their shirts had a weed leaf on it, which I thought was funny so I got it.

So wearing it to college classes, yes or no? Thoughts?
