How I ruined my first time having s*x Guys take this seriously dont squeeze ur dick too hard when having a wank. I had sex for the first time last night and couldnâ€™t cum. I said it was because I was nervous but the truth is that I couldnâ€™t climax because it was too loose compared to how thight I usually do it (she was virgin as well her v**** wasnt loose). It makes you less sensitive overtime if you do it too roughly so take my advice and do it gently.
