"I'm boredâ€ is such an annoying phrase when used to explain why you're talking with someone I swear, every time anyone texts me, they always start off by saying â€œI'm boredâ€ and it's such a transparent half-assed attempt at making it seem like the conversation isn't important to them to play it cool. If you just want to talk to someone, saying â€œI just wanted to talk to youâ€ is a perfectly fine reason to give, and can even make people feel more appreciated.
