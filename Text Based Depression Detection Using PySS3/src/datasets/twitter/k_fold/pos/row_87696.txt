Do you ever actually talk back on your mom and regret later? Like , If I do it ; I always end up regret that and it seems that I low-key hurt her by doing so  . It's not her fault to ask me to eat and all when I'm not eating and doing things that aren't as important as her or food but I do it .

Apparently I'm not a good son but I'll be one day ig .
