Does anyone else feel weird using â€˜gayâ€™ as an insult? I know and Iâ€™ve heard before that itâ€™s just a joke, but I still feel uncomfortable when all of my straight friends (and just people I know) use the adjective â€˜gayâ€™ with negative connotations. To be clear, I am straight, but it still just annoys me a little. And I donâ€™t want to be like one of those random people on Instagram getting offended â€œon behalfâ€ of other communities. But this has bugged me for a while now and I want to know how others feel and if I should say something, or if Iâ€™m just being annoying. What do you guys think?
