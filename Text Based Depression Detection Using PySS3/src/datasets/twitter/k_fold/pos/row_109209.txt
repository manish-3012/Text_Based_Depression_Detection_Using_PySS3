Okay, this may be kinda dumb but Iâ€™m looking for peeps who wanna play Among Us together with some other people on Discord.. 
I am looking for people who arenâ€™t too serious and are okay playing third imposter willingly at times. Say someone vents.. They then say, â€œMy bad, I tripped.â€ If you are willing to let them go 1/3 of the time- Congrats! 

Maybe you have an imposter friend and they show you.. If you a loyal friend 1/4 of the time and donâ€™t tell- Congrats! 

By â€˜Congratsâ€™ I mean that thatâ€™s the kind of person I want to play with..

Iâ€™m looking for what some would call â€œThird Imposters.â€ I want to screw around in the game and have fun without making anyone else too mad.

I just donâ€™t want the game ruined for those who want to play fair.
