What should I get for Christmas? So, Christmas is like about the corner and itâ€™s time to see what I wanna get but idk, and I wanted you guys to help me decide. So Iâ€™ve been thinking of maybe a bycicle, or like an iPad Pro, or maybe even an oculus quest? But I donâ€™t have any games to play on VR, nor I feel like a bycicle that much, nor do I extremely want the iPad... I would love it if you could give me some ideas because I really donâ€™t know. Gaming stuff that doesnâ€™t go above 700 bucks would be nice, like a WiFi router like a razer sila? But I donâ€™t know if that would really be satisfactory to open and I canâ€™t mod my laptop with an RTX 3080 or anything and Iâ€™m screaming inside please help and sorry for this being a wall of text but itâ€™s 1:35 a m and I do this because Iâ€™m desperate to know what to get please help :)
