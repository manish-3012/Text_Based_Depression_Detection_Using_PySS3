im scared i wont loe my virginity because of my zodiac sign im a virgo, in my language its the same word as 'virgin'. i never took it serious that my zodiac sign was called virgo or virgin. But now i have looked it up and apparently the virgo is easily attached to the symbolism of virgin. Well, thats when i got scared. then i visited more websites, saying virgos wont find love easier than other sings. Or that the virgo will never lose their virginity. Or at the age of 19. I dont want to lose my virginity on 19 man i really dont. Im 16 now which is the max age for me to lose it.
