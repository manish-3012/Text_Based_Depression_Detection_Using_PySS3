Sad Day(s) - Diary (3rd August) Today was a great day. I did everything I do on a normal weekend. Everything was normal except for no conversation between me and my friends. Sure, I talked to S (he doesn't like social media), but it was too short as he was watching Youtube. He has neither talked to me nor played with me since he asked his crush on Zoom. She said no, and here I am, without my friend. Earlier I told E to talk to me later as she was in a class. She didnâ€™t even reply to my â€œhiâ€. I have been seeing a lot of my own messages in the chats than theirs. So this is what total Corona isolation is. I mean, not a single hello from anybody in a day. It feels as if Iâ€™m disconnected from everyone. 

Let's leave it before I get too sad. Today, I started my day a little late but was in the online class before everyone. Maths was going well till the evening when my mom asked me some questions which I was not able to solve properly. I swear I would have been able to do those questions but I wasnâ€™t able to do it at the right time. It was probably because it was very late to do an application-heavy study. I didnâ€™t sleep in the afternoon either so here I am now, resorted to writing my day, even when I know I will forget about it.

I really hope that both S and E at least talk to me. I only have them right now and it is a terrifying thought of losing them and being socially isolated, even for a day. Iâ€™m not going to cry or anything like that, but its kind of sad. Just waiting for someone to know my password and get access to my whole digital life.
