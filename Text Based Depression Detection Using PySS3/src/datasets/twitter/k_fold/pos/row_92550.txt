im going to die alone i cant forget about her for 2 years and she forgets about me in a week. Over and over again. Some random guy is like hey lets be together. Sure. 

I am obsessed. I have issues. Im not okay mentally. Over and over again. I am blind. I wish to wake up but this is not a dream. Im so hurt I dont feel shit. I just wanna die in my sleep tonight. I am obsessed. I cannot stop. I am obsessed, I cant admit it

Im pathetic. Thats what I am, a big piece of pathetic shit. I am useless, I am dumb. I really am worthless, I have nothing.

Im not gonna die alone, im going to kill myself in the fucking future
