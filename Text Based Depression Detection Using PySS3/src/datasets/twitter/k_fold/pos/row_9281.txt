Is she really into me? So there was this girl that was in my friend group in high school, and we talked outside of school a lot too. Well anyways fast forward to now, and after breaking up with one of her friends, she suddenly seems to be trying to be personal, and is asking more about me. I know my ex was quite open about our relationship and personal lives. Like things we would do together. So is she really into me?
