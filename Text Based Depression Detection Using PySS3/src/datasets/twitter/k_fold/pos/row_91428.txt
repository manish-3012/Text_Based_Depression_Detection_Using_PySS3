I donâ€™t even know Iâ€™ve tried keeping my thoughts in because I donâ€™t want to burden people but Iâ€™ve got an essay due tomorrow that Iâ€™ve barely started and I can barely focus so I just need to get my thoughts out.

I wanna die, but I donâ€™t want to kill myself. I just wish I had some bad accident and suddenly died. I donâ€™t have the guts to jump off or cut deeper which is why I wish I would just accidentally get hit by a truck or something. Living is such a pain. I just hate being alive, and a majority of the things that come attached to it. Waking up, going to school, playing games, watching yt, itâ€™s all stuff I used to enjoy and look forward to but nowadays I dread the thought of it. I just want to sleep forever. Not to mention Iâ€™m an asshole to basically all my friends, I can think of a select group of people who might be upset if I were gone but Iâ€™d imagine theyâ€™d get over it eventually. Not to mention eventually Iâ€™ll die eventually and my whole life wouldâ€™ve been pointless from start to finish. Ultimately Iâ€™d just be speeding of the process of life by offing myself, yet I still canâ€™t fucking do it. Iâ€™ll go to the pipe, stare down yet I canâ€™t jump. I just donâ€™t have the guts to do it. Itâ€™d be so easy and the moment I make the choice I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about anything anymore. Iâ€™d be in peace. I just want to die but itâ€™s so difficult. Iâ€™m easily replaceable in life and Iâ€™m not a very significant person so why is it so goddamn difficult. Especially considering how easy itâ€™d be to off myself and how good the payoff for me would be, I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t do it. It feels like Iâ€™m stuck sometimes. Weird thing about it is I canâ€™t even cry about the thought of who Iâ€™d be leaving behind. Granted I would feel bad for causing them trouble. I donâ€™t want to cause anybody trouble, I just want to disappear from this earth without a trace of me left physically and mentally. In a way where nobody remembers me and everything I did it had would just disappear with me. Thatâ€™d be nice that way nobody would be upset. I donâ€™t even know where Iâ€™m going in life. Whenever I try to picture a future for myself my mind goes blank. I canâ€™t foresee having a future. I mean itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m doing much with my life, considering a decent chunk of my time is spent asleep in bed. I just donâ€™t fucking know. 

Tl:dr I wanna die but I donâ€™t want to kill myself because thatâ€™s scary

Iâ€™m sorry this is probably super disjointed but it did help me clear my mind a little bit. Hopefully Iâ€™ll get the essay done before tomorrow.. goodbye 

ps sorry for dumping my thoughts
