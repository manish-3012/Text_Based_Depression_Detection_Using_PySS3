I donâ€™t know where to post this so here. I hope u guys are doctors Iâ€™m freaking out here a little, bit itâ€™s probably unwarranted. So I was holding my breath for about a minute and a half cause I heard it can wake u up. My right cheek started feeling a little weak compared to the other. I canâ€™t see any difference  in my face, and the rest of my body feels fine. I have a history of thinking Iâ€™m having a stoke even when Iâ€™m just lying in bed.
Iâ€™m 14 year old male 5â€™7 180 lbs ok athleticism. I held my breath about 5 minutes ago

Edit: sorry for being a hypochondriac
