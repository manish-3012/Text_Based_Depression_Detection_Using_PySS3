I keep forgetting I'm turning 20 ðŸ™ Just doesn't feel the same anymore on this forum I go quite often. I joined when I was a minor and now I'm not. I end up not posting everything I wanna post because I remember I'm a literal 20 year old about to post on a forum filled with mostly minors and other 20+ year olds (we are the minority aha) and it just feels so fucking weird I'm sad :( I used to go there and rant my heart out and be pissed but now I'm like "are you really gonna rant to a bunch of 14-16 year olds ðŸ¤¨"  obviously not aha 


So now I'm using Reddit since no one gives a shit and there's so many 18+ users I feel okay to vent (and no one sees my posts! Well, almost no one)
