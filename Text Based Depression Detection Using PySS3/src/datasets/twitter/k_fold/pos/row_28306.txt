Dont know where else to post this So before I went to vacation I had two pet spiders in my Room to kill off flies and stuff, and as I didnt want them to overtake my Room by having children I killed them the hour before I went on vacation

When I came back my Room was full of spiders, so I figured that they must have survived

What if god tried to do the same with Adam and Eve but failed as horrible as I did?
