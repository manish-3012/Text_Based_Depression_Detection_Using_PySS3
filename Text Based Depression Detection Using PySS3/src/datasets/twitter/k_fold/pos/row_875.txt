The CREEPIEST thing happened last night ok so i have a set up for my logitech g920 which is right next to my bed. iâ€™m an extremely light sleeper by the way. at about 1:30 am my wheel randomly spun like it does on a startup, waking me up, and i think it sounded like my xbox was on but no light  on the power. i shit my pants and still am, i have no clue what it was
