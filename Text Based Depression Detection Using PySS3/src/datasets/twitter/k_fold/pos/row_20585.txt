I hate when parents say it When ever i talk to my parents about bullying, harrasing(acc to indian lvl). My parents just brush it off and ignoresaying"Ya it use to exist even in our days, its life son!,you should stand up to them "you pice of dumb shit!! How about i score low marks it used happen even in your days right, what?! Shut up mom you were a girl in school you didn't have such problems, i could have stood up if it was 1v1 but they gang up on me and its not just physical abuse its harsh word and negative critics. You people say you know when i get hurt stop that sentimental lie i was beaten and treated like shit everyday for half semester i even bunked school at tuesday and friday to avoid getting beaten and you don't even know about it. 2years have passed it still makes my nerves chill and cry.
