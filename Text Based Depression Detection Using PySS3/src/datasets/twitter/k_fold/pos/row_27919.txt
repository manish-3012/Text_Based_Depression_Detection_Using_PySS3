Mildly Upset Iâ€™m a little angry atm. I screwed up on a math test and my average in the class went from a 97 to an 85. I was acing the class, and got one 75 on a test which was apparently worth half my grade and my really hard work is all down the drain

I donâ€™t like that the American school system puts so much emphasis on tests. I never have and this little setback is only setting that opinion in stone. 

I have put in so much effort into raising my Algebra grade and I nerf a single assignment and itâ€™s ALL gone.
