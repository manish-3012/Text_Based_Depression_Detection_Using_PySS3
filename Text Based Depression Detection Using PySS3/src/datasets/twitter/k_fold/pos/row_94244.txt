STILL BE A HUMAN BEING, you know not rejecting your emotions, not rejecting "femenine" things right away just because "thats gay", you can cry, you may not be able to open the pickle jar and you are still valid and 100% a men, quite the discovery huh?! (out of jokes guys don't be toxic masculine allow yourself to be who you truly are, you are valid no matter what old people and stupid dudes say, you can be whoever you want and i will always accept you and love you:)
