Yeah I confessed to my girl bff.... We talk on call like everyday for an hour even if we have a busy schedule.And I really like her and I confessed to her.I said I know you don't want to date and its anyways ok to say no.So I said I really like you and she said sorry but no.
Yeah that's practically it but I couldn't stop crying the entire morning and I don't even know why.
Some of her other friends said she might have her reasons but I know that if she really liked she would've said yes.Yeah and she called again today and we had a 2 hour call again and it was so tough to hold back myself from crying.I don't know what to do.Will our friendship be the same? She calls me everyday and suddenly spacing out would be bad.....
(She's a school friend)
Yeah I sound like a sobby kid but I considered her the closest.....
