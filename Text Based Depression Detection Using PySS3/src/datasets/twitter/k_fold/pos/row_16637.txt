Just do what you love I'm 15 and for the past month I've been "living my dream"

I've hooked up with 3 girls (yes it was my first time)

Made 40k dollars from the rise of bitcoin (it has reached 16k$ for one bitcoin)

And I was hired as a graphic designer and as a marketing co manager at a design studio I really like (Sharon Shrem).


And I'm still not happy, my happiest moments were just spending time with my best friend, just chilling, sitting, doing basically nothing. 
My massage to you is just do what you love, no matter how simple how hard. 

Just have fun.
