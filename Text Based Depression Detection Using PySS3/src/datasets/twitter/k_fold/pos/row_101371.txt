OH SHIT MY MOM REMOVED MY DOOR LOCK AND MY PET DIED now that i have your attention, i need some place to be absolutely ridiculous. government said that the schools in this state are to be re-opened starting 19th October, and they need parents' consent before opening the school i go to. now i want to meet my friends, because next year i am shifting to a new school, and this might be the last time i get to meet them. but safety is also important. my friend attended his ptm today and the teacher said that our school has not yet decided if they will reopen. so should i be sad that i might not get to meet my friends or should i be happy that i don't have to go to school and can remain safe at home? i don't want to sit in the front of a screen all day but again, covid is shitty.
