Being a young teen kinda sucks Like I'm not complaining. At least I can have a debit card. But I have to be driven everywhere and 5 times out of 6 my brother has tag along with me.

Also, I'm the youngest in my grade. I won't be able to drive until halfway through my junior year and everyone in my grade has a real job (compared to me selling stuff on Etsy). But at least I'm not in middle school...
