I'm fucking done What's the point anymore man. Everything goes bad eventually and I'm sick of it happening to me. I hate how sad I am 24/7. I hate that I can't talk to my parents without getting yelled at. I'm tired. I should have died 9 weeks ago but I didn't and I hate it. Im gonna do anything but seriously guys I'm done.
