I think somethings wrong with me A few days ago, I was thinking about hurting someone who hurt me like 2 months ago. The thing is the way I hurt them, In my head, to a normal mind would seem horrible, but I didn't feel any regret, I still don't as a matter of fact I felt really really good but not in a "oh that was strange" way. Things have been happening to me mentaly, that no one is in control of not even me. I feel like a different person, I don't know what's going on. I'm going to a counceler about my sadness at the moment and I'm almost finished, I just don't feel comfortable talking to anyone about it
