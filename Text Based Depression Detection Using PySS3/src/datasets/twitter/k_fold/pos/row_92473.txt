discord mods are honestly just terrible people if u're a discord mod here, i'm sorry if my words down below are going to make u feel insulted, but i still hope u can understand my perspective 

many subreddits tend to have their own discord servers, and i'm perfectly fine with the idea of it, being able to connect members together is surely a good thing, meeting new people and stuff, but the dumbest of the dumbest things in a discord server, is their rules 

yes i understand rules are there to keep the members in order, prevent bullying and stuff, but for some reason they love to go to the extent of not allowing links and pictures which is honestly like dumb, like i get it, there are spammers or toxic people that abused that function and made many people angry, but u can't just assume everyone is gonna spam pictures because of a few guys who did it in the past 

and like whenever u get banned or muted for doing it, they are never willing to understand the intent of u sending the pic or the link, they just ban u straightaway and don't bother to understand the context even if ur intent was to just share something and mean no harm 

they will just say something "the rules are there, as long as u broke it u'll be banned" like bruh the rules were made to "prevent harm" or "prevent spam" and our intent wasnt even to harm or spam someone, just because we did what a spammer did in the past it doesn't mean we have the same intent as them

tldr: mods of discord servers create stupid rules and are never willing to be reasonable when someone "breaks" them
