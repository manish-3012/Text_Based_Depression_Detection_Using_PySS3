I confessed to my crush who is a close friend though she doesn't really care anymore about me after i confessed. I confessed to my crush (really liked her for a year) almost 2 weeks ago, for the record she was a close friend of mine just last year. When i confessed, we really hit it off with our conversations in messages though it's visible that i'm the one initiating the conversation. Now we don't talk much though it will almost be a one-sided conversation with messages she doesn't prefer to look at. I just don't wanna hurt myself by hoping more. What should i do?
