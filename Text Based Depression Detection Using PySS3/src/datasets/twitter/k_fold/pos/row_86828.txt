I JUST GOT KICKED FROM MY ZOOM CALL FOR SMILING Before the teacher arrived we were telling jokes, and the teacher got mad so we stopped. But then this kid swoops in with a mcdonald's play place as his background and we all start laughing a little. I managed to keep a straight face but accidentally cracked a small smile, and got booted. No one else got booted even though they were laughing harder than me. 

Teachers like that ruin school for me
