itâ€™s been a year it been a year since i was last in a mental hospital. i should feel happy that iâ€™ve been making strides of progress but i canâ€™t help but to feel scared. it feels like time is going by so fast and iâ€™m completely out of control. i feel so unimportant to everyone around me, no matter how many friends i have i still feel completely alone. i donâ€™t want to die tho. i just want to change myself you know. over this last year iâ€™ve gotten so much better with my ED and addiction but i still canâ€™t stop this deep feeling of dread. i just want to mean something to someone. again iâ€™m not suicidal, just lost.
