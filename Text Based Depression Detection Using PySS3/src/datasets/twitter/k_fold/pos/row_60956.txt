A-hole realtors I actually hate our house being shown. It sucks. There is this couple, from Toronto. They are actual pos's. They originally said they wanted to come on Friday. Then Thursday. Then today, at 5:50 (like 10 minutes before dinner) THE REALTOR KNOCKED ON OUR DOOR AND ASKED IF THEY COULD COME IN. NO 24HR WARNING OR EVEN A VERIFIED SHOWING. THIS COUPLE ACTUALLY HAD THE CHEEK TO SAY THAT THEY WERE IN THE AREA AND WANTED TO COME IN. It was just 4 of us, (me, mum, sibling, dog) because my dad went downtown to his office in our single car. So we couldn't even drive around and get food. I have done about 1.5 hours today of walking, while doing online school on top of that. At the start of the showings, we had FOUR SHOWINGS IN ONE DAY.
