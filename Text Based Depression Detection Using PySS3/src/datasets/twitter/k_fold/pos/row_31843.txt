I really have to talk about this Ok so my dad sat me and my four younger siblings down and said that we have some financial problems, and that he might not be able to pay for my school much longer, and then he had the fucking audacity to say that someone in our family must be sinning, and that itâ€™s the devils fault, and that this gods will and shit. Like wtf, thatâ€™s not what causes financial issues, you know what does? Buying a fucking boat that we donâ€™t need because itâ€™ll supposedly be a â€œgood witness.â€ And then he says that it might be because my younger brother doesnâ€™t know enough Verses, itâ€™s bad enough that heâ€™s blaming all of his shortcomings on god, but now heâ€™s blaming us. God I canâ€™t wait to leave.
