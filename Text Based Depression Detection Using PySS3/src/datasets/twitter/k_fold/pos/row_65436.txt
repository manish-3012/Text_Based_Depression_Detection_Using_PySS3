I don't like sharing my favorite songs to anyone I really like this song. But then I'm not going to share it with my friends or anyone. My friends aren't judgemental but they'll not respect this song as much as I do and I can't tolerate insult to my favorite songs. Me liking this song is probably my biggest secret.
