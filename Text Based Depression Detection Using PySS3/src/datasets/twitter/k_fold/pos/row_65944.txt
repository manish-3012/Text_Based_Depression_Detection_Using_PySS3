Think your school is bad? Listen to this I break up on Wednesday, meaning I donâ€™t have school for just over two weeks

Great, except suddenly the school has managed to put another lesson on that day at 1:30

My initial (and usually only) lesson ends at 11:30, meaning while thereâ€™s a heatwave, I have to sit in a bleak room for two hours just to attend a 1 hour lesson 

I sent an email asking if I could do it virtually and they said no. Itâ€™s complete BS and I essentially have to twiddle my thumbs for 2 hours
