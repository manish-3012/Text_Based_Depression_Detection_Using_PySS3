Am I dumb or 
So Iâ€™ve lowkey had a crush on one of my best friends from school and she texts me a tik tok that says â€œshoot your shot send this to someone who want to be your valentineâ€. And sheâ€™s says â€œwill you be my valentineâ€. 

So Iâ€™m thinking wtf this is kinda cool and Iâ€™m like omg yea Iâ€™m down Iâ€™ve actually liked you for a bit. She says â€œomg yayâ€. 

Then my mind goes to some weird fucking place and I ask her â€œwait are you joking or being serious rnâ€ and she says â€œIm kidding lmaoâ€. 

I am in a state of shock and paralysis. She didnâ€™t say it over call or anything so I didnâ€™t recognize like a joking tone. I mean like damn I thought that she was being serious but I guess not. We donâ€™t really joke about this stuff either so idk. I feel really fucking embarrassed. But at the same time how was I supposed to know she was joking :(

Soooooo I guess my question is: is this shit normal or smthn? is it weird that I thought she was being serious?

I feel like maybe Iâ€™m dumb for not being able to differentiate platonic and romantic feelings but I feel like she was being really straightforward about it? And also at the same time who asks that â€œas a jokeâ€. So was I justified to coming to the conclusion that she liked me? 

Im not too upset that she rejected me in the end- I understand it and like I canâ€™t really change her feelings so yea I canâ€™t rlly do much but accept it and move on. I just wanna know if this stuff is like normal or if Iâ€™m had overseen anything


Dude idk Iâ€™m confused. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks
