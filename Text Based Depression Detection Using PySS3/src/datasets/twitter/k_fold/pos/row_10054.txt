Guys, just discovered an epic pimple hack, changed my life or something idk how youtubers write titles like this. anyway, hope it helps :) 1- campfire, marshmallows n shit. burn a marshmallow; extra c r i s p y and a bit red is probably best

2- fucking stab yourself in the face with it. 

3- dont tell anyone that you just gave yourself a 5cm second-degree burn because it actually doesnt hurt that much and you dont want to bother anyone anyway

4- benefit from a pimple-free chin

hope this works for you guys as much as it did for me, currently have no pimples on my chin and its super cool

side effects may include burned chin and scab from where you rubbed off the burnt skin, 1 week healing time and pain, but thats ok because im talking so fast you cant hear me \*exaggerated wink\*
