I feel like reaching out to a friend, but at the same time I feel like reaching out isnâ€™t going to change anything because I donâ€™t really feel like I trust anyone enough to reach out in the first place. I want to go complain to one of my friends for an hour and just tell them everything thatâ€™s been going on in my head and let them know what Iâ€™ve been thinking about and how Iâ€™ve been feeling, but Iâ€™ve done that once already, and nothing has changed, and nobody has even texted me since. So now Iâ€™m just sitting here frustrated, thinking about how all Iâ€™m doing is sitting around in a household that I hate, waiting for something to change. FUCK.
