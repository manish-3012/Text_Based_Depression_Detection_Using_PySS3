I respect COVID I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m making this but here we go.    
Iâ€™m not saying I like the virus or enjoy quarantine but I respect like a general would respect an enemy for being very strategic. I am very impressed by how well it evolved to become a very infectious disease but not as life threatening. I know I will get downvoted to hell for saying idk Iâ€™m bored.
