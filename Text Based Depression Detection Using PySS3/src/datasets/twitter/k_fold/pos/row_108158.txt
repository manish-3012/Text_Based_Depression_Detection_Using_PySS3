People need to see the truth ðŸ‘ Iâ€™m trying to say no matter what peopleâ€™s beliefs are you shouldnâ€™t need to judge. Just because somebody decides not to wear a mask in public doesnâ€™t means its morally wrong. Just because somebody supports and doesnâ€™t  support the BLM organization doesnâ€™t mean that its morally wrong. Just because someone doesnâ€™t support and does support LGBTQ doesnâ€™t mean its morally wrong. Just because someoneâ€™s an atheist or they believe in another religion doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re morally wrong. Just because someone has different political opinions doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re morally wrong. And just because someone decides not to get vaccinated and not doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re morally wrong. And theyâ€™re are many other issues people judge upon. All opinions arenâ€™t intended to disrespect you. But arguing your opinion with someone isnâ€™t the best solution either. What Iâ€™m trying to say is that no matter what someone believes in doesnâ€™t mean that you should make fun of them. And that youâ€™re inferior to them. What makes it bad and morally wrong is that people have to judge each other when we should be spreading love not hate. But just because you all  focusing on the negative side and and are fighting for your opinion isnâ€™t the point.  What Iâ€™m saying  is donâ€™t judge someone upon  there beliefs unless itâ€™s physically and mentally going to hurt you and is morally wrong and evil. Iâ€™m not trying to make no point Iâ€™m just trying to inform. Thatâ€™s my message. Period.
