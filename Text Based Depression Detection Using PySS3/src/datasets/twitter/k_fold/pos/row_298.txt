Hey guys! I want to make something (digitally) for my friend because she has been feeling down lately and she helped me get through 2020 so itâ€™s the least I can do. She likes yellow, because it reminds her of happiness so I want to incorporate lots of yellow in it. She has been going through some stuff and I feel like she hates herself even more for it. She is depressed (like most of us are). I want to make her something digitally that she would appreciate. Do you guys have any ideas? I have all Adobe digital programs so throw them at me
