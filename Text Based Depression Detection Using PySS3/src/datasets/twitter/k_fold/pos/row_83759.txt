Does anyone know how to make a teams meeting with friends on a school account? My school is using teams for classes and I'm terrified of video calls (always have been). I want to practice with some friends so I don't die when class starts, since they require cameras be on, but I can't figure out how to create a meeting with people other than teachers. Anyone know how to?
