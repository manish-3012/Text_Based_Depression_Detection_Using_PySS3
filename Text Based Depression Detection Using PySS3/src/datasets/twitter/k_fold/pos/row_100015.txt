My half-sister tested positive for covid-19 I'm kinda lowkey fucking mad right now because she didn't take necessary precautions before she went to get tested and now I'm afraid I have covid. I sneezed twice this morning and haven't since so I don't know what to make out of this situation other than I'm not letting anyone in my room until I get tested and my results come back. I'm guessing my mom probably has covid too because she sleeps in the same room as my half-sister.  bruhhhh
