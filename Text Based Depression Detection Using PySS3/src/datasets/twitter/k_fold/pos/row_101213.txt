Schools making us run the mile is stupid Idk how it is in other countries or states, but in my highschool they make us run one mile, even outside of school. What's the point? It's not going to affect my grade if I don't beat my previous time. Sure schools want us to make sure we are healthy, but I still don't get it. I'm fine with other things in gym, because I actually like that class. It's just a waste of time. If I want to get fit and run a mile, I can do.it by myself
