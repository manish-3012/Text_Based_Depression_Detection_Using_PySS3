I kinda miss her but.... So there's this girl I've been texting with for almost a year now.About half a month ago we stopped chatting,or rather I stopped messaging her.The thing is that I had the tendency to get semi depressed whenever we stopped chatting to each other for a few days after weeks of constant texting or when the reality struck me that we'll probably never meet irl.
About 20 days ago she texted me just to check if I'm okay and I did kinda "run away" from longer chatting that time.I do kinda feel bad for doing that and I don't want her to feel that I got bored of her.Then again how am I suppose to explain my problem to her ._.
After all we weren't chatting for almost a month so how am I supposed to approach this situation or maybe I should just let this relationship be ?
