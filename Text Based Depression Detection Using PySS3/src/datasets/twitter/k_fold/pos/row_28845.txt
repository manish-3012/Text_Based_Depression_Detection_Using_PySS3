Well Iâ€™m sure they had their reasons.. maybe Just remembered the time that my school went on lockdown for an hour because of a bomb threat.. instead of evacuating. Iâ€™m sure the school was under a lot of pressure and decided to follow their own procedures but if there was a bomb.. it would have been in the school.
