Just confronted my parents about them having sex So Iâ€™m the oldest of 2 siblings, and my parents are still fairly young. For the last 2 years-ish, Iâ€™ve noticed them having sex loudly. Itâ€™s not that they moan or anything, they just make thumping noses, and it makes it difficult for me to sleep. 

Tonight I confronted them before bed, asking them if they could take it easy at night. It was somewhat awkward for me, but Iâ€™m pretty close with my parents, so I was able to communicate my issue easily. 

I thought it was strange, cause this would be the first time theyâ€™ve ever revived a complaint about having sex, and it was from their own son nonetheless. 

So yeah. Tonight was interesting to say the least. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
