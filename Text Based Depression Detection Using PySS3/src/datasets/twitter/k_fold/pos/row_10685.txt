I need your advice, my dad regrets having me So Iâ€™m busy studying and then I check my phone. Literally once in the last five hours. And my dad comes in, and shouts, â€œARE YOU TEXTING?â€ And I kinda lose it and shout back â€œNO Iâ€™M LITERALLY NOT, STOP ITâ€, because this isnâ€™t the first time and I have this terrible noise sensitivity. 

I think that was his breaking point because I heard him talking to my mom saying he regrets having us and is in a bad situation, and thinks we only use him for his money and donâ€™t love him. He gets stressed easily and work has been tough for him, heâ€™s never been talkative or anything to me either, but I used to sleep I his room until I was like 12 because he was super attached to me. I used to hate him then for those reasons and act loving but now I genuinely love him. I hugged him, but he just kinda... didnâ€™t do anything and tried to push me away. What do I do?
