I messed up So I started dating this guy the other day because he was really sweet and I thought it would be nice. Yall lied, this craps so dang overwhelming. But don't get me wrong, he's a great guy. He has cute nicknames for me and tells me I'm pretty and all that stuff that yall want so bad but oh my gosh I don't know how to take it. I can't make myself be okay with it. He tells me he loves me and my first thought is 'ok???' I don't know how to talk to him without feeling like I'm projecting a certain image

Yall how do I break up with a guy after two days I feel bad for even having to ask but this is my last resort. I didn't even mean to get in the relationship in the first place because I can't say no.
