My school is making me go back to school even when they know I've come into contact with someone with COVID-19 So on Wednesday my PE teacher asked my whole class if we have come into contact with someone who had COVID-19, I have twice, but they ar emaking me go back to school when I'm supposed to quarantine for 2 weeks, I've been home for a day, this is bullshit
