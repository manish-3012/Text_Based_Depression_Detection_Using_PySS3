Help me please i'm a dumb guy I sent a flirtatious message to a my best friend just for fun, more or less like this "so, when will we travel together to my bed?", expecting something like "anytime, hottie", because that's just how i talk with my girl friends. She saw the message and didn't reply, so maybe she thought i was serious? How can i shrug this off without being cringe?
