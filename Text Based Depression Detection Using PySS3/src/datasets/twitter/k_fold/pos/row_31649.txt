You know what would be cool? Some origin episode of The Mandalorian's first bounty hunt when he was younger. He's in school, and the teacher sends him on a quest to find the kid who went to the bathroom 15 minutes ago. And yes, it'll be a 40 minute episode.

I feel like a lot of the episodes of Season 2 were him going on little side quests, so it only makes sense, I guess.
