I hate my school No matter how "good" my board of education claims we are handling the pandemic, we're not. Almost 180+ students went home in a single day, my favorite teacher had to transfer hospitals + in the icu + on a ventilator, and my best friend just got it meaning imma have  to quarantine. I thought when that many students left, we would close school but NO! I can't understand how stupid people can be over this
