WELP! ITâ€™S JUST AN ACCIDENT. So recently I had my class in MS Teams. I was called for a recitation and forgot to mute my mic, and then I watched Lady Gagaâ€™s National Anthem Song performance in Youtube and played it out loud. Only to realize that I am not in mute when my instructor says â€œWhy is Lady Gaga singing in this classâ€ and got me muted. Now I donâ€™t know how to redeem myself on his next class. I am really embarrassed.
