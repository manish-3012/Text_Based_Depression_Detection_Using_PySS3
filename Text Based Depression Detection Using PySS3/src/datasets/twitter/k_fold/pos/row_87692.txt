Can I please catch a break God I wish I could catch a break every once in a while. just the other day my leg hurt so bad out of no where I had to miss school, and because of that I have to download and print my homework for my algebra class. I cant just write it out on a normal piece of paper because its graphing and I cant hand draw a graph, and I have 0 graphing paper. So I try printing the page and after 10 minutes of trying to print 2 pages of homework I have to fully reset my printer, after I do that I try to print it again. AND NOW IT JUST WONT PRINT. I do all the in app bullshit and fuss with it for 30 minutes and nothing pops up on the actual printer. SO NOW I HAVE 0 WAY OF DOING MY WORK. Its 5:30 am on a Sunday and I just want my math homework to print, but NOooooOOOOoo I have to deal with this printer bullshit. I hate this new printer so much because it takes an hour or 2 for 1 fucking page of paper.
