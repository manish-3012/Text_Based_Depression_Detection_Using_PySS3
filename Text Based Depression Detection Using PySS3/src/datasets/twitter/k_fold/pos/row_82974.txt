Because of my nationality I can't buy bop it For some backstory, I had a bop it smash when I was like 6 or 7 that I recently found that broke, but they don't produce them anymore(I think) so I can't buy it from any store, so I tried buying it from some random guy on the internet, but the only seller sells one of those scams where they put only on the description that it's broken and nowhere else, so after almost getting scammed I tried buying it from ebay (ps: I'm not from a English speaking country so that's why that wasn't my first option) but the shipping taxes + price were like R$150(way more than 150 noodles since each noodle costs R$0,70)

So basically I can't buy my bop it smash for Christmas cuz of taxes that I got just for living on the other side of the planet

I decided to buy a bop it tetris instead since it's just R$99 without taxes (I'm going to pay the taxes and my dad will pay the toy itself as a Christmas gift)

Maybe next year I can bop some shit up with my bop it smash
