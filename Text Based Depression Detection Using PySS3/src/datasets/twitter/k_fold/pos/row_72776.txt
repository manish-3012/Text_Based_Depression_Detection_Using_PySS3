What should I draw. Because I am lazy and canâ€™t think right now I am asking Reddit. I was wondering what kind of art people would want on shirts and stickers (I run a shop). Please no copyrighted or porn nsfw stuff, gore is fine. Iâ€™ll tell yâ€™all if I pick your idea, Iâ€™ll be putting them on [my shop](https://kaylynnsartstudio.threadless.com) if they turn out nice. Thanks so much!
