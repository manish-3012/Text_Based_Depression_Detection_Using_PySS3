Iâ€™m getting off of Reddit for a while Iâ€™m so sick of this platform as a whole. Iâ€™m sick of people hating me for being a Republican, being called a Karen for not wearing my mask in the car, being called a nazi for supporting Trump, being racist for not supporting BLM and being shut down when I say anything good about cops or if I try to defend them. Iâ€™m sick of it all. Until all of this blows over, I wonâ€™t be online that much at all. Not that any of you care anyway, but I just wanted to say a couple things. Sorry for the rant
