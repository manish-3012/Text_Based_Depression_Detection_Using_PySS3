I fucked up by having "single" on my instagram bio So, i basically put that there because if a girl would have a crush on me, she would know that im single.

Today, however i went to the computer class, and there are a few people (there is only boys in that class) that have always made fun of me.

So apparently someone found out that i have the text "single" on my instagram. (i have not even told them that i have an instagram account) So they bullied me the next 1 hour and 30 min because of that. 
Its embarassing af what do i do help!!!
