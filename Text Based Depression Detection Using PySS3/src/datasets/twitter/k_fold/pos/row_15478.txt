How can I make friends? I'm an autistic 14-year-old male living in the U.K. I live in a really, really strict group home, and attend a teeny tiny special school that nobody attends. I don't have any friends in real life, but so many fake friends online that come and go and I never form actual connections to. I'm also an orphan and don't have a family. The other three kids in the home I just don't really like. I tried stalking the kids who attended my primary school on Instagram but just struggled to start DMing them. I've tried Meetup but it's 18+ so I lied about my age and I'd be by far the youngest there which would feel weird. I'm pretty much stranded in loneliness.
