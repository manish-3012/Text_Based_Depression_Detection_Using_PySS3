Posting about my day: Day 2 My depression is getting worse. I scratched at my arms with my fingernails because my parents hid all of the sharp things. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™m trying to think of one positive thing each day, so, Iâ€™m working on ukulele. I think Iâ€™ll post some of the covers Iâ€™ve been working on. Goodnight &lt;3
