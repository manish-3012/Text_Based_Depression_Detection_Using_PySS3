I know this seems stupid and nobody cares but Iâ€™m actually going to dress nice for once and Iâ€™m stoked So today I realized that Iâ€™m 15 and I still wear the same clothes as I did when I was 13. And itâ€™s all just t shirts and sweatpants. So I was like â€œok you know what? Next week is picture day and my excoriation has gotten better and my arms donâ€™t look like a murder scene anymore, so Iâ€™m just gonna go all out and borrow my momâ€™s Calvin Klein jumpsuit with short sleeves. And heck, Iâ€™ll cut my own hair, too. And why donâ€™t I wear makeup for the first time, too?â€ I know it seems stupid cuz it seems like a pretty normal thing to dress nice sometimes but honestly I canâ€™t remember the last time I tried to do that so Iâ€™m pretty excited lol
