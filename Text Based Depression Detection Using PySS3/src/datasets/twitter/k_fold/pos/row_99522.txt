I just want a a girl who will wear my sweatshirt And curl up on the couch with and watch a scary movie (or a romcom) and in the morning she wakes me up with coffee in bed and a kiss and then we go and have a picnic in the park before sitting up late watching the stars, sitting on the roof, her head on my shoulder.
