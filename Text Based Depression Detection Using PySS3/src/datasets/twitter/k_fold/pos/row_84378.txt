me and my "friend" havent talked in 11 days And this shit is super fucking annoying. I always need to text first, or we literally don't talk unless she does a story reply. Whenever we do talk, the conversation is short lived, and she takes her sweet goddamn time to respond to me. Eventually she'll say she has to do something or stop responding to me which pisses me off (randomly not responding, not her needing to do something). I've always asked her if she could start convos with me more and she always says sorry and then gives me a dumbass excuse. I'm starting to think their lies just so she can avoid me. The last time we talked was October 29th and i said something like "still wanna watch that movie on halloween? also why u sleep so much" (i said that last bit as a joke, cuz it was like 6am and i was still awake) and she left me read. I hid my story from her, so if she ever does start a convo w/ me its not due to a story reply. But anyway yeah, i just wanted to rant
