My job is fucking killing me Iâ€™m currently working as a dishwasher racking in around 30ish hours a week and it is killing not only my body, but my mental health, and my grades.
Here is my current schedule
Mon-Thursday 
Wake up and get ready 5:15-6am
Drive to college 6am-7am
College 7-9 am
Drive from college to my high school 9-10am 
Highschool 10 am to 3:40 pm

Work schedule Tuesday Wednesday Friday Saturday 4pm- 11pm 



Itâ€™s taking a mental toll on me, and ideas for jobs that I could do from home or that may be a bit less killing me? 
I make $400-$500  every 2 weeks, Iâ€™ve worked there for 2 months, and literally only have $500 to show for it (Ive finally dialed it down to like no expenditures besides gas and spotify premium). 
I have a 3d printer (ender 5 plus), I am really good at A/V stuff, and I love photography, so Iâ€™m open to any and all Ideas.
