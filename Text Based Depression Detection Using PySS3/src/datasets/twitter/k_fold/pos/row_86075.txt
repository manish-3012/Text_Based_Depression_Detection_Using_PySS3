Halloween Costumes As some one who makes there own Halloween costume every year i have already started construction on a Hazmat suit out of yellow rain ponchos. Also for my candy basket I have some connections who can get me an actual bio hazard sticker to put on a spray painted expanded polystyrene cooler.

What are you doing for Halloween Costume this year?
