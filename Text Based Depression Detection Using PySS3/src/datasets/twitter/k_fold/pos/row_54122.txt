I'm gonna die alone so I plan to kill myself on January 12 2021 I'm done. I've tried all I can and nothing works.  I've tried losing weight but I physically cant due to some medicines. I don't know what else to do. I'm not expecting someone to like me for being nice or shit like that. I want to meet someone and create a bond and want to spend all of my time with them and feel loved for a change dammit. So I've given up.
