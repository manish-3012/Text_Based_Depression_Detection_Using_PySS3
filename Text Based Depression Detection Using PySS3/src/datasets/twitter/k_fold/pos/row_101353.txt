How I scammed a pedo So, I was watching a channel called nexpo in which he uncovers a website with ya know pedos. It piequed my interest and of course I headed into the website, using a vpn and on tor browser. I used a fake account , within minutes I got many messages from them. A guy asked me for pictures, I told him that if send it only if he gives me rainbow six siege ( all my friends play it and my parents didn't want to get it), I created a new steam account(For obvious reasons) and he gifted it to me on the new account after which I blocked him lol.
