I feel like I fail at everything and Iâ€™ll never find a hobby/talent. All I want is to be able to sew, crochet, macrame, or knit and I canâ€™t do any of that. I try so hard and fail each and every time. Itâ€™s awful. I can sort of draw, but thatâ€™s not really what I want. I want to make something like a stuffed animal or a blanket but I canâ€™t do it. If I were to count how many times Iâ€™ve cried over this Iâ€™d say maybe twice a day. I just want to know why I canâ€™t be good at any of the things I want to be good at. Iâ€™ve practiced, watched tutorials, and tried at these multiple times but Iâ€™ve never had success. I see people online making wonderful creations, but I can barely do a slip knot or sew 2 pieces of fabric together. ):
