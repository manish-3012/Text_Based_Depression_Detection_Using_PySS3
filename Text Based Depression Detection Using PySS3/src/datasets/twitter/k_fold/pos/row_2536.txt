Dear friend #2 I'm sorry I know recently I've been kind of rude and distant and it isn't purposeful. I'm a nervous wreck and I'm constantly dreary but shouldn't be rubbing that off on you considering stuff your dealing with. It doesn't help that you tried to end it and I'm sorry. I truly am. I would say it directly but I'm a wuss so if you know who you are then you know. Stay safe my friend and I'm sorry
