istg this boy keeps staring at me and I hate it so before lockdown ii this boy in my class kept staring at me and yesterday was the first day back and he's still doing it?? my friends couldn't decide if it was me or them but it eventually become obvious it was me &lt;/3

the thing is, he's the literal Nazi of the class. like he hates communism, loves capitalism, thinks equality already exists, hates BLM with a passion etc. so he has no friends because his beliefs are so extreme.

also I'm annoying and ugly af? what does it say about me if the fucking fascist of the class stares at me? and when I turn round and he's just staring at me he doesn't even bother to turn away and just makes awful eye contact I hate this so much.
