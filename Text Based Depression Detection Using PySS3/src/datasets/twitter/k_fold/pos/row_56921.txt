I lately feel like, finishing highschool, that my childhood and early teens were just empty, a void During quarantine I stumbled on many things like songs or old cartoons that were around during my childhood, you know the typical Gen Z stuff. I see other people saying how happy they were at those times and talk about those great and fun memories. Like talking about nostalgia and stuff. While that happens to me in a smaller extent, most of the times it comes with a feeling big regret for not participating in these stuff .Though I was in a position to have all of that, my family was a supportive and school went good. However, the emptiness I feel when remember my childhood and early teens is immense. 

Like everybody did something and I didn't. I never played any video games until I was 15 and bought a ps4. In primary school I was mostly a loner so I made new friends in middle school, who are great great dudes but our friendship does not go any deep. Like very very few parties and shit, no Minecraft nothing to connect with other people. In highschool it started getting a little better but studying never let it blossom. 

Now I'm finishing high school, fucked by stress and I feel those years were so so empty, like missing out on many great things. Idk I may be exaggerating but I hope this community will provide with some feedback
