Here's a thing I don't get. Why tf don't people eat the pizza? If you eat the crust, then you're good in my book. But if you don't eat the crust...why.

It's a piece of the crust. Hell if you got a garlic crust its like piece of garlic bread. 

Like why don't you eat the crust? Its got nothing wrong with it. It's a piece of the crust. Nothing is different with it.
