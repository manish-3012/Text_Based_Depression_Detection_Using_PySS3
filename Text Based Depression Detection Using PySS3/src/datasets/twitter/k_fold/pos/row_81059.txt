Hello fellow teenager, how u guys doing? I hope u doing great. Uhhh quick question? So a student doesnt goes to online school for a whole week because of stress, and sleep deprivation because he is having trouble. After a week he decides to go to the classes, when he goes to the first one, and apologizes for not going to school because of stress, and the teacher says "I also have stress, and I always show up". Does a student have an excuse to get fucking angry?
