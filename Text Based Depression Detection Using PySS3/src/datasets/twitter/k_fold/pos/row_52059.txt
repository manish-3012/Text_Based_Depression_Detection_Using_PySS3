Is it all calories in VS calories out? I mean I eat all sorts of junk food, from ice creams to brownies to protein bars and healthy stuff from fruits to chicken to nuts and berries trail mixes.
Still I lose weight.
Is it because I eat everything but at the end of the day, stay under 700 calories only?
