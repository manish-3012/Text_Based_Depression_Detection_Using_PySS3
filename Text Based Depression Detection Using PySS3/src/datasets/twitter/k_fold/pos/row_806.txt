TW I should be getting better but I'm not :( the past few months iv had lots of suicidal thoughts and really high anxiety but yesterday I got a gf and I was soo happy and thought that I want to live , the whole day I was smiling.
but most of today my anxiety has been higher than ever and i heard she had a bad day it made me feel really bad and guilty so I ended up peeling my skin off with some sciccors why am I like this I should be happy just now is this normal?
