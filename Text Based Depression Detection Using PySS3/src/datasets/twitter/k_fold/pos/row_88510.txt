I MESSED UP, BIG TIME I payed no attention throughout any of my 3 classes this quadmester (my school is doing quadmesters instead of semesters due to COVID-19) and now I have about 15-20 assignments to finish by the 29th of this month, across my English class, civics class, and careers class, including multi-page essays, worksheets, analyses, etc...

WHAT DO I DO???
