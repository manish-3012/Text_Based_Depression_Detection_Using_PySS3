I am 17M and turning 18 soon. Should I delete the nudes of all the girls I have in my eyes only This is a very fucking weird post. Also I typed this on my phone so thereâ€™s probably spelling errors. Also forgive me for my weird name, I made this quick account to ask questions about ap exams and other shit when it was online but then this site actually seemed aight so I just kept it)

So basically I gathered up a bunch of nudes From girls when I was in high school (Iâ€™m still in high school Iâ€™m a senior this year). I donâ€™t really know why why I originally started collected them but it turned to a competition between me and my friends and so far I have the most ( 60ish nudes). My friends arenâ€™t 18 so they arenâ€™t deleting theirs and I donâ€™t wanna delete all of them cuz it kinda holds a sentimental value from the difficulty of keeping them (sent to principal every week checking my phone and my friends so I had to send it to different phones and make multiple Snapchat accounts â€” that was from a drugs issue tho because my dumbass friends kept pics of them doing weed with dab pens in my dorm room (Iâ€™m in a boarding school))

Anyways, I donâ€™t even like jack off with them Or anything I just like having them cuz itâ€™s a competition and I had to go through a fuck ton of shit for these. Also itâ€™s like a chad move kind of you know,

Also I got most of these consentually (like 45) and the others came from my friends before it became a competition (in total we definitely have over 100...also these arenâ€™t 100 different girls itâ€™s just 100 pic, some girls might have 2 or 3)

I know Iâ€™m gonna get downvoted a shit ton cuz this seems like a very fucked up thing to do for the normal person and to be fair it is.  I just want advice from someone who isnâ€™t in my friend group and wouldnâ€™t be too judgmental.
