Please help I have an assignment I have to do for my AP French class. I have to listen to a conversation and submit a recorded, spoken response on the AP website. There is no other option, and I have until tonight to turn it in. Personally, I do not feel comfortable recording myself, and I especially do not feel comfortable submitting it, even if its on a trustworthy site. I have a high A in the class, but if i skip this, it will probably bring me down to a mid B. That doesn't sound like much, and I don't care about having a B (especially in a college-level class), but my parents will probably keep harassing me about it even after its too late to do anything, since they expect me to be perfect in every way, regardless of how I am doing mentally. Should I skip it?

Also, I have about two weeks until the quarter ends and my grades reset
