A potentially serious concern for me I've been raging a lot lately. 



I'm constantly finding myself swearing and nearly hitting objects around me while playing games.



Granted I do suck sometimes but I've never raged on something as simple as that and I find myself constantly being ticked off by small things as well.


This might mess with me in the future and I don't want that to happen, so how can I help with my mountain shattering rage?
