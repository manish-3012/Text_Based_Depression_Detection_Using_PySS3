Females of reddit... How tf do you tie your hair up? Just started growing out a man bun and Iâ€™ve tried doing a top bun and just tying it at the back, and itâ€™s really heckin hard. Honestly I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m supposed to tie it up with, thereâ€™s like 20 different kinds of clip.

If anyone could tell me, possibly before Thursday cause Iâ€™ve got rowing and it helps have to have my hair out of my face.
