Do rapists deserve torture? Please read below before commenting! Hello!

So me and couple of my friends got in an argument about what rapists deserve I said death, but they also said torture and torture like cutting of fingers and shit. Now before you downvote me to hell please let me explain myself.

Now my dad was a rapist, but that doesnt excuse me. My mom died in childbirth and my dad was the only one I had cause my sister didnt talk to anyone cause dad raped her. Now I hated my dad, but I wouldnt torture him. 

So now imagine:
The only person that u love for example your whole family is dead and u only have ur son/daughter and he turns out to be a rapist. Now would u torture him? Hear him scream? Cut off his fingers? If u dont imagine u could then why do other rapists deserve it? 

Tell me if u have thoughts about that.
