Predicting some sort of reptile/amphibian catastrophe for 2021. Today, I encountered a poisonous giant toad for the first time ever. A neighbor told us that there was one lurking around the neighborhood, and it just so happened to come scratching at my window on New Yearâ€™s Eve. 

Secondly, a lizard thatâ€™s been hiding in my house and that Iâ€™ve been trying to catch to let free for two months has finally reappeared a few hours after midnight. I have no idea how this thing survived underneath a bathroom cabinet for that long, but it did.

Both these creatures have proven themselves as powerful, and may be a sign that 2021 wonâ€™t be the saving grace that we are all expecting.
