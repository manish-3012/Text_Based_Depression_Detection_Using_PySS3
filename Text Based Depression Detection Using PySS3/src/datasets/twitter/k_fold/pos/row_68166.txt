Aah shit! Looks like I'mma be virgin my Entire Life. So for the last 10 months I've been trying to get a girlfriend and till now I've broken up with 7 girls. Not that I'm tryna brag about it or anything. It's just that I can't seem to find the right girl.

For me having a girlfriend means quite a lot. It holds a very high value. For me GF is someone whom you can trust on and could literally tell anything that's on your mind and could sometimes even ask for her shoulder to put your face on and feel embraced during the hard times.

And as you call tell by now Yup I'm an Introvert. 

I've been alone for most of my life so I don't actually know how to communicate with strangers or how to flirt or how to get the conversation going. So most of my conversation start getting dry in 3 or 4 days or so and then the conversation starts becoming more drier and drier and them boom  suddenly all of the tension that I try to build just gets nuked and then they walk away. And that shit really slaps my ass and I get sad and start feeling pitty on myself.

At this point I don't even know YTF am I even trying to get a girl. It's just fucking sad shit.
