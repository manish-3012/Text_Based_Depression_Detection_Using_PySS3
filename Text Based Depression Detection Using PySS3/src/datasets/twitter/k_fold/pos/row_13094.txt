my friend is having an ego death (drug-related post) an ego death is when your soul is reborn or gets a hard reset on drugs. you forget who you are, where you are, you lose a sense of self, and you canâ€™t think clearly (btw my friend only took acid. lysergic acid diethylamide is completely safe, nobody has ever died from it)

anyways, he keeps saying random things to me every 10 minutes. he said a few very different thoughts and then he told me that he straight up pissed himself. he just now facetimed me and said â€œhey... did we do good?â€ â€œyesâ€ â€œdid it go smoothly?â€ â€œyes weâ€™re doing goodâ€ â€œ(his gfâ€™s name) loves meâ€ â€œyes, she doesâ€

and then he hung up. hahaha i wish my friend luck. heâ€™s gonna have a hard time explaining this in the morning
