I know you guys hate this sort of stuff but I NEED advice on this Early September, me and my girlfriend started â€œdatingâ€. Well we still havenâ€™t even been out on one date. We donâ€™t hug, kiss, or do anything that I would have thought we would do.

So our relationship needs fixing. But how? What can I do to achieve this?

And donâ€™t just tell me to end the relationship because it isnâ€™t working. I really like her and want to get closer to her. I just donâ€™t know how.

I really hate this. I just want it to get less awkward. But again, I donâ€™t know how. 

&gt;! Now Iâ€™m just gonna say some information I think is important: This is my first relationship, and her first relationship. I am a guy, she is a girl. We are both 15 and in the same class. We have been friends for 3 years. We do have zoom calls with each other, but others are often there too. !&lt;

I appreciate it if you read this, and would appreciate it even more if you tried to help me out. Thank you, and have a great day.
