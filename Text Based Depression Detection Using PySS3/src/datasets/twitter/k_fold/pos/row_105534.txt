I have the large confusion This is another post about that girl in my previous posts

She stayed at my house for a couple days during Thanksgiving break, and we watched a couple movies and played pokemon. While we were doing that, she kept putting her legs on one of mine and idk what that means since I've barely interacted with girls. She would also randomly hold my hand, like when we were watching the movies, standing in the backyard, or sitting on the trampoline. With her last relationship, I noticed that she would randomly hold the guy's hand then after that they started dating. (Before any of you comment about how weird that is, I've been friends with the guy and her for a while and she wanted to my follow her.) The part I'm confused about, is that a while ago, she said that it'd be better if we didn't date. She's also one of those people who likes physical contact. Like she's kissed her female friends on the lips before, but from what I know, she doesn't hold hands with them.

TL;DR: Girl is holding my hand and kinda sitting on me + she said we shouldn't date = confusion

Imma go to sleep, so I won't see any of the replies until the morning
