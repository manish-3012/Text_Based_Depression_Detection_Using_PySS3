Is it okay if I stay up 40-45 hours I seriously donâ€™t plan on spending anymore time than that, I just have a lot to do tmr and Iâ€™m too pumped to wanna sleep. Plus a lot I wanna do tonight, geez I just dont wanna sleep. Anyways Iâ€™ll make sure to have coffee on hand and this wonâ€™t interfere with anything. So is it safe and will there be any side effects if I do thatâ€™s be better if I just slept? Should I just try sleeping for like 4-5 hours?
