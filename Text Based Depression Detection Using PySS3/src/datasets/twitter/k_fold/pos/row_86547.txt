I fell asleep with headphones on and realised something when I woke up I fell asleep with headphones on, Spotify was playing some random songs I've never heard before. In my dream there was this monster or something called the junction. After I woke up I checked the songs that were played as I was asleep. One of which is called up the junction.

To be clear I'm not saying this is some kind of conspiracy where headphones read your mind or some crap. I mean as I was nearing the end of my dream, part of me must have been awake. And after the song said 'junction' it incorporated it into the dream.

Idk if this post is a massive waste of time but I found it interesting
