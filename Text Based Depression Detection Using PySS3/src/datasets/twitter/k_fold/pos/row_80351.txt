Can everyone please send a prayer My Pops got Covid. I'm really stressing since it got confirmed today and it hurts seeing my mom and dad in the situation they are in. I don't know how to say it but what I am trying to say is if anyone sees this please send a prayer to everyone who is infected wishing for them a speedy recovery.
