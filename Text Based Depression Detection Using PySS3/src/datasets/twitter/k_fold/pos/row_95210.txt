I hate uninvited guests They were like uhhh we are coming in an hours and we are gonna stay the night there. I would not be so annoyed even if they told us the night before that they were gonna stay the night but no they have to tell me an hour before arriving. And the worst part is that theg have to travel for 10 hours to get where I live. They could have also told us before they left their home but they had to tell us just an hour before arriving
