My family won't social distance Now, I know it's hard not seeing friends but this is a pandemic that's still raging. If you want to see friends without putting yourself or others then it's foolish and dangerous. My family acknowledge the virus, wear mask when shopping, and poke fun at those who won't but the moment a friend they invited comes over the only precaution they take is making sure it's well ventilated (half the time they do this though). They say it's fine and that it's not that big of a risk, they are careful, etc but they ruined all of that as soon as they decided they want to chat for a bit in a unsafe way.

This is a grievous hypocrisy and one that I feel threatens my life. I tried to tell them the unnecessary dangers that they take and I go "hey what about just texting/calling them?" But no apparently it makes you careful to put others at risk. I am sure a lot of those 34.5M people were careful and don't worry only 1M have died so far..


Thanks for the 2 people who read this and have a goodnight.
