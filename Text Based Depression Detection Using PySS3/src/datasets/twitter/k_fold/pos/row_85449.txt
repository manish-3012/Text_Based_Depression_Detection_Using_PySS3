Went on my phone after 90~ minutes of revision/study, but of course my mom had to walk in. I was doing some homework and revision since noon, and I decided to have a break, for 15 minutes, but my mom has to walk in and think I have been on there for the whole day, saying "you don't do any work" although I have done 80% of my homework. Giving me a 15 minute lecture on why I should do work, by shouting at me saying I am lying.

Now I don't want to study anymore.
