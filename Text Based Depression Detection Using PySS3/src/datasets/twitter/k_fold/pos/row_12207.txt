Does anyone with bad dandruff know how to get rid of it? So, Iâ€™ve got dandruff. My hair is pretty short (1-2 inches) but thereâ€™s so much flaky shit that just falls out of my hair every single day. Iâ€™ve tried 2 different dandruff relief shampoos and I use them often but itâ€™s still really bad and a couple people have commented on it. Do I have to get some prescription stuff? Is there something Iâ€™m doing wrong? Please let me know
