Today is 4 years since I lost my bestfriend to suicide. I'll never forget you, Peyton. I still love you. In the summer 5 years ago we met online and we immediately hit it off. Sparks were flying the second we said hello to each other. I didnt care that she was a girl too, I just loved her so so much. She was my bestfriend and my girlfriend, I guess. My first love. I remember being on the phone with her and when her dad asked her who she was talking to she said "My bestfriend." And later told me it wasnt a lie, because I wasnt just her girlfriend, I was her bestfriend. 

But our families didnt approve. My other tried to send me to a mental hospital when she found out I was dating a girl. Her family shamed her, along with her entire community for coming out. I got the same kind of retaliation. We were both shamed to hell for who we were. Our families turned their backs on us and ignore our desperate cries "Love me! Why dont you love me?!" 

I was used to it, my maternal family didnt give a shit about me, and my mother alienated my fraternal family from me so I was used to being alone. But she wasnt. And she couldnt take it. In December she told me she needed space to work things out on her own and heal. So she was going to distance herself. And I believed her. God, why did I believe her??? 

In February I pleaded for her to come back to me. We could figure this out, we could still be together, even if it was as friends, right? Nope... she told me she was starting to cut loose ends and that she wanted me to know she loved me, that she wished me the best, that she hopes one day I'll get the happy ending I've been waiting for, and she begged for me not to forget her. I was worried but I still didnt see it. How didnt I see it? The warnings seem to glare right back at me now. 

On March 18th I found a post on Instagram from her friend. It said how her friend needed some space after her friend Peyton killed herself 6 days prior. I trembled as I searched through her other friends instagrams to find the same thing. My heart sank to the core of the Earth. She was gone. My Peyton was gone. The world that has looked down upon us like we're diseased took her away from me. 

My mother never spared the opportunity to tell me it was all my fault. If I just supported her more, if I just texted more, if I called more, if i said "I love you" more, if I made more art, if I was just more I could have saved her. I still kinda believe it. I logically know it's not my fault but I still feel like if I was just *more* I could have saved her. But I'm working on it. I'm healing. But I know one thing for sure: I will give her her last wish for me, I will get better. I already got my happy ending, I found my dad again. But I will never ever ever forget her. I will be brain dead before I forget her. 

I just wanted to get that off my chest. Thank for listening.
