Interpret my dream? Idk I had a dream last night that I cannot stop thinking about, any advice would be appreciated. In my dream my FORMER crush and I were walking around an old barn together holding hands, and we were in love. I had super strong feelings for him in the dream, but in my real life I feel like I am over him. Thoughts???
