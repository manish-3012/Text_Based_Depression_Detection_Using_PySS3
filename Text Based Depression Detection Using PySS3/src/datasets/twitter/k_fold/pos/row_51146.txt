Is it worth a second try? There is a girl at school.I asked her out on Messenger during the fall break, but she wrote that she wonâ€™t really be home on during holiday. After that, it's worth trying or should I leave it. And sorry, I know it's probably sounds stupid that I asked that, but I don't know what to do.
