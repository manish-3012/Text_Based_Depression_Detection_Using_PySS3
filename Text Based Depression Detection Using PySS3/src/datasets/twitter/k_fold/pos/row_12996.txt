For those of you who need to hear this You are the most amazing man/woman on this earth, you are a truly special one of a kind human, there is no one like you and the one thing that is humans are good at, it's being perfect at being ourselves. No one and I mean no one is as perfect as you at being you. You deserve everything good that comes to you and all bad things that come your way it's only a minor road block on your way to developing to become the best most perfect you possible and that is what you are amazing at, being yourself. I can not stress this enough you deserve everything that happens to you, and if you don't believe me then just think about it, what horrible things have you done truly horrid things have you done to deserve the ultimate punishment? Not only that but you matter the most out of everything on this sphere we call earth, you matter just as much as everyone else as we are all equals. Have a good day/night/whatever the fuck time it is for you

TLDR:Read the fucken post dipshits I'm not putting a summary of something this short.
