I am absolutely fucked. In spanish class, we do kahoot every day. I, for some reason, was being an extreme dumbass on Thursday when we did kahoot last week. I put my name as "gagon cok". My spanish teacher got pissed. Tomorrow, she's going to go through all of our chromebooks to find out who did it. The only way for her to find out would be for her to hop into a kahoot with our chromebooks, one by one, and check our recent names. It's hidden from my recent names unless you put in the letter g, then it will be suggested. I'm hoping she doesn't find out.
