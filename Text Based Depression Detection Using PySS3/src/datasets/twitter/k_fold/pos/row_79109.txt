When a girl kicks a boy in the balls so hard one explodes and has to be removed (not in self defense but over some bullshit or for "fun"), how is that not at least as horrible, violating and wrong as rape? How is this not traumatizing for life? So why do series and movies CONSTANTLY portray it as funny, normal, deserved, no big deal, etc. when a girl kicks a guy there over some bullshit? HOW is this OKAY?
