I need tips on how to socialize during quarantine. The title of this post says everything you need to know. Whatever's written below is just extra context.

So, I started online school today. In an attempt to socialize and meet people, I made discord servers for each of my classes, along with an Instagram group chat for my entire grade.

Unfortunately, not many people joined the discord servers (but to be fair I was only able to advertise like two of them. I'll make a fair judgment once I promote all of the servers but I have a feeling that the results won't be much different). On the other hand, the Instagram chat was somewhat successful in terms of the number of people who joined, but is still pretty barebones overall as we've already run out of conversation topics and are just exchanging memes at this point.

Throughout the quarantine so far I've mainly been focusing on improving myself. I started a workout routine (I'm a skinny boi so I want to build some muscle), started listening to music (was never really a big fan of music until recently, when I realized that liking music is basically essential when it comes to socializing nowadays. So, I downloaded Spotify and started listening to some of my friends' recommendations along with some old classics. For those curious, my favorite genres atm are classic rock, pop, and hip-hop, and my favorite artists are Prince, Drake, The Weeknd, and Post Malone. I can safely say that I'm at least somewhat cultured now when it comes to music), started eating slightly healthier, adopted some hobbies such as writing, etc.

I did all of this in hopes that it would help me socialize more, and maybe even help me get a girlfriend. I've always been a relatively quiet kid and recently I've started feeling the urge to break out of my shell a little bit, but the quarantine is making it exceptionally difficult.

So, with all of that said, does anyone have any tips on how to socialize during quarantine?
