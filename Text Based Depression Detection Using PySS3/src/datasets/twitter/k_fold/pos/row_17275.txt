I'm breaking down, and I feel like shit. Someone online, who I thought was my friend online, ghosted me for a while. At first, I didn't think anything of it "hey, maybe she's just busy!" Then, I noticed she was posting on her account, so I kept trying to talk with her. No answer. Except for a dislike. I convinced myself it was nothing. Then, she made a subreddit. I joined, responded to her post. I thought it was cool! Then, she banned me for no reason. By this point, I felt like my confidence got shattered. She even made a post about the ban for mod advice. There, I asked what was going on. Again, no answer, just a dislike. Then, I just cried, and cried.

You don't understand, I've been struggling with people leaving me in the dust and taking advantage of my trust for a while. My own family and friends backstabbing me. Me and her connected a lot over stuff, and I really thought I found someone that got me, that would truly be there for me. Someone who's shoulder I could cry on. Someone who got what it meant to feel weak and alone. But now...it just feels like another one of those times where people hurt me. Goddamn. I can't do this anymore.
