This is a call for help My class in school is being forced to perform a tik tok dance and if i don't go then I'll get a bad grade and it counts as missing a class. And we have to do it in front of the whole school for 2 minutes, and it's the wap thing or something.

Oh and we have to dress up as foxes and get a fox tail wtf.

Please help me.
