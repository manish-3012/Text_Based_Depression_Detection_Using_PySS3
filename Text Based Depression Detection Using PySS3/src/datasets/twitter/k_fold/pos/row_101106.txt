Talking about random stuff: Day 96 I've gone down a rabbit hole of watching "Joker motivational quotes" videos. It may at first seem satire, but no, the channels full on preach this stuff and the comments are full of 8 year old edgelords. The shitty editing, the spelling errors, the terrible quotes that Joker didn't even say, it's so fucking funny to me for some reason. 

And the titles! Just amazing. For example: 

# "Joker motivational quotes - best motivation ever - bad boy quotes - fuck the fucking fuckers" 

# "15 EPIC BOYS QUOTES JOKER'S ULTIMATE QUOTES || QUOTES UPLOADER boy attitude quotes joker quotes"

and so on. The trap music and random joker images during the whole video doesn't make it look any better.

It's just amazing to me people try so hard to look so edgy.
