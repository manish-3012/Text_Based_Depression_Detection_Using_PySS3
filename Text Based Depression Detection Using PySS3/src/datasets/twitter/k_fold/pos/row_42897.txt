How do I reject someone nicely if I'm already dating someone? Lately I've notice that this girl in m class has been crushing over me pretty hard. I'm pretty sure that she's going to ask me out pretty soon, But I'm already in a pretty serious relationship, and i want to know how to tell the girl I'm not interested in her with out hurting her, any advice?
