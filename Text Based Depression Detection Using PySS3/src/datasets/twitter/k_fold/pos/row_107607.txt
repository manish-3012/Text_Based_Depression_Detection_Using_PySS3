So my aunts just banned the phrase "simp" in our house My aunts are stupid. 

Me and my cousins call each other "simps" as a joke around the house. No foul no harm 

However, today I called my little cousin a "simp" and my aunt got upset. Quick note before I continue, we're a black family. So my aunt went on about how "simp is a phrase used against black women to discourage them from showing love". 

Like, what the fuck? This is not a racially exclusive phrase. Everybody gets called a simp and if a celebrity is crying online about it, they need tougher skin. 

Anyway yeah, I can't say simp anymore because its racist against my own race? Stupidest shit I've ever heard
