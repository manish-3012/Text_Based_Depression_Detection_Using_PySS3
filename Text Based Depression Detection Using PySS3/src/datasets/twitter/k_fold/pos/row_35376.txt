Im so sick of apologizing for sh*t that I've never done, and never would do. Im angry at both sides of the argument right now. Whether its white racism against black citizens, or the mistreatment of natives, or misogyny, 

I am so f*cking tired of having to apologize for things I had no involvement in!!!

Misogynists, racists, and etc: Stop being such a garbage human being and grow tf up! Treat people with respect your human piece of filth! 

Victims of racism, sexism and etc: stop blaming people today for things that happened hundreds of years ago, or were done by people I have no connection to! 

I understand you're upset that those things happened, but it is NOT my fault. Its not my fault blacks were beaten, murdered, and discriminated. Its not my fault the Indians were near wiped out. Women, it is not my fault that you have unrealistic societal standards, and you are treated horribly! 

I do not do those things, never have, and never will. I have apologized for the people who did do it, because I want to help you all, but it makes me feel like garbage when I get treated like sh*t for things I had NO INVOLVEMENT IN!!! 

Stop getting pissed and being horrible to people who don't deserve it. I am sorry you were treated horribly, but im done apologizing for those things. 

All of the slave owners are dead. everyone who mistreated the natives are dead. Its over and done with. So just shut the hell up already.
