I made my dad cry My familyâ€™s been in a rough spot since 2019, I had to drop out of school in my final year, I was 16. I never thought Iâ€™d be able to write my igcse finals because we missed the date for the first intake (may/June 2020). But in July dad surprised me and told me Iâ€™d be writing Oct/Nov. I only had 2 months to prepare and to teach myself a yearâ€™s worth of work. It was hard and I had so many mental breakdowns but today we got our results.
I passed!
I cried so hard, my parents cried too. They told me they were proud of me. My dad, who never sheds tears, cried because of me.
Now Iâ€™m 17 and Iâ€™m unofficially a high school graduate. 
I just really felt like sharing because of how proud I am. I never thought Iâ€™d be able to get good enough grades on my own. I did that!
