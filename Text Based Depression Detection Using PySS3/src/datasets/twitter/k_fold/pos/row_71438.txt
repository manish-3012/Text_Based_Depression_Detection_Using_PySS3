Oh shit I feel so bad. I decided to make a smoothie with a glass that had just came from the dishwasher so it was a little wet. I walk into the living room ready to spend the next 10 minutes in pure bliss but the glass slips out of my hand, which ment when it hit the floor it splattered everywhere, on the dog, on my sister, on the carpet and worse of all, the light grey wall. Long story short the wall has water stains o it and a liitlw but of the old paint is showing through and now I'm on the floor having a panic attack.
