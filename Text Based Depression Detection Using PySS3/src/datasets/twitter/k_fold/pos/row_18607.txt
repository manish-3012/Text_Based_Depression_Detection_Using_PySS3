I hate my stepbrother and his fucking treadmill We live in a 1800's house in the middle of nowhere with very nice trails all around that go into the woods and around beautiful wheat fields, but my stepbrother prefers to stay in his room playing video games all day and "run" with all his 110 kg on a treadmill on the second fucking floor, which is so deformed I don't now how it hasn't collapsed yet, when we are all home trying to relax or watch some tv.

(Sorry for the bad english)
