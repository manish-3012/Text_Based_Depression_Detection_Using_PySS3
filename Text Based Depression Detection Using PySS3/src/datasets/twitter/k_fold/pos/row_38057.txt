Does this girl like me? So thereâ€™s is this girl that is always staring at me from a distance and when I look her way she looks the other way. Whenever I talk to her she is always starts giggling out of nowhere and doesnâ€™t make eye contact. Today the most strange thing happened where I came up to her to say hi and she accidentally hit herself hard on a pole and instead of being in pain she just said â€˜ouchâ€™ while giggling as if she doesnâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening while I said â€œare you okayâ€. She is normal when she talks to other people I think from what Iâ€™ve seen. Can someone help me understand this chick?
