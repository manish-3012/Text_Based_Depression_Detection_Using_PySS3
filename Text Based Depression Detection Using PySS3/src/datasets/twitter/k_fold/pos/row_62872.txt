I think I have realized somewhat why straight people seem a lot dumber than gay people Sexuality doesn't rly have a direct effect on intelligence or how logical a person thinks. But I believe there are a lot of indirect effects that benefit gay people in different ways.

1. You have to be above a certain level of comprehension to realize you are gay, instead of being straight by default - it's hard to explain but basically you are "in the loop" if you are gay, there's a lot of people who are sadly just "filler" in the world and are basically like video game NPCs except they aren't in the story at all, they're just fucking pointless, like people who think that burning 5G signal towers will prevent virus from spreading or some shit. Just people like that who are fucking lost, in the background, you can't interact with them and they're almost all straight because they probably think you will go to hell for kissing boys or some shit or they don't know what being gay is. 

2. Gay people don't have sex with the opposite gender, so they are forced to not make stupid decisions that straight people do by getting pregnant when they are underaged / can't afford it

3. Gay people know that they can't just hit up any guy and expect them to be gay and compatible in a relationship, so buy default they don't do stupid shit like getting rejected by 20 girls like straight guys, and they use dating apps more often which is the smartest choice these days.

4. Gay guys of course are interested in other guys, which is the most intelligent choice because males will get along best with males in friendships, so they will have less problems in relationships than straight people do

And yes there's just a lot of ways being gay is better which is good
