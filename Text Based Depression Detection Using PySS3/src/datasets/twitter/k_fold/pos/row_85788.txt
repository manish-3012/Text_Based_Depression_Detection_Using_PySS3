What do I do? I grew up in this strict Christian household where my dad and mom spurred on and on about religious stuff to me and my siblings. I only recently told them that I don't believe in god, and they still make these terrible efforts to try and convince me that the Bible is true.

Their beliefs has interfered with my education, and I am going to be 20 without my high school diploma because their unwillingness to put me in school and instead give me christian-based curriculum to ponder over and rely on myself and the internet.

I tried my best to get my license, but when I was 16 I had no money to take it. Now that I have a job, I lost my birth certificate and now I can't take my first driving test until 2022.

All of these fucking problems that make my life a living hell when I wake up, and try to convince myself I'm okay over, I try to quelm by having a good time with my friends. I like to drink with them too, all legal drinking like me of course, but more than I care to admit.

Sometimes I like to get drunk. I came home one night and my parents could smell alcohol. Today my mom asked me not to drink AT ALL.

My parents have only been a burden in my life, as much as I try to say to myself it's me that needs to get my shit together, I can't help but think I'll probably be happier if I was in college, on my own, with or without a license. Right now I have none of that, except depression and religious parents, which without saying go hand in hand for a young adult.

Is this a me problem? Or do I need to leave ASAP?
