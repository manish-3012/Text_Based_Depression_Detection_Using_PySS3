I feel like w piece of shit So I came out to my parents as trans.
I was hoping they would be supportive like anyone else I told but they weren't.
They said some shit about being confused and it just somehow the internet's fault because I haven't been getting enough real life exprince. 
I've had this feeling for years before the fucking lockdown and they just want to use it as an excuse to deny me.
And force me into situations they know would make it harder for me to be trans like work or uni since if meeting people thats more people to come out to. Its fucking ridiculous.
They cat like they are fucking being the bigger man in this but they are so goddamn pretty is unbelievable. And the worst part is because the internet is the only place I can voice my frustrations they act like that's the only reason I want to be trans. I want to fucking die
