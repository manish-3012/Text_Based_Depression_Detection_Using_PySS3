Embarrassing posts on my mom's Facebook account Guys, my mother added the teacher that I respect the most, the best teacher I ever had, on Facebook. My mother posts a lot of unironic r/im14andthisisdeep shit, not to mention the old, embarrassing pictures of me. Fuck. I always had in mind to grab her phone and block that specific teacher but I was too lazy to do it. Before you start calling me an asshole... Trust me, you don't know how much these pictures are embarrassing and how much it's bothering me and making me uncomfortable... Help?
