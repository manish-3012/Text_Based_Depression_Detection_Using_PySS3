I think my mom has a boyfriend This should be okay right? My parents have been divorced for about 2 years now, and my mom has had at least one BF since then that I know about. (I only found out about it because I saw a good night text on her phone once with heart emoji). I asked her about it and she said she was dating him.

My mom is very open and kind, so it shouldn't really bother me, right?? Anyways, today she went to a big lake in North Cali on a day trip, and I was in another city with my best friend. When I came back, I saw her car was still here, but she wasn't, so I was wondering how she got there. When she got back, I asked how it went and who she went with. She said it was good and that she went with a friend. Normally she would tell me which friend, but she didn't specify. I had a suspicion from that (also because she was dressed up) so I didn't press it. Also, a couple nights ago I heard her talking to a guy on the phone once I got out of the shower. She hung up shortly after I got out. I asked who it was and she said it was just a friend.

I don't know what to do. It's not like I can't bring it up because she is a good mom and likes to help me through things. I guess I just don't know if I want to. I shouldn't really care because 50% of marriages do end in divorce, so I'm obviously not a special case. I just feel sad about it...
