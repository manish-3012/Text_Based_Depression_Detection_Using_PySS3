The problem with schools education system. The curriculum is fucked. Itâ€™s designed around getting students to remember knowledge, and not learn it, which means youâ€™ll probably forget all of it within months. Plus, the information is all non-vital. Take this for example: I had Chinese class and we were learning how to say the names of different sports. (Keep in mind this is a required subject at my school.) We havenâ€™t learnt how to say â€œDo you speak English?â€ Or â€œWhere can I get a taxi?â€. Instead we have to learn this crap instead. If I ever go to China, Iâ€™m not going to walk up to people and say â€œMy favourite activity is swimming. Whatâ€™s your favourite activity?â€ Iâ€™m going to walk up to them and say â€œCan you get me directions?â€. Iâ€™ve tried talking to the teachers about this, and I get they canâ€™t change the curriculum, but I would like to focus on important things and learn in a memorable way. Another thing wrong with the system is the fact that teachers do not give attention to the middle to high class students. If you get straight As or straight Ds you will be noticed, but if youâ€™re a B student no one will pay attention to you. Rant over, thank you for reading.
