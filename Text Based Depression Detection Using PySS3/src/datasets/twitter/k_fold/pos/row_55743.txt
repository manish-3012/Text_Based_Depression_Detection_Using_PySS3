my parents are great today I was playing video games and my mom was going upstairs to sleep so she called me , I said :"hold up mom,I can't pause" and after I died in the game and said"nevermind I died in the game"and my mom had said "ooooo,it was bc of me? sorry son" but not in satirical way ,she was legit sad that I died in the game:D. BEST MOM EVER
