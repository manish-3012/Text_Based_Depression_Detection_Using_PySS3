Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 13: Dwight Eishenhower He was Allied Supreme Commander in World War Two and president during key times in the Cold War, but perhaps his hero status is exaggerated?

Despite his status as a war hero, not once has he seen battle. He was stationed at home in World War One and all of his work in World War Two was done in some city far away.

As president, it's not that he did a bad job, it's just that he avoided doing a good job. In the early 50's, America was dominated by the fears of Joesph McCarthy, who caused many innocent people to have their lives ruined under false accusations of being a part of the Communist Party, which isn't even a crime in the first place. Eishenhower did nothing to stop this, even though he was openly against it.

Speaking of Communism, he also signed into law the Communist Control Act of 1954, in which he (and nearly all of Congress) passed a law that removed 1st Amendment rights to anything or anyone deemed "Communist infiltrated." This, of course, is a direct violation of the Constitution since it is basically censorship with extra steps.
