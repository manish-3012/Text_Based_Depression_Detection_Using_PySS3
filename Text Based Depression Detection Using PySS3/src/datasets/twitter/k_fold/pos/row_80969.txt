Help needed for Research Topics Hi. I am 15m living in Singapore. My school requires me along with 3 others to do a Scientific Research project which it will fully fund.

 Can somebody give me any ideas, piece of advice, inspiration, currently researched topics or even where to find any of these so that I can get started?

I would appreciate any help I can get. Thanks so much as I am really lost.
