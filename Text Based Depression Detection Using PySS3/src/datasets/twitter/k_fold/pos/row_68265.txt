Today I sent my sister an image of something. Before you think I sent her a pic of my dick I didn't you sickos. Today I sent my sister an image of a little kid petting a furry that looked convincing enough to be a dog. She still thinks it was a dog and I don't wanna ruin it for her. 
Tldr: I sent a picture of a kid petting a furry to my sister and she thinks it's a dog.
