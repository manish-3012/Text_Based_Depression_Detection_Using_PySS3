stop touching me during a pandemic like yea it's not that difficult?? 

she was pulling my arm and yelling stuff like 'air air air' and her face was red... probably of embarrassment, I would also be embarrassed if I was acting like that in a grocery store. I just pushed her away and she dropped on the floor, typical karen making a scene. SMH
