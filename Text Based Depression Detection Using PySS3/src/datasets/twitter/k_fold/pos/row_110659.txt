Lucid dreams are the greatest thing ever. The other night, I had the most bizarre dream. When explaining it, it isnâ€™t as cool, but I was feeling genuine emotion in this one. So, there was this island. I was on the beach with some kid who Iâ€™ve never seen, had glasses and was nice. Maybe about 12-13. Anyways, weâ€™re talking for about 20 seconds and all the sudden the scene changed. 

I was all the sudden still on the island and was in this white suit, all dapper and shit, and there were these houses all around me. I think this was like a weird time skip or something, I dunno. I was in what looked like was like a small neighborhood. 

I was walking out of one of the houses and met up with the kid from earlier but he was older, Pyra from Xenoblade 2(donâ€™t know why, Iâ€™ve never played it), Ryoku from Kill la Kill(donâ€™t know why, Iâ€™ve never watched it), I think one of my real life friends, along with some other people I donâ€™t remember. I had an actual full interaction with them and I was in complete control.

I was genuinely very happy until I woke up and realized, â€œOh, I donâ€™t live on a deserted island with a bunch of cosplayers and we need to save the world. FUCK!â€ And that is why I love lucid dreams.

Before anyone asks, no I did not make any of this up. My brain just like to create these batshit crazy scenarios while I sleep. Itâ€™s awesome.
