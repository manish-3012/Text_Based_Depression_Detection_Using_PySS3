My mom: thereâ€™s nothing wrong with you, youâ€™re fine! Me: 

*literally feels like thereâ€™s people in my room watching me 24/7*

*used to believe there was somebody hiding in my closet*

*disassociation*

*literally has arguments with myself to the point it sounds like there are different people in my brain arguing with eachother*

*believes Iâ€™m dying everyday*

*mood can change so fast I act like a completely different person*
