Is there something wrong with me? Not too long a go I made a post about why I didn't understand why rape victims were traumatized. Being a rape victim my self, I wanted to see why these people were upset, and I was educated accordingly. 

There is still one more question I have to ask: Is there something wrong with me?

During the entire rape scenario, actually, *multiple* rape scenarios I've experienced, i kind of just went with the flow. I was five, and my cousins that raped me were probably in their late teens. There were two different scenarios, one at my place and one at my uncles place. 

I feel like I should be traumatized, but I don't care, and I hate it. I feel like I should care, but I just don't for some reason. It seems like all of the other victims had their lives ruined. Now don't get me wrong, i don't want my life ruined, but it I just want it to hurt a little bit. So I can convince my self I'm not in the wrong, and that I'm still human.
