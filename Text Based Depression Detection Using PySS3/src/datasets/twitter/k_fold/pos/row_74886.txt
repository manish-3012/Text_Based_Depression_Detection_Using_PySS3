I haven't read it yet but the ability is so co Did you perhapsâ€¦ Come hereâ€¦ Intending to â€˜Pursueâ€™ me? I seeâ€¦ So you are pursuing meâ€¦ I understand. So then, the lid of this jar, have you tried opening it? What Iâ€™m saying isâ€¦ Simply looking at that jar from the outside, you wouldnâ€™t know for certain that whatâ€™s inside it is a â€˜Fruitâ€™, noâ€¦? Isnâ€™t that right? Though it certainly seems to be fragments of â€˜Somethingâ€™â€¦ But looking from the outside, those may be potato fragmentsâ€¦ or perhaps onion fragmentsâ€¦ it may not look like an onionâ€¦ but that definitely looks like it could be a large mushroom! How can you be so definitive in saying that whatâ€™s inside that jar is a â€˜Fruitâ€™? Iâ€™m explaining the fact that you â€˜Openedâ€™ the jar. Because you received that package, you opened the lid with your hands, you â€˜Smelledâ€™ it. And itâ€™s because it gave off the sweet and sour scent of a â€˜Fruitâ€™â€¦ that you came into this room thinking it was a â€˜Fruitâ€™. You got all excited thinking â€˜Iâ€™ve got an exclusive scoop hereâ€™, didnâ€™t you? And thenâ€¦ you perhaps got some fruit juice from the lid stuck to your finger. Just a little of it. Or perhaps you were careless and licked that finger. If fate were particularly unlucky, thereâ€™s a rather good chance that when you were putting the lid back on, some fruit juice seeped into a small cut on your skin or your fingernail.
