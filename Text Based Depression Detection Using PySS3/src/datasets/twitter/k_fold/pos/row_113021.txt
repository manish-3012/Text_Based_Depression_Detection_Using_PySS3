Starting work, help Iâ€™m so nervous, I havenâ€™t showed it but my hands get sweaty asf when itâ€™s mentioned, itâ€™s happening later on today. Iâ€™m having a trial shift. I havenâ€™t done anything like this. My dads friend helped me get the job of working in pizza place, like taking orders and stuff. What if Iâ€™m super bad and stutter or I canâ€™t understand them because I donâ€™t talk to people on the phone often. I donâ€™t know how to introduce myself, I know no one there cause my dads friend isnâ€™t working later on. Wtf do I do. To like calm nerves and shit... Iâ€™m so nervous fuck
