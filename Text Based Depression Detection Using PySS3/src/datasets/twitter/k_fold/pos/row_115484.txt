I'm tired of being lonely I'm a M 16 and my whole life I've had girlfriends but none of them ever stick around long enough for me to actually love them. It gets really tiring being so lonely all the time so I'm calling on the subreddit for help (please don't shame me on this) I'm gonna look for a girlfriend on this subreddit. Sure it's not the best way but I'm outta ideas. If any girls in the Selma Alabama area is looking for a boyfriend, DM me for more details about myself. Or I may accept long distance idk yet
