Gonna try the push ups thing  I know its not original and was memed plenty, but idc. I'll find a threshold of votes(if it even gets high enough) and record all the push ups I do until I'm done  
Not that I really need the exercise, I'm actually pretty boney and I'm getting the necessary amount of food, just lacking the commitment for fitness
