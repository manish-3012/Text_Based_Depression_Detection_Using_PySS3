I used lotion as shampoo for 2 and a half months One day I felt that my hair was super greasy and I couldnâ€™t figure out why. I thought that it would pass and I just kept washing my hair. It didnâ€™t stop 

My brother told me that I need to not wash my hair everyday, and I needed to wash it every other day so it doesnâ€™t dry out, so I started doing that, but it didnâ€™t show any progress

I figured out 2 and a half months later why my hair was so greasy. I wasnâ€™t using shampoo. I was using lotion in my hair.

Apparently someone had decided it would be a good idea to put a bottle of lotion in the shower where shampoo bottles normally go, and I just assumed that it was shampoo. It was in a bottle that looked Exaclty like a bottle of shampoo, and I didnâ€™t expect anyone to put lotion in the shower, cause like why would you need lotion in the shower? 

Anyway my mom asked my brother

 â€œcan you bring me some lotion?â€

So he goes in the shower, and comes back with the bottle of lotion and my face dropped. It was LOTION?! HOW?! HOW COULD I HAVE NOT KNOWN?!

Anyway, my family made fun of me for like a year and I started using actual shampoo

My hair is lucious now donâ€™t worry lol but yea thatâ€™s what happened
