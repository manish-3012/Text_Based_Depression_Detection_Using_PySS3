guys isnt it so cool and coincidental that we were born on a planet thats just far away enough from the sun for us not to burn but also not far away so we dont freeze !!!!!!!! and that our living environment is (generally speaking) perfect and the only reason why it's not in some places is because humans made it that way !!!!!!! and that we have access to the exact resources that we need to survive like food, water, and fresh air !!!!!!!!! what a coincidence we didn't exist on another planet ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³
