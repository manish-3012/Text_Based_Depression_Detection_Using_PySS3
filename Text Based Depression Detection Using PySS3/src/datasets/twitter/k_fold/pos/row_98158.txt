Guys and girls and people of r/teenagers, help me take this important life decision. So. Itâ€™s currently 2 am here. Iâ€™m watching the NBA. After this game Iâ€™m watching there is another one that starts at 3 am, and itâ€™s definitely a better game. I gotta be up at 9, tho... Should I just say f*ck it? Consider usually I always have 8 hours of sleep.
