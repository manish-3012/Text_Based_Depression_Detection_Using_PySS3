doing photo shop requests(probably) because I'm fucking bored so I started photoshop today and I really like it but I'm have no fucking creativity. so I'm taking requests.

I don't care what it is. just nothing super complicated because I have an ape brain and don't know what I'm doing.

whether it's shitty clickbait thumbnails, strange images, or whatever, I'll try my best to do some of them. if you want certain images plz link them so I dont spend hours googling it. don't expect them done soon because I plan on starting tomorrow (US time). thanks
