If I could go back to when I was 12 and tell myself one thing, Iâ€™d say donâ€™t masturbate. Iâ€™m not really ashamed of it, but I get sad when I think about how much time Iâ€™ve wasted. You start off once a week, then every weekend, then before you know it every school night. Iâ€™ve probably been doing it once a day on average (sometimes twice, some off days) for 10 minutes a day. If you do the maths (math if youâ€™re American) youâ€™d be shocked to find out youâ€™ve probably spent over 100 hours of your life fapping. Think of all those tests that you wouldâ€™ve done anything for another hours revision, all the skills you couldâ€™ve learnt and if you donâ€™t wanna be productive, how many games you couldâ€™ve finished. Iâ€™m not waisting another 121 hours of my life in the next 2 years for 10 seconds of pleasure each time to pixels on a screen. I donâ€™t know if I believe in all NoFap benefits, but I will be grateful just to get the time back.
