Actually Made Money on Swagbucks Yo guys.  Iâ€™ve been using Swagbucks lately and itâ€™s actually kinda dope.  I made $10 in like a few days with only like 10 minutes per day and got a Visa gift card and then bought some movies on YouTube movies.  With all this extra time, might as well get a little cash lmao.  I am gonna post my affiliate link, but with it you get an extra $1.50.  Also, I figured out how to rarely get disqualified from surveys, so hmu if youâ€™re interested.

Thanks guys!
