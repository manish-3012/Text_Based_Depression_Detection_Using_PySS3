Day 11 of posting my fav Twenty Ã¸ne pilÃ¸ts lyrics one order a car, a torch, a death- from the album self titled- by twenty one pilots
Quote:"And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game
And then I saw him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said I'll take the grave
Please just send them all my way
And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game
And then I saw him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said I'll take the grave
Please just send them all my way
I began to understand why God died" - Tyler Joseph 2009
