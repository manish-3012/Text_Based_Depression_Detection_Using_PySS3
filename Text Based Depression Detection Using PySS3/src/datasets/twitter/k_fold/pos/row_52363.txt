I did the rice purity test again to see if it was the same (I did it like only a couple of weeks ago) And ig I lied a little for 3 questions because it was definitely 93 before but now itâ€™s 90. Iâ€™m not as pure as I thought but 90 is still very pure. 

Now Iâ€™m curious as to what yours is, so whatâ€™s yours?
