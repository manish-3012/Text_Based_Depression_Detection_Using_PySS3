I think bisexuals are confused. Not because I donâ€™t think bisexuality is wrong, Im just saying that Iâ€™m bisexual and Iâ€™m confused as hell Like I donâ€™t know why, but I just canâ€™t make decisions. Iâ€™m like â€œHey, I want chocolate ice cream, or something dumbâ€ but then anxiety comes in like LEROY JENKINS and I just want to scream 

P.S. the title is a joke plz donâ€™t get offended, if your bi I love you, and youâ€™re valid
