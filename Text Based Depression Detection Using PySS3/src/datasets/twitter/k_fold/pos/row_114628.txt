I just learned that one of my friends was a victim of a school shooting. 
This isnâ€™t going to be as serious as some of the stuff on this sub, but Iâ€™d appreciate if people held their jokes in. First off, I want to say my friend is fine. She apparently was shot in the leg, but has healed and is now healthy enough to make jokes about the whole experience. However, hearing about it really brought me to see whatâ€™s been going on. Thereâ€™s so many stories on this sub about serious topics that someone like me whoâ€™s never really had any major events like this in their life canâ€™t relate to, so we donâ€™t really consider that this is happening around us. Up until now, Iâ€™ve never actually felt like the shootings were real. Iâ€™d laugh at the jokes and the memes, not considering that this could happen to people I know. I wasnâ€™t even the victim, and yet this has brought me to the reality that at any moment, something terrible could happen to any one of us and we donâ€™t realize nor consider it.
