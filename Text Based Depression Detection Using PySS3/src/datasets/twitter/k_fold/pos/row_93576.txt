So I melted a hole in My fingernail So Iâ€™m 14 and am really interested in electricity, and was at a friendâ€™s house who had a plasma ball (one of the things with the ball in the middle with the lightning coming out, IYKYK) and I had brought a charger for my iPhone. 

I absentmindedly set my charger on the plasma ball, loosely coiled so it went around once with a bit hanging off of the charger end. I then turned the plasma ball on, and reached near the cable and, and when I brushed the end with my hand I was shocked to see little bolts of electricity coming from the charger.

Curious and wanting to investigate more, I put my fingernail on it, and didnâ€™t consider the fact that there were no nerves there. It started to hurt after it had melted through my nail on a tiny spot and had started burning the nail bed. 

So now thereâ€™s a small painful black hole on my finger nail that smells like burning hair.

TL;DR: I melted a hole in my fingernail with a phone charger and a plasma ball
