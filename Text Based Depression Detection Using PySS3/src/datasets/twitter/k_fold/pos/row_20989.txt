I turned 20 today, it was fun while it lasted boys I am no longer a teenager as of today. I have lurked in this server for years, but if there's one last thing I can inspire you guys with, it would be this: don't slack in high school cause that stuff really matters when you get older. Good luck all you teens of the world!
