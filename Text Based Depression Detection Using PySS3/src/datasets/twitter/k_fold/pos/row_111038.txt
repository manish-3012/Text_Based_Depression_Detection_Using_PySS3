I might not see my best friend in a short time I(M15) might drift away from my best friend(F14)
Itâ€™s really hard for me to thinks about it, and Iâ€™m considering to start drifting away from her so seeing her for the last time wonâ€™t be that hard.
It might sound stupid, but by the summer Iâ€™ll finish middle school and move to a high school, and thereâ€™s a chance she wonâ€™t be going to the same school I will, but our friendship is so important to me, we were in this pretty big fight, and I just got close to her again, I donâ€™t want it yo be over so soon, and itâ€™ll be hard to stay connected to her if weâ€™re not in the same school, for both of us, the only thing I can think about is for us to be couple, and I had that tiny crush to her a few months back, but now I just know it wonâ€™t work out so I leave it alone. Now I know I need to move on, and Iâ€™ll meet new friends in high school, but I donâ€™t wanna forget her.
Anyway, this was just me writing this to feel better.
