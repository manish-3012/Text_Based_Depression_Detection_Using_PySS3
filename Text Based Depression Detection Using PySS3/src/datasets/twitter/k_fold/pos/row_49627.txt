Iâ€™ve got a weird story I had class earlier today. And I had to speak for something but I had just woken up so deep voice go brrr. But I donâ€™t speak much and I donâ€™t sound anything like I look so everyone was confused for a solid 5s. Iâ€™m pretty sure half of them thought I was faking it but eh. It was kinda funny for me.
