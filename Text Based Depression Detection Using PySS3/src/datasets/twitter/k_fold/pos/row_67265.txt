My gf just broke up with me through someone elseâ€™s text I just got some voice clips of my gf telling her friend that she isnâ€™t dating me. I asked her on a date before quarantine and she said yes, i have taken her on 3 dates and now i get a clip saying that those werenâ€™t dates! I told her so many times how i felt about her and all she did was USE me. I have always had extreme social anxiety, depression, anger issues and trust  issues but she was the only person that i could talk about everything to and and wouldnâ€™t get angry at ever. And suddenly she isnâ€™t even dating me. Anyone i have ever learned to trust has done the same thing to me, betraying me and leaving me even more broken. Plus she didnâ€™t even text me to tell me she just fucking told my friend who recorded it and sent if to me. 
I always thought i was lucky to have a girlfriend never mind one as nice as she was but turns out that was all a fucking lie and she was just using me.
