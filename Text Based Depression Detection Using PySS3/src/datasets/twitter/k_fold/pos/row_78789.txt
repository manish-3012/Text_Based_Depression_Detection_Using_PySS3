Any Dog owners/adopters here I got questions I want to adopt a dog since I feel sorta alone during free time and got nothing else to occupy myself so I want a companion and as well itâ€™s be nice to give a dog a home
So here are questions I got

1.what do I need to sign or go through to apply for an adoption 

2.how often should I get them examined by a vet

3. Whatâ€™s generally good dog snacks or food to give them 

4.what actives should I try to do 

5. What human food they can have (I know chocolate and sweets are not good  for them)

6.how do I  make sure to have a good connection
