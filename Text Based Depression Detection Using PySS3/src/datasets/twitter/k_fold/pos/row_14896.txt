Just a rant So, i started dating a girl around two months ago, and we haven't really been able to properly talk to each other through our relationship. We would go around two weeks without even talking once. We used to play minecraft a lot together but me recently getting into playing skyblock a lot, instead of pvp which we would play together. So now to cut to the point she messaged me at 2 am telling me that we have to break up because we aren't able to talk to eachother properly. And i just feel like i could've saved our relationship.
