So something weird has been happening to me for two nights in a row. So on Wednesday at around 23:40. I was in bed and I decided to put some music on.  (I do this every night) I was going to listen to the song twice and then go to bed but when I next checked my phone it was 2:20 and the music was still playing.

Then last night I didnâ€™t want the same thing to happen so I listened to the music and I swear I put my headphones and phone on the floor. I even had a dream where my best friend was in a shooting range but I then woke up or realised what was happening and found out it was 5 o clock and I had been listening to music for 3 hours. 

Idk whatâ€™s happening but itâ€™s so weird
