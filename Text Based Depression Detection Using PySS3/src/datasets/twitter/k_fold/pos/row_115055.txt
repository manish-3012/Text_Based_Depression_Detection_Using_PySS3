Is it normal that my mom does my homework with me and controls it completely? Im 15 and i have never done my homework alone.
I come home from school and i have to show my mom what i did in school and she corrects it. She watches me for mistakes while i do my homework. Ive told her i dont want to continue that, but she insists on continuing. She homework takes more time because of that. Some days all i do is homework. She also gives me extra work because i have nothing to do.

Im always so stressed
