I did some calculations. The average person can see things about 2 miles away in the best possible conditions. 2 miles is equal to 5280*2=10560 feet. Dividing this by 3.28 gets us the measurement of about 3219.5 meters. One Minecraft chunk is 16 blocks long, and since a block is a meter long, it's the same as 16 meters. So dividing 3219.5 by 16 gets us about 201. This means that the average human render distance in Minecraft terms is 201 chunks.
