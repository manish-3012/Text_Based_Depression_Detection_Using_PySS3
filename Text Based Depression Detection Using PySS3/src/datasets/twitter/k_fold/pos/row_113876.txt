Quick psych tip for your personal life Med student and hopefully future psychiatrist here. 

While doing some studies I was reminded of the jdea of problem based coping and emotion based coping.

I know when I was a teenager (and hell even through undergrad and now) I misused these.

For example:

Emotion Based Coping: eating icecream and playing video games after a break up because it makes you feel better.  - good use of emotion based coping

Problem Based Coping: working on a project your stressed about to get it out of the way to relieve your stress. - good use of problem based coping

However, I find myself doing this often:

Emotion Based Coping: Eating Ice cream and playing video games to deal with the stress of a project I need to do.  - bad use of emotion based coping

Problem Based Coping: working on trying to get my ex back after a break up. - bad use of problem based coping.

I recommend being able to identify what problem your facing and deciding what is the proper way to handle it, it will save you a lot of frustration later and make you handle problems much easier.
