Update on the Wii music brainwashing: Last night, I played Wii music on loop while I slept, as eight of you already know. This is now morning for me. 

I do have strange vibes today, but it just feels like an amplification of my regular vibes. This leads me to believe that the only thing in my subconscious is the Wii music playing nonstop.

I will continue to update throughout the day.
