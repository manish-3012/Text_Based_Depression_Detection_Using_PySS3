I usually don't have any interest in this, but... If anyone wants to talk about anything I feel like talking to some random person, well type but you know.

I'm usually extremely introverted even online so this is a weird thing for me. But if you got any cool games you are playing, good streamers or youtubers to watch, or really just any topic on your mind id be welcome to talk. 

Oh and I will be judging you on your choice of games. 100%. At least enough judging to question why that game out of the rest.
