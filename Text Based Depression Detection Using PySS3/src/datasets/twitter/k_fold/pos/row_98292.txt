I have a short story that happened a few years ago. I was 9 years old in forth grade. It was the solar eclipse. So we wouldn't be able to see the whole thing, but we could see it partly so that's pretty cool. Since we only had one pair of glasses me and my brother who was in third grade 8 years old had to take turns. So we took some turns when he somehow got two turns in a row without me noticing and my mom said "You'll go next." So we had pretty much switched times we had our turns. And there's this one moment in a solar eclipse where it goes all the way (Or most the way where we were) And this lasted a very short time only like a few seconds. So I was on what would have been his turn if he didn't skip, and guess who saw it? Like he would have seen it if he didn't skip don't skip things or this will happen. Makes me a little sad he couldn't see it but still.
