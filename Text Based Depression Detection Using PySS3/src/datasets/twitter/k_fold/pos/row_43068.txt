i think i have a bf now??? (apologies for bad formatting/grammar, itâ€™s late and iâ€™m on mobile)

so one of my closest friends recently told me heâ€™s actually a guy. obviously iâ€™m gonna support him, heâ€™s still awesome. as of recently, however, i developed some mild romantic feelings, and today i acted upon them.

he didnâ€™t say he felt the same, but when i told him we should date, he agreed. so, victory?
