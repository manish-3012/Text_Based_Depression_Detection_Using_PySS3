Dear companies Specifically talking about companies that make movies / shows here...

God fucking dammit can I please watch whatever I want in my country without having to research for 5 minutes only to realise I need a hulu subscription.

But hulu doesnt even give me the option to use it in brazil so I need a privacy.com licence to make a credit card hulu can charge, a VPN licence, because the free ones stream at 240p, all that so I can even have the option to buy hulu, and watch all the ads because you gotta pay extra to get rid of those.

Or you know I could go to the pirate bay, download a 30gig torrent that contains all the episodes movies and shorts, in full 1080p.

Piracy is literally the only option and its such bullshit it pisses me off. A piracy website is more convenient then the actual thing.
