Depression hit me again. Iâ€™m having one of those days where the depression really hits, and normally I just ignore it and donâ€™t say anything online about it because people will think Iâ€™m reaching for attention. I donâ€™t even want a response I just feel like itâ€™s better to put it here than with my parents who will try to do something but end up making it worse, and then there annoyed that they try for me and I donâ€™t appreciate it. I want to care about what they do for me, I just canâ€™t. When I was 8 or 9 this happened a lot and if i understood what I do now I probably wouldnâ€™t be here now. I never wanted to cut myself until mid 2019 when I finally understood that it was about control and not actually dying so efficiently really isnâ€™t the point like I thought it was. Now whenever I hold a knife or run water over my hands or just have more blood than usual pumping through my wrists I just want to slice them open. I once again donâ€™t want a response I just want to know People get it and my depression symptoms are also abnormal and wrong. If I had friends I probably wouldnâ€™t be able to send this to them for the same reason as above, but Iâ€™ve never been close enough with anyone for that to apply
