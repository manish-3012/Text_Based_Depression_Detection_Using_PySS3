So it turns out my friend and I are both really socially anxious and afraid of texting other people, so we decided weâ€™re gonna text each other to help practice. But I have no idea how to start texting her We both realized that we feel pretty much the exact same discomfort about starting conversations with people over text, so we decided that we would start texting a lot more with each other to help normalize it for ourselves so weâ€™d be more comfortable texting other people.

And donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m totally on board with this idea. I just donâ€™t know where to start. I donâ€™t want it to *feel* like weâ€™re texting just for the sake of texting, even if thatâ€™s what weâ€™re actually doing. I want to feel like weâ€™re actually just talking as friends, and I donâ€™t know how to do that in a natural way
