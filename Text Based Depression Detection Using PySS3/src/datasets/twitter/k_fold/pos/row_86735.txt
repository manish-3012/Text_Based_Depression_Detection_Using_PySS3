Are you f*cking kidding me right now Im so fcking upset. A very dangerous mixture of sad and mad. On christmas eve as well.

Alright lemme explain. So one of my friends has been in a group home for a few months now. She told me she was able to come back to town for christmas. Thats great. I'll be able to see her again.

Nope.

She tells me that she can only have two people over and that she has already selected them. Kinda hurts but I can deal with it. So I wish her a merry christmas and go about my day.

Flash forward a couple hours and I'm on snapchat. I start scrolling through people's stories and I come across hers. And this is the part that pisses me right off.

She has a whole bunch of videos of her hanging out with friends. Like six of them. Six other people. She didnt even think to invite me. And its a whole bunch of stupid stuff they are doing and it looks like so much fun. And she didnt even invite me. She specifically told me that she couldnt have any else over. And yet she had six other people over. 

I mean, fck me I thought we were close. We've had deep conversations and good times. But she just didnt care enough about me I guess.

I dont know, my dudes, maybe I'm being too self-important. But it still really hurts. And I could try and talk to the people there about it( They are also my friends) but they wpuld probably just say I'm being oversensitive about it. I don't know what to do. I'm really upset.
