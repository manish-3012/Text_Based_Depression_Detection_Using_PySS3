I did a do I havenâ€™t done a single assignment in almost any class since day one. Ya boi got permission to redo em all, but theyâ€™re all due tomorrow at midnight. 

It was around 12 assignments for one class, about 6 hours an assignment. The other classes had 3 or 4 half hour assignments, and one class with 20 hours of work

And I got it all done today. How? I donâ€™t know. But I did, so itâ€™s possible. I believe in you, you can pass your classes too. If I can pull back from this hellhole, you can crawl your way out of whatever hole youâ€™re in. Iâ€™ll toss you a ladder if you need it, just dm me if you need that kinda help
