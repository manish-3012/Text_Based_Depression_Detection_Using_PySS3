A while ago I deleted snap bc it wan't working on my tablet. I recently redownloaded it after getting it fixed to find that some girl added me from quick add. I have no idea how snap works so what does this mean. Should I add her back and inquire why. Does it mean nothing? Need help, I'm very confused. Wtf even is quick add?
