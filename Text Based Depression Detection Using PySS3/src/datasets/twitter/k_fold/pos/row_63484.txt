I feel so bad for anyone sitting next to me So Iâ€™ve had adhd since I was like 1 and only very recently has a new symptom came up... when ever Iâ€™m bored,have nothing to do or just randomly I start to make beats I hit the table I hit my knees and make noises with my pen I just feel like everyone around me is listening and I feel pressured to make good beats
