Man I so want this to happen to me :( Man I really want someone run into by accident because they're late to somet then we exchanged numbers things hit off then we start dating, Few years later get married and have a family grow old together and watch the world change around us as if we're the centre of the universe, one day looking up at the night sky remembering our lives and how happy we were and still are then one day making a promise saying that we'd live for as long as we can helping out people who can't help themselves and then we die a few weeks apart then we meet again in heaven and we watch over our family that we created and watch their families remembering the good times. Thank you for listening me rant on about my delusions cya
