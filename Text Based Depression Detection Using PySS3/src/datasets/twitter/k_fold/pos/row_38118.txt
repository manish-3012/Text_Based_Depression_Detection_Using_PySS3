This sub can be ridiculous at times Some ot the things I've seen on this sub that should be common sense, and no you're not special for pointing it out.

Earth's not flat.

No shit making fun of a guys penis size is a terrible thing to do.

Girls shouldn't play with guys feelings by asking them out 'as a joke' or 'dare' and vice versa.

Of course Trump is racist, not exactly news.

Respecting a woman =/= simp.

Obviously you shouldn't assault anyone, regardless of gender. 

No dip being overweight is unhealthy and we shouldn't be celebrating it. Just dont be a dick about it.

Getting boners is natural.

Celebrating someone mourning a death is a disgusting thing to do.



All of these have been posts about the most common sense things but have people acting as if it was the most original thought. Hell, even this one with me complaining about it probably isn't original.
