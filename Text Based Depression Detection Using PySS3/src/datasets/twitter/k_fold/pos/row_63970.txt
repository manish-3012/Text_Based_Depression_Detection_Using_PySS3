Okay this may sound weird but i think i may have apathy I dunno but i just donâ€™t feel anything. Not happy not sad no anything. My grandpa has cancer and I somehow â€œdonâ€™t careâ€ (i do care but I donâ€™t feel it) and my motivation for school and sport is non existence basically...I donâ€™t really love anyone and feel completely independent from them. I am not happy and not sad. Just a spectator of my own body. Is this actually apathy or am i a sociopath or is this just normal? I am quite lonely and donâ€™t have any close or good friends so that may is a factor...
