I'm so oblivious right now I've been up for a good while now and i want to keep going to 2 days because I heard after 2 days of being awake the sleep is good but im getting so tired its been over a day and almost half. I also don't want to have anything bad happen like if something goes wrong and I just become a vegetable that would suck. Anybody who been awake for so long is it worth the 2 day awake then sleep is it that good of sleep?
