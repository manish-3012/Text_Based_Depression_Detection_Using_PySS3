my dog is being put down tomorrow my dog whoâ€™ve iâ€™ve known since he was a puppy is being put down tomorrow. he just turned 2 in october. i know it may not seem like that long but he really was my best friend. heâ€™s a good dog, his only problem is he fights our other dog and sometimes us too. i feel like a piece of my heart is gone now. i donâ€™t know what to do. i have an exam tomorrow. sorry for the rant. my head is spinning rn and iâ€™m struggling to breathe
