So i confessed to my crush I've know her since 6th grde and i later knew she had a crush on me at the time but we only really started talking 4 years later, and 3 days after, i told her my feelings for her and she just seems to ignore and talk about other stuff. For example we started talking a lot by whatsapp, and i told her my problems in conjunction with my feelings for her and she only talked about my problems and that she would be there to help me. I just get more sad because i don't know if she doesn't understand, if she's ignoring, she doesn't like me or she is just not prepared yet. Any help?
