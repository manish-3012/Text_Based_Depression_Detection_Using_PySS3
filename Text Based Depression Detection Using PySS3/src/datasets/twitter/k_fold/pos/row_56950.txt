Please help My gf has been super depressed lately. She has been depressed for about 3 years but its been super bad lately. Im writing this in the middle of the night because im scared for her. We have been together for over one year and she has told me I have helped her out of suicidal thoughts before. I feel like im unable to help because im sick and cant leave the house. Please, if anyone know how i can help her, please. Im scared.
