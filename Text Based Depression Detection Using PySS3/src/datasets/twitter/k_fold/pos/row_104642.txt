I feel like I should pursue a relationship with this girl but Iâ€™m not sure Quick facts 

Sheâ€™s 2 year older 

Sheâ€™s displays psychopathic behaviour (still not too sure if itâ€™s an act or if she actually is a psycho) 

Sheâ€™s beautiful 

She scares me, she lit the school shed on fire

We live across each other and only recently our parents started becoming friends so Iâ€™ve been to her house and we started talking.

Even though she says the weirdest, psycho, creepiest shit to me like random facts about how to torture someone or how to murder someone without any evidence. It makes me like her more 

Am I turned on by psychotic behaviour or something or am I just in love with her.
