Oh my fucking god i did it! So iâ€˜ve been texting this girl i like and confessed to her. She said that it could be a yes but she wanted to meet up a few times before making up her decision. So we did and it went pretty good. Yesterday night we Facetimed and i told her that i really like her again...

...so today she sent this: Hey, me again, so yesterday you were honest with me and today I want to be honest to you. You made my head spin pretty good. As soon as you text me, I just smile automatically. I can't control it Haha. 
I don't know but I think I have a real crush on you. ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜š
Sorry if this comes across as rushed, but I just had to say that. ðŸ˜…

I DID IT! I FINALLY FUCKING DID IT!
