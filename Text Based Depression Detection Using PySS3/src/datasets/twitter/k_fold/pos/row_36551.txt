So uhm, someone wanted to see my songs so here (Anyways slight warning this song mentions kicking the bucket lol) [Hideous Reality]


[Verse 1]

I'm the prince of the 7 seas

I'm not hurt but I still bleed

I can't believe my life has come to this

And when I look back on the ugly past

I'll realise my existence is a sin

My life has come to this


[Pre-chorus] 

Oh, at what point will they realise

I'm not what first meets the eye?

I have more character than just my lies.

And when I finally go to bed

I hope someone comes and shoots me dead

Because my life is fixed to my lies.


[Chorus]

Oh, dear gods why on earth do I bleed?

I wish I could satisfy your needs, 

And assert dominance across the nation.

But when it comes to basic needs

My wishes are nothing more than greed.

The hideous reality breaks my hallucination.


[Verse 2]

And when the stars begin to fall

I'll think "God damn oh is this all?

Is this my reward for pushing through my issues?"

I'm being selfish yet again

And nobody loves me the same.

Oh, now I'm crying and running outta tissues.


[Pre-chorus]


[Chorus]


[Outro thing]

And despite all the evidence

All refuses to make any sense.

My brain is scattered right across the nation.

And when I finally hit the hay

Forever, war will stay at bay.

Oh, can I just shut down my imagination?
