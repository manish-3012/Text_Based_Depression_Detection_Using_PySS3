BOIS, last couple weeks been pretty pog Started texting this chic out of the blue, we haven't talked in years. Now we datin and she a solid 8 and damn. She great. 2020 looking up even with all the bull. Online school and being stuck at home all summer really been taking a toll on my mental. Things are starting to look up for me. Hope everyones 2020 can get better. Cause I know it's sucked.
