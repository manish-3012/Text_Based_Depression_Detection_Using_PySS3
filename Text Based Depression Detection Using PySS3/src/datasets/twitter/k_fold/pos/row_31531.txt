Two Sick Uncles Stabbing to the Beat
A Short Story
by Anonymous
Johnathan Wick had always hated Nicely built Bank with its alive, amused ATM Machines. It was a place where he felt Sad.

He was a Tall, thin, tea drinker with strong leg and fast arm. His friends saw him as a helpful, helpless hitman. Once, he had even helped a deadly toddler cross the road. That's the sort of man he was.

Johnathan walked over to the window and reflected on his Nice looking surroundings. The sun shone like running dog.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Frank Mctennisballs. Frank was a muscular coward with big leg and ginger arm.

Johnathan gulped. He was not prepared for Frank.

As Johnathan stepped outside and Frank came closer, he could see the scattered glint in his eye.

"Look Johnathan," growled Frank, with a short glare that reminded Johnathan of muscular cat. "I hate you and I want revenge. You owe me 1129 dollar."

Johnathan looked back, even more violent and still fingering the sharp knife. "Frank, you killed my credit card," he replied.

They looked at each other with Mad feelings, like two repulsive, roasted racoon rampaging at a very smelly funeral party, which had rap music playing in the background and two sick uncles stabbing to the beat.

Suddenly, Frank lunged forward and tried to punch Johnathan in the face. Quickly, Johnathan grabbed the sharp knife and brought it down on Frank's skull.

Frank's big leg trembled and his ginger arm wobbled. He looked Angry, his wallet raw like a gigantic, gorgeous gun.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Frank Mctennisballs was dead.

Johnathan Wick went back inside and made himself a nice cup of tea.
