Guys I need advice. Australians and US citizens. A friend of mine met this dude on Omegle (for fun ofc) and met this dude who lives in US. She then adds him to this group with several of other school friends who are quite younger. I think heâ€™s 17/18 yrs old. A few days later he tries asking a few of the younger girls to add him, only to ask them for nudes. When they reject he becomes extremely rude and abusive on the chat, fat shaming my friends cousin, and another who has mental issues. He continues to be this way sometimes and I want to do something about it. I reported his account but Snapchat wonâ€™t do anything.
