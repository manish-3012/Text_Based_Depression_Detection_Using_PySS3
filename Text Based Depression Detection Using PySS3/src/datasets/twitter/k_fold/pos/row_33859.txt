My goal in life is to be as fast as possible, while being as silent as possible. Aswell as being able to hide in plain sight :Future: 

Boss: Where's that damn employee's paperwork? He should have turned it in by now!

Me: *apparating behind his chair* here it is boss.

Imagine all the uses as a parent. Your child will always be "confident" knowing that you might be watching. Always watching. They'll never do anything bad. They know that there's a chance I'm watching

Or if your girlfriend is cheating on you, she'd never know if you saw her doing the thing with the person she's not supposed to be doing the thing with.

You could have a friend over, and they ask for a drink, and you appear behind them with a gallon of water and freak them out. 

If i had my own house, hell yeah, it'd be filled with secret passages to and from the rooms.
No secret lair shit, just tunnels.

Fuck yeah, I'd be the real world embodiment of Fred and George Weasley.
