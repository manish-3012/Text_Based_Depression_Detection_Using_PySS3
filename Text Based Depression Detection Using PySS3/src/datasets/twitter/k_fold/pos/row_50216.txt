I hate men. No , not all men. The ones that are fucking creepy and try to hit on me even if im a minor. Today i was going inside my apartment building and a man just stood in the doorway and wouldnt let me in , he told me that im beautiful or some shit like that. I got so scared and ran outside . Fuck creepy men.
