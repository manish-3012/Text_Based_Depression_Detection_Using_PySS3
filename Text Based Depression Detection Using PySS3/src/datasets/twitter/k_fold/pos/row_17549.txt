Anyone else feel like they're wasting their teenage years by not being in a relationship or being truly themselves Ive never been in a relationship and it just makes me sad that I'll never have another opportunity to go to prom or something with a guy. And I'm still not out to a lot of people and which I could just go up to a guy in public and ask him out without being scared of what my friends think. This is literally all I think about now
