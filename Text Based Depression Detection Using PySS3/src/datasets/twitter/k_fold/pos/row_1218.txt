when you want to call for help but at the same time, scared of what might happen idk. probably this is child abuse but i just put up with it since i have nowhere to go. my little brother gets shouted at almost everyday and I canâ€™t do anything about it.

iâ€™ve seen my own father being violent with my older brother a lot of times now. people think my parents are decent people. weâ€™d probably just get accused of being whiny.

both of them has serious anger issues and i cope with it by not provoking them. usually by not speaking a word or holding back my emotions. i canâ€™t tell these to people i know either, since most of my â€œfriendshipsâ€ are very surface level. 

I remember as early as my kindergarten years where we were â€œdisciplinedâ€ with harsh methods. Now, itâ€™s just them being condescending nonstop.

i admit, i observed some of their toxic traits within me and iâ€™m pretty much ashamed of it. 

thatâ€™s my rant
