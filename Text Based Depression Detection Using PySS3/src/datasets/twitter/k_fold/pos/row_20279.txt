this covid stuff is no joke i thought it wouldnâ€™t be bad, thought it was like a bad flu. when i had a runny nose a week ago i thought nothing of it and wasnâ€™t worried until i saw how it hit my mom, looked like she was having a seizure and suffocating at the same time and weâ€™re both high risk

iâ€™ve had a constant fever for 4 days and my body aches make me feel like iâ€™m about to explode, iâ€™ve never felt this way in my life. itâ€™s not like flu symptoms at all. i thought everyone was exaggerating. i wanna feel normal again and none of the medicine i take ease the symptoms. i donâ€™t even have that bad of a cough but itâ€™s hard to breathe. i have so many missing assignments because i canâ€™t get out of bed. i have finals next week how tf do i get better. why couldnâ€™t it wait 2 weeks. i seriously thought everyone was exaggerating. when i think iâ€™m getting better it slaps me harder
