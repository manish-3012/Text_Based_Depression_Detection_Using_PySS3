I am so disappointed Friends, relatives, people who I didn't even know were racist are severely disappointing me with awful Facebook posts. A white relative today posted "Black privilege, the ability to break every law in the country and still remain the victim." 

And a family friend posted a sob story about how her 'white' friend was bullied because of race and never 'complained'. 

I am so done with these people who don't even consider themselves to be racist. Those are just a few examples! 
I'm so surprised and disappointed at the amount of racism that exists in a modern and liberal community. With people I know, people who seemed perfectly normal and kind. 

Anyone else?
