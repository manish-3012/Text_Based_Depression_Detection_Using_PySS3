I made a grave mistake I donâ€™t remember the post all I know is that it was something about the LGBT community and I made a comment trying to say something along the lines of Iâ€™m straight I donâ€™t like the thought of being gay personally but you can do whatever the hell you want. And It came across as homophobic. Iâ€™m lost and I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t care whether people are get or not but I didnâ€™t exactly word it very well.
