I got addicted to prostitutes Guys I got addicted. I am officially addicted to prostitutes. Once I became 18, I hired my first prostitute. I enjoyed it so much that every time Iâ€™m bored, I either visit prostitutes or hire them for the entire night with weed and everything. 

The thing is, premarital sex is really important in my country. You wonâ€™t get laid here. 

Money isnâ€™t an issue. Prostitutes cost $80/hour in my country so it literally doesnâ€™t affect me much but still, I donâ€™t think I should be as addicted as I am. 

What do you think? What do I do? Is it wrong or not?
