Anyone else been using quarantine to finally work on really improving themselves? Doubt many people will see this, but here we go

For a long time I've been pretty anti-social/awkward, and have been basically non-existent in my school social network. I was also not in shape at all- though not fat, I had barely any endurance or muscle. And I had no desire to put in the effort to change that.

But since quarantine started, I've finally started to really work on improving myself and doing regular exercise/home workout. Started running, been working on confidence and social skills, started lifting weights, keeping myself mentally and physically healthy.

I have gone into quarantine socially anxious and weak, and, when it finally ends, I will emerge from quarantine the person that I wished I could be.
