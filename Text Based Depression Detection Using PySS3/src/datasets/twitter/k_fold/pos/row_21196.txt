Are you worried about those modern gender things? Gay people are obviously fine (Alan Turing suicided because of homophobia), but why the hell are those weird transsexual and whatevergender people spewing their bullshit absolutely everywhere?! 

I am happy to be raised in European Conservative values. I am however strongly worried, that one day, heterosexuality will become a minority and everyone will be expected to identify as some sort of gender crap thingy.
