Writing something positive about my day, day #371 Iâ€™m at boarding school right now and basically anyone who couldnâ€™t go back home for the holiday was put into one house even though we would normally be in different houses. Iâ€™m new to the school and didnâ€™t really manage to make friends until this holiday where I actually managed to become quite good friends with a couple girls in a different house. Today was the last day of the holiday so last night we spent it staying up really late while eating instant noodles and general just enjoying our last day of us living in the same house and it was a lot of fun. Really hope Iâ€™ll get the chance to see them a lot still
