Anyone else kind of wish they lived in a country where you could just see your head of state walking their dog randomly on a Tuesday morning just down the street. And you could walk down that street as well and no one would panic or tackle you were there is no 7 mile perimeter around whatever head of state that is.

You read stories about like the Prime Minister of the UK or the president of the United States in like the 1890 years or early 1900s  Having to Chase their dog down the street or through Central Park or Hyde Park because it saw a squirrel or something and it's just like a little sad that the world has changed so much in the way of... People have done horrible things so now we have higher security that you can't randomly see that from time to time and that just kind of sucks.

Because I think it would be funny seeing the president of the United States chasing his dog through Central Park because it saw a squirrel or something and you're just chilling on a park bench like 30' away with some friends watching this unfold.... But we don't live in that kind of a world so yeah kind of sucks
