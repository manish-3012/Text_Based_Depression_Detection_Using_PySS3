I ran out of my house after a big fight with my mom. As the title says I (15 M) ran out of my house after a big fight with my mom.  I've never done anything like this nor I have ever been grounded. I've been known as a "goody too shoes" so I always listened to my mom and did her request no matter how ridiculous it was. So here is the story of the fight, I was taking online classess and I finnihsed my work only, I'm a responsible straight A student, so I thought I coud use this time to play with my friends some tetris on the home PC. I was playing and she started saying that I didn't do anything in the house and that she didn't want me to play in the PC or talk with my friends anymore. This obviously made me angry and I started telling her the things I didn't like. She said that she can do anything she wants because its her house. That was the last straw. I made a backpack with my school notebooks and some clothes and asked my aunt if I can go to her house. I told her where I was going and the time I will be coming back. I hope that she sees that Im not a baby boy and hoping that she clears her head so we can talk things clearly.
