how can you tell if youâ€™re talking about yourself too much in a conversation i generally try really hard when having a conversation to not bring myself up too much or at least ask the other person equal amounts of questions about themselves. i just have this overwhelming fear that iâ€™m being narcissistic and speaking about myself far more than iâ€™m letting the other person speak on their own problems. how do i tell if i am, and how do i fix this?
