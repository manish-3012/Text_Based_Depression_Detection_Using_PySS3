I wrote something. I wish yâ€™all will like it. Itâ€™s still kind of a first draft but I donâ€™t thing Iâ€™ll ever work on it again haha. My loneliness is making of a me a mess,
I simply wish someone would care.
This pain I canâ€™t bear,
Approach me if you dare.

My hatred is stronger than my love,
My pain is stronger than myself.
You canâ€™t stop it from happening,
All leads to the same ending. 

I am a stranger to myself,
Yet, I hate my person.
At this point Iâ€™m simply done,
Iâ€™m only waiting for the last chord to be strung.

I feel so alone,
Not cared about.
Still, Iâ€™m hiding in my corner,
Wishing someone would bother.

Thereupon,
Nothing can numb my pain.
Always overwhelmed by sadness,
Which is complementing my stress. 

I donâ€™t have a why to live,
Neither do I have a will to live.
And as meaningless as it can be,
It pains me.

Haunting and tormenting me,
Those thoughts of being free.
Free from suffering,
Free from existing.

All I can feel is suffering,
All I do is sinking,
All I can think of is dying,
Why live a life that has no meaning?
