What should I do? I came out to my mom as trans and pan (athough I'm not sure if I'm pan anymore) like, a week ago and at first my mom said she accepted me, but I wasn't so sure. Now, I know 100% that she doesn't accept me. I think because I came out to her she's putting off getting me therapy. I'm also terrified that she's going to tell my dad and he'll physically abuse me. I'm just scared and don't know what to do anymore. Can I please get some help.. anything will be usefull currently..
