This haunting shit is getting ridiculous For those of you who donâ€™t know: I have posted a couple of times about what Iâ€™m pretty sure has been a haunting at my house both on here and on r/paranormal. Both posts were removed by mods but you can find them through my comment history and I do have one up of an audio clip I got while talking to a friend on discord. 

So anyways, I just had another experience. I just took a shower and was in the bathroom brushing my teeth after it. Everything was going normal and there was nothing out of the ordinary when out of nowhere the bathroom door handle started shaking and so did the door itself. The door was locked so it only moved so much, but it rattled like one would expect it to. I unlocked the door almost instantly, expecting it to be my mom, but when I opened the door there was nobody there. Furthermore, there was nobody in the entire house. My mom was outside with all of the dogs, and my dad was in the barn. Weâ€™re the only people that were at the house so I know it wasnâ€™t a different family member or an animal just sniffing the door or itching against it to make it rattle the way it did. Anyways, now Iâ€™m shaken up and have no idea if I should tell my parents, especially after this and what was said in the video clip. 

Any advice or tips are welcome, I just want this shit to be over with
