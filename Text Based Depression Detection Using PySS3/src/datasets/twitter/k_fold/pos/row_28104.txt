My insane experience with a toad So basically my two friends and I were chillin' and one of my friends was like "holy shit it's a toad", and we looked over and it was jumping around. I think we scared it because it started vigorously pissing everywhere. After a while I think it got too scared, so he took off its costume and he got into his car and left.
