My one fear I feel kinda sad so I thought this will distract me. So my one true fear is getting cucked by an other guy. I have a long distance relationship and the girl I love has sometimes friends to party  with (with alcohol). I just fear that something happens while I send her cute messages and stuff. I know it's dumb because she is trustworthy but the unpleasent feeling won't go away. If you read this which I know you probably do: I love you and know that you can be trusted ^_^. But I just had to get this out.
