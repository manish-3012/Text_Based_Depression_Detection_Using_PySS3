It doesn't work like that I have seen many edgy kids telling if they could time travel they would kill Hitler and all that. But that straight up doesn't work. First off, ww2 would have still happened because the political tensions were exploding, even without Hitler. And second, why does  everyone forget Mussolini and Hirohito? Germany didn't do anything himself! I'm sorry if you already knew this, I just wanted to say this.
