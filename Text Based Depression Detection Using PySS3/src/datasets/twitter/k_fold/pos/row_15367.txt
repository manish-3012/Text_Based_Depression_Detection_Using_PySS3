I wish I didn't exist literally if I didn't exist, my family would be off way better than they are now; I fucking messed everything up when I was born, when I die, I'll regret it all. I mean seriously, looking at old pictures of my family to see how they were before I was born makes me feel bad, because they all looked better off, but nope, god for some fucking reason made me exist.

I'm lazy, I'm whiny, I'm sensitive, and a cry baby, God must've made me so he could laugh at me all day.

At this point, I might just kill myself, and I had this thought in my head for probably 3 or 4 years, the only problem to this: I don't know how, maybe you guys can give me some tips in the comment section? So I can fucking kill myself and stop the suffering for my family.
