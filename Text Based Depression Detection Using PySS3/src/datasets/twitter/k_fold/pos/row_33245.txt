how do i tell my parents that i want a lock on my door? so im 16/M and dont have lock on the door to my room, which means that if i wanna jack off without having a risk of getting busted, i have to use the bathroom. So how do i tell my parents that i want a lock without it sounding like "hey can i have a lock on my door so i can jack off in peace?" my parents arent very strict and the only reason why i dont have a lock already is because its pretty much the default to not have a lock on your door where i live.
