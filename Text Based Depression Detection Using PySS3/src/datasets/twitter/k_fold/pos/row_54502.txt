Help me So uh recently our class had a really big falling out and I've deleted all forms of communication w/them. I need a hobby or something to do, because I was just dumped by my girlfriend and best friend. Please give me something so I don't just fall asleep sad forever now. Also does this flair mean Im giving advice or taking it? I'm taking advice.
