I almost crashed a car into my house So I'm 14 and live in Ohio where you get a license at 16 with all the proper requirements. My school doesn't have a driving class so my mom had me start doing small tasks in my dads old car (which he doesn't care about anymore). I did everything mom wanted me to do except when it was time to stop I forgot how to clutch and my short legs didn't help me push the brake enough so I kinda just kept going forward. I ended up just turning the car off because i was way too close to the house. We resolved the issue and pulled the car out because it was stuck in a muddy area.
My dad came home from work like an hour later and was really upset. He didn't care about if I was okay he worried about the car (remember he doesn't care about that) and the yard (which also was only a small spot that was slightly damaged due to the spin out) and I just feel really guilty about it but my mom is proud of me and says its all good. She also said its going to be a good story in the future so I'm not looking forward to that.
But basically my mom was mad at my dad for being mad at me so she got me a McDonald's fudge sunday and chickie nuggies :)
