I hope that youâ€™ve at least heard Yonkers before, even if you arenâ€™t a fan of rap. This song and itâ€™s music video are incredible. *WARNING* if you are squeamish you may want to look away for a bit. Another *warning*, some of these lyrics are...... well youâ€™ll see. Just know you might heard a few slurs and some light threatening of Bruno Mars. 

Internet Money feat. Don Tolliver, Nav, and Gunna - Lemonade

To cleanse your soul of the horror that is Yonkers listen too this song that is meant for you to turn up too. 


By the way I had no fucking clue what song to recommend today, so I left it up to a group chat and two songs were basically tied and these are those two songs. Thank my friends for multiple songs today boys.
