I (m16) like a girl (16) and I don't really know what I should do. So basically that, but here's some more info. We've known each other for about 8 months and can say just about anything to each other. I think we have a very good friendship, but I don't know if I should take a shot if it could mean fucking up what we have now. I already know that I will confess, but I don't really know when since we haven't even seen each other since covid and have only texted and played video games with each other. So wtf should I do. Wait to see her in person or do it over text.
