Which are some social cues I should look for when socializing with teenagers? Hey teenagers, I've always struggled with socializing and social cues. I can never detect whether a person wants to be my friend or is just tolerating me. I always either overreach (do things the other person isn't comfortable with) or never talk to someone who may want to talk to me. That's why I'm asking this.
