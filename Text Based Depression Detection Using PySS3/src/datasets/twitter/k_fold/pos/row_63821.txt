2003 dropout year Honestly if u were born in 2003 I feel like honestly it's better to drop out of highschool an get a job rn and get your GED and go for a trade or apprenticeship or something like that then go back into highschool an do shit in your last year cause they don't know how to deal with covid like get a full time job get some certificates like whmis or food handlers or shit like that an make money then go to a death trap of a school were your set up to become infected or waste hours doing online schooling to fail an retake a year anyways so go on a gap year an make money an save it so if u really wanna go to college or uni ur most likely gonna have to retake it anyways
