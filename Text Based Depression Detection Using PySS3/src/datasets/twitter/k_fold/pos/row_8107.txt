Can you be straight and non-binary? Thereâ€™s a 14 year old guy with a vagina at my school who is non-binary and I heard him say that if youâ€™re non-binary you canâ€™t be straight. 

This confused me a bit because I thought non binary means you could be any gender depending on how youâ€™re feeling which means that you could be attracted to the opposite sex for the preferred gender you are that day. 

Iâ€™d like your thoughts on this and Iâ€™m wondering if you can be straight while being non-binary.
