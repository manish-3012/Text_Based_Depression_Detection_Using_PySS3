I quit contact with my friends a week ago, no one has made an effort to talk to me. 
I'm 16 F, Basically, what the title says. I quit all social media except reddit and discord (idk if it counts as social media though) Honestly I'm done. You know I used to be fairly popular in school, I'm a junior in high school for reference. You know I never had to eat lunch alone and all, it's hard being popular going to parties, hanging out with people etc. But it suck ass. No one cares about me literally. The least you could do is call, right, but turns out my friends are fake friends and they don't give a fuck. I've been in depression since the beginning of lockdown. No one had a clue. Anxiety made me quit social media, and now look at me 

I was literally nice to everyone and now look at me. Sometimes I feel like I'm a paper girl, living in a paper town, and I think I have a very few strings left.

I hate my friends. Please dont do this to your friends, regularly check in on them, ask them how they are doing, ask them if they are ok, it sucks to go through anxiety and depression alone. Thanks for coming to my TED talk
