I love college Had to wake up at 6 am this morning cause the fire alarm in my building went off, didnâ€™t even have time to put my glasses on. The cops usually show up when the alarm goes off but they didnâ€™t this time, we had to wait outside in the rain for ten minutes till the alarm turned off :) went back to sleep at work up at 8 for class
