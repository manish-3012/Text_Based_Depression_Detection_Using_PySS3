how do people deal with like, existing? like it's kinda weird but, idk i an constantly feeling just, empty? if that makes sense. kinda just don't want to do,,, basically anything. even things that i like doing. ive pushed most people away, yeah they were toxic so ig they called for it, but like, what do i do now? i just feel empty. i no longer have anything to look forward to, no one to crush on, i kinda just don't feel emotions anymore. I'm just,,,tired ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
