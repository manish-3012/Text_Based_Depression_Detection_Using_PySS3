Our friendship is falling apart Idk what to do our relationship is getting harder to keep going. I can't lose my only real friend. Both of us don't want to leave each other but it's getting worse day by day. There are terrible mistakes I did and I just hate the fact that I will not stop doing those mistakes. I don't even know if it'll get better even if I can stop doing those mistakes.
