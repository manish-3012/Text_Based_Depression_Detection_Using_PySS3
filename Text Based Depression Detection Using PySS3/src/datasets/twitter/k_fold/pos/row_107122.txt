Today I start possibly the hardest challenge I've ever faced  From today onwards, I will try to no longer masturbate. Yes, this is something serious and not a meme at all. For me, this is a challenge to see how strong I am how long I can avoid; I want to see w long I can last without straying from the correct path of losing my will to masturbate.

The rules are the following:

\- No masturbating whatsoever;

\- No edging;

\- Watching porn or reading sauce is allowed (though it will only make the challenge harder);

Thank you in advance to anyone who follows me in this journey of mine. If something important happens then I will edit in the day and state what happened.
