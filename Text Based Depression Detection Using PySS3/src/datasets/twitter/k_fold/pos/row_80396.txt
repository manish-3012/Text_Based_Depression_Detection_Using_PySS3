Hello! first time posting here haha. and for the clickbaity title so people click on this, my dad died 2 days ago and this is me venting. Hello! first time posting here. and I honestly feel really shitty. so anyway yeah the whole dad dying thing happened for me at 14 sooooo uhh yea. I'm kinda sorry that I took inspiration for this post from another one that's similar in this sub. anyway, the reason this is so stressful is that there is multiple and ill start now. 1. I live on the other side of the country, I live in West Virginia and my dead father has died in California and sadly my family is extremely poor so we weren't able to see his funeral and probably wot be able to see his headstone for months and then I have to suddenly deal with my mom being way harsher with me for even breathing and shit. anyway he was a garbage person and constantly abused my mom before the divorce and yea but I still cared for him cuz he's my dad and my mom accused me of wanting to go to California only cause its fun and not cause I actually wanna see his head stone
