A childhood â€˜friendâ€™ is currently in the process of being arrested in my street at midnight Itâ€™s his 18th birthday, and in the midst of an alcohol-infused rage, he smashed his houses windows, and heavily insulted his parents and grandparent. Idk why. The police arrived, his dad disowned him, and he ran off down the street before being caught. I have no idea whatâ€™s going to happen to him next, but this is just kinda sad. I mean, what a way to be reintroduced to somebody you spent almost every waking hour with around 7 years ago lol.

Idek what to think. He isnâ€™t a particularly kind-hearted person, and Iâ€™m very glad that I was able to stop associating with him...but itâ€™s difficult to not feel shitty about the situation, even just as an (extremely tired) observer

I originally intended to write something mildly more interesting related to the policeâ€™s handling of the situation, whilst simultaneously reflecting on change and identity, but idk screw that. I donâ€™t have any apt words. A house without windows.
