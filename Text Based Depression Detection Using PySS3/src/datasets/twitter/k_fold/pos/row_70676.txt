Is this normal? So for the past couple of months I've heard kids at my school tell their parents everything that goes on with them, this is the majority of the people I know. Like who said what and stuff. However with my mom I hardly tell her anything except like got a ... on a test or there is a book report I have to do. I'm not sure if something happened but I remember my mom getting mad at me for something stupid at school I cant remember, I just wanna know what the deal is
