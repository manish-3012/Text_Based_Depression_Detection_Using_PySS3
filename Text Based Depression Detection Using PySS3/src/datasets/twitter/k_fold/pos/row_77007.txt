My friend watched porn in my Google acount... So, I discovered it 2 days ago, but we need some more context here


When Pokemon Go were trending, I were the best trainer in the whole school(still), but I didn't tell it to nobody. These days a guy "redownloaded" it and everyone did the same thing, and then I beat the shit out of their Pokemons asses. After that a friend's came to me and said something like:

Hey "Choko", put your account in my phone so I can farm to you on Pokemon!

And I thought:

He's pretty dumb and doesn't know nothing at all about hacking and destroying people's life, ok them...

I did it, some weeks after that when I where managing my account (trading my profile picture) I found horrible things in my "Web and apps history" like:

*In one night*

"Elderly hot ladies" at 00:05Am

"Asian and sexy" at 00:11Am (early cummer I think)

"Gay" (I think he's not bi or gay, probably just an accident looking at the time) at 00:12Am

"Russian girls" at 00:12Am

"Naruto hentai" 00:23Am

...  


Long list that only ended at 01:04 Am :(


Please tell me how to erase my mind...
