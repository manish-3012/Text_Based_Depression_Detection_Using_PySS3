I just turned 18 I just turned 18 and Iâ€™ve just finished crying for the 3rd time, Initially wasnâ€™t sure if itâ€™s tears of joy or sadness. Then it hit me I was crying because Iâ€™m literally growing up and in a few years Iâ€™ll be moving out my parents house and probably doing big people things and it makes me sad to think I wonâ€™t be young forever. I wish I could have done more but sadly most of my major events like prom and graduation got canceled due to covid and Iâ€™ve spent my first year of college all online. Itâ€™s sad but I canâ€™t wait till lockdown is over! I always try look at the bright side of things yano
