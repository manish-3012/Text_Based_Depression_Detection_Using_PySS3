I FINALLY GOT A GIRLFRIEND!!! We met a few months ago at school after she joined my friend group. It wasn't until a week later that we became friends and I only started having feelings for her a few weeks ago. We  started hanging out more and talking over snap and she started to get flirtatious, it was mostly under the nose and i didn't notice until one of my friends pointed out. That's when i knew I had to make my move, so i asked her to go to the movies with me and she said yes! We had a great time and held hands at the cinema, we both blushed a lot. I think she likes me a lot and I feel the same way, hopefully this lasts forever and i don't screw this up. Wish me luck for the future guys!
