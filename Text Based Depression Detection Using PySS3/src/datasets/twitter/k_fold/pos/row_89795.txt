I made a game So I just thought I'd share something I've done that I'm actually proud of: I made a game. Yes sir, I put my time effort into programming this little simple game. It's nothing too big or ambitious, it's a simple game in fact, but still I'm proud of how it came out and that I managed to commit to it till the end.  


If you want you can check it out [here](https://jacodepa.itch.io/the-island). If you do end up playing it, I'd really appreciate if you could tell me what you think about it, even if it's something negative, I'm always willing to get some criticism if it helps me improve.
