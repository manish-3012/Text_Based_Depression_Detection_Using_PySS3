Hopefully my eyelids donâ€™t puff up tomorrow morning :,) Started wearing contacts, absolutely love them. I had a fever about 3 weeks later, my eyelids puffed up. Apparently it could have been a reaction to the contacts, accelerated by the fever. Had to wait for the swelling to go down, put them back in today, if my eyes swell tomorrow then itâ€™s the contacts. I like how I look without glasses, not wearing them boosts my self esteem, theyâ€™re impractical and face masks fog them up like a field in the early hours of a spring morning. Big sad if I have to go back to glasses - update tomorrow morning :/
