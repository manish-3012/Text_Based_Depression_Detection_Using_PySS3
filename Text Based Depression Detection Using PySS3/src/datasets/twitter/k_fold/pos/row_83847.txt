That time where I accidentally slapped my aunt. Me, my aunt, little brother, metro card with no credit, no money, we had to walk 2 km just to give back some books to the library.

We where returning home, walking up-hill through a park, I was ahead of the group, lost in my own thoughts, as usual. When suddenly, my aunt had the great idea to run at me, just to scare me.

She gets ahead of me, full speed, buries her fingers in my sensitive belly and yells "AH HI !!!!"

Fight or flight reflexes kick in.

Fight.

BY REFLEX, I SLAPPED MY AUNT.

Felt like a piece of shit for the rest of the day.

Apologized like 6 times.

She says no problem.

It was literally a year ago, and I still feel like shit about what I did... She is such a sweet woman.
