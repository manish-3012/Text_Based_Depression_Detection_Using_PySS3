What/who do you think created the whole universe? I don't believe in god, at least i don't believe in it as the religion tries to describe it. i do believe in an superior entity, but even then, who/what sended that entity, we quickly find ourselves in a loop. The earth, the solar system the whole univers, nothing of this was supposed to exist. No one said that this whole thing were we find outselves must exists, yet here i am doing this post. What really makes me feel a mix of sadness and anger is the fact that if we ever find an answer to all this questions, i won't be there to hear it. I guess it doesn't make any difference since i think all of this is beyond our knowledge. I feel a big hole in my stomach.
