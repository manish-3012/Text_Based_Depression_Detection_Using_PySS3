Pewdiepie fans are worse than dream fans  Both channels have similar demographics but I feel like pewdiepie fans are *so* much more annoying. I've never once seen a pewdiepie meme that didn't look straight out of r/4PanelCringe, and it doesn't help that his subreddit constantly gets on the reddit trending page.
(not talking about serious issues in the communities btw so don't get into discourse)
