Any advice on how to lose face fat / glow up before school? Hey guys! So, over the course of quarantine I've gained some weight and quite frankly my face in particular feels and looks chubbier than it has been before and I'm not happy with it at all. I go back to school in around 2 months and I'd love to improve in terms of my body as much as possible. Thanks!
