So there is this girl that I like but I met her over the internet. I know what she looks like, I know what she sounds like, I know a bit about her (including her age). She's nice,  we have similar interests and we get along quite well.

I dont know what to do since I dont know her that well and she doesnt know what I even look like. I am really unsure on what to do, I just keep thinking of her and it's already 1am. 

Please help me lads, I have no clue what I'm doing. Call me insane and what have you, but I never had a relationship before or even liked a girl. So I really need some help, but I doubt reddit is my go-to. I guess it's worth asking anyway.
