What the heck help me Weâ€™ve gotten so close, we know almost everything about each other and weâ€™ve touched a lot. We were sitting alone for 20 minutes just there holding hands time to time and my arm around her. All of this happens and she tells me sheâ€™s into someone else? I never asked she just said â€œdo you want to know a secret?â€ And I say yes and she tells me she likes some other guy. What the actual heck. I thought she was trying to make me jealous but then she told me she emailed him something asking about some book I think. Itâ€™s obvious she wants to get closer to him but damn. I guess Iâ€™m kinda mad. I either wanna do one of the following:

- stop my jealousy 

- make her like me more

Someone help me thanks
