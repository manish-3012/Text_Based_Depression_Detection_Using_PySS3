I did a scientifical experiment With this experiment I wanted to measure the effects of smoking to heart rate. My hypothesis was that I'd find around 20% increase in beats per minute. 

I measured my resting heart rate. Then I smoked a cigarette. After that I measured my resting heart rate again.

Results:

Measurement one (before smoking) 67 bpm

Two (immediately after smoking) 102 bpm

Three (5 minutes after smoking) 80 bpm

Four (10 minutes after smoking) 77 bpm

The results showed that immediately after smoking my heart rate went up by 52 %. This was significantly higher increase than what I anticipated. 

Then my heart rate started to decrease towards 67 bpm again.
