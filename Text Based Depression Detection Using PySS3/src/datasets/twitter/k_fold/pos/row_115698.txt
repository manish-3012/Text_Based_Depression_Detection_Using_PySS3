Help me boyos I need to ask someone out and I'm freaking out. So last Saturday, after a college entrance exam me and a friend went out to eat, just us 2. We talked for like 2 hours over just 1 pizza. We told each other our secrets and fears etc... So ever since, I haven't been able to stop thinking about her and I really wanna ask her to be my girlfriend. I'm 18 and I've never had a girlfriend (I'm a guy btw). HOW DO I DO THIS?? We won't be seeing each other anytime soon btw, because of covid. So my only option is text. HALP ME PLISS
