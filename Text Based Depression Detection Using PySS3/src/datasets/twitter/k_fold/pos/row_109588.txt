I just learned how to whistle Somehow it never occurred to me that to whistle, you blow. I've been inhaling the entire time until that episode of Peppa Pig "I can't whistle" enlightened me after Peppa Pig said the "you put your lips together and bÍŸlÍŸoÍŸwÍŸ". Days of practice have passed, I can whistle correctly :'D
