Cops gross me out... (VIDEO) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/izfwn8/cop\_violently\_shoving\_an\_unarmed\_person\_from/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/izfwn8/cop_violently_shoving_an_unarmed_person_from/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

and to preface, no. i do not hate cops because of their actions like the ones shown in the video. I hate cops because of the larger institutional harms they contribute to, both inside and outside of what is legal.

but that being said, this video is a great example of the mentality that far too many cops have. They view the public as their enemy; a group to be subjugated and abused in order to keep them in line, not a populace that they themselves are a part of. Cops need a serious change of attitude in america, for their own sake as well. They are doing everything they can to make sure the younger generations grow to hate them. and honestly, they deserve the hate. 

for actions like the one pictured, and for many more reasons, they deserve it
