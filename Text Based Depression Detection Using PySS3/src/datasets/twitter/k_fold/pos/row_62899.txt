i want to run away from home my parents are extremely controlling and have made me feel shitty to the point where i have been considering self harm, this all started because i couldnt focus in online school, i feel like im going insane. they dont want me to talk to anyone that they dont know and recently i managed to get some money to buy a pc for myself, ive been waiting for this for years but they cancelled the order and bought me a laptop that they put parental controls on it. i feel awful help me please
