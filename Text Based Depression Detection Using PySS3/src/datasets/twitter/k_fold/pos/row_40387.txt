I wish schools had better mental health services for students Like sure there are school counselors but they aren't really for that and they will usually suggest therapy outside of school. But I don't think a lot of people realize that not having mental health services at school means that many people won't have access to it at all. And school can be so toxic a lot of people need therapy because of school alone.
