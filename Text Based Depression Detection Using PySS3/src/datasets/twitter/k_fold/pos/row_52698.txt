im running for president ill legalize weed while putting a 40% minimum tax on it. ill then use taht money for education and better welfare. after taht, ill end the war on drugs, legalizing all drugs. that'll cripple the cartels and will eventually phase them all out. then, no more unnecessary regulation for small business, and more environmental regulation for bigger businesses, while a bit more for small ones too. then, ill place a tax on vapes, and use taht money for rehabilitation for drug addicts. ill ignore all identity politics unless soomething like 2020 happens again, and ill focus on real issues. ill run as libertarian or democrat, since republicans will probably leave me the moment i bring up legalizing drugs. and my sologan will be "not like the other candidates" or "to our children and for america". vote for me
