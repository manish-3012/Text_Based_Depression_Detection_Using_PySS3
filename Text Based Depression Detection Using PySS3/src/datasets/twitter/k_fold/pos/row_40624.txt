my mum has sent me the most passive aggressive text about what i eat today basically trying to put it off nicely that she isn't happy with what i eat and indicating that she wants me to eat bigger meals, which i actually just can't bring myself to do.
for example i had some porridge for breakfast at 11am yesterday, had a few biscuits during the day and then toast at around 8pm.
i weigh 9 stone and i'm 6'2 idk if that means anything, but is it worth slowly eating more or is she over exaggerating??
