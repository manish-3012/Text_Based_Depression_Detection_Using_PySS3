Are my parents overreacting? So, for context I'm a 15yo male, today I got my results for the 1.5 months (in my school you get results every 1.5 months or so). I had fairly good marks, just one, Dutch.. I forgot to tell my parents about the fact that the only test for Dutch in this timespan of 1.5m was some hour long listening test.. I didn't get good marks on that, so my total percentage for Dutch was bad. The thing is tho, I simply forgot to tell them. And so now my parents are furious cuz I didn't tell them, and claim this is a "lie". I partially agree, but getting all mental over something I forgot? Now I can't game for about 2w, I'm pretty pissed about it. Is this an over reaction?
