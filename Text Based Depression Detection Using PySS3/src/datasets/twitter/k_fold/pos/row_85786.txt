i think i messedup okok I am almost certain that I will get downvoted but here we go. 
So i've liked this girl for a while now. We were snapping, and I we were using some filter that just said "Which person in the friendgroup am I?" and it would give you a random stereotype. I got "The one that always skips legday" Which I said "The only thing I train is my right arm". She replied with "uhoh". She usually stops snapping at like 6-7. Which she did now. She snapped like 5 more minutes after that and then left me on opened. She does like dark houmor so I didn't think shed think anything about it, but maybe she thought otherwise? I am probably just overthinking, but oh well. How was your day?
