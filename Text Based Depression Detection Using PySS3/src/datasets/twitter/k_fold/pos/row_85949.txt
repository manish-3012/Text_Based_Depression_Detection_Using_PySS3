I dont like stans of anything. I dont like stans of anything cause they make something good hard to get into as an outsider. For example I like kpop but I usually dont tell people because of how toxic the stans are and I dont want people to think I'm like that. It's ok to really like something but dont attack people who dont share the same view, it's just stupid. This doesnt just apply to kpop it applies to most stan communities and it just damages the thing the community is built around. And I know that there are stans who dont act like that but I think they should just call themselves super fans or something other than stan so that people dont get the wrong idea.
