Follow up post from a few months back Hey its been a while but this is a follow up post to one I made a few months back. I took a long break from most of my life and went upstate from where I live. I can't say my mental health is better but I'm no longer considering suicide. If you have any questions feel free to ask. But I want to know what's been going on here.
