Hmm spooky unknown caller This person has been calling me 4 or 5 times every few days for the past few weeks, and I finally answered the phone and put myself on mute and the guy is like "Hello? Hello is this -name-" and I panicked because I dont know the number and the person doesnt sound familiar.
I'm now kind of scared because I dont give my number out to many people, much less strangers.. and even weirder it's a landline so it won't let me text it, and the area code is the same as mine.
I've tried doing number searches but nothing shows up.

Hmm..
