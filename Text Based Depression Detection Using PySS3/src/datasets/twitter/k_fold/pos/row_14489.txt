No-one actually knows me I don't talk to my parentd at all and they think I'm still like what I was like like 4 years ago

My "friends" don't know anything about what I actually like or anything

And if you were to look at my post history you wouldn't have any idea either

This isn't that boohoo I'm so sad no-one understands me kinda post. I'm not really sad about that, I do wish things were different though, but they're probably not going to change for as long as I live here
