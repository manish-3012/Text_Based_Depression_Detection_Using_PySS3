The fuck is up with people using men who are victims of rape/false rape allegations as a way to denounce feminists? Did you see that post on r/noahgettheboat today? With the woman getting arrested for false rape accusations? Look at the comments. 


Dude, feminists support these men. We *want* men to feel comfortable speaking up about sexual assault. If a woman thinks otherwise, she is not a feminist. 


Please stop getting all your knowledge of feminists from Buzzfeed, dudeðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸
