Dear Mom's and Dad's, please, dont compare your children to others. Now i know that you are doing it without thinking you are doing harm. But nothing is more off putting then hearing. "Oh you made food, you are becoming more like your sister." Or "Jhonny got 80 on the test how come you only got 60". After hearing this Teens ussualy feel demotivated and dont want to do whatever they did again because they know they are going to get paired to someone again. Some teens might enjoy having themselves compared to someone higher or who they look up to. But i think majority of us don't.
