i feel guilty for not wanting to talk to a guy from my high school i just feel bad about it but heâ€™s not getting the hint when i donâ€™t reply for a full day and he just triple messages me and i donâ€™t want to be mean and say â€œlisten man i donâ€™t want to chatâ€ because i would feel like a bitch. heâ€™s a really nice person, i just donâ€™t want to talk to him ... at all. 

my other friends told me to just block him and not think about it, but i would feel even more guilty if i did that :/
