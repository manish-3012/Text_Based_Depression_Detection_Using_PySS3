I'm sick of being called an "effeminate male". I'm just done with society. People need to realize that this isn't the the 1900s anymore and that time has passed. I grew up close to my mother which made me attracted to more feminine characteristics. I always get ridiculed for that. So guys can't like the color pink just because you've been told that it's a feminine quality?  I really want to change my first name into something more feminine sounding. Fuck, I prefer wearing a dress over a suit. But I know that God won't allow that which is a shame. I love God but I also want to be myself. And I apologize for being all over the place, I just need somewhere to vent all my thoughts to. I'm done burdening everything.
