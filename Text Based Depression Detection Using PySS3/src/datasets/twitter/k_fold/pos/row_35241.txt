Bruh moment I just hiked for like 4 hours and my feet hurt like hell and I said . Ughh,I don't want to walk anymore and my mom was like ,,OMG DON'T SAY THAT GOD WILL TAKE UR LEGS".And it's not even something uncommon like if I say something like ,,I don't want to go to school I'm so tired" my dad yells at me and says ,, YOU'LL END UP ON THE STREETS HOMELESS AND YOU WILL DESTROY YOUR LIFE"
