I can't wait until I move out My mother can never stand to be corrected. Her word is always final. She said "Wiping down the countertops is part of doing the dishes" which simply isn't true and when I point that out, she got mad at me. "Clean the kitchen =/= "do the dishes" and I did the dishes like she fucking asked. But when she comes in the kitchen, all she sees is that the countertops are still dirty. I would've cleaned them if she said to clean the kitchen. But she said to do the dishes, so now the fact that the kitchen isn't clean is my fault? 

Petty rant but this shit is so annoying. Whenever I do what's asked, it's always "why didn't you do this, this, and this, too?"

And I have two sisters who should also being helping clean, but they don't. They always complain and ignore the problem until we all get yelled at and I still end up doing it myself.
