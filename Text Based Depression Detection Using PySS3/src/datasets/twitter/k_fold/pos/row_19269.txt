My Best Friend Kissed Me On The Cheek So for a bit of context, me and my friend Hannah were watching old videos that me and her made when we were younger and made a video about us reacting to those said old videos. After I kinda teased her on an editing error, she randomly leaned in and kissed me on the cheek.

I honestly dont know why, but I think it's because maybe she has a crush on me. Any advice/questions?

And no, this isnt a dumb cash grab so I can get 1 million useless medals, I'm genuinely reaching out for help. No need to give me anything.
