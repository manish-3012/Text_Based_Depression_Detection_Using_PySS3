Iâ€™m tired of kids that have loving parents, a good house, and a full life ahead of them joining gangs because itâ€™s cool. Bruh the real gangsters are trying to get to where youâ€™re at bro. Youâ€™re stepping down to a level you shouldnâ€™t be in. You were given all of this shit and then decide to just throw it away? Youâ€™re sad as fuck if you do dude. Iâ€™d like my uncle to give you a fucking lesson on what youâ€™re doing bruh. My uncle was given a hard ass life, just like my dad, yet they chose two completely different paths. Both of their parents were alcoholics that would beat them, sell their items for drug money, and commit tax fraud so theyâ€™d end up losing their home. My dad decided to bust his ass and work his way out of it. My uncle went the other direction because he saw no alternate path. He is now serving life in prison. The fact that you were given something your parents worked extremely hard for to give you as a kid, and you throw it away, is beyond embarrassing.
