You know, reddit and Tik Tok aren't actually that different. I mean both have great stuff but have a massive side that Is just terrible. And it's fanbases are just bleh. Yeah you can call me out for using reddit while saying reddit bad, but tbh, i don't really like it. Only difference between Tik Tok and reddit is that Tik Tok is based on vids and reddit isn't.
