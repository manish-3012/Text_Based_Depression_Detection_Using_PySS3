The thought of MAPs makes me actually sick I donâ€™t know man like I genuinely felt nauseous just thinking about what horrible things theyâ€™d do to a child.

Sometimes I want to go hunting for them but Iâ€™m too scared of talking to people and I donâ€™t have the right materials to do so.

They just suck and I hate them.
