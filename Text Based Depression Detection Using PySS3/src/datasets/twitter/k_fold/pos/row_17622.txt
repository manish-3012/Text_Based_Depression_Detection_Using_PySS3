I FINALLY GET TO SEE A GOOD DOCTOR UGH FINALLY. My original doctor was awesome, but she retired when I was like, 11, and my new one took me off my ADHD meds which ABSOLUTELY FUCKED ME OVER. I mean, he was cool to talk to and we talked about anime and stuff, but he wasnâ€™t great at his job.

IM SO FUCKING HAPPY I CAN GET BACK ON MY ADHD MEDS!!!! Yâ€™all have no idea how hard it is to quit adhd meds cold turkey. Itâ€™s like, going from a genius to the biggest moron on earth. Because I was taken off I developed: depression, anxiety, paranoia, and of course, Iâ€™m failing all my core classes. Itâ€™s such a relief that Iâ€™ll finally be able to just, exist normally again.
