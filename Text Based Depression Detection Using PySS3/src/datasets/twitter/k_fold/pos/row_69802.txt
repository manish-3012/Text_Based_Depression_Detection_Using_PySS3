The most interesting thing happened today So i was in band class and the class was gonna end so we were all just standing around talking meanwhile our teacher was cleaning the chairs for the next class and i decided to say something so as loud as i can i say EA SPORTS and then out of  nowhere my teacher says â€œits in the gameâ€ im glad my teacher is so cultured
