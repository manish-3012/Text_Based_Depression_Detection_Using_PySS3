An advice to everyone here Alright I just finished my stretches and as I was stretching I thought I should give give everyone here an advice for 2 things.

The first one is about deodorant.

I have seen many people who don't know hot to use deodorant and it's...really sad tbh. First of all, I suggest you use the roll one and not the spray because at least in my experience sprays ain't so good. First of all you don't use deodorant when you are already sweaty, you use deodorant after you take a bath, then u use it again before you do something (like exercising or going out) and then u use it again when you are finished. Deodorant doesn't magically make you not smell bad. It prevents you from smelling bad before you are all in sweat. Of course, taking a bath once a day or at least once every 2 days is also important.

The 2nd advice is for people who don't exercise here, I am not going to body shame you or something but even if you get offended...then this advice isn't headed towards you in the first place. I think that even 10 minutes of stretching before going to sleep is better than nothing, like of course, working out during the day for an hour or two is even better but if you are not willing to do that I suggest that you try to do  stretching for 10 minutes before going to sleep for a week or two and it will be at least better than nothing.
