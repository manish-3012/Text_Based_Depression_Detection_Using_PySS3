Rant/ need a tad bit of help : ) PREFACE -  basically, since covid has happened, i have lost all of my social ability and quite a bit of my friend group has split up. I used to be a very social person who could easily walk up to anyone, but now i am a lot more by-myself. (bear in mind this only happens to me at lunch times, during lessons im fine) now at lunch times, im probably with 1 or 2 other people (3 max) and all of us are kind of held together by 1 person

I have just learned that the person who holds the group together will no longer be able to be out at lunch times. this means i am lost of what i am going to do, i literally feel like i will have no-one

sorry if some of this does not make sense, not only has covid took away my social skills, but it has also took away my grammer
