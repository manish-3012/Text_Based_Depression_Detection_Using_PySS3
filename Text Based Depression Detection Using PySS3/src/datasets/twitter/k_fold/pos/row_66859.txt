I wasn't feeling well today so I took like 9264838 naps I've been ~~really~~ stressed lately mainly bc of my finals and I kept sleeping as soon as I got up, hoping that maybe just one more nap and I'll get up feeling better and feel a bit fresh and happy ðŸ˜³ but it's like 5pm now ðŸ˜³ can't sleep anymore, gotta get back to studying. fuck
