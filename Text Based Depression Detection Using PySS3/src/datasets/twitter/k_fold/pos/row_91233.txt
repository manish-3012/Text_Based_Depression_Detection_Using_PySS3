Does anyone else feel like any subreddit besides teenagers is really mean? Iâ€™ve noticed after being on reddit for maybe two years, every time I post in another subreddit people can be really cruel. I tried posting in ask reddit and my post got trolled to hell and my direct messages filled with some really hateful stuff. 

I tried posting in life pro tips and literally the entire comments were filled with people calling me a bad person, and while I understand their perspective, I just wish they had been willing to be a bit nicer about it. 

Every time I try posting in casual conversations my post just gets removed for â€œnot facilitating conversationâ€ even though I make an effort to include phrases like â€œcan anyone relate to this?â€ and â€œdoes anyone else have a different perspective?â€ 

I honestly just feel like itâ€™s impossible to interact with the reddit community without having to delete half your posts and avoid opening your direct messages. Maybe thatâ€™s just the collateral damage of being a teenage girl on the internet, but I donâ€™t understand why it has to be this way. Everyone always talks about how all other social media is terrible and fake, but literally every other social media Iâ€™ve been on has been nicer and more accepting then reddit. Who made up these arbitrary rules- you canâ€™t talk about having an instagram account, use emojis, or frankly do anything without receiving public hate. I find that teenagers is the only subreddit where people will react to your posts without immediately trying to think of what hate comment will hit you the hardest. 

I know the reaction to this post is just going to be â€œstop using reddit,â€ and thatâ€™s entirely valid, but reddit provides a unique community where you can interact with people that share your specific passions and opinions, and I donâ€™t want to loose that. All of this may be true: Iâ€™m just being too sensitive, I need to learn to take a joke, and itâ€™s my fault in the first place because my posts suck. Even if this is all fact, Iâ€™m making this post because I know I canâ€™t be the only person who feels alienated by a community they thought they would find acceptance in, and I want those people to know theyâ€™re not alone. Thank you to the teenagers subreddit for downvoting my posts to hell only half the time, and I hope the future of reddit is a little more accepting.
