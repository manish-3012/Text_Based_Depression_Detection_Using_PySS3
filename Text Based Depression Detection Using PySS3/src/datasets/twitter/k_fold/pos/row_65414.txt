My whole 8th grade year this girl teased me. Not sure if she hated me or liked me. I need advice. We had art class together. She drew on me. Drew on my papers. Always decided to sit by me in class, the whole year. She would smack the back of my head, not hard just a tap. Say hi to me in the hallways, only she did this 10x a day everyday. She told a lot of her friends about me. She got her two best friends to like me. She said I looked like her ex once, her ex was a good looking guy. She also said I looked buff once. She would call be bighead and peenhead. She kissed my friend once and then looked directly at me. She said she thought I hated her once. She came over to sit by me in lunch with a bunch of her friends for a period of time. Iâ€™m not sure if she hated me or liked me. Can you help? She definitely couldâ€™ve hated me and I could be twisting everything in my mind because I like her and I had a crush on her. Although I didnâ€™t show it, I didnâ€™t really pay her any mind. I slept through most of my school days. What do you think?
