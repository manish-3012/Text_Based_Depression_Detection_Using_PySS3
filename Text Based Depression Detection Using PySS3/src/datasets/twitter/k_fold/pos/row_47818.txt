Some advice for y'all After 1 year on Reddit, I thought I'd take the opportunity to give everyone here some friendly advice. 

Looking through r/teenagers, I see a lot of posts regarding teenagers being frustrated about not being in a relationship/being rejected my their crushes. One of the biggest pieces of advice I can give you guys is it really doesn't matter. Being single can be great, you have more freedoms and mates are just as important as girlfriends/boyfriends. Keep that in mind. It is also unlikely that you will find your forever person at this age. For those of you in a happy relationship I salute you, and wish you all the best for your future. And for those of you who aren't, take my advice and try to be happy! 

It's easy for you to think that the reason you aren't in a relationship is that you just aren't good enough, but this is a bad mentality. Negative thoughts like these can spiral and make your life a hell of a lot more difficult, trust me I've been there. You just have to remember that with something as personal as a relationship, you can't put it down to your flaws. You have to just accept that maybe you aren't right for each other, and push those unhelpful thoughts to the back of your mind.

I wish you all the best for your futures, and the best of luck in life. Thank you for taking the time to read this it's quite a long post :)
