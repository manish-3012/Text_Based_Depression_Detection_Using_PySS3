This is hard for me to talk about, but I need to vent... 

I just found out that my dad is actually my adoptive dad. My real dad is Phil Swift. Not only that, but my mom isnâ€™t my real mom either. My real mom is Nikki Bella from WWE. I canâ€™t believe they didnâ€™t tell me about this. I am so upset I could puke.
