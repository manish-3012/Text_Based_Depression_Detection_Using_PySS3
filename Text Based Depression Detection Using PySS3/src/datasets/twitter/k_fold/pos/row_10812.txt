Is my friend flirting with me? Ok so, me and my friend/crush are both huge nerds. We were playing minecraft together tonight and we were the only ones in the discord voicechat. 

He asked me about the original species Iâ€™m making for a comic. The thing is, the first quistion he asked was about how the species reproduced. He sounded very sweet and genuinly interested (like always). He also made it â€œofficialâ€ that I helped him with a thing he was building in Mc.

Was he nerd-flirting with me or am I looking too much into this? (I just kinda got some vibes from him I guess)
