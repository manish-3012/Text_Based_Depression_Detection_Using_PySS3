Have you ever been humiliated by a teacher? A senior teacher who makes everyone quiver in fear when she walks through the hallways, pulled my cheeks in front of my whole class. I am very humiliated. While all my classmates were being asked to mind their behavior, I was being treated like a cute puppy you meet on the street. Having a babyface is a curse.
