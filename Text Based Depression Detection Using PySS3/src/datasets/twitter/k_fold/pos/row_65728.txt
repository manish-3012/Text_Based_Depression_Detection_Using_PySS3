When I'm watching a movie or similar media I sometimes get a tingling/electric feeling in my arms, it seems to be in moments where it's emotional. Does anyone else experience it, and what is it called? I have absolutely no idea how to explain it, I've asked a friend about it and he says he's experienced the same thing
