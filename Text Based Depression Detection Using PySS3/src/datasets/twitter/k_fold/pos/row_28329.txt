Approaching a girl in my science class  Hey so I am attracted to a girl in one of my science classes but I donâ€™t have the courage to talk to her. Sheâ€™s from a different school and in the class there are about 5 boys and two girls and the teacher is almost always present. The teacher isnâ€™t that uptight but doesnâ€™t let students talk to each other.
