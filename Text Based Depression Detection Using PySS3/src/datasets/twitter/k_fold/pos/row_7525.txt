do not read this post if you hate furries. only furries and furry supporters are allowed to read this post I myself am not a furry, but I know people who are. But my life goals are to buy a big ass pikachu mascot costume [like this one](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/621510779476115496/766848001888747550/pikachu_1.png) and hang out at furry conventions, either waddling around like a dumbass, playing little games with people there, or doing funny dances for money, I'd have a lot of pictures taken and i'd probably fall over a lot and people would help me get up, people would record me fucking around and post it on twitter, insta, tiktok, or the like, and I'd have a lot of fun.
