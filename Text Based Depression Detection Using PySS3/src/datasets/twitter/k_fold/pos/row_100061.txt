What's something your friend can do for you that as a teenager you would appreciate it so much? It's little details that matters the most What's Something like a little friendly gesture you would appreciate so much? 

Maybe sending good morning &amp; night messages every day? 

Buying flowers for you ? 

Listening to music together ? 

Maybe compliments? 

 Your friend mentioning how much amazing you are? 

Enjoying your jokes &amp; funny moments ? 

Crying for you when you are going through hard time?
