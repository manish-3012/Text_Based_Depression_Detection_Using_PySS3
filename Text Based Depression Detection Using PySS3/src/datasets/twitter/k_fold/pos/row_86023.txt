MY CRUSH SAID HE LIKED ME AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO So here's the story:

My friend(Friend A) made a Google forms for fun asking how everyone feels about him. It was a completly unanimous form, but there was a question that allowed you to add your name if you wanted to. I have a bad sence of how people view me so I though I'd do the same and make a Google Form asking how people feel about me.

I get a couple responces that make me happy and stuff but I knew everyone hasent responded, so I waited more. I saw on the discord my friends are in and I see that "Crush" and his friend (My friend too but he's closer with "Crush") just did Friend A's form, so I decided to check my form too, and sure enough!

The form had questions like how close are we, so you wanna be closer, would you wanna go shopping or something, and finally - Do you have a crush on me?

I saw that he put his name on the form (which was optional) and he said he does, he would absolutly date me and he really likes me!!!!!!!!!

So heres the question - how should I ask him about it?!? What do I say?????
