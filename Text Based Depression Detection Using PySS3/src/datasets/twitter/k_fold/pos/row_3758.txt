Posting everyday until I get a girlfriend. Day: 24 So Iâ€™ve been getting some comments about how Iâ€™m pursuing this goal. Iâ€™m not saying that I am placing my whole happiness on a different person. The reason I have this goal is because, once I have a new girlfriend I know I will be over my last one. Because Iâ€™m still struggling with this after a month just as much as when it all happened. And once Iâ€™m over my last breakup I know I will be happy.
