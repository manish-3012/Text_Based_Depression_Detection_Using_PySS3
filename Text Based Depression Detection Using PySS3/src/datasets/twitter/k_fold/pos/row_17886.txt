My crush of 6 months just blocked me when I woke up this morning. I usually wake up to a good morning text from her saying good morning and that she loved me. Well this morning she didn't and I thought she must be asleep still, well at the bottom the the chat log I noticed it said "Chats are pending until user adds you back" My heart instantly dropped. I didn't say anything last night that would have pissed her off. I never go behind her back and say anything. So I don't know what to think. Maybe she just got bored of me? Or maybe she was talking to another person and they found out and got mad? but the last one is unlikely she wouldn't do that. So here I am just needing someone to tell me it gonna be fine or what ever while she's probably celebrating. I was about to post this when I remembered I have her close friend on snapchat so I might as well ask her
