Some people are just plain stupid So in my school we have students from 5th to 8th grade that are in middle school and students from 9th to 12th grade that are in highschool. That's how it is in my country. I heard Americans have it different.

For a couple of years we've been using a platform which allows teachers to grade us and send us messages online. This is good, but the students have too the power to send messages to anyone in the school.

So here we are. Today a kid from the 6th grade fucking put his instagram @ in a message to all students in the whole school (about 1500 people).

Edit: while i was writing this someone from the 9th grade put the classic rickroll link.

I will update if more people start doing this or if they get some sort of punishment.

Say what you want, that I'm a boomer and everything, but I don't what to think a teacher sent something important for it to be just an idiot announcing his IG or making an unoriginal unfunny meme.
