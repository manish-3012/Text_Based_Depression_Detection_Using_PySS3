I capitulate in exams - Help Iâ€™m currently 17 (year 12), and Iâ€™ll use mathematics as my example:

I love maths, I find the work good, Iâ€™ll be able to answer questions during class and also able to do my homework. But when I have a test is where I go wrong. I feel like I get overwhelmed and I start to overthink everything. 

A few months ago I did an algebra exam. I got just over 50%, and majority of the class got above 70%. I could easily do those questions at home or during class and score above 80%, but as usual, I capitulated and worries myself during the exam. 

I have another maths exam later this week, on circles and lines. Iâ€™ve spent a few weeks revising the test. I was feeling pretty good, until one of my maths teachers said that the test is going to be hard. He said he hadnâ€™t seen the test, but he knows itâ€™ll be hard 

So Iâ€™ve got even more anxious about the exam. So until the test, Iâ€™m just going to spend my time doing exam questions. 

But I fear I will capitulate and overwhelm myself again. Itâ€™s annoying, I can do well on the exams if it wasnâ€™t a test, so I try to psychologically tell myself itâ€™s not that big, but I know what Iâ€™m telling myself, so it doesnâ€™t really work. 

How can I stop myself being capitulated and overwhelmed?
