Riding a motorbike on an Indian Crowded street is the worst thing ever! Just don't do it. Just don't.


I did it today for the first time. Holy shit. Almost crashed 2 times.

People can come from anywhere. No rules. I almost hit a kid who was riding a tricycle, On a busy street! 

If a part of the speedbraker is broken, then people will pass from there only. No matter how narrow it is or on which side it is. 

Now I wonder how the hell my dad does it without crashing into anyone. There are a lot of close calls everytime.

Stress level instantly reaches 100 as you see everyone with their bike, car, cycle, tricycle, a cow and a cart coming towards you!

I am too scared after this.
