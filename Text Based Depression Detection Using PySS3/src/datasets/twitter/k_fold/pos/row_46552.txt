Little bro needs some friends to play fall guys on ps4 tmrw My brother (14) and I are only allowed to play video games once a week. He hasn't been able to talk to his friends because of the c-virus and so he doesnt have friends to play fall guys with. I cant play with him because its a single player game and its his favourite. I was wondering if anyone was down to play with at 10 a.m ET tomorrow (Sep. 14) for a couple hours? I'll PM the first 10 comments my psn and if I PM you just send me your psn back. Thanks guys.

P.S you do need to have a mic to talk because if you dont it kind of defeats the purpose.
