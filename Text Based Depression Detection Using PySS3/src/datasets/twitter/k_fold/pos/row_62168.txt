Guys today my cat died. This morning my cat who I adopted 2 months ago passed away today. I knew he wouldn't live long because he had leukemia but I didn't think that he would be gone so soon. I never really had any pets and I now really feel that having a pet is very enriching. You get all sorts of new experiences. This morning when he passed I stayed by him until he died. I felt that I didn't have enough time. I dug him a grave today and put him into his favorite bed. He wasn't the smartest cat in the world but he was my cat.
