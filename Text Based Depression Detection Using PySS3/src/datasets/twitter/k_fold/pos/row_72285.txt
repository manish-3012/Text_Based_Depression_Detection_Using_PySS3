u/what_if_we_jk_unless is no longer my daughter I abandoned her for being a naughty girl. She is not half an orphan. Her mom Ava will also abandon her and she will be an orphan and end up in da streets. I and Ava will then get married and our only daughter u/Putting_down_roots will live with us happily ever after.
