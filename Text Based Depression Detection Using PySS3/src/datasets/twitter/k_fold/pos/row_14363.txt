Unconditional Love A few weeks ago, I had an nice and open discussion with my lovely girlfriend. We talked about a lot of things, insecurities, daily life, just things that stressed us out, so that we comfort each other.

Mid way through our talk, I opened up about questioning my gender identity. Iâ€™m a 16 year old boy as of now, but Iâ€™ve always felt quite nice being referred to as â€œsheâ€ and â€œherâ€. Iâ€™ve always been more feminine than the average boy around me, and Ive always seemed to enjoy exploring my feminine side more than sticking to my masculine roots. Of course, Iâ€™m in touch with my masculine side, but I feel a strange and strong attraction to the femininity within myself.

After telling her this, she spoke to me calmly (as she always does). She told me,

â€œYou can identify as anything, I donâ€™t care. I love you, and I love being with you.â€ 

PLUS 

â€œI donâ€™t think anything can stop me from loving you. When I say my love for you is strong, I really do mean it. Youâ€™re perfect, and I love you so much, I truly do.â€

I cried so hard when she said this. Iâ€™ve finally found someone whoâ€™s love transcends my identity and their previous view on their sexuality. Unconditional love is hard to come by, itâ€™s rare, but itâ€™s still possible to find. We both love each other for who we truly are inside. 

When I was smaller, I had to grow up quick so I could deal with people who were struggling with substance abuse problems, and I had to learn how to diffuse situations and comfort my older sister when these thing happened. Mentally, Iâ€™ve aged about a thousand lifetimes. 

She really makes me feel like a kid again.
