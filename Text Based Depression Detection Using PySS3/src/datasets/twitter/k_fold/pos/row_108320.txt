Guys I have a question Lately Iâ€™ve been writing a lot of lyrics , and I feel like Iâ€™m getting. Better over time 
I wanna start making these lyrics into actual songs. The thing is , idk how to make beats or play any instrument
So is there any free computer program wich can make beats,melodys and record voice? 
Thank u in advance :)
