Midlife crisis at 18 (M) I had what would usually be a minor inconvenience on top of some other â€œminor inconveniencesâ€ on the same day and it made me feel completely useless, and lose all hope and self confidence I had in myself. I donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life and recently Iâ€™m just wondering why Iâ€™m here. How do I find my purpose and restore any shred of ambition I had before?  I feel like sleeping all day and things that used to make me happy like playing video games with friends isnâ€™t gratifying anymore. I feel lost but donâ€™t know what to do. How am I supposed to feel? Where do I start.
