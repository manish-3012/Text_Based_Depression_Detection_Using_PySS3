I am being forced to run against my will, is that ok? So you might have seen my earlier post. For a bit of context, i have divorced parents. I am overweight (210) and want to slim down to something like 170/18. Now, my dad wants me to run 8 laps around our property (around 2 miles) every single day, on top of the extreme yard work i do (feeding cows, unloading hay, etc.) I know he is just looking out for my health, but I feel like if i did something less severe, i would do it involuntary. Is him forcing me to run bad, or is it just me misunderstanding his view?
