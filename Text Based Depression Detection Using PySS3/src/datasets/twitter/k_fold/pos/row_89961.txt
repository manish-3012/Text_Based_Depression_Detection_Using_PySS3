Looking for some friends (possibly long term who knows) Hello. I'm 13m from the US. I enjoy listening to music and that usually what I do all day, I like to read, I like to write and thinking about actually writing a book and trying to get it published, I'm very awkward and shy so I won't seem interesting at first but trust me I get better lol, and I just need someone to talk to cause I have a lot going on rn (as much of us do) and just need someone to talk to and you can vent to me also. I'm usually very kind. So hmu if you wanna talk
