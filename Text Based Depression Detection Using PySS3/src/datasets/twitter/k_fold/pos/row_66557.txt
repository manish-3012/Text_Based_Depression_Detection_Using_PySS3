My dog almost ran away today So me and my grandma came home, while she was getting some bags, i went to put one inside, my dog quickly left the house i told my grandma to close the door, she didnt, i had to chase him, he went back but still running away, my brother managed to get him, i was already with shoes on so thats why i got a head start, it was really scary and i still think about â€œwhat if i didnt catch himâ€ and stuff like that

This also happened today, im writing this a few minutes after it happened, the reason is because i want to talk to some people i can trust, i almost had a panic attack.
