Itâ€™s not even fun, itâ€™s sad I donâ€™t know, I assume most people feel this way. Personally I donâ€™t like to jerk off. Doing it makes me feel like crap during and after. I get horny and I donâ€™t even like the Hub, I stay away from it too. I get horny and want to jerk off but itâ€™s a chore so then I just stand there sad and horny, does anyone ever feel like this? Honestly itâ€™s not even horny, itâ€™s just an urge.
