Reviewing random things every day until I get a boyfriend: Day 4 Day 4:

Today Iâ€™m reviewing a sky bison. I love sky bisons they are really cute and fluffy and big and hella practical, not to mention those things are supposed to be your BEST FRIEND FOR LIFE. Also those things are the OG air benders so Iâ€™m gonna have to give them extra points for that... Anyways I think we can all agree that sky bisons deserve a perfect 10/10

Anyways have a lovely day guys &lt;3 

P.s. I have no clue what to review tomorrow help ;-:
