am i not good enough so my girlfriend went over to her friends place today and her ex was there, but i knew shes loyal and wouldnt get into anything w him. i went to a resturant w family at the same time and when i got out i found out abt him hugging on her and she looked so happy. i got upset and told her i didnt like him being like that with her and she says, "but hes my friend and its not like that" but it really hurt to see her hugging up on another guy. i told her abt this and we started arguing. she plans to go back tm after we had plans to see eachother tm. what am i doing wrong? am i not good enough? it fucking hurts but i cant tell her that bc then im controlling and not letting her have friends. i genuinely love her and it just hurts.
