I saw you dancing in a crowded room You looked so happy when Iâ€™m not with you

But then you saw me, caught you by surprise

A single tear drop falling from youâ€™re eyes

I donâ€™t know why, I run away

Iâ€™ll make you cry when, I run away

You couldâ€™ve asked why I broke your heart

You couldâ€™ve told me that you fell apart

But you walked passed me like I wasnâ€™t there

And just pretended that you didnâ€™t care
