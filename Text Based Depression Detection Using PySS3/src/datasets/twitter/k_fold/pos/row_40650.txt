I hate Egypt i hate this place I hate Egypt i hate everything about it and everyone in it i hate its streets i hate it's education system i hate the government i hate how they think i hate how they're living 

Every dream i had is destroyed by Egypt 

Every wish every fantasy they destroyed it 

All hope for things to get better is shattered 

All plans go in vain 

I hate everything about it and i can't even kill myself because i am religious 

Running away will never help either 

I have my Dutch passport 

Travelling to another country will not help i still belong to this trashass land and this community full of assholes 

I was born here. I am Egyptian. 

I will for my whole life think Egyptian and live Egyptian 

Even if i was on whatever land

This is who i am and i hate it i will never find love i will never be happy i will never do what i love i will never have good internet i will never enjoy video games i will never make a movie i will never be a teacher i will never have a pet i will never go to parties i will never do anything and i blame Egypt. Egypt's effects will stay on me forever like a trauma i also blame my family for not running away when they had already had the Dutch passport it wouldn't be better but i would have appreciated them trying

I hate Egypt i hate life
