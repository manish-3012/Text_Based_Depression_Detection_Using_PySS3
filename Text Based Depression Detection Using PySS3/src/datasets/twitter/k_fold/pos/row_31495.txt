OMG OMG OMG a thing happened I donâ€™t know how many of you care to hear but I actually got asked out today! So Iâ€™ve asked girls out on 5 occasions and all of it failed miserably. I gave up on it and havenâ€™t asked anyone out in a while but today an old friend that I havenâ€™t seen I quite a while just messaged me that they had a huge crush on me. My immediate response was to reply with â€œis this for a tiktok or something?â€ (That had happened not once but twice to me on two different occasions). To my complete surprise she replied with no she really means it. Anyway, long story short, by the end of the conversation we were both in tears because she dropped the bomb on me that she is leaving for Manitoba in a week and she was just confessing and never thought Iâ€™d actually say yes. We are going out on a date tomorrow and weâ€™ll keep in contact when she leaves. Iâ€™m still in utter shock from the whole thing. A few short days ago I was super depressed and contemplating death and now Iâ€™m experiencing the polar opposite. Just needed to write this down somewhere to take it all in. I hope yâ€™all donâ€™t mind my monologue.
