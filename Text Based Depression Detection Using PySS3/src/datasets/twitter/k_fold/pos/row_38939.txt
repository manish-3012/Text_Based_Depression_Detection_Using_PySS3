Hey guys, Iâ€™ve been feeling really anxious and depressed lately and I want to tell my parents about it, but I donâ€™t want them to get mad at me and brush me off. Iâ€™m scared to got to them because they really stress me out and when my older sister was my age she was in a really bad state of depression and all they told her to do was â€˜implement god into your lifeâ€™. Also, my brother told them that he thinks he needs therapy for his anger and they told him to â€˜read his Bible and prayâ€™. I want to get help, but I donâ€™t want to go to my parents because of the reasons above and more. Any ideas?
