Let's create a new future and not be like our boomer parents/grandparents Now,  in Washington there is so much division. Instead of focusing on what divides us. We need to unite and understand our differences. Let's join together, fix the environment, defeat corrupt China, fix our economy and make a better future for our kids where they can retire and we can retire happily.  Instead of just criticizing the boomers let's show that we can be better. Have a nice day and drink a lot of water :)
