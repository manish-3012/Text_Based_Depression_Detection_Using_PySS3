(this is from a song don't take this seriously) I wish I was dead I wish I was dead and cold  
Wake up every day and it just feels repetitive  
Think I need to chill, I think I need a sedative  
I think depression's hittin' me  
I think it's finally setting in  
Drifting to my feet and settling just like sediment                                                                                
Constantly walking down this road called life blindly  
Foolishly hoping for purpose to come and find me  
In the depths of depressions is where I've been residing  
That or in my room under my covers just hiding
