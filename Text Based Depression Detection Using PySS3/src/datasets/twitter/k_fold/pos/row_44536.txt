bruh being a teenager sucks. i already wanna move out of this shitty household. everyone in my family is an asshole and no one uses or even has common sense. I'm just lying in every convo just to avoid arguments tbh. I'm also not allowed to show any emotions through facial expressions like when I'm angry or else my mom starts screaming saying i should smile more instead or else I'll die young (seriously?????). i hate my dad so much he is a dumbass and is constantly annoying and i always tell him to fucking stop and yelling "no" but i guess he is too much of an idiot to understand basic human interaction. bruh I'm cutting off contact with this crazy family once i move out. oh yeah i forgot about my brother and sister, my brother always makes up lies and tries to read my mind and make me look bad and everyone believes him cuz he's the oldest. and my sister is constantly getting in my business and trying to make me mad so i scream.

another thing i hate about being a teenager is i have no money and I'm broke because i can't get a job and i can't ask my parents to buy me stuff or else they'll dodge and ignore me until i forget i needed something so they don't spend any money. i have no control over my life whatsoever.

they also don't let me go outside at all and they're so fucking overprotective i hate it. i can't come 5 minutes late from school.

i wanna go to college already.
