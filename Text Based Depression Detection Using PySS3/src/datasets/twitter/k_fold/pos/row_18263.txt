School won't let me in I have a small cough that is scratchy and im 99.99% sure it's not THAT virus! But hey out of school for nothing right? WRONG subway just opened and I want to eat there, one of my closest friends recently gone back to my school and I've already spent a week in my room. 

Anyways have a good night/morning/noon/afternoon/evening to all you wonderful people
