I fucking hate my mom. My mom just stabbed me with a fork because some cookies my sister made were on the counter and I haven't put them away yet. For some reason she expects me to suddenly know when the kitchen gets dirty and rush to fix it. And their cookies? like they're gonna be out for the next hour or so and people will just grab em yknow? Anyway just needed to rant
