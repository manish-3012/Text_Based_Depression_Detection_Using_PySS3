Please Help Zimbabwe In my country Zimbabwe there is massive human rights violations many of us are unable to express freedom of speech, yesterday we organized protests against the government for the lack of service delivery during this pandemic, more than 2 million children are starving because theyâ€™re parents arenâ€™t able to go to work. When we bring to light that the government is corrupt, journalists and activists are abducted and tortured. On thursday when people tried to enter the CBD, soldiers and police brutalized people and told them to leave. Thereâ€™s no actual plan for the COVID pandemic and any funds that were set aside were looted by the government. Itâ€™s very sad and depressing and thereâ€™s no global support whatsoever itâ€™s just pain in Zimbabwe. Pain is what zimbabweans know best.
