I told my boyfriend I was non binary and he responded with â€œI still love you you :)â€, it was very stressful to do but it made me really happy when he said that Iâ€™m pansexual so I donâ€™t know how it is to only like one gender so I dont know if a gay guy could still love a enby and I didnâ€™t wanna loose the love of my life so I was just very anxious lol
