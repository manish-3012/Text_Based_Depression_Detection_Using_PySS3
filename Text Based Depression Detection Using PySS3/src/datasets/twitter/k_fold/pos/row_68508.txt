Does anyone have Millennial parents? Just a random passerby with a question that I was pondering. I'm in my late 20's but now that the oldest Millennials are 36-40 depending on if you take 84' or 80' as the first Millennial, there would conceivably be a decent representation of teenagers with Millennial parents on this forum.

What is it like? I imagine that parent would be quite connected to the internet and in tune with new technology.
