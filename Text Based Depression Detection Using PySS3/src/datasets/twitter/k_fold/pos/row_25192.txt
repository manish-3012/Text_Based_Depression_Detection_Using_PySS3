im so tired im extremley tired. school is starting and im not gonna be able to handle the stress. i barely have any friends, and even when i do i cant keep them. if any of my friends do anything and i mean anything with each other without me i get extremley sad and often start crying, im so scared they donâ€™t wanna be around me anymore. i hate being like this,, i usually just decide to be alone which makes school even worse. the fact that im bullied and most people dislike me doesnt help either.

im not even gonna have time to do homework since i have a ton of activites and my school days are gonna end even sooner than before. i donâ€™t know how im gonna handle it, my parents arent any help either. they usually make things worse and wont leave me alone. i donâ€™t wanna be here anymore, i feel done, im not even sure if anyone wants me here.
