My uncleâ€™s girlfriend keeps going out to restaurants with friends even though she knows itâ€™s not right, and Iâ€™m scared of my grandparents catching it... So a little elaboration, my uncle frequents himself between living at his parentsâ€™ house (my grandparents) and staying at his girlfriendâ€™s house. His girlfriend has been still going out to eat with friends at restaurants INDOORS- wtf Texas close your damn restaurants- and then of course comes into contact with my uncle, who then will go home and be around my grandparents (early 70s). It makes me SO ANGRY because this issue is completely avoidable by 1. His girlfriend stops being selfish and put others before herself, and stops going, or 2. My uncle stays at his girlfriends house FULL TIME and does not go into contact with his parents at all for the time being. I tried telling my uncle this and that itâ€™s not ok what sheâ€™s doing, and how it can be dangerous, obviously, for his parents, but he just shrugged and said â€œyeah, I knowwwâ€ but wouldnâ€™t say anything else. I swear to god if my grandparents get sick because of my uncleâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s stupidity and carelessness, Iâ€™m going to lose my shit! My uncle already had one covid scare at work (was in a company car with a covid+ asymptomatic co-worker) and had to quarantine, but luckily didnâ€™t catch it and tested negative. That wasnâ€™t his fault but this, THIS here is pure selfishness and carelessness on the both of them. I just donâ€™t understand how people can be this stupid! I live in LA so maybe Iâ€™m a bit paranoid because Iâ€™m at the epicenter in the worst affected city, but I donâ€™t want to lose my grandparents in a dumb situation that is PREVENTABLE.
