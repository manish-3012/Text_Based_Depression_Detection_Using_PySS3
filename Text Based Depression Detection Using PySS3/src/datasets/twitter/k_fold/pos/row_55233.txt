After a year of eating disorder recovery I still canâ€™t stop feeling fat and disgusting //tw //vent 

Iâ€™ve made peace with every part of my body except for my stomach, I find it absolutely revolting and disgusting, no matter what I do it just stays big and fat and it always pokes out and ruins any outfit that I try to put on. I feel awful about myself and I feel so worthless for being fat and ugly and disgusting. 

Iâ€™ve gained weight since being in anorexia recovery but my mindset still stays 

I feel awful for my poor boyfriend, I love him so much and he is absolutely smoking hot and gorgeous and I just feel awful that I canâ€™t offer that to him in return, I donâ€™t want to take my shirt off during sexy times bc of my stomach, I feel so bad that he canâ€™t have a hot girlfriend , heâ€™s stuck with a fat one, and I have a hot boyfriend

I just donâ€™t feel confident in my body at all, I fucking hate it,  and it affects my daily life
