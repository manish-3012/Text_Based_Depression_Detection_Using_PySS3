How Will I Survive College And Well - Life - With Mental Illness? Hi guys so like, Iâ€™m in high school and I currently am struggling with not being able to do work cuz a) i get so fidgety and anxious b) i feel sick and c) i just donâ€™t want to do it. Well, itâ€™s almost been 2 weeks now and I know my grades are gonna drop soon, but apart of me just doesnâ€™t care. Iâ€™m a junior which apparently is an important year but, I keep trying to accept that I will be a poor student in college who doesnâ€™t make a lot of money and who will have to depend on others for many years of my life. I just donâ€™t feel capable of being anything more than I am because of my mental illness. How am I going to make it????
