I guess that Iâ€™m skipping lunch. The random person from my class isnâ€™t here today. I usually sit with her. I canâ€™t do that today. 

So, I skipped.

Iâ€™m in the bathroom right now. It smells fine, actually. Our school is pretty empty and no one suspects that Iâ€™m in here. Honestly, this is kinda sad. 

I just hate eating alone.
