I keep surpassing Lucas! It's dinner time! Lucas: "You sis, are you hungry?"

Me: "Yeah, pretty much!"

Lucas: "I made delicious food!"

Me: "What did you make then?"

Lucas: "Lasagna!"

Me: "That's nothing man!"

Lucas: "Why not?!"'

Me: "I made lobster yesterday, with cream sauce! That was delicious!"
