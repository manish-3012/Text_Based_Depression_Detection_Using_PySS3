Anyone want to join an active discord server? We are all pretty chill and active all of the time. My friend has it all set up but only 40 members. Also he is a pretty great mod and not corrupt unlike most. We have a bunch of bots and an active community and we're thinking of starting daily among us/MC server also open for game night requests.
