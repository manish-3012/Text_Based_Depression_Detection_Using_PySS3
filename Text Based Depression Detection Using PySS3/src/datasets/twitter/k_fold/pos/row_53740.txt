Trying to change I canâ€™t say that Iâ€™ve changed very drastically over my few years of existence. But I feel like everybody knows that feeling of emptiness that creeps in. The moment when you very genuinely think:â€œI have nothing to doâ€œ Usually when the feeling set in, Iâ€™d just try to forget about it by lazily going through YouTube or scrolling through Reddit a bit more. But I feel like something changed not too long ago. I wanted my mediocre existence to change. And so I tried. I got started on reading books, rekindled old hobbies and started focusing on school more. But that change is incredibly different than what people expect. It was initially, watching some YouTube videos on school subjects when Iâ€™d get bored or talking to someone different in school every once in a while. But I noticed that the changes have gotten bigger over the last year or so. Compared to the last year, my grades have improved, I have more good friends, people compliment me because they think Iâ€™m talented. But I know Iâ€™m not talented. No one is. And itâ€™s not as if Im a genius. Im barely any different from everyone else. My difference happened a year ago, so small that not even I could notice it. A small burst of motivation to reach towards my dreams. Sure I donâ€™t have excellent grades, sure Iâ€™m not popular, sure Iâ€™m not normal but at least Iâ€™m trying. A change in character is never immediately noticeable. It takes time to change and you might not even notice. But at some point, you do start noticing. That youâ€™re being treated differently, that you are different from before. And not because you changed, but because you added to what was already there. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted-Talk
