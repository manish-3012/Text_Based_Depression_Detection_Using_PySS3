Well looks like lockdown in Auckland, New Zealand just got a little bit longer So here in NZ, we've all been waiting on the news to see whether lockdown will be finished from its three day period or continue - and the news has just come out that until 11:59 of the 26th of this month (August), we will continue to be in lockdown. Kinda annoying because our school ball was supposed to be on the 29th so I'll see how that goes.

At least with all of this I can sleep in again - only downside is that I have to continue with many assessments.....
