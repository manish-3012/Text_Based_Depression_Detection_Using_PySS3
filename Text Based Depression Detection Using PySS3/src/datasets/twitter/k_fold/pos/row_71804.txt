I hate life Ok so I just had a birthday yesterday (17) and I donâ€™t like to make things, especially birthdays, a big deal. Everyone has birthdays every year so itâ€™s not that big of a deal to have one. But my Step-Mom LOVES to make things a big deal. Apparently where sheâ€™s from in the Philippines birthdays are a big deal so now I have to deal with that. Sheâ€™ll spend all week preparing food and cooking for like 50 people because â€œItâ€™s tradition for herâ€ or something. Now I donâ€™t have any major anxiety or anything but when someone invites LITERALLY EVERYONE ON THE BLOCK for my birthday I donâ€™t really like it that much. I donâ€™t like big groups especially when I do t k ow half of them. I donâ€™t like having attention on me but she forced it on me and I had no say in it whatsoever and I HATED IT.
