Well, my girlfriend is mad at me She says Iâ€™m asking to many questions. Iâ€™m just trying to make sure she is good because she has anxiety, sleep paralysis, and depression. I know Iâ€™m asking to many but I really want to make sure she is good. I try to hold her hand to comfort her. Am I a bad boyfriend?
