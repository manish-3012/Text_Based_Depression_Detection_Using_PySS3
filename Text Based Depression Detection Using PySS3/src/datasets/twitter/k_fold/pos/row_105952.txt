Asked out a girl in a night club So me and my friend were out partying yesterday (the pandemic is over in my country). I had never asked anyone out before. 

We were in a night club and there was this cute girl sitting at the bar. The thing is, she was 6 or 7 years older than me lol (Iâ€™m 18). 

I went up to her and talked to her a little bit and she rejected the fuck out of me but itâ€™s ok. Lol.
