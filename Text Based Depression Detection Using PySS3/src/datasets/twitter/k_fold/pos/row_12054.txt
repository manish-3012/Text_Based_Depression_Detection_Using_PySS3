19, working 40+ hours on top of community college I just graduated from high school in July and Iâ€™m already tired of life. Online learning is not my cup a tea, Iâ€™m struggling to keep good grades up- my average being a 39 when my high school grades were always 80+ (and I took APs). My parents are always on my ass about my grades, but I canâ€™t learn online. I get distracted, my boss doesnâ€™t follow my availability form that says I can only work a max of 30 hours a week instead she puts me on the schedule for 40+, I canâ€™t keep up with deadlines and wifi doesnâ€™t work half the time, canâ€™t join the zoom because of network issues or my parents force me to do chores during my class time. Iâ€™m so close to just dropping out and swearing off college forever at this point. Even getting a notification from my school email which is mostly just our school administrators inviting us to zoom meetings about random things gives me anxiety to the point where I just deleted the school email app off my phone. My parents are always belittling me about how stressed I am because of this, saying â€œI donâ€™t understand stressâ€ and that I â€œcanâ€™t be stressed since Iâ€™m a kidâ€. Iâ€™m not a kid. Iâ€™m almost 19 years old, juggling a full time job when I shouldnâ€™t, community college all while in a pandemic to the point where I cry myself to sleep at night and wonder if I should just drop out.
