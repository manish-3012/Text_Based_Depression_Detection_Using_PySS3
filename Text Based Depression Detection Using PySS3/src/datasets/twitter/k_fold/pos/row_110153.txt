I have been saving my award So you know how Reddit gives you free awards sometimes? Well a little known fact is you can save it by not claiming it, the only downside is you donâ€™t know what award it is.

So anyway I saw a post by a dude saying some of his friends had been in a terrible accident. Naturally I felt really bad for the guy and thought I should give him my award. Take a guess which award it was.



On an unrelated note who wants a wholesome award
