Therapy doesn't work for me but I got no one else to talk to I know none of you care, but for some reason I have to let the internet know.

I go to a psychiatrist every other week and I've been doing that for 2 years, but it always makes me feel a lot worse in the end. But I don't stop going because he's the only person I feel comfortable talking to about everything (except my suicidal thoughts and drinking, because of the mandatory reporting bullshit). I have no friends that I'd feel anywhere near comfortable talking to, and my family worries too much about me already. My dad needs as much sleep as he can get, and telling him about how I wish I had the courage to throw up after a meal wouldn't help.

Everyone overlooks me, and that helps and hurts me at the same time. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to find someone who has the same interests as me. I don't really know how to talk to people either.
