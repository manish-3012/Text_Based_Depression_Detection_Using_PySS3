Do my gender and sexuality even need a label? Ive been having a crisis for the last hour and I kind of realized some things. I used to think I'm bi with a preference for women, but after some thinking, I realized I'm not into a specific gender/ers, more like just into feminity. Im attracted to both girls, trans girls and femboys, and I don't really care about the whole gender stuff. Also, even tho I'm biologicaly a girl and am almost completly happy with it, I sometimes feel like crossdressing or just basically trying to be a boy for even a day because it would make me feel a bit better. I'm sorry if I offended anyone, I'm just very confused. Should I keep looking for answers or just ignore the labels and just be me?
