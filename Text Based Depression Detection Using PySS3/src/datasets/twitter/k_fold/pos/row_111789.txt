Iâ€™m going to be an adult next year thatâ€™s crazy Some of my friends are already 18 and theyâ€™re vibing, but I almost feel that my 18th birthday is my last day on earth or something, like thereâ€™s a constant countdown to July 20, 2021 in my head

I donâ€™t know why i feel like itâ€™s such a big deal, maybe cause my parents never let me live and after that date Iâ€™d be able to do what I want without their approval. It seems surreal, not having anyone hold you back, having to do most things on your own. New dentist, new doctor, new chapter. Also the fact that I never had a childhood, I think thatâ€™s what keeps me down the most. Your childhood makes you but all mine did was break me, so itâ€™s hard now that iâ€™m trying to fix myself. Itâ€™s hard to forgive people and move on too. I donâ€™t have to stop being a kid at 18 but it feels that way. I have a while to go but Iâ€™m really stressed about college and stuff right now that I canâ€™t sleep
