It could be a bit strange question but how do you become friends with other people? I know one guy that I wanna become friends with. But I really don't understand how to start a conversation with him and not look too strange or stupid. 

(He's my classmate but we don't talk much. Mostly only on some school themes (if circumstances so require)) 

And also the other question how to make these conversations regular?
