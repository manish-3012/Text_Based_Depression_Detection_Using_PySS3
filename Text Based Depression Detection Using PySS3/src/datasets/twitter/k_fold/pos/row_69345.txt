I miss Middle School Besides the fact of Covid and school being school, middle school was great. Also I'm M15 BTW(13 or 14 then.(or 12 in the beginning of 7tg grade))Anyway when I was there two things happened. 
1. People assumed I was gay(which I'm not) because I had lots of female friends, no gf, and I would be like gay is OK. So yeah that stopped after enough times of me saying I'm straight and that some girls were into me because I wasn't an asshole. 

2. People assumed that I was straight and that either hatie or Devon was my gf. Because they were my best friends although One of them is now a male, but that's a story for another day. Anyway also a lot of women were into me or pretended to be into me to bully me or at least wanted to be around me because I wasn't an asshole. 

Anyway I hoped that made sense. I'm currently at the eye doctor whilst having an autofill that dosen't work(While the auto-correct does).
