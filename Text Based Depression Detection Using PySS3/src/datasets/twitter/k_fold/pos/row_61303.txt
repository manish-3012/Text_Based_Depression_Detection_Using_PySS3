Any music recommendations? I'm looking to expand my playlist, for now my usual genres are alt pop, Minnesota hip hop, steampunk, and various indie genres, and artists are people like cavetown, aliceband, bug hunter, Penelope Scott, various rhymesayers, BUT am willing to explore new genres/artists and such.

Anything but generic rap (the type exclusively about sex, drugs, how cool the rapper is, other rap types are pretty good) or the pop that was popular a couple years ago. (Dunno the technical genre name).

Anyways, anyone got some music recommendations? What are your favorite artists/songs?
