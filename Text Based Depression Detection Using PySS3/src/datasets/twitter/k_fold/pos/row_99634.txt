Holy crap guys, I just found out that I can resit my SATs I took them during the middle of last year, but I was an absolute idiot and didn't study at all, and I'd never even taken an American test before since I live in Hong Kong where we use the British system, so I only got a 1300. Back then I thought â€No big deal, I'll just resit them at the next possible opportunity and get a better scoreâ€ but then Corona came in on a cloud to ruin my day.
Up until this point I basically accepted that I wouldn't be able to resit them at all, which basically destroyed my chances of getting into Stanford or Cornell. Hell, it would've been better if I just hadn't taken them at all, but we just looked it up and found out that they have one in Stockholm in September, and I've been trapped there for almost 6 months now, which means I have a second shot. I am so happy right now, this is the first bit of good news I've gotten in months.
