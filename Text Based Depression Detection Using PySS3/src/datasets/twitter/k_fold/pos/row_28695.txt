Do you feel the same as I do? Hello everyone. Sorry for my following "bad" english, I'm actually japanese so I'm practicing my fluency. 

Soo, recently, I've moved to the UK and I'm attending regularly to school, and I've been observing my classmates to see which things they can do and so on.

Before getting into the point: My strength had always being having good grades, and I'm actually what you would call 'a genius' (don't want to sound selfish tho), but I guess that is just because I only see the world from a different point of view. I'm actually an ordinary person.

The thing is that I realised that I can't do anything unique, while my classmates have a lot of fantastic abilities. By fantastic I mean like: "Drawing!", "Singing!", "Dancing!". Well, I actually have knowledge (I've studied music, arts and some languages like spanish and french) and know how to do many things but there's nothing that I can do better than the others, or a special characteristic. The worst thing about this feeling is that I can't think of what to choose for a university course, because I really feel useless. I think I actually have the impostor syndrome, but I don't really want to auto-diagnose myself. 

My question is: Have some of you ever felt like me? I know I really sound like a narcissist saying these things about myself, but honestly, I feel really upset when thinking about my future because I honestly can't imagine myself in the next 5 years.

Sorry for my bad english again, and thank you.
