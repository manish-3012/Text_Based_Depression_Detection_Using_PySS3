The first and last crush Iâ€™ll have for a while This happened two years ago but I canâ€™t stop thinking about how stupid I was and how rude my crush was. 

So I had a crush on someone for a couple of years but never really talked to them. I would always try to be nice to them and even sent them a card when they were ill (they didnâ€™t care, they didnâ€™t even say thank you) even after they didnâ€™t thank me I still decided to confess to them. They didnâ€™t say anything and just walked away. They then told all their friends about it and I was so embarrassed the next day. I wish I wasnâ€™t so stupid. The card was the warning sign and I shouldâ€™ve took it. Iâ€™m still upset about it to this day. There was no reason for them to be so rude.
