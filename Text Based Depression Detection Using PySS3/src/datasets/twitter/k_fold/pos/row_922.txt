To the guy that dm'd me asking if i am a girl and then immediately asked me to be his gf on behalf of all girls on this sub i can tell you that doing something like that doesn't get you a gf because 

1. it makes us feel very uncomfortable if you ask that, like you could have just started a nice convo, but no, you just had to start the convo asking if I'm a girl.

2. Most of us aren't that desperate for a bf, to just say yes

3. Some of us aren't even into guys

If you really want a gf, go download a dating app or smth
