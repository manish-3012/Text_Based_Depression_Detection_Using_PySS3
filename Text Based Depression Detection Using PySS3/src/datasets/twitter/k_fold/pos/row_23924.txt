The internet makes me feel like an outcast My parents love me.

I'm doing well in school.

I don't have a crush to ask out.

I don't have a girlfriend to do stupid things with. 

I don't have friends in general. 

My parents support my hobbies/lifestyle.

Why is it that everyone else has a shitty life with abusive parents, get instantly depressed over school, or have an actual social life?

Sorry if I sound like an arrogant loser. I have been an outcast to people my whole life, thinking the internet is the only escape. I guess not.
