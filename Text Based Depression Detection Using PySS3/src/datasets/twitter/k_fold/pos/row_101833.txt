Why is school so hated here? I'm just wondering because I personally love school and don't see how you can dislike it. School is good and challenging and makes me learn. That means I can go into the future and do whatever I want. I don't understand the hatred for it. School opens opportunities for all who are enrolled and it is the best way to learn. Maybe school is different in the US (I'm in UK), but surely it is not bad. I'd like to know reasons in the comments.

Edit: Friends are another great benefit to school
