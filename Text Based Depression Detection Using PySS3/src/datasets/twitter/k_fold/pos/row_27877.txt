I donâ€™t get formal/prom So here in Ireland we only have one prom for our whole school time like from just one and itâ€™s in our last school year 

And Iâ€™m gonna miss mine because of Covid 

But tbf I do hate all the dates, dresses makeup and all but itâ€™s just the experience I want 

Like my school is known for having the mental one in a hotel reception because our school wonâ€™t take us and even hotels within about 100 miles of the school wonâ€™t take us because we are known for drinking too much and then sometimes wreaking stuff which is why I want to go and Iâ€™m annoyed
