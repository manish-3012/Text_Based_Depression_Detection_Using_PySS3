Are you bored? You like Minecraft? Hear me out Do you like minecraft? Do you like light-hearted content? Yeah, same. About two years ago, I discovered Hermitcraft. Hermitcraft is a server that unites some youtubers (hermits), and basically, they just have a good time. Watching it is very entertaining, and I just wanted to tell you guys about it, in hopes it helps a bit with the boredom. It has many seasons (7 is currently happening), and the good part is you can start at any season you want!

Anyways, hope this helps

and no, this isn't publicity, I just want to help some bored people
