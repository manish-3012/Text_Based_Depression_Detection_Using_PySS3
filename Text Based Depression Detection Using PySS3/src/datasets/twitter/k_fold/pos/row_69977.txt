My Friend Is Dying My friend swears sheâ€™s going to kill herself before 21. Her mental state is terrible. She constantly complains about her body even going out of her way to harm herself to look â€œprettierâ€. She lives in a toxic household where both parents hate each other and the Dad is a â€œCovid doesnâ€™t existâ€ type of dude. Her mom is a tough love type. She has self confidence issues yet a lot of pride so she wonâ€™t see a therapist. The thing is though, sheâ€™s probably one of the best people I know. She helps everyone, is nice to everyone and goes the extra mile for everyone. She doesnâ€™t think sheâ€™ll be missed and believes she is replaceable. Iâ€™m scared for her tbh. I was texting her a few nights ago and she says she may start cutting herself soon. Sheâ€™s done drugs and alcohol but I quickly put a stop to that. Iâ€™m wondering if I should send screenshots of our conversations to her mother so maybe then sheâ€™ll be forced get help but then again I donâ€™t wanna force her to get help. I donâ€™t know what to do at this point.
