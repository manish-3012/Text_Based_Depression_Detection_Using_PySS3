Life is ever changing and ever declining      I'm typically a very cynical person, so posts like this are new to me, as well as opening up.
    Life is exponentially getting harder to understand, for everyone. Not just me, at least I hope so. Humanity is like a dog chasing the tail of progress, we don't know what to do with it, so we just let it go, and simply start again.
     In the pursuit of progress, we truly forget what we've already learned. In America's brief history, we've had to learn and re-learn just how to treat people equally.
     If we look at the Earth in it's natural state, even that is too much for our tiny brains to comprehend. Some people would see the brutality in its basest form, some would see the beauty, some may even see the science of it all. Then, look at the universe in its entirety, the ever expanding glorious everything. We can barely understand our minuscule fraction of the ever expanding enormity of creation.
      To put this in perspective to you, we are nothing, everything humanity has ever amounted to, is nothing, when compared to the universe. We know so little that we have to tell each other, most probably false legends of religion.
      And that's not to bash religion, because there is no existing evidence to debunk it.
      I apologize for sounding however I sound.I might have come off as condescending, or at least I fear I did. I want you to know that I don't mean to be. I feel like I'm losing my mind. But that doesn't matter to you. Continue with your lives. You don't ever have to think of the ramblings of this mentally ill 15 year old ever again, if you did in the first place.
