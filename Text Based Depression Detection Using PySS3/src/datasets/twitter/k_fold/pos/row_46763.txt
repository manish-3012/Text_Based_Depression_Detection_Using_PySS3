I wish I could wear whatever I want Iâ€™m seeing other girls online with such cute outfits and I really wish that

1. I was confident enough to wear the outfit in public
2. I wasnâ€™t ugly so Iâ€™d actually look good in it
3. My broke ass could actually afford clothes like that

Pretty much my entire wardrobe consists of T shirts and leggings. Maybe in a while Iâ€™ll buy a skirt or a top that I like without thinking about my insecurities. :) 

This isnâ€™t much of a rant, more like me complaining a bit. I know a lot of you have more important things to do than listening to me talk about clothes so like just skip this post or something

Okie baiii have a nice life &lt;3
