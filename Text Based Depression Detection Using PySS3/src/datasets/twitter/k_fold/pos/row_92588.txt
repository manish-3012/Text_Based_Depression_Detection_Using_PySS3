My gf broke up with me, and got mad at me the next day bc I didnt want to get back together. I had bad grades and got grounded and got my phone taken. She thought I was ghosting her and said she was breaking up with me. After thinking about it, all the lying she constantly does, and the mental health problems she seems like she has, I decided that was a good idea. The next day I got texts from her saying that she wanted to get back together and that she wasnt thinking clearly, even tho she said she thought about it for at least a week. She then starts getting mad at me about me not wanting to date her anymore. Did I make the right decision, or should I have given it more time and thought?
