I'm sick of this shit Hey, so i live in France and there you go to school one week in two because of covid, i can't stand that shit anymore.
My school called my parents to tell them i was the only student that didn't give the work back.
They were angry at first and then understood that i was having a mental breakdown because i was always a good student but my grades were falling.

My teachers don't understand what it is to wake up without any goal in life and feel like you're nothing to society so they just continue shouting at me and giving me bad grades.
I might go in a private school open every week just to work properly again.
I hope it'll help.
Anyways thanks for reading.
