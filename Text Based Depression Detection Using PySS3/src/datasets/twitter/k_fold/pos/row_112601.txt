Who is in the wrong here ok lets imagine theres 3 people, A, B, and C.

A and C have been friends for a long time and have a group of people that they're close with, who they've known for about a year or two. A decides to take B and introduce them to C and A's friend group on November 1. Fast forward to today, and B is a regular part of the friend group and hangs out with them every weekend. A was not expecting this to happen when they first introduced B to everyone.

For the past 6 months, A and C have been eachothers #1 on snapchat so they had the yellow heart, but about a week ago C and B became bestfriends on snapchat. A gets upset so they yell at C and tell them to leave B on delivered. 

But this wholetime B doesn't understand why C isn't talking to them, or if they did something wrong. So they call A, and tell them about how they are stressing thinking that C is mad at them.

A then informs B and explains the situation. A tells B that it was a joke.

Who is in the wrong here? Is A in the wrong for making C leave B on delivered? Or is B in the wrong by getting mad at A.
