I broke my lava lamp, I am very sad about it I finally got my own room after many years! I had a lava lamp I very much enjoyed that had remained off for almost 2 years, It was heating up for almost an hour and wasnâ€™t bubbling around. My dumbass decided to shake it up a little bit, it fucking ruined the lamp. The wax is all flaky and weird now. Iâ€™m very disappointed in myself, that lava lamp was one the few decorations I had. Iâ€™m devastated...
