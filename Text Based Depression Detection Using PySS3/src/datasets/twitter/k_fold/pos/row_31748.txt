why do i get so pissed off at people who are very emotional like i just donâ€™t understand how some people can be so emotional. for me, i just donâ€™t feel emotions much. they seem like such a weakness and a waste of energy. i keep seeing people getting all emotional and i cant stop myself from thinking â€œwhy not just stop caring?â€ because thats what i do and it works perfectly fine

i know this is a shitty thing to think but emotional people just piss me off at this point. i cant handle them being so irrational. i wanna just say Å›hut the fuck up and stop caring because thats how it works for me. but i guess thats not how it works for other people. but i donâ€™t say anything and i sit there and listen cos i dont wanna hurt anyones feelings :/

idk emotions are so weird. like i understand the meaning behind them, but i dont understand feeling them so strongly

maybe im just built different ðŸ˜Ž 

or a sociopath or sum shit. lmao iâ€™d laugh if it turned out i actually was. but nah im pretty sure im just an asshole
