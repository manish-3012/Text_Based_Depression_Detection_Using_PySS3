Iâ€™m so glad that thereâ€™s a kids show with LGBT people. Iâ€™m listening to my little sisters cartoon in the background and it caught my attention that one of characters has 2 dads. The show is the loud house.
Iâ€™m just glad kids are being exposed to lgbt people in a positive light and I hope that it will have a positive impact in the future around lgbt rights.
