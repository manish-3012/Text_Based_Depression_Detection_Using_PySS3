How do you guys go to School? Is it face to face or Online Classes? I hate online classes. I want to save my eyes.  


I wonder when will all of this end. I believe some of you are very lucky you have a government that can handle the Pandemic effectively thus you are slowly going back to F2F.   


Meanwhile me, i don't know. My teacher told me we will spend A.Y 2021-2022 in Online Classes.   
God i just want to stop. I want to maintain my 20/20 vision. I don't know what to do. Not to mention i have shit ton of household stuff to do.
