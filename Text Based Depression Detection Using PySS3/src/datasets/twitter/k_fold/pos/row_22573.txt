i think someone i talked to might have killed themselves i was in discord just chilling until i got a ping from a mental health group i was a part of, someone had asked for someone to talk to, i said my dms are open and started trying to help him, for almost the whole conversation he kept saying how it would be the best if he killed himself, then his last words before he stopped responding was  "I should just go really, there is nothing that can really help me.. sorry " before that he said he should just kill himself

this happened like 20 minutes ago and he is offline now, im scared he might have actually done it...

i really like helping people with mental illness as much as i can, and its a shame seeing these kinds people go, if youre dealing with a lot was it mental illness, stress, depression or what have you, my dms are open if you need someone to help you, but please do not kill yourself, i know it might sound tempting but there are other options.

i hope he is alright...
