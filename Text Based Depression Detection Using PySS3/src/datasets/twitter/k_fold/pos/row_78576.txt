Well, this is it! Tomorrow I have an appointment at my doctor (for school purposes) and my parents will go with me because I'm constantly losing weight (BMI is already below 18.5).


I know for a fact they will mention it which will result in me getting a variety of tests done by the same doctor. Though, I for sure know that I can't eat when I'm either feeling depressed/down or anxious. Which is most of the time through out the day.

Of course these tests won't show anything and the next step will be to see a psychiatrist because weight of loss is very often associated with mental disorders (anxiety, depression).

So, there's a high chance I will end up being diagnosed with these shits which is not what I want. I don't want my parents to think that there's anything wrong with me (they are concerned already, but I always brushed it off as just being "fine").

Just wanted to vent. :)
