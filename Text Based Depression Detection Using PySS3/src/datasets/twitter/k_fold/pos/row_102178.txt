I'm turning 20 in about an hour, time to share a pinch of stuff I've learned this past decade To preface, I'm gonna try my best to keep this short and quick, I don't want to bore you guys with a lengthy essay. Instead, I've devised a list of rules that I try my best to follow. These are written in hopes that they'll guide you through daily life as a growing, and perhaps, confused teenager. Hella hella hella hella HELL YEAH, let's dive in.

**RULE 1 - Sit Up Straight**
Posture may not seem significant, but it's helped me a whole hell of a lot. I feel more confident in my skin, and I feel like I have more of a presence in the space I'm in.


**RULE 2 - Drink an Assload of Water**
This one's pretty straightforward. Hydration homies wya 


**RULE 3 - Stuffed Animals are Fucking Dope**
This rule rings true for all 'strange' quirks and atypical interests though. It was junior year when I first started being super open with my interests around other people. Turns out when you share stuff, other folks will share goofy shit with you, and then you realize that most everyone is goofy in some way or another.


**RULE 4 - Don't Lie My Dude**
I didn't follow this one for a looooong time, but lying has caused me (and others) a lot more pain than any positives I would attain from lying. It doesn't feel good to realize you've been lied to, and it doesn't feel good to haunt yourself with a lie. 


**RULE 5 - Get a Good Night's Rest**
Another self-explanatory one, but it could be argued that this is the most important rule on here. The amount of sleep you get, and what your sleep schedule is can lead to a number of different occurrences. Bottom line: 


**RULE 6 - Life's a Bitch, but It's Your Bitch ;0**
Ahhh, my favorite personal motto. To break it down, essentially what this means is that, at the end of the day, life might suck in the moment, but things DO get better. They get a lot better much faster, however, if you take the steps necessary to improve your circumstances, whatever those steps may be for you. 

**RULE 7 - IT'S OK TO ASK FOR HELP**
Hey man I get it, I'm a very independent person. I don't like asking for help when I don't need to, but sometimes I do it anyways. It never hurts to have an extra leg of support to stand on in times where you may need it most. This can be applied in *every* facet in your life.

**RULE 8 - Relentlessly Pursue Your Goals**
In the beautifully written words of Prince EA, "if you *'kinda'* want something, then you're only *kinda* going to get the results you want." I think about this statement every time I'm doing something difficult that's in the way of a goal I'm after, and Prince is absolutely right. Life only happens once, so where do you want to end up 2 years from now? 5 years? 10? 20? Somethin to think about. ( The Prince EA video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ja-n5qUNRi8 )

**RULE 9 - Embrace Suffering**
Mental health is a crucial facet of our well-being. There is a lot you can do to keep afloat, but sometimes you can't. Don't deny your circumstances though, face them with fortitude. Don't swim against the tide, swim with it, in other words. I'll refer back to rule 7 though: there is no shame in asking for assistance. Sometimes you're faced with something so novel or difficult that it feels impossible for you to go about it by yourself. 

**RULE 10 - Compare Yourself to Who You Were Yesterday, Not to Who Someone Else is Today**
This is also a rule inspired public figure, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson. I suppose this one could also be self-explanatory, but I'll explain it a bit anyways. It is perfectly ok not to be the best at something. As long as you're improving in the areas you want to improve in, that's forward progress, nobody else's forward progress matters in this context. And hey, maybe, eventually, you could be the best at something, and that takes persistence.


Aight that's all for now. I hope these rules help maybe even a tiny bit. I hope it wasn't too long, but that just about wraps up my time on this subreddit. I mean, I still have an hour left, but I'm sleepy as hell so imma head out. I'll probably still float around every now and again, but now I'm gonna be an ollllllllld man, gonna need a mf walker here pretty soon at this rate jeez

Anyways, cheers dudes, nice knowing y'all. Stay litty
