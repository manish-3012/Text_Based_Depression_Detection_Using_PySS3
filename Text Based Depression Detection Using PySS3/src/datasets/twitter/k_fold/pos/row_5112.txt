Unpopular Opinion: Sugar cookies are better than chocolate chip cookies I'm posting this here since my post isn't showing up on the unpopular opinion subreddit anyways...

Sugar cookies are cookies in their best form! They have just the perfect mix of everything a cookie should have. It's nice, simple and damm delicious. Meanwhile With chocolate chip cookies they either don't have enough chocolate chips or too much of them and the cookie part of a chocolate chip cookie is just a watered down version of a sugar cookie.
