Heyheyheyheyheyheyhey i remember you from somewhere Get on your knees and lick the dirt from my shoes 

Between the seams and through the stitches. Clean and through

You deserve the happiness you feel

You deserve the friends I can't have 

I've reached the nadir of my existance 

Further down the road I don't remember paving 


I'm stuck missing your friendly manipulation
