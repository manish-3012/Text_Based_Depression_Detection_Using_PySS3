I had an idea (kind of) for making friends online to game with or just chat i guess English not my firsy langua bla bla also im bad at punctuation
So im in situation that i think a bunch of you guys might relate to. I have a lot of people that i met online on a friend list of whatever app but i only play regularly with like 1 dude and sometimes with other ones, and i always dreamed of having that perfect group of friends like some youtubers have to play games with maybe like a group of 4 or 5 or even a really big group for games that are more enjoyable like that (like mmorpgs), but its really hard to tell the other to play sometime and the longer the time that none of you is convinced to ask the other one to play it gets harder and harder until he/she is jusy some text on your friendlist.
Well i had this idea of SOMETHiNG maybe an app (probably not) or a group or a discord server where you go there and get matched with people that want to play with others and form groups, you could select  wich games and when are the times you are aviliable to play. You could think this would be a bit awkward at first and you are probably right especially for introverted people but as an introvert that learned to not be a silent shy shit (not an isult to introverted or shy people btw) i can say that meeting people and enjoyng games with them is easier online at leasy for  me.
Anyway i got a bit out of the point of this post, i just got this idea a week ago and i would really like some of your thoughts about it, maybe dm and we can make this as some kind of fun project for a while, i would really enjoy to make this a reality and be someone who made great friendships but maybe this idea isnt possible at all and im fine with that after all i didnt think about it that much.
Thank you for reading this.
