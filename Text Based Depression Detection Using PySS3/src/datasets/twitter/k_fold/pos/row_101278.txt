A poem I just wrote It's freestyle. So no rhymes or structure.

The Elusive man

A man who bears my face and soul
But better
He holds all that I could be,
All that I want to be
I have helped people find their own elusive man
But people refuse to help me
I have lost myself in the search
Of the elusive man
