How long can I use the excuse of just being a kid?  I am 17f and have done some really fucked up things recently that feel like they are ruining my life. I feel a lot younger than I am but I am starting to realise that I am not that far off being an adult and I cant excuse is anymore. I used to think it would all go away and I would stop feeling like this but it hasnt and I don't know what to do with myself anymore. It feels like now that I'm close to being an adult the way I feel with be permanent and I can be help fully accountable
