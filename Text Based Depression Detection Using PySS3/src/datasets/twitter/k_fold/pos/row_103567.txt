I hate how people are starting to use completely unrelated insults when arguing Like some idiotic trump supporter calls people a â€œracist homophobe sexist nazi communistâ€ just because people say that joe didnâ€™t lose


Stop using unrelated terms, it makes u saiid like a child that has just learnt a new word without learning the context and started saying it everywhere
