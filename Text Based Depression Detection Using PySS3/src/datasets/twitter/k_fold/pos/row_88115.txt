i wanna run away to southern italy and lay on the grass and watch the sunset while sitting on top of a hill facing the blue, crystal clear ocean. and with my perfect playlist playing in the background. just watch the orange and pink sky slowly fade into dark blue, and dawn turn into night. the soft breeze against my skin, and contemplate my entire life, in comfortable silence. and when it becomes night, lay down and stare at the stars, and cry for a while. and then smile to myself because i finally made it. i finally found myself, and found where i could be happy. 

oh be a young girl in countryside europe with no care of the world
