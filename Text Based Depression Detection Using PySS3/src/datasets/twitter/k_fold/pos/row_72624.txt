so minecon live happens tommorow... minecon live happens for me tomorrow but early in the morning. me and my buds were planning on waking up and hopping on a discord call to watch the Livestream but as most mothers do..."family first" my mom literally today wants to go on a boat with other family members and it sounds fun. but I told my mom I was doing this 2 weeks ago and now all of the sudden she wants to go on a boat and leave the house the same exact time the Livestream starts. I know this sounds alot like first world problems and stuff but my mom only allows me 1 hour of screentime a day all electronics included for some reason. I will have my phone on me and hopefully, I am able to check Reddit tomorrow after the Livestream and see what happened anyways, hope you guys have fun watching the Livestream tomorrow.
