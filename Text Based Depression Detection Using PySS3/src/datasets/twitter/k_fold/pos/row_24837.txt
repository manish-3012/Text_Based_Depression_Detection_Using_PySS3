I miss snow It's almost December and there still is no snow. It has been like this for couple of years.

I remember how there was snow on 18th November in capital city (because of cars and sea next to it, snow will melt quickly) 10 years ago. It should be at least few cm by now but that haven't been the situation for years.

Yesterday during night I saw how it was snowing and how the snow was staying on the ground. Today I wake up and guess what. No snow. Nada.

I miss having the snow piles that broke the old fence, ice on my street that made small kids fall to death (j), and evenings when the sky was orange and you could see big snow flakes falling.
