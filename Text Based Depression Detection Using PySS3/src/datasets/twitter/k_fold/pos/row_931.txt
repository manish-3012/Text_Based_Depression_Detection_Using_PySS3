Fucked up and need some help Got drunk last night and texted my crush (whoâ€™s also currently only beat friend) ranted to her a bit about no one wanting to talk to me, and her spending most of her break time msging her bf, then I called her amazing and said if she wasnâ€™t dating someone Iâ€™d have asked her out but weâ€™re just friends and Iâ€™m fine with that. She said â€œIdk broâ€ and I said I wasnâ€™t feeling good so she told me to drink some water and maybe go to sleep and so I said goodnight. Itâ€™s the next morning now, should I text her and tell her Iâ€™m sorry for last night or just not say anything or what should I do
