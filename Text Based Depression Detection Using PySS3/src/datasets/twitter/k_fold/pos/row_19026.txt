I need to tell my family about my rape story but idk how to ... trigger warning: rape/pedophilia

first of all, english is not my first language sorry for any mistakes 

i have chose to tell this story on reddit because is the only place that i kinda can be anonymous.

After 3 years i finally told my psychologist about my rape story and he asked me to tell my parents or only my mom (my dad is very aggressive)... I just canâ€™t , i donâ€™t how to tell my mom.

I canâ€™t properly go to my mom and say: â€œmom,Uncle [name] raped me when i was 12 hahaâ€ 

my mom will also make a lot of questions and this will make me feel uncomfortable...

can someone kinda help me i donâ€™t know how tell this whole history to family. 

I know i have the option of still hiding this secret but this is destroying me day by day .

I have been acting like everything is normal with my uncle when is not. 

itâ€™s very complicated for me 

thank you so much for everyone who read this :)
