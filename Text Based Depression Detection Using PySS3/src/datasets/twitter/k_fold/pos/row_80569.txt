How would a animal society really work? This actually started as a conversation with my sister during lunch and during that conversation there were many unanswered questions I had that even she just looked at me and like "why are you asking me this"?

How would eggs meat and milk work?

Would there be extra training for animals that work at hospital because of eggs and pregnancy?

Would there be three society's, air, land, and water?

Adoption in general

What would replace a zoo?

What happened to humanity?

Would cross animal marriage be legal?

Government in general

How would life expectancy change the way age works?

Would bounty hunter and assassins be called "poachers"?

How would "extinction" work?

Those are the only ones I can remember, so can someone try to answer these in the comments?
