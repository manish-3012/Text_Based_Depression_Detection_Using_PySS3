My Friends and I Need a New PS4 Online Game to Play 
Iâ€™ll list a few of the games of the games we used to play, but have gotten sick of. 

List: 

- Rainbow Six Siege
- Minecraft 
- Fallout 76
- Bloodborne
- Watch Dogs 2
- Tom Clancyâ€™s Ghost Recon Breakpoint
- Tom Clancyâ€™s Ghost Recon Wildlands
- Rocket League
- Overwatch 
- Fortnite
- PUBG
- Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout
- DayZ
- Red Dead Redemption II
- Destiny 2 
- The Division 2
- The Crew 2 
- UNO
- For Honor
- Steep
- Far Cry 5
- Far Cry New Dawn
- BlackOps 4
- Advanced Warfare

Those are the games we have played since I got the PS4 how many years ago. I used to play/buy a lot of games. I have gotten two this year. I guess you can say I do not play games to the degree I used to. I started doing other things, like working out, something I needed to do for so long.

We played some games more than others. We have play Tom Clancyâ€™s Rainbow Six Siege the most. I have been playing it since 2016. 

We need a new game. A game that we will play for at least a month. 

Any suggestions?
