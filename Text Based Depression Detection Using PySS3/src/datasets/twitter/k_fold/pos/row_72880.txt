I feel like absolute trash I really feel like trash rn, theres not really a reason why but i just do

I keep almost posting something, commenting something, or texting someone something, and then all of a sudden i just think "should i really send that? Yeah no, im not gonna send that its so stupid" and no one is ever gonna listen to me or even notice my existence.

It just feels like everyone is judging me or making fun of me and i cant stop thinking that. Even if no one acually is doing that, it feels like they are

^I ^just ^wish ^i ^could ^die ^already
