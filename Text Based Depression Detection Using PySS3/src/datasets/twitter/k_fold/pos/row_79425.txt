Domestic Abuse Can't Be Justified or Set Aside as Teenage Rebellion My father strangled me twice, told me to hang myself, and made me hate myself everyday. Another thing, he threatened to burn my feet like when I was a child (which was way too traumatic for me to mention), despite knowing that I can't tolerate that. Just know that I and everyone else here will be there for you, especially the minority and LGBTQ+ part of this community. I'll leave this place knowing this subreddit will never make me feel alone.
