Rant I'm sorry I personally think ranting is stupid to do online but I need to do it once. basically I have done everything my mother has wanted me to do I've been trying my best in school I try to get stuff in on time I am as polite and quiet at my new school as I possibly can be 1 because I'm too shy to talk 2nd I hate assholes so I don't want to seem like one. But this past summer my parents moved so I helped them I carried stuff I cleaned up the house and yard and when we moved here I did the same cleaned and moved stuff and in the middle of all of it a personal thing happened were I had sucidal thoughts and who caused it my mother she said sorry (I did not tell them about my thoughts) she said sorry and acted like it was all chill and I recently had to go to the hospital not for anything serious but just a mishap that freaked me out so that was stress ful what did my mother do make jokes about me being worried and she has not only been a ass to me but my father too my father does not deserve any shit he's a good man but all of this happening all of my hard work with the best additude I can have. After me helping my parents doing good in school be a nice guy to the teachers and fellow students my mom tells me I should go help the neighbors with their yard work with the young men(religious kids) I said not I want to play with my friend on xbox because my xbox is the only thing giving me happiness these days and when I say no she acts like I'm a horrible person like I have done nothing and them she takes a hit at my after school stuff saying my that I need to change my after school ways because bis college you need to work 24/7 just what the fuck man I've done all of this gone through your shit for you and you act like I'm the bitch the fuck I'm gonna try having a talk with my parents tonight to tell them how shitty of a job they are doing right now yes they are trying their best but they just don't pay attention and it makes me feel and look like shit
