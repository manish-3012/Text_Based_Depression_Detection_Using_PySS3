I think I wanna be a nudist? Lol Hey dudes Iâ€™m 13m and I live in Florida not too far from a nude beach and Iâ€™ve always thought it would be fun to go but Iâ€™ve been too scared to ask cause most people think thatâ€™s pretty weird. It came up in a conversation my mom/stepdad were having yesterday so I mentioned that I thought it would be fun to go :)
They mostly thought it was funny because Iâ€™m really shy and introverted so they didnâ€™t take me seriously. But they said if I really wanted to do it, I should go nude at home for a day or two to see if I could handle it. So Iâ€™m supposed to try it tomorrow but they said if I go through with it I wonâ€™t be able to put anything on until Wednesday night, like my bedroom door would be locked lol.
It probably wouldnâ€™t be that bad but my mom got my sister to message a few of our friends that live in our apartment complex about coming over since there would obviously be a lot of people at a nude beach which makes sense but Iâ€™ve never really been naked in front of anyone so Iâ€™m really nervous. But should I do it!?
Idk how they know about it but a lot of my friends are messaging me on Facebook telling me I better not back out lol ðŸ˜‚
