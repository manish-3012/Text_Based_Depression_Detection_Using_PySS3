Need to rant again Sooooooooooooo guess who now hates the sound of crying babies and still wants to die in a hole (hint itâ€™s me). Soooo quick recap my mom (who is manipulative, controlling, self centered (narcissistic), attention seeking, irresponsible (in the way of she canâ€™t admit that sheâ€™s wrong and blames my dad for me and her bad relationship), basically a r/insainparent) got engaged to a dipshit, mind controlled, snooping, asshole about what like 7 or 8 months ago and I learned about 5 months ago she was pregnant. She also asked me multiple times months before if I wanted another sibling and when I replied â€œNO I DONT WANT ANOTHER SIBLING I HAVE TOO MANYâ€ she replied with â€œwell itâ€™s my choiceâ€ like uhhhh ok fine then donâ€™t take my fukn feelings into consideration and then make me feel bad for not wanting a relationship with this thing your having. So now the child (I canâ€™t call it my sibling because it isnâ€™t a sibling in my eyes and Iâ€™m not trying to take it out on the kid but there is no way for me to relate this thing to me) is born and every time I hear it cry I for some reason get filled with rage and cry myself and I just ugh itâ€™s like i have no clue how to describe it like itâ€™s just the Absolute form of my mom saying I donâ€™t give half a shit about your feelings or opinions. The other thing is is that I can tell you for a fact this isnâ€™t going to be the only child she has with this douchbag because she has said multiple times before to at least have 2 children so they wonâ€™t be lonely sooooo yeah I know for sure more mental shit is coming my way. I want to mention I recently got over saying I wanna shoot myself and making dark suicidal jokes because I was getting better and happy you know before this I was extremely happy I have the sweetest boyfriend ever I wasnâ€™t dealing with any major mom shit I was no longer being bullied and I had a few friends and when quarantine started I had a shit tone of time to do stuff and get costumes done and have fun but Iâ€™ve gone back to making those dark jokes and drawing upsetting vent art and wanting to punch walls and ugh my mental state went back to shit and I donâ€™t know what to do except vent and attempt to push through but being quarantined with her and not being able to see my boyfriend is just making life so much worse like wtf universe you finally gave me happiness only to take it away like I donâ€™t know im just super emotional and just wanna go live with my dad and be able to take my cat son with me which thatâ€™s a whole other issue that I will get into later I donâ€™t know ugh this went from me trying to proper grammar to a complete mess sorry bout that but yeah Iâ€™ll just leave it here and go try to sneak eat some cookies or something play some video games something to make me feel better. So yeah hopefully you all have a good morning evening whatever and thank you for actually looking at my incredibly bad grammar, punctuation, mess of a rant so I hope you have a nice day and goodbye until next rant
