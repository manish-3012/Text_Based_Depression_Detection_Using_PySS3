Leather Jackets are an 11/10 My school is having a greaser and soc dress up day because for my grade we just finished The Outsiders. If you don't know what that is 1. I would definitely read the book and that is coming from someone who doesn't like reading and 2. Greasers are basically the rougher part of town and always getting a bad rap even when they didn't do anything while the socs (pronounced sosh) are the preppy rich kids that never get in trouble. Ok so I'm dressed up as a greaser and I'm wearing a leather jacket AND I FEEL FUKN COOL FOE ONCE. LIKE MY GOD THE POWER OF A NICE AND COMFY LEATHER JACKET BROUGHT ME THE MOST SELF CONFIDENCE THAT IVE HAD IN A LONG TIME AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHJ
