I seriously pissed my homeroom teacher off So in my school there is this thing in the morning announcements where every week they give anonymous fun facts on the teachers. Today, the fun fact was that one was a Valedictorian. I then said out loud, â€œHow much do you have to screw your life up to be a valedictorian and end up as a teacher living off a 40k dollar salary.â€ My teacher was staring at me the rest of class. Iâ€™m scared for tomorrow
