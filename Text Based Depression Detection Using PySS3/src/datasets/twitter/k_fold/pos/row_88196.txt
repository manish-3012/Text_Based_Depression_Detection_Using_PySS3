I honestly don't believe that someone being an asshole to a person because of their skin color is more noteworthy than someone being an asshole to anyone for any other reason. This is probably unpopular. I just don't think racism is as big of a problem people make it to be. It is a big problem just like it's a big problem for people in general to criticize and harm anyone for their appearance. But it isn't a more important problem imo. 

Like if you say something rude to someone because they are fat, and you say the exact same thing to someone because they are black, I feel like they both deserve equal punishment or consequence, not the racist person deserving to be killed and completely crucified simply because they was racist.
