Girls with bigger feet need more of there shoe sizes!!! Summary: Longstory short, this is my experience with a bunch of searching for shoes that I liked with my shoe size and how women with size 9 to size 14 should be able to find their shoe size and fit the actual shoe. 



Okay so for my 14th birthday, my brother said that he would get me some shoes right? So I was scrolling and scrolling looking for some shoes that I would really like, and I was mainly looking at wedge sneakers because it's like wearing heels and sneakers at the same time, but I can tie them and they look cute with dresses. When I finally found the ones I liked.... They only went up to size 10.

I'm around 5'9â€“5'10 and wear size 11 in women's. 

So I went back in and searched on Amazon AND Macy's and had to find shoes within my brother's $36 budget and within the length of my dusty crusty long af feet ðŸ¦¶ðŸ¾, and settled on boots. I found a pair of heeled boots (where I'd have to relearn how to walk because last time I TRIED wearing heels was on right grade picture day and I fell down the stairs at school) that came in my size.

I got them a month after my birthday because if Corona delays and my brother's procrastination (just swipe the card big bro, but the affection of your precious little sister you only see one a month ðŸ¥º). I was sooo happy when I got the shoes and I tried them on and my toes had no room to wiggle. They were wiggleless. WIGGLELESS I TELL YOU!!! And due to my brother's procrastination once again, and him basically not caring, they are now sitting in my room because he didn't care whether or not they got returned and he got his money back.... but I also forgot about them.

So if anyone in Texas want some cute heel boots in a women's 11 get me up!
