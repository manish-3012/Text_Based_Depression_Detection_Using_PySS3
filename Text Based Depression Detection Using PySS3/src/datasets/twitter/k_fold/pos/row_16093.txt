I feel dead In one of the classes I have this teacher and she doesnâ€™t let you do any late work because itâ€™s not fair to anyone but are you kidding me? We donâ€™t even get two days to turn anything and we have more important class, I get threatened by my parents every day and can barely make sure I donâ€™t end up starving myself because of the stress. I CANT PRACTICE MUSIC WHEN IM HAVING BENCHMARK AND ESSAYS DUE IN THE SAME DAY. Thanks for coming to my TED talk
