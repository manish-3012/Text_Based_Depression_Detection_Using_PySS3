Last night I had a dream It was a very vivid dream. 

One day Iâ€™d woken up just like any day getting ready for school it was the start of a new quarter so everyone got different classes. I looked in the mirror and thought of myself as ugly and inadequate. 

So I went to school I only had one class this quarter and it was e-commerce. There was this new guy though and Jesus Christ he was so fucking hot. 

Since the classes were small due to covid I was able to get to know him quite well. After knowing him my crush on him got much larger but I didnâ€™t know if it would ever work out anyways because I didnâ€™t know if he was gay or bi and Iâ€™m still closeted so he wouldnâ€™t even know. 

We had developed a good friendship over a few weeks in class. But one day he invited me over to his house just to hangout. I of course just said â€œsure sounds funâ€, but when we got there he confessed his love for me. I was so happy. We ended up making out for a while but then I woke up. I checked my phone to see if I had any texts from him. None, none at all we had actually never texted. I checked to see if he had sent me something on Snapchat and Instagram and turned out, he didnâ€™t have an account on either. He didnâ€™t exist. I cried my dream hadnâ€™t come true even though it felt so real. All I want is someone to love and it even manifested in my dreams to make me happy for a brief moment but it was all the same afterwards.

Iâ€™m still depressed and I still have little chance of finding someone.
