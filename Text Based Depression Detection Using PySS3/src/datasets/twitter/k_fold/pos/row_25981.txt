What a fucking bitch... This girl is all mad and up in arms because I told her to be careful. What I told her to be careful about is that she lets guys fuck her without condoms, which she fucking told me btw I didn't ask. She's been my friend for a while so I told her to be careful with that cause I was concerned. She just flipped me off when I said it's not really my business and that I maybe shouldn't have said anything. 

I'm about this close to flipping out but I think I'm better off just blocking her I feel like. Jesus fucking Christ what is her issue? Someone talk me down so I don't flip shit on her.
