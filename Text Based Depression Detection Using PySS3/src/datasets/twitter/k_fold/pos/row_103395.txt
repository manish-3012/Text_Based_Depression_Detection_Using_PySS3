It might be just me but u tell me... So I was sitting in the middle of my room on the floor and was scrolling through reddit so long on my phone... I forgot which way I was facing. Meaning I had to turn my flashlight on on my phone to see where I was in my room. I might me an idiot. Or I might be an idiot with a common problem. U tell me.
