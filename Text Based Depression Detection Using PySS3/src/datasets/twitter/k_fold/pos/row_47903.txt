Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 6: Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson was the president that led the U.S. through World War One. However, he wasn't always an American. He grew up in the Confederacy, and this shows in his ideas.

As president, he implemented an absurdly high amount of segregation in federal offices.

Later, he threw William Monroe Trotter (one of the Civil Rights leaders of the time and a devout support of Wilson) out of the Oval Office after he came in with a peaceful demonstration to discuss his segregation policy.

Aside from this, he believed in Eugenics, which is the idea that the government should assign you a spouse to have children with based on your genetic traits.
