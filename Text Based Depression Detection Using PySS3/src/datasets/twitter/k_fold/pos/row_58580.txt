[RANT] People who think mobile games are not considered gaming people who lack common sense This sparked on my head since the Dr. Disrespect post on twitter but i just think he wants attention, but why the fuck does some people think its not fucking gaming? I like to think these people as people crying over not getting a consistent 120fps on the game theyre playing and rants about it. And also the console peeps who have the same ideas are pieces of shit. Yeah yeah your console is next fucking gen i dont care because every device is good in their own way, PC has tons of usability and you can do pretty much anything with it,  Console focuses on gaming together with friends and puts next gen hardware on a smaller form factor. Mobile goes for portability while also having fun if youre going on a different place, while its graphics arent that good looking, its gives you enough fun like how the switch works. And those motherfuckers think yes the switch is gaming but mobile fucking phones arent? People who think like this arent a true gamer. I am a pc and mobile gamer and this is outrageous
