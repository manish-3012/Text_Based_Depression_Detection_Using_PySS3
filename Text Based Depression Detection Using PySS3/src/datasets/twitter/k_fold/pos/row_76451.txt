I feel depressed for the first time in months Ever since I moved to Austin I've been pretty much perfectly content, extrmely happy tbh.

However today I just took a total nosedive and I feel like absolute garbage. To start it off I ran out of blades for my razor about a week ago so all my body hair has started growing back and I really don't like that.

Along with that I didnt realize how much money I was spending on stupid shit and it turns out I've spent $50 dollars on random subscriptions and shit, and I do't have a job and I can't get one right now until I get my SS card, and I have to wait for that because my dad won't just fucking give it to me.

I haven't run in two weeks now and I honestly don't know if I'm going to be able to get back into the groove. I was going super well, I had two months of running every other day, and I only had a week left on my 9 week plan, but then it rained every day I needed to run, and it snowed this week.

I've been able to keep up with my diet, in fact I've actually further restricted myself because I got a calorie tracker app, however today I was so stressed I started eating which made me more stressed, so on and so forth.

I just feel gross and tired and hopeless. I'm so not ready to start being an adult yet but I feel like I have no choice. I need to get to therapy but I can't fucking do that without my ss, and even then its so fucking backed up it would take months to schedule a fucking appointment.

Along with that my fucking acne is killing me, especially on my back, and its making me feel disgusting but I can't see a dermatologist for the same reasons as the therapist.

I've only been an adult for 6 days and I fucking hate it.
