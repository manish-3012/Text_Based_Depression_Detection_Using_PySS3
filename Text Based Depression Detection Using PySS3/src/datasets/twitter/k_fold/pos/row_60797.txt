today sucks i hate tuesdays. especially today, itâ€™s cold and dark and rainy. i only have a quarter tank of gas. just found out that my exâ€™s assigned seat is right fkn in front of me. iâ€™m more anxious than normal, i miss my Happy Pen. photo flashbacks are reminding me of my ex best friend who essentially ghosted me for her boyfriend. my current best friend isnâ€™t here so i canâ€™t get my back popped. in conclusion, today fkn sucks.
