I don't know what I want to do with my life As you can tell my the title, I don't know what to do with my life. I don't know what to go to college for let alone what college to go to

I don't know what job I want let alone what I want for a career

Im currently in a career tech school but my program isn't what I thought it was and I don't want a career in it. 

I don't know what to do and I'm a junior in high school, I want to make my parent proud. Neither finished college, my dad didn't even finish high school. They both want me to go to college but tbh at this point living in a van sounds better than being a pencil pusher in a cubicle for the rest of my life. 

Anyone have any advice??
