This is my 3rd time in a row sleeping with all lights off I've been scared of the dark for my entire life, and I've always slept with some sort of light on. it went from leaving my door open with the hallway light on, to sleeping with both that and a lamp on, to just the lamp on, to putting something on top of the to dim it, to finally sleeping without any lights on. Goodnight homies!
