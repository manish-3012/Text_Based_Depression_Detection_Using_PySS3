i live and breathe reddit that's right

reddit is my life. its the air I breath and I'm not even kidding. my inhaler has reddit tag on it. I sleep, eat, drink this site

lookism is me and I am lookism. I plan on having a wedding with lookism. that's why I say I am the perfect candidate for moderator here. I fit 100% to be moderator here. this is not just a site for me.. it's my life. that's why I should become moderator

I skip school for lookism ffs. sometimes I don't even drink nor eat food just to browse/post on lookism

for me.. lookism is worth way more than my parents, pets, siblings etc. way more. I'd choose lookism over them without a doubt

lookism &gt; my life and friends. I choose lookism over them every single time

I sell my house + car for lookism
