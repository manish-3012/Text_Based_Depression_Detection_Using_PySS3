Anyone else find these people annoying Vegans well not every vegan, just the ones that yell at you for getting a sandwich, like dude just because Iâ€™m not getting a sandwich doesnâ€™t mean the thing isnâ€™t gonna be killed, and then they say Iâ€™m cruel for saying that. Like dude nature is cruel to, either way itâ€™s gonna die.
