Doing a REALLY hard test in 30 minutes... Anyways I decided to try Cambridgeâ€™s CPE (Certificate of Proficiency in English) and the written test is going to happen soon. Iâ€™m scared, although prepared. Pls wish me luck, even tho Iâ€™ve been studying for it since March xD. (English isnâ€™t my first language, and this would be a huge improvement at least for my certification, since I only have a basic â€œthis person can handle English on his ownâ€ kind of certification, lol)
