Local Rock Radio Every night i sleep to classic rock radio, because of this i associate one fucking band to winter and the colder months. The band Heart is played like every day in October - December/January. I cant not associate the song Magic Man with snow goddammit. I donâ€™t have a problem with it but why Heart of all bands to be associated with cold months? 

Also my mom says Heart reminds her of a dirty carpet and i somewhat agree.
