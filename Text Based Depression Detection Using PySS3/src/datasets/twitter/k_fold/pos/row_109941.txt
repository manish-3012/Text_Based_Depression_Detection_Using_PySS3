My experience with covid so far My brother got covid like symptoms about a week ago and got tested then, and it came back negative only for then his symptoms to go on and then a test about a day or 2 ago come back positive.

Basically meaning the first place fucked up or idk what happened but isnâ€™t his fault and by now everyone whoâ€™s come in contact with him more than likely has a strong chance of having it now too which then leads me to my own personal experience with it since Iâ€™m 90% sure I have it now too.

So far our experiences have really just been a lack of energy, really weird feeling headache for us it hasnâ€™t felt painful I guess more like an annoyance but nothing worth complaining about, lots of congestion, some aches and thatâ€™s really it.

Itâ€™s the same way heâ€™s felt for the past week that I feel now so I mean we used the same bathroom, kitchen, ya know whatever else in the house for a week now with him having it so pretty sure I have it now and luckily so far on the very lesser spectrum
