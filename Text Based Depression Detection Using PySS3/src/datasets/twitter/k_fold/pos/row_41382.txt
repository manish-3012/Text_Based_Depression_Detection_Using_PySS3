Listen, I know this sounds bad, but if anyone who considers themself an incel would like to vent to me, go ahead I won't hate you, obviously I'll try to change your view of the world, but I'll be respectful while doing it, this isn't coming from a point of superiority either, I genuinely want to help and understand
