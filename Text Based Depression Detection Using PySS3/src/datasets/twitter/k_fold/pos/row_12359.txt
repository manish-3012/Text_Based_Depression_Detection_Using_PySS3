My mom is annoying So for context we recently got a new puppy and my dad is being trained for his job in another state.

 After 2 days we finally got a name for the Puppy and before that I had been saying stuff like They're (Insert Action here) and she has been saying its she not they. We got into an argument I said "You can pronounce it in a Singular way." She ignored me and said she's not transgender, I kept trying to justify it but she'd interrupt me and come up with a bs excuse. My mom is honestly a Semi-Karen.

  I don't care how she thinks I should word my sentences, I've heard a crap ton of people say it as they rather than she or he. I'm homeschooled but its virtual not like she reads a book and quizzes me or shit. Either way she's unnecessarily unreasonable.

 She is overthinking on how something should be said and is yelling at me for not saying it in that way.
She is annoying she pisses me off way too easily and wants people to stop what they're doing to do what she wants them to do. And at this point I want to cut ties with her when I'm old enough to move out.

 Imagine your parent or parents getting mad and yelling at you over a single word. That can be pronuced in a multiple of ways.
