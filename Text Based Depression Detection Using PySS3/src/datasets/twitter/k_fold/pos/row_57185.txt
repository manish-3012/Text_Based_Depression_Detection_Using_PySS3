Does anyone else have olfactory hallucinations sometimes? This startet a while back when I for some reason kept smelling sour cream and onion pringles despite none being anywhere in the house. I found it odd but I assumed my parents had some that they hid from me, but then it happened on the train, in school and at my girlfriend's place. Then I smelled whiskey with a slight note of vanilla, despite the whiskey being closed. Neither of my parents drink and my whiskey doesn't smell like vanilla. Could this have something to do with me being able to perfectly remember and mix tastes in my head? I mean, once I've eaten something, I remember every little note of its taste and I can mix and match it with every other one of the tastes in my head. Should I go to my doctor about this?
