just a boring rant * Slight trigger warning - Self h*rm *


So I've had tic's for about two years now and they've recently gotten worse. I went from twitching my arm, saying sounds at random, and stuff like that -- too jerking my head, yelling words/phrases, and randomly dancing/shaking. And they got really bad on Thanksgiving day, and while I was in the car I hit my head with my wrist and she asked me what was up, and I told her they were happening involuntarily and she just laughed and said "So now you've got tourette's?" and I didn't really expect her to believe me bc when I told her about my self h*rm, she told me I was attention seeking. and even though home alone, and when no one is watching, she still doesn't believe me. So yah, I just wanted to share this fun snip bit of my life
