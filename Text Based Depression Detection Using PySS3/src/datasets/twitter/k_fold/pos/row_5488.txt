I want a girlfriend Like most of the people here lmao. I donâ€™t want it to be like my other relationships where we are just friends but with our genders in front of the title. I want a girlfriend who texts me all the time, one who will hold my hand, one who will put her head on my shoulder and make any negative emotions going around in my head disappear. There are only like 5 girls in my grade who I actually like (not in THAT way but yeah). And I doubt theyâ€™d be like that. The only ones that would do that I find annoying. Iâ€™d also be fine with dating a guy but of course everyone just HAS to be straight

Side rant: what the hell is the deal with no simp September, like it makes no sense to me. To me it sounds like people intentionally being toxic because itâ€™s â€œfor the boys.â€ Honestly itâ€™s so stupid. The whole â€œfor the boysâ€ thing is funny sometimes, but a lot of the time it gets taken too far. Also can we STOP using the word simp. The way people use it now is to make fun of people for being straight (or in my case bi).
