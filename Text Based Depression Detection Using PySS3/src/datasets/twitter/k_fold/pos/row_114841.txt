It's really sad how many peoples shoes are worth as much as the money which can solve most or all of your problems. :( Mine is 10,000$ for all problems maybe 15,000$ how much is yours. There are shoes (Nike's and other) which cost this and above. Like why do people have to suffer? When there is such a huge economy? Why can't the economy be fair and equal?

What is the money$ which can solve most or all of your problems?
