Weekly self post weekend story #1: femboy reality I came back from work and opened reddit then someone linked me to a subreddit named r/196. 

â€œHuh,I never heard of it whatâ€™s that?â€ I murmured to myself then saw several posts about femboys. 

â€œEw, I would never be a femboy, they are disgusting.â€ I turn off reddit but right as I went to swipe up to close it, a small hand with painted nails reached out to me and took me in. 

â€œLet me go!â€ I shouted at the hand, but to no avail. It took me in and threw me to a place I had never seen before. There were several men walking in maid dresses and wearing masks with 'UwU' written on them. 

â€œWhat the hell? Is this a dimension of femboys?â€ I started running in one direction, hiding from anybody in my way because I knew they were a threat. 

â€œCome here! Hide with us before they see you.â€ A voice suddenly told me and I followed their command in pure determination. I saw a blonde man, a tall young boy and a short muscular man. 

â€œWho are you? Why did you tell me to hide with you? What is this place?â€ I said to the weird group. 

â€œHello! We are the only men here that arenâ€™t femboys and we asked you to hide with us because we thought we were the only normal peopleâ€ the blonde man said to me. 

â€œWhat is this place?â€ I asked him. 

â€œI believe you were teleported from another reality.â€ The short muscular man told me. 

â€œHuh? Why do you think that?â€ I asked the short muscular man. 

â€œYou donâ€™t look from here and I was also teleported from another reality. r/196, right?â€ The man said to me. 

â€œYes! How did you know?â€ I asked him, now intrigued. 

â€œI was also taken from my home from r/196. This reality is the femboy reality. If you arenâ€™t femboy you either get turned into one or you die, the higher ups choose how you die.â€ He said, eyes getting a bit teary. 

They offered me some food and we talked a bit. 

â€œI am Keith.â€ the blonde man said to me â€œthis tall boy is David, and this short tank is micheal. Whatâ€™s your name?â€

â€œMy name is Kyle.â€ I said to Keith â€œthanks for taking me in.â€

â€œNo problem, Kyle. We should sleep itâ€™s getting dark and we are going to new shelter soon.â€ Keith told me. 

â€œWhy would you move shelter?â€ I asked them. 

â€œBecause we are wanted criminals. Michealâ€™s dad was shot to death for not turning into a femboy and we ran away as fast as we could from them. Now we are the biggest criminals in the entire reality.â€ David explained to me. â€œWe donâ€™t want to die too so Micheal's dad doesnâ€™t die in vain.â€ 

We said goodnight and went to sleep.
