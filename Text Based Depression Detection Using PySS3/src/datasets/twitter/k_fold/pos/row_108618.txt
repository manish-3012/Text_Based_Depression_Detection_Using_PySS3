I just found out that one of my friends genuinely believes that all people who listen to country music are racist The stupidity levels are off the charts. I like some country music so I guess I'm racist now. And no I'm not joking about this shit. Gonna go try to change her mind. I can't believe I even have to try to change her mind about this
