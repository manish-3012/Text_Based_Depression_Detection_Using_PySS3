I tried to follow one of those Japanese ASMR Cooking Channels Tutorials and fucked up pretty bad Anyone know Nino's Home? He made a video about chocolate truffels and uhhh.

I fucked this up bad. Like, really bad.
I think the biggest and first problem was i didn't use enough cocoa powder when mixing it with the condensed milk. I poured it into that bowl thingy forgot what its called and put it in the fridge. After a few hours i take it back out and tried to put it onto the cutting board and - it don't work. Fuck. The mix of condensed milk and cocoa powder was stuck to that foil and it didn't want to get off. I tried scraping it off and about 25% of it was still stuck on the foil and couldn't get off and thus had to be thrown away. Then i thought hmm i should put more cocoa powder into it and put a bit more onto it and started kneading it in hopes of fixing it. Not a good idea. 
Everything was extremely sticky and stuck on my hands and fingers. I called my sister and told her to get more of the cocoa powder and she did. I now had lost another 5% of the dough because it wouldn't get off of my hands and i had to wash it off or else it would've stuck there forever. Now i sprinkled a lot like a god damn lot of the cocoa powder and mixed it into my creation. And it was less sticky, ey something good happened, buuuuuttttt now it was really bitter. The remains are currently on a plate in the fridge and i sprinkled some powdered sugar onto it in hopes of somehow saving it and having it not gone completely to waste. Wish me luck.

Tl;dr i didn't put enough cocoa powder, everything sticky, then bitter, total failure and lost about 30% of what i originally had
