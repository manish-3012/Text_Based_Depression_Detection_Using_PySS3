What does this mean??? I recently followed everyone on instagram from my team including a guy I have a crush on. I noticed he followed back almost EVERY single team member (mutual friends) but me. Why? Does that mean he dislikes me?

For context, we've been on the team together for two years and exchange a few words occasionally. We just aren't really friends although we're on good terms.
