Life feels like such a drag. I don't know how much more of this I can take. Let me preface this by saying I don't want your attention, I only want to put this out there, maybe have a nice discussion about it.

It feels like I'm living just to live. I wake up every day, and I say hello to a few friends. I play some games. I check my phone. I go to school, and I get some assignments to do.

I come home, and do my school assignments in less than an hour. I get passing grades on all of them. Then I mindlessly pace around the house for hours, and hours. I give myself menial tasks to occupy myself. I live in an okay neighborhood, with nice people for parents, with siblings that tolerate me. 

I have such an *average* life. I'm not really popular among my peers. I sort of blend in. I have a lot of interests, but I choose not to express them more often than not because I'm anxious that people will judge me for it.

I have anxiety. It doesn't impact my social life hugely, but it does make me do things that I otherwise wouldn't had I not gotten clinical anxiety through genetics. I wish I wouldn't worry so much about the most trivial things at night. I keep myself up for hours, thinking about "What if ---?" making the worst possibly scenarios just to satisfy my brain's need to channel my anxiety.

I should be happy. I have friends. I have hobbies. I get good grades. But I'm not. I don't know what to do.
