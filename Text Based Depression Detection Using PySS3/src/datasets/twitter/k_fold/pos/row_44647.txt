Instead of teachers berating and embarrassing students for what theyâ€™ve done wrong they should motivate them for what theyâ€™ve done right. One compliment is the difference between a successful person and a liability. Instead of pegging students and making their lives worse teachers should strive to find their strengths and help the person build on that. 
Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
