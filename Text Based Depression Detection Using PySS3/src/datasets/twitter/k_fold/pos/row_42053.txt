Teacher accidentally left mic on and made transphobic comments against another student, What do I do? My teacher during a study hall accidentally left her mic on and while talking to another teacher said that she wouldnâ€™t refer to the student as the students respected pronoun and would continue using the students dead name, Should I report this?
