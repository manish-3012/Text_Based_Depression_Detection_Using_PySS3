Screw teachers that say theyâ€™re tired of grading HW and assigning 4 things in one nigh Honestly, why tf they gotta do that, especially in my AP physics class, I canâ€™t go a night without HW, and my teacher straight up told us during class he was tired of having to look over HW and tests and labs, then proceeds to give us 3 things to do, like wtf man, just let us chill for once
