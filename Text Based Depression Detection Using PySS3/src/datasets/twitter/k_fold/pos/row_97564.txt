Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 32 And here's today's fact! As usual, if you have any questions about space OR topics you want to know a fact about, lemme know! See you tomorrow!  


Fact: The probability that we are alone in the universe just became a little higher. Unlike most discoveries you hear about, recent studies have shown that Earth may very well be the only place where intelligent life thrives.....  

**...so far.**  

Our ever-expanding knowledge of the life cycle of the universe has told us that life will be possible for about another 100 ***trillion*** years. For reference, life on Earth has only existed for about 4 *billion* years, and it is thought that life has been possible for about 13.7 billion. It is still unlikely, but we now know that it is certainly possible that we are simply the first chapter in the story of life. Planets and stars will continue to form until the last star dies, and it is estimated that around 50 billion planets in our galaxy alone lie in the habitable zone. If you put that number on a universal scale, you get a staggering 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets where life could be possible.  

If we are somehow the first, that means we can take pride in the fact that we can experience something later civilizations won't be able to. Over the next few trillion years, the expansion of spacetime will cause stars and galaxies to become so distant from each other that they won't be visible in the night sky. Future lifeforms may wonder: what was it like to live in the brilliant early days of the universe? We are lucky, because we know the answer.  

All we have to do is look up.
