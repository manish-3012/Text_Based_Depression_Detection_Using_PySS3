A very weird (maybe bad) birthday Jan. 8 is my birthday and im turning 14. Last year when I was turning 13, it was so bad because I had school and didnt really celebrated it. Now i asked my mom to have some people over because i hated my birthday last year. So its Jan. 7 and i still had online school for my tomorrow and I usually sleep at 11 so I can get up early. But because of my birthday, i decided to sleep at 1 am. When i woke up in the morning, i was almost late, i didnt took a bath i just cleaned my face and went to school. Now during afternoon break of school, i went to the garage and play basketball (i had a small ring hanged up). At this point my dog was outside her cage just runnin around and stuff. Then out of nowhere she just rough played with me and bit me. At this point it was already a bad day but boi its much worse than that. In the morning i have done all my tasks and stuff for school, i was just waiting for the next class but my mom took my phone and said to focus on school. I tried to reason with her but you know, she didnt understand even i told her i was done. So at that point it was already a crappy birthday. After i got bitten by dog my uncle (my parents were out of the house to get ready for the party) took me to get anti rabies and anti tetanus. Right now its the evening and party is about to get started and ill keep an update on the party. Thanks for reading this tho just needed to share this terrible experience.
