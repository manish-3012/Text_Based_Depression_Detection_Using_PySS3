lol I think Iâ€™m kinda in love with my best friend and thatâ€™s freaking me out because we both girls!!! Lol lol lol ahaha what.

we joke about how we should makeout all the time but the thing is Iâ€™d deadass do it, I just donâ€™t know if shes just joking around. Like today we came REALLY close to kissing and I was so excited but then we didnâ€™t because she pulled away and started laughing because it was â€œjust a jokeâ€ and I laughed with her but honestly I felt sad when she pulled away. And even right now Iâ€™m kinda sad lol. But like Iâ€™m â€œstraightâ€. So uh idk. The feeling I have right now is so much more weirder and painful than anything else. And Iâ€™ve had guys be assholes to me who Iâ€™ve really liked before. But this feels different because itâ€™s not an infatuation with someone I donâ€™t know, but rather someone I know and care deeply about and she just pulls at my heart strings. Where I just like kinda want something ig, idk what exactly but I wanna kiss her so bad and ack thatâ€™s scary lol.
