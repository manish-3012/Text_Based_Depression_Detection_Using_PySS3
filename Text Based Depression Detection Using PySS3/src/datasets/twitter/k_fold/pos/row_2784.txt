The reason why some parents seem mean to you as you get older For the most par the reason is parents seem like they get meaner as you get older is because they see that they are loosing you. The thing is that your parents feel like they are loosing you as you get older and they want you to be the baby you use to be. For example when they asked you something to do you do it right away but now you argue with it. It's not that they want to be mean it's that they want you to be their baby again. So next time you get angry at them for yelling at you for talking back or some other thing take what they are feeling into perspective and dont get all mad because that's just gonna make it worse.
