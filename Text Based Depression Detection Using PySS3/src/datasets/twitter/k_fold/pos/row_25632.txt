if you make fun of someone's music taste you're actual scum saying like haha this song is so bad and shit like that is fine ig but when people repeatedly take the piss out of other peoples music taste it's so shitty like if they like it why does that matter to you???? like this girl I used to be friends with would do it all the time and now I always feel embarrassed saying what music I like and at point she literally took songs off my playlist???? if someone's music isnt your cup of tea then just say that but let people like what the like (unless its Morrissey)
