What would y'all want/not want to see in a YA romance story? I wanna know what y'all think. Are there any tropes, cliches, elements in romances that you just don't like or resonate with? What seems unrealistic in your opinions? What would you want to see that you don't think you've seen before or seen enough of? Personally I detest love triangles and the typical "bad boy who everyone totally fawns over"
