only reason i miss school is because i want to fall asleep in the bus on my way home and wake up with my eyes feeling cold and sleepy, my hoodie keeping me comfy, getting off the bus and just barely being able to walk the way home because of how tired i am and how much my bones hurt from the day at school. then when i get home i just let myself fall onto my bed and fall asleep again until grandma wakes me up to have lunch
