How do I teach the annoying kid a lesson Just to clarify heâ€™s not a bully but really annoying 
If you ask him anything heâ€™ll most likely respond with 
â€œYOuR mOMâ€
He constantly is being rude and trashy to people who have had a bad time at school 
take for instance a girl in my class had a golf ball thrown at her by her ex twice and she was crying 
The person made fun of  her.
So I need need to know how to deal with it 
Sorry for bad grammar
