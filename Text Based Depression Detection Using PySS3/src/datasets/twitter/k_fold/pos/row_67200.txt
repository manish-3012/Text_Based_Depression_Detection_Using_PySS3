Question from a parent: Iâ€™ve got two teens about to start virtual school. What can I do to help them? Iâ€™ve got two teens, 15 and 18. They will be in high school and college respectively.  We have lots of technology available so thatâ€™s covered well.  

I know they miss their friends and all the joking around that happens at school. Canâ€™t fix that specifically right now.


What can I, a supportive dad, do to help them have a good year or virtual school?
