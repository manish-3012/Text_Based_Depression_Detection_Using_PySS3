I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me I have a 69% in AP Lit because of a couple missing assignments, and Iâ€™m supposed to write 3 essays for my â€œfinal examâ€ (due a while ago) but I just donâ€™t care. I keep telling myself how â€œcoolâ€ it would be to fail a class one semester and then get an A the next with a 5 on the exam like it wonâ€™t drop my gpa and take my credits away. I donâ€™t know why I just donâ€™t care, Iâ€™m not worried about getting into college because I know my test scores are great and I decided to go to community for the first year anyway. Iâ€™ve never failed a class before but itâ€™s almost like I want to. Not even sure if I can still turn it in tbh

I didnâ€™t take my AP gov final either because my Covid symptoms were bad that day but i still havenâ€™t emailed him to ask for a new testing date in January. Like what? 15 year old me would be so mad that i threw everything away
