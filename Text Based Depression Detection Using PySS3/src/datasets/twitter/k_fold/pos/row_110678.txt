hi there is something thatâ€™s been bothering me for a while. so today I went to my cousins house and we were hanging out. Iâ€™m 14 heâ€™s 24 and he just asked to see me feet and I said no repeatedly and he kept begging and now iâ€™m uncomfortable because weâ€™re so close and heâ€™s like a brother to me. What should I do?
