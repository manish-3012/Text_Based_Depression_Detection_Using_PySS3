Im telling you guys since I dont know who to tell and I cant bear it any more I dont really know how to describe it but I always feel guilty. Idk why. I feel like everything I do is fake. I try to just ignore it but its eating at me. I feel like how I feel is fake. My familys love for me is fake. My friends caring about me is fake. I know its not but I have that feeling deep down and it keeps getting stronger. I feel terrible deep down and I dont know what to do about it. And that feeling is extremly strong today.
Sorry about that. I had to tell someone and dont want to tell anybody near me because im afriad of hurting them or making them mad.
