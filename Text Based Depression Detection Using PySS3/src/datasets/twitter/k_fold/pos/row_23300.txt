I really really love my best friend 
We've known each other for 14 years now and everytime I see her, I can't believe how lucky I am to have this beautiful, talented, cute and awesome girl in my life. She's the best person i know and I would give everything for her. I literally can't describe how much she means to me. She doesn't even know that she's saved my life multiple times and made me love myself. If there's actually a god, I want to thank them for bringing this ethereal human being in my life!
