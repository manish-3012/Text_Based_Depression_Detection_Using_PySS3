I had to sit across from a female my age today at dinner. My brothers baseball team went out to a restraunt after the game.  One of the kids has a cute sister my age, but I've always been too afraid to go near her. When we got to the restraunt, luck had it that I sat across from her. She looked at me weird, and gave me a half hearted "hi".  I said hello back, and was terrified.  I sat down, and I didn't know what to do. I tried to talk to the kid next to me, but she keept asking me questions.  I gave short answers, not knowing what to say. I ate as quick as I could, and ran out to hid in my family's car.
That really sucked.  Sorry for my rant, I just needed to get it off my chest.

Sorry for the rant I just thought some fellow incels like u/Man-Akle would like to hear.
