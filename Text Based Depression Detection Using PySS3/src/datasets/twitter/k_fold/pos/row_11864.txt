How do you escape a toxic relationship that you feel inclined to be in? Iâ€™m in a relationship i donâ€™t want to be in anymore. But this person is still somehow special to me. She cheated on me and is messed up in so many ways but if i leave her, i feel like sheâ€™ll kill herself due to traumatic events in her life. Please just someone give me advice because i donâ€™t wanna live in this relationship anymore due to the fact itâ€™s poisoning my mind and ruining my mental state. Thanks.
