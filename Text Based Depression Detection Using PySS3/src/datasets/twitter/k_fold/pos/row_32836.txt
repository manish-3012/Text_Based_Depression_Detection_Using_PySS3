Damn notes! I just took a page of detailed an organized notes, which took me twenty minutes. I just realized I did it in the wrong color.... this may seem insignificant but the rest of my notes in the notebook are this color, and now itâ€™s ruined. I have to rip it out an restart. 

I legit had a panic attack over it just now, wtf is wrong with me? It literally should *not* matter that much what color my notes are in?? My damn brain.... I feel so useless sometimes.
