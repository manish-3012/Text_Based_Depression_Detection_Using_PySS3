Calling for all Unity game developers out there! Hi, I'm organizing a team of high school students who know and are interested in Unity and game development. **Before you leave, this will be great for college applications if you're looking for an incentive (leadership + effort + passion).** 

There are a lot of roles to choose,  not just coding:

1. Development (coding in Unity, major part of team)
2. Design (making maps, sprites, etc)
3. Art (designs the sprites and art components, just art stuff)
4. Marketing/Sales (promotes the games, controls social media, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

You may be thinking, what's in it for me?

1. Working as a team helps develop so much teamwork skills and it's easier + fun.
2. Easy college credit. Games are not too hard to make, they just take a bit of effort. Making a few great looking games can look great in college application. It shows that you have determination and perseverance.
3. Learn coding. Not even I am really knowledgeable in Unity. All of us are students and learning. It is a great learning experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Prerequisites?

1. You don't need to have a ton of experience but you should at least know how to code and work with Unity, but I'm not asking too much for skill.
2. For art/design, you should have some artistic skills.
3. Marketing/sales do not need coding or art experience, but you should possess some business characteristics.
4. Fluent in English and have discord.
