I give up on life Feeling worthless tbh. I just recently accepted that I canâ€™t move forward with my life. With all of the advice or support that you guys give me, nothingâ€™s changed. Iâ€™m just the same old same old. Nothing will ever change. Thatâ€™s just fact for me. I honestly feel like Iâ€™m an abomination. I hate myself and my body. Everyone always calls me skinny, I feel embarrassed when Iâ€™m made fun of for my body. I also feel ugly, some people have gave me gestures of disgust when they see me, one kid even called me ugly. Iâ€™m going to just keep playing video games and watch YouTube. Iâ€™m going to abandon my dreams and just find a new job or career. Hereâ€™s to being worthless. Bye guys have a good day.
