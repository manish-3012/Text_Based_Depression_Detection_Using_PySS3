My mom is a Karen and I donâ€™t know what to do Ok, my mom believes that kids should go to school and you shouldnâ€™t vaccinate your kids. I got vaccinated bc my dad isnâ€™t a idiot but my mom is, she thinks if we get vaccines our immune system wonâ€™t work, like at all. She doesnâ€™t believe in dentists and (to my horror) has not been to the dentist in almost 15 or so years. How do I one, convince her that having kids go back is a BAD idea (because tbh most kids wonâ€™t wear a mask or practice social distancing) two, that for the love of everything we should get vaccinated, and three to go to the fucking dentist!

Edit: I didnâ€™t know if I should put rant or serious, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
