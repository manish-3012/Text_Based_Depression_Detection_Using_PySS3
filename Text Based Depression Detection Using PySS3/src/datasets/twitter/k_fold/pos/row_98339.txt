I wanna live my dream life man Thereâ€™s not enough time. I wanna live in a little villa in Italy and have picnics and run through maze gardens and have my own garden. But I also want to be a strong business woman in a bustling city living on my own and being rich. But I also want to have my own library where I can read literature and live a dark academia life. But I also want to wake up every morning and surf and what not. I want to do so much but I have so little time.
