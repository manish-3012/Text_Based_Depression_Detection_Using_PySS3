Okay so this is what I think It's not feminism if it's being sexist towards men. I hate it when girls will degrade and be so demeaning towards men, and call it feminism. That is not feminism. Feminism is believing that men and women are equal, so Stacy, it is not feminism when you say that all men are trash. 
also the fact that women get so mad when people objectify them, but will legit rate a guy's ass, bothers me. Like you can't have it both ways. Obviously objectification of humans kind of sucks, but you can't expect to not be objectified when you objectify others. (take a shot every time I say something along the lines of objectify)
