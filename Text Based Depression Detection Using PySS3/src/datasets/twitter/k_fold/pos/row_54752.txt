TW I told myself I was strong and Iâ€™d get over myself 3 years ago after hospitalization but I seriously canâ€™t live anymore I donâ€™t even know what the fuck Iâ€™m doing Itâ€™s 4 in the morning and I have nothing working for me and I have no friends or bio family this shit sucks. My minds too blank to even want to do anything anymore and I just keep recycling the same old shit just like last time I wish I actually went full force then. I donâ€™t want to end up in the hospital again. They made me stay in my room most of the time anyway. God. If only things could get worse. I have no one to turn to and I canâ€™t connect with you guys, I feel disconnected because I donâ€™t know you. I need to sleep. I just want to stop feeling like such a fucking loser all the time. Night.
