I need help with something guys   Hello! So next year I am going into high school, and I want to take it slow. meaning I want to take all regular classes because I'm not ready to take all AP classes. My mom pretty much has her mind set on me being a doctor and taking dual-credit (dual-credit is where you go to a college during high school and get your basics out of the way for free, which ik is awesome but not good for my mental health yk?) But I'm doing orchestra and theater as electives, as I have been doing for middle school, and I don't think I am ready for that yet. 

 Today, I tried to explain this to her and she didn't listen to my pov. Every time I started to explain why I didn't want to do this, she looked away and rolled her eyes. I tried to explain to her that if taking all PRE-AP classes in intermediate took a toll on my mental health, then all AP in high school would mentally kill me ig.

  And again, I know it's in my best interest to take all AP and do dual-credit, but if I'm not mentally ready for that yet, I shouldn't right? Can someone help me with what to say to her?
