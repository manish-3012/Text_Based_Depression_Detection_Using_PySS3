Seriously I've never felt this confident. I made a post a couple days ago about realizing that if my fuck up of a dad could get married, I could at least get a gf at some point. I didn't realize just how much more confidence that gave me until like a minute ago.



Thanks dad. Still hate you, but thanks.
