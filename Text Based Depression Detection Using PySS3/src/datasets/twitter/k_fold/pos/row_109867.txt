Calling 911 is scary About 15 minutes ago my mom was taken away on an ambulance.  So my mom just had surgery on Wednesday to get her gallbladder removed. But today I was on the couch and I heard my mom start screaming in pain. I didn't know what to do so I just sat there until she started screaming for help. I immediately got up and asked what she needed help with. She just said I dont know and kept screaming in pain. Then she asked for her inhaler, which I got her. She asked me to move the pillows of of her chair so she could sit down. After a few seconds after sitting down still screaming out in pain she told me to call 911. I immediately got the phone and called. I got the guy to send an ambulance and everything. My mom was still screaming the whole time. When he asked I wanted to stay on the line I said I dont know. So he started asking me questions. Like what my name was what grade I was in. By this time my twin brother had called our step dad. The ambulance came and took her to the hospital. My anxiety was skyrocketing the whole time but I stayed calm. I've never been in a situation like that before and it was terrifying. I can say I handled it well though
