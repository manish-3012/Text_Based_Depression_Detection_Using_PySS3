The teachers who dress up for their classroom are the biggest sweethearts ever and are made fun of for trying to bring joyfulness The teachers who dress up to bring joy to the classroom are the sweetest things ever!!! All they are trying to do is bring happiness and laughs to the classroom and they are so under appreciated! Maybe they even bring candy into the room or some decorations, but in my opinion they deserve a raise for these acts of kindness. But they are made fun of for acting silly &amp; having fun!
