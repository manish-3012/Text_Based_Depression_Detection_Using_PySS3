Iâ€™m hella unprepared for going back to school Iâ€™m heading into my senior year and Iâ€™m not prepared at all. I didnâ€™t go to any of my zoom classes after the first month (math &amp; physics) because I just didnâ€™t want to. Iâ€™m signed up for a university level math course and I know Iâ€™m going to be fucked because I didnâ€™t even finish the grade 11 advanced math course. The videos are still available and I can go back and watch them and do the work but Iâ€™ve been working full time and if I didnâ€™t have the motivation before, I certainly donâ€™t have it on my limited amount of days off. 

Basically I put myself in a shitty position and donâ€™t have the motivation to pull myself out of it. Gotta love procrastination, eh?
