Crying actually feels kinda good I was watching kingsman the golden circle and the scene where Merlin dies came up.He started to sing and i felt the burn in my eyes and thought â€œwhy not no one is aroundâ€ and started crying with no noise just tears.Now i have been raised with the mentality that crying is for girls and if I remember the last time I actually cried was like 4 years ago.In this day when something sad happens or I remember something sad i just dont feel anything or maybe just the burn without tears which like feeling a sneeze but not sneezing.I felt happy not sad and i thought is this how i wanna raise my kid making him scared just to show his emotions training him to be a rock with no emotions.What do you guys think
