So I know a Karen... More of a male Karen, a Kyle?

Anyways we are good friends, we hang out sometimes and help each other in homework, but since the first shipment of vaccines came to our country, he keeps talking about how I shouldnâ€™t vaccinate myself and that itâ€™s all 5G, you know the nonsense

So should I cut him out of my life? Or ignore him?
