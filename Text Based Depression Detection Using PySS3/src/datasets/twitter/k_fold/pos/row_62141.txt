you know what we need? a god damn road trip.

my university decided to give the classes online. It was going to be my freshman year. It just stupid. I was too excited for this. I got in to the college i wanted and this is what i get. I know there are a lot off people suffering from the virus and i know my problem is not even a problem but i can't help feeling sad, alright? I waited for this for years. Now everything seems so... i don't fucking know.

i just realized while being sad, the thing that would make me happy right now is a road trip. with anyone, really. you get the snacks and music and a pillow. hours and hours of driving wherever.

i'm so hopeless man. being a teenager sucks
