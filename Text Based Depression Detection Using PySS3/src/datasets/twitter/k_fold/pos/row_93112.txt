Bit of a rant I know no one is going to read this , and it sucks because that just makes me feel more helpless and speechless , like I scream ,but no on listens  

I was listening to some songs , and I just got reminded of my lonliness
I am used to hearing love songs so it wasnâ€™t a problem 
But like this song really reminded me of a character of a book 
That I felt like really related and I just remembered how my life used to be 
I just miss that weird feeling and thrill , I miss it so dang much 
Like it wasnâ€™t even as a gf , it was like just a friend / family member 
But it just made me feel lonley , this also made me realize that the most powerful cure for lonliness isnâ€™t a gf , it isnâ€™t even a friend
Itâ€™s your family , like I have a cousin , we donâ€™t get along that well 
But she used to try to get me into her friend group 
And I think I should just go back and see if she can help me again
The thing is it feels weird , the friend group has changed 
I have changed and the best friend I had on that group isnâ€™t there anymore 
So I feel like it just isnâ€™t the same  and I know I donâ€™t get along with then anymore so itâ€™s a bit pointless 

If you read my last rant then you will remeber that I felt that everything is pointless , yeah I still feel like that , I still havenâ€™t found a solution to all this 
Aside from waiting , and see if time brings something 

Also you may remeber I felt overwhelmed , with school
And I blame totally on myself because I am a procrastinator
But also I feel like I am trying to do 2 things at once 
Iâ€™m trying to make myself happy , and to pass school
I donâ€™t know what to do because I have to balance it out 
When I try to to make myself happy I canâ€™t enjoy it because I am reminded of being guilty , and when I try to do school , I lose all my motivation and everything starts feeling pointless l 
You might think that just doing both at the same time would work , but that just mixes the two bad things together l and makes me overwhelmed 

I donâ€™t even know what should I do , I thought I was trying to make myself happy , but really I was trying both , o just wanna get a break from life 
I know that because on summer vacation is the only time where I can be happy , on the school year I just progressively go downhill with little bumps 
From my light social life . And just everything gets harder , and harder 
I just can do happily the one class I enjoy . The rest just feel horrible for  me
And I just donâ€™t even find the motivation to keep up with them 

Man I just want a break , a break from everything , a break from me 
Maybe I just need to take a break from me , to make me feel right again
