My love for school and the wonderful feelings it fills my heart with (/s). When I'm outside of school I usually feel confident, sociable and in tune with myself, but walking through the hallways of my school makes me unusually self-conscious.

I am 18M, I really like my aparance and personality, I know I've got a rich and interesting "inner world" (for lack of a better term), I'm well adjusted despite my terrible childhood and I know from experience that I can be very charming if I put in some effort.

I'm confident.
I've even gone through a youth militarily program and didn't come out messed up at the other side.
But for some reason being in school just makes me slowly die inside.

I feel so damn self conscious inside those god forsaken walls. 
I know that teenagers are for the most part horrible judgemental people (kinda /s) but I've hung out with shitty people before and felt right in my element. I can hang out or party with strangers with no anxiety. I've approached girls that catch my fancy without feeling very nervous. 

But walking around school is somehow very trying for me.

It might stem from how stifling school feels in general. I'm pretty introspective and intelligent, and I grew up without much outside influence from my peers. I'm my own person and proud of it, but it can be incredibly hard to relate to the people around me in school.


Idk where I was going with this really, guess I'll end it with apologizing for my slightly bad English. Not my first or even second language, and I can't be bothered to fix my mistakes rn.

Looking forward to graduating: Fredrik aka Dyrehagen
