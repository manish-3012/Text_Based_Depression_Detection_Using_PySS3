â€¢I am officially 16 nowâ€¢ Well good luck figuring out what you need with this information, i just wanna say reddit has been really helpfull and a great distraction from all the shit in my mind, oh boy i shouldve known how badly this year would effect my mental health... but who cares? I am going to ignore my birthday, but i lowkey hope someone will remember (what probably isnâ€™t the case...) covid is a good reason to have an excuse for not giving a sweet 16 party... i mean nobody wouldâ€™ve come anyway so now it wonâ€™t be awkward. I low key hope i find myself a girlfriend or actual real non toxic friends when I become 17 or something, it would really help me with my loneliness but i mean i can understand why i am hated tho... but yea if you told me a year ago how fucked this year would be I probably already killed myself... i just wish i get a lot happier and more social next year 

A â€œhappyâ€ birthday it wonâ€™t be, because Iâ€™ll be working and spend the rest of the time alone in my room, but thatâ€™s fine i guess... i am used to it

Oh and happy birthday to the other 2 people i saw on this sub who share birthdays. 

Ima gonna sleep now
