Why do I keep thinking these things I keep having these vivid images of me killing myself in my mind, or almost the hunger to feel the transition from ground to falling, or the gun in my hand, itâ€™s almost like imagining what something tastes like and being able to almost feel it in your mouth, and then craving it so strangely, Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll act on this.
But sometimes Iâ€™m not even sad when it happens. Iâ€™m just sitting there and one moment Iâ€™m fine, the next I feel like I NEED to feel myself die. I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s like really bad intrusive thoughts ig. Idk what itâ€™s from though. 

Anyone else feel this?
