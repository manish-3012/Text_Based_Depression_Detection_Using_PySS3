Even with getting help, and taking meds everything still sucks.

I'm going to be a teen dad, and I can't imagine what would happen if, I didn't go to the party. My life just sucks, and although i'm almost for sure going to be a dad I just don't see the point. The only real person I have is the soon to be mom, but she doesn't need a dump like me. Every day, I just want to jump off my bridge into a lake more and more. I hate living, I hate it. Every day my life sucks more, and more, and more. My parent's don't care, my therapist doesn't help, neither does Zoloft. I can't fucking take it. I just don't want to be here anymore I just want the suffering to end. It's time I put my own emotion's before other's. I'm thinking of doing it more and more every day.
