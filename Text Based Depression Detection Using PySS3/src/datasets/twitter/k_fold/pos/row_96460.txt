Looking for a weight loss buddy I guess Iâ€™m just looking for someone to hold me accountable. Iâ€™ve been â€œtryingâ€ to lose weight for like 2 months now, but itâ€™s hard because Iâ€™m so unmotivated. So yea, we can keep each other motivated and make sure we donâ€™t give in to our cravings, and stuff. It would have to be on discord tho, cause my reddit dms are shit.

15f btw, CDT timezone. My goal is to lose 10-12 pounds, and to change my eating habits for the better. Maybe learn a bit about discipline along the way.

Feel free to message me if youâ€™re interested. We can be honest with each other, chat, and see if we get along. If not no biggie, weâ€™ll both go our ways.

Hope I get replies. Iâ€™m going to sleep so if I do, I probably wonâ€™t answer until after I wake up when I have time. Night everyone.
