Please help I suck at relationship things Please help, my friend says that I need to change, else that everyone will dislike me and hate me.

I have no idea how to change; my friend says that I should spend more time on my close friends, less on those who doesn't want to care about me, and try to reach out to my semi close friends. Else, my close friends will think that I am cold, not caring, while others will think that I'm annoying as fuck.

Now I only have 2/3 close friends; I don't think if my semi close friends want to hang out with me; I like to talk to a lot people and help them.. idk, I just feel that it's hard for me to change. I know that everyone hates me and - I feel hopeless.

Please help everyone. And thank you if you've read this whole thing. Please help me to change I don't want to be a shitty person.
