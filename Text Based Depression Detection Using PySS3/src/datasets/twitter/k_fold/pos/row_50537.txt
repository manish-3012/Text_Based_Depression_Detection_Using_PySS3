Is there a way to approach or compliment a random person you see in public? So I want to try to tell people that they look nice (in a non-creepy way) or something, but I'm scared someone might misinterpret that and think that I'm gonna try to do something risky or that I'm a creep. I just want to try to make someones day if they need it, but i don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable.


And is there any method to casually approach someone to try being friends?
