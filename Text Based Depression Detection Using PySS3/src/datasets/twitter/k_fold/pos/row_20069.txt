So let me tell you about the story of my only relationship till this day Iâ€™m 18, and my love life has been pretty disastrous; long story short a long ass chain of rejections, mostly due to me being revolting at the time. Cut to late 2019, Iâ€™m an ICT assistant at my school and things are looking brighter for me, started focusing on my life more and girls less, then I started joking with a friend of mine (who I was teaching) about cannibal corpse, and this girl right next to him recognized the band. This might not seem like a lot, but my eyes were practically heart shaped at this point, so this was when we started talking and she told me sheâ€™d fell for me a long time ago. A bit later we dated, she revealed herself being pansexual and all, we dated and honestly Iâ€™ve never been happier, just 2 very compatible intimate kids being kids, we even started sharing hobbies and all. Anyway she turned exclusively lesbian 4 months later, and while knowing it wasnâ€™t in either of our hands and that I had to accept it, I was absolutely wrecked. We dated from 20/10/2019 to 4/3/2020 if that makes any difference. Things were stiff between us for about a month and a half but now weâ€™re talking like best buds again, and sheâ€™s great. We have no hard feelings but I am still emotionally scarred from that breakup, like goddamn the one time I date after a shattered sense of self-esteem she turns lesbian. And, despite wanting to move on and having feelings for someone else, I acknowledge Iâ€™m not ready for a new thing, and here I wait.


Moral of the story? Iâ€™m really fucking revolting.
