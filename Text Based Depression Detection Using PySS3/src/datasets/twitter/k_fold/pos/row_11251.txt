Way to add insult to my injuries, Imogen. So this story takes place around June-July last year. I was in year 8 and we were in the middle of lockdown in Victoria and it was depressing as fuck. One day when I leave my drama class call a girl from the class messages me. Her name was Imogen. For the next few hours, we talked and then continued to talk for the next few weeks. Over time we started playing games together. We had similar interests so it worked out great. I started developing feelings for Imogen as she was so kind and we were so similar.  
 Keep in mind that at this point in my high school life I had been rejected 4 times, so I was already sad from all my past rejections and hoped this one would work out. about 4-5 months later, Imogen messaged me, without context, asking what I would want in a relationship. When I said what I would want she got all excited and told me she fit all the boxes. At this point, I was happier than I had ever been. We were going to go back to school the next week so we arranged to meet each other. I finally thought my life was getting better.  
About 1 day before we went back though, she sent me a long message. As I read it I felt worse and worse. She told me that she lied about liking me back. She said that she only did it because her friends told her to do it and that she never liked me. This fucker kept up a facade for 5 months and played by feelings like a guitar. I then cut all contacts with her and we haven't spoken since. Girls, if you are reading this, be straight with people and don't lie like this bitch. Anyway, it's been like 8 months. I am still single and am yet to be in a relationship. I try to forget about this incident, but whenever a girl says anything nice to me, this thought comes back. I have moved on, but I will never forget how much of a dick she was.
