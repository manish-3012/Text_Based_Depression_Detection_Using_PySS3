I'm in a bit of a peculiar situation right now See, my crush, is also my best friend. I had her in my Chinese class 2 years ago, but didn't really start being friends with her until last year, when we both ended up in our High School's marching band. Back then she was still dating someone, but he broke up with her in February, ironically a week before Valentine's day. She's a great friend, always been there for me, and we share many common interests. Back before COVID we both knew we liked each other, but when I asked if we wanted to start dating she said not then, because of her recent breakup. Fast forward to now. I mainly see her during marching band practice, and after practice we'll spend the entire night texting each other. Some days too we'll get lunch together, after or before practice. I want to ask her out, but I got so many questions and ifs. Does she still like me? She's so busy when can I get some private time with her to ask? Should I even date her? With COVID around I don't know if I'll be able to see her as much, and even worse, when we split up, I'll lose her as a friend forever. There are so many other questions as well, I just don't know what to do except stay course and just keep doing what I've been doing with her. I don't know, I guess I need a bit of a place to rant. Thanks for coming to my ted talk or whatever.
