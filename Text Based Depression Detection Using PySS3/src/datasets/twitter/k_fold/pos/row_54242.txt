I accidentally popped a ballon in my room last night at like 1:30 in the morning. So Iâ€™ve been in the process of going through all my stuff and cleaning my room up, and Iâ€™ve been finding a bunch of stuff Iâ€™ve forgotten about. Last night at like 1:20 I found an old balloon from my Eagle ceremony from like 2 years ago, and thought â€œIf I donâ€™t blow it up now, I never willâ€. So of course I decided to blow it up, and bounce it around a little cause what else was I going to do with it. Then I bat it into the ceiling a few times, and then it happened. It hit a part of my ceiling  with small paint spikes and made the loudest explosion Iâ€™ve ever heard. 

Somehow, by some miracle, no one woke up from it, but I felt so tense for the next 20 minutes. If thereâ€™s a lesson to be learned, itâ€™s donâ€™t be an idiot at 1:30 in the morning.
