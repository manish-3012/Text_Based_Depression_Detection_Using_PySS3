Am I depressed or whatâ€™s up with me? Hi teenagers,
Iâ€˜m feeling kinda unmotivated and sad lately. Iâ€˜m not lonely, but I feel like I am. 
There is like one thing Iâ€˜m aware of that could cause that all: Iâ€˜m overthinking conversations with some people and then think Iâ€˜m doing everything wrong. 
Whatâ€™s going on? Have you experienced something similar?
