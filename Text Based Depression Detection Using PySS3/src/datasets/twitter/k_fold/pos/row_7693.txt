I know she meant this well but... This girl I hang out with who Iâ€™m close to was talking to me the other day. I said that I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m an everything or a boy and she said â€œYouâ€™re a girlâ€. I know she meant this well but it didnâ€™t seem very good I think I should say. Also this other girl (my homophobic friend) and the previous girl I was talking to were proving to her why it isnâ€™t a choice and why she is inherently wrong. She was really trying and said â€œIâ€™m straight and I donâ€™t care about your sexuality!â€  I know she meant it well and she also said panhandle instead of pan sexual so ðŸ˜•. Anyways have a good day!
