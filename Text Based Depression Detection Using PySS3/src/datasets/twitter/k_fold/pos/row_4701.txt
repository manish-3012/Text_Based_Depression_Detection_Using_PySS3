My Biology teacher is awful So basically, my biology teacher is the worst imo for this reason:

The work she hands out is REDICULUS!
She assigns 3 assignments that are due at 1:20 and her class ends at 1:15, and she doesn't want us doing it during the zoom, she wants it done ON TIME, and half the time I never get it done because the time limit.

She wants us to learn, but making us do 3 assignments, WHILE RESEARCHING THE TOPICS, IN 5 MINUTES IS NOT GONNA TEACH US ANYTHING.


Sorry I had to rant about this...
