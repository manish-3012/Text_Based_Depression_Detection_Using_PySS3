Anyone have friends a little too political? My group of friends saw an article on how some dude installed an electric fence and kids got shocked by it when they were trespassing. My take was, well, if he'd tried getting kids off his lawn before and they don't listen, then yeah you can take measures to keep them from trespassing. My very PC friend was pretty offended by that and called me a "capitalist anarchist." It kinda put me on the defensive, and it made me look like an asshole for wanting kids to get "electrocuted." We later read the article and the guy was just an asshole (put the fence by a bus stop without warning), but still rubbed me the wrong way that I was associated with a pretty extreme and dare I say crazy political group over something like this.
