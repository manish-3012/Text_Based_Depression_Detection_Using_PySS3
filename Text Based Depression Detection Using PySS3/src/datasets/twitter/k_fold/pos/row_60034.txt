Guys how weird does this sound? Thereâ€™s this stigma that for some reason, people who are a couple and blonde are incest?

Well as someone whoâ€™s blonde, I find it weird but others believe it?

Anyway Iâ€™m blonde, my crush is blonde and my mum is blonde

Iâ€™m wandering, will people think itâ€™s weird that my possible girlfriend has the same hair colour as my mum? I donâ€™t believe this but Iâ€™ve heard many do
