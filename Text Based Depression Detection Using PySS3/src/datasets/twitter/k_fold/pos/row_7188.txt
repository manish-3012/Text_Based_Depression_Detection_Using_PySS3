13 and all my friends have reached puberty. Not me So i turned 13 recently and all of my friends have begun the process. Idk why but they bug me about it and now i WANT to start it, unlike some. Sometimes i cry at night when i think about it, i shouldnt, but i do. Im also avarage height but my friends are taller than me and annoy me about it, theyve said sorry but i still think about it. Ive searched methods to grow faster and all that. But all say its mostly genetics. So what can i do to soothe the pain away from being different, i sound like an 8 year old and dickheads online treat me like garbage. I know people online are idiots and that i shouldnt listen to them but its in the back of my mind all the time when i wanna use vc.

Please god help me
