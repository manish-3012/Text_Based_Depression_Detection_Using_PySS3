So I noticed something while scrolling today Most teens on this sub (at least, the majoritywho post): I have a shit family, but at least I have good friends.

Me (and anyone else who relates): I have too many dramatic people in my life who think I'm their disposable therapy napkin, but at least I have my family and 4 good friends.

And then we all supported each other anyway.

The end
