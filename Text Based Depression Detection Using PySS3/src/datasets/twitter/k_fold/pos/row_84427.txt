Im just gunna post this reminder cuz a lot of people still are kinda confused about this Nonbinary isnt an absence of gender or a lack of gender. What your thinking of is Agender which is a nonbinary gender but not what nonbinary means.

Nonbinary means your not on the gender binary. It means your not exclusively a man, and your not exclusively a woman. Its a WIDE spectrum and an umbrella term for any gender that isnt male or female.

Bigender, and genderfluid are both under the nonbinary umbrella even if theyre male and female bigender, or fluxuates between male and female because theyre still not on the gender binary.

Hopefully that clears things up.
