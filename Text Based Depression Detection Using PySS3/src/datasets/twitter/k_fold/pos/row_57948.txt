I wanna go back I remember the day that my stepfather had his aneurysm. He didn't die, but he lost most of his memory. We had to put up sticky notes to remind him of basic knowledge. He didn't fully remember me for a solid month after I saw him again.

I wanna go back.

I remember the day that covid was announced in my state. The day the mask mandate was proclaimed. I had to wear a mask in public, no big deal. My grandmother got sick soon after, and there was a good three days that I thought I would lose my grandmother.

I wanna go back.

I remember the day my last remaining irl friend logged off for the last time. I remember looking through my friends list to find that they had unfriended me. No biggie, thought I, I can last a few weeks without friends. It's been 11 months since I've talked to someone in person.

I wanna go back.

Someone take me back. I wanna go back.
