How can I stop myself from trusting people on here too easily and getting creeped on? When I get drunk Iâ€™m super open to online conversations. Iâ€™ve sent pics of my face to a couple people here thinking they were friendly and then they all tried to get me to send nudes or freaking fly out to take me on a date.
