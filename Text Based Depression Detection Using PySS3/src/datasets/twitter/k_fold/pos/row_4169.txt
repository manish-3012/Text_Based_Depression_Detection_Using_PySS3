I'm tired of the simp thing like you can't ask how someone's doing underneath a post of a girl without getting called a simp. 

that y'all can't have a normal conversation with a girl doesn't have to say that the ones that can have a conversation are simps.

so please stop calling people a simp for nothing, I'm tired of y'all, please just grow the fck up.
