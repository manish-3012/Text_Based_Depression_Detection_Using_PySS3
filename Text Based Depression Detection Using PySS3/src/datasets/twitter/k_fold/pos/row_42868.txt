Hey little kids, this is just for the adults 18+ okay? You can scroll past Okay now that the kids are gone, I need you to register to vote and actually go vote. I don't care if it's in person or by mail. This is a crucial election my guy! I don't care who you vote for either. Love Trump? Vote! Love Biden? Vote! Don't like either one and want to go with a 3rd party? Please vote!! A vote never goes wasted I can guarantee it. It's your constitutional right to vote at 18. Please please vote!
