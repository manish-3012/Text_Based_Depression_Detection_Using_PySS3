Being single is funðŸ˜Ž My relationship wasnâ€™t particularly awful, but other than the random panic attacks I had right after breaking up with him, I honestly feel pretty rad.

Like I only talk to two people now, and itâ€™s honestly great. I feel like I can focus on the aspects of my life that arenâ€™t social, you know?

Also this relationship lasted for over a year so changing all of my passwords do not have my exâ€™s name in them has been a bitchðŸ˜‚.
