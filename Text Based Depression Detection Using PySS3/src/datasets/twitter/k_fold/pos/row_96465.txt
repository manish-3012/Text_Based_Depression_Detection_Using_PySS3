Sucidal be sucide prevented by internet points So I made a promise with myself that if I dont get 1k+ k*rma in the next week I will literally kill myself. I already thought of killing myself multiple times but I thought it would be more fun to decide my fate with k*rma. So if I get 1k upv*tes on this p*st that definitely doesn't deserve 1k upv*tes then I survive. And if not then I'll kill myself. It's like a game that decides my life.

Also I'm not joking lol. I'm genuinely going to kill myself. I have a rope ready every day and I am probably going to kill myself either way. Life's been absolute shit and everyone in it including myself have also been shit. There's nothing worth it in this world now. At least for me. So wether you guys decide to delay my sucide is up to you. I'm expecting this to get no attention anyway. 

And this is going to be like a sucide note to my family since I didn't say this to anyone. Fun times!!!

ALSO MODS I KNOW YOUR GOING TO REMOVE THIS BUT HOW  HOW ABOUT JUST GIVE THIS POST A CHANCE...
