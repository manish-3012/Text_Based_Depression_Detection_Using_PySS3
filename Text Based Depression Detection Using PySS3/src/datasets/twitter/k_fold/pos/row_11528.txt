My idea of equality True gender equality is the nonchalance towards, not the celebration of gender.

Who the fuck cares if you have a penis or a vagina down there?

Honestly I don't really like all those "girl power" marketing strategies that big corporations are pushing, and the ideology of incels that belive that men are superior to women.

They all have their strengths and weaknesses. For example, men are better than women at strength, but women has better endurance than men(such as pain tolerance, etc)

If you're being annoying and illogical, you're an asshole. If you raped someone, you're a rapist and there's no exceptions. If you want to cry, go cry, and if you're in public, learn to control your emotions. Wear whatever you want to wear, we don't care unless you smell like you haven't showered for 5 days.
