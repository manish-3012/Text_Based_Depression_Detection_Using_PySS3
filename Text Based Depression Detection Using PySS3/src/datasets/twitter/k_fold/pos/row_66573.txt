I fucking hate nord Pieces of shit said the Auto-renewel was off in the app so I wouldn't be charged then I wake up and I have 5 dollars left in my bank account. Trying to get this shit sorted out every which way I can, contacting them today and also just sent a ticket to google because I didn't want the fucking year long shit. Fucking scumbags, if those 2 don't work then I'm contacting my bank directly to try and get my money back, if that doesn't work anyone want to send me money and I'll give you my nord account the year.
