Is it ok that I like a girl more because she developed a motor tic disorder? I was going to do this on a throwaway account but I couldnâ€™t get enough karma fast enough so fuck it.

So there is this girl that Iâ€™ve sort of liked for some time now, and after being away for two weeks, she finally came back with news that she had developed a motor tic disorder. It involves uncontrolled spasms, and happens more when stressed (similar to tourettes but without any verbal impacts). 

Even though itâ€™s something terrible, I sort of find it cute and that Iâ€™d really want to care for her. Is it acceptable that I like her more because of this?
