My moms reaction on me being bi is scaring me So this just happened in a time span of 20 mins. I had this in my bio on whatsapp "may be biðŸ™‚ðŸ¤—" she just messaged me asking if im serious and that i should take it out of my bio. I know that is not the best way to announce im bi but her reaction is scaring me, no support  nothing. I asked her if that's a problem and she doged my question ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. Im so scared
