Villain speech time Suffer itâ€™s amazingness

&amp;#x200B;

â€So you made it to me. You draw swords, you prepare spells, you sharpen axes. You claim to by my rivals, my anathema, my enemy. But you couldnâ€™t be here without me! You claim to hate me but you are my biggest advocates in the realms! Every time you fireball out of a room, every time you eldritch blast a cultist of mine, every time you blood curse, Iâ€™m there. That sick lasting feeling is my lifeblood. I am death and you wreak havoc in my name every day, claiming to use it to destroy me. Every last one of you will face me in this plane and will suffer a painful death, because you could not see your own blind hypocrisy. And now your time has come.â€
