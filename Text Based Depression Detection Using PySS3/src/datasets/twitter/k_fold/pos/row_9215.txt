Me and my friend decided to do a valentine's prank It was a day before valentine's day, me and my friend decided to prank two girls by asking them to be our valentine's and than immediately sent a legendary photo 'sike you thought one'. We thought it would be fun.
So it was valentine's day I sent mine as planned, to which the girl understood that it was a joke and there is where it stopped (for me) but for my friend it didn't go as planned. He sent the message as planned but first he got rejected or something. But like 6 hours later he got a message that she has gf and is bisexual. 
My friend being stupid as heck thought he made her bisexual and started panicking like crap. And after an hour he finally calmed down and said ' I lost a lot of braincells today'
