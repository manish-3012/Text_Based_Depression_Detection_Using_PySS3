Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 17: Aristotle Aristotle was a great philosopher of ancient Greece. Science in his time was less than perfect, but he takes it to a whole new level.

Aristotle actually said that women were not humans. He just thought that they were "deformed men" because they have less teeth, thus, they are incomplete.

They don't, by the way.

He also said that women contribute nothing to their children and the father contributes everything. Never mind the whole "childbirth" part.
