Some tips for High School and/or College I have learned over the past year During my first year in HS, I learned a few things that will help.

1) Take your notes in a spiral notebook instead of loose leaf paper

This is especially helpful for classes where you take lots of notes, for example, AP classes. What you do is, take your notes in the notebook, then when you get home/free time, you can put the note pages in your binder. This helps even if you forget to put them in your binder, because they stay in the notebook, and don't fall out like loose leaf paper. My dad suggested I do this at the beginning of the year, as he had learned it during college, and it really works well.

2) Don't neglect your textbooks

This is mainly for math/science classes, but may be used for others. Many times, if you don't understand the topic, the only thing is to ask the teacher, but what you forget is that you have a textbook for that class. Textbooks give explanations and examples, which can help a lot to understand the material. I made this mistake last year, and i didn't read my math textbook when I didn't understand the topics, and I ended the year with a B average. Don't make this mistake.

3) Joining a school sport can make you happier and more confident

When I started swimming for my school, I started feeling better and more confident. You don't have to join a big sport like soccer or football. If you don't have friends, it can even help you make friends, while feeling better about yourself.

I hope these things helped you, just as they helped me, and i wish you all the best.
