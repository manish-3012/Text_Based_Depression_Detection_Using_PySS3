What is a friend supposed to be?? IM SO CONFUSED!!! Ok so I consider a friend to be someone youâ€™d trust your life with. Someone you talk to everyday and love deeply. A person I simply â€œlikeâ€ and talk to occasionally and have an affection for is more of a pal. This tends to lead to confusion when I say I have two friends. Iâ€™m not lonely, I just consider friendship to be introspective and involved, and I think I may be wrong. What on earth is a friend to you guys?
