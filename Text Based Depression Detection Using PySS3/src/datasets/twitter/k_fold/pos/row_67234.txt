Kung Fu Panda is very underrated When people talk about good animation films the same always come up, shrek, toy story... But I do think Kung Fu Panda is the best one.

The musical theme is great (not the everybody was kung fu fighting song). 

The themes of the movies are also very good. Finding yourself, family, and fate. In the first film the villain escapes because they send a messenger fearing that he is going to escape. In the second the villain makes his own fate truth by attacking the pandas.

It also has some nice fighting and training scenes. 

Po is a great character and you can always understand why he does what he does.

With that said the 3rd film is worse than the other 2 and is childish
