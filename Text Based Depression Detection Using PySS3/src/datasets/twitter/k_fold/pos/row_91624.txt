If you were to start a smoke and skate shop what would you call it? Thereâ€™s this hella cool place near me that has a bunch of cool shit but they are horrible at marketing and the layout of their store is trash they have skate stuff but itâ€™s kinda just in a pile in the back corner of the store and so is their pipes and shit but then they have like toys and hoodies in the front of the store just piled on tables and I feel like itâ€™s such a good idea but they donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing
