God I feel worthless You ever just feel like you donâ€™t matter to anyone, that if you were to just disappear one day no one would really care. Like theyâ€™d be â€œoh no heâ€™s goneâ€ and then just forget about you a few days later. I feel unwanted, and I wonder sometimes how it got to this point or if Iâ€™ll ever be able to move past this. Losing your first college year to covid doesnâ€™t help, being in engineering were people only look at the job prospects. Like man I want my life to amount to something but at the rate Iâ€™m going at nothings going to happen.
