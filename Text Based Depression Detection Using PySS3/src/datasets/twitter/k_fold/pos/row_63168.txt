Ayo, should I just leave? Aight, I used to have a crush on this dude at my bio classes, he quite talkative, sweet and funny and we have  a lot of things in common,  so when he asked me out, I was excited because I get to go on my first date with someone I really like buuuut... when I actually got to know him...jesus he's not what I expected at ALL. 


He brags about anything, literally anything, I don't mind bragging but who brags about cheating on someone...he makes a lot of lewd jokes and I'm into dark humor but jesus christ the things he said...


But he took me to this ice cream shop thingy (I'm so introverted so i digress) then to a skating rink and it was fun, he kinda made me feel safe because I was kinda knew how to skate...but honestly I feel like he isn't the right person for me...
