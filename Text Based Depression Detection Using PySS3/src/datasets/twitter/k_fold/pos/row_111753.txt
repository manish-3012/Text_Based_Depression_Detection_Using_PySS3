Ok so I had a phase of really wanting to live in america so badly and then I realized how shit it is there buttt I think the phase is coming back. like I live in England rn but america just seems very different like you guys have all these cool places to go and like it's really big also schools seem more fun (apart from shootings lol )cuz no uniform and of course most important yall have hotter guys. although I'd rather be shanked than shot so that's one good thing about living in England.
