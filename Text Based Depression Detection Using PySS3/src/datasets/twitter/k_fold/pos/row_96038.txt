Cunning Sun Remember when u/cowboi14 beat the sun in a staring contest?

Well it turns out it underestimated him, but ultimately learnt from the loss. 

I stared at the sun for 30 seconds, but then another sun appeared, I couldn't belive my eyes so I blinked and looked again but only to see only one sun!!  It tricked me!!
