I wanna feel loved or something I always feel like im a pain in the back for everyone, just someone they rather dont talk to... just an useless piece of shit

The only one that probably loves me is my mom but she doesnt show it that often and thats it. I never feel really part of the group or something and i never had a girlfriend or a girl saying she loves me 

I know yâ€™all dont care but at least i can rant somewhere
