A funny story because my life is so interesting and you care so much So the other day in history my teacher asked what the most valuable resource from Samoa was

My immediate thought was coconuts because Samoa is tropical but I'm shy so of course I don't raise my hand. But him being the jerk he is calls on me anyways and before I have the time to answer he says "just don't say something stupid like coconuts"

I swear he can read minds

Also the answer was freaking NFL football players cause apparently a lot of them are Samoans like what the heck man
