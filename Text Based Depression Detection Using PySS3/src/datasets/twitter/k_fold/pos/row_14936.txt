My convoluted friendship So I've been friends with this person for almost 3 year now, and we are super close even though we live quite far from each other. But within being my best friend they are also my first love. However unlike most of those friendships they've known sense like a month into our friendship that I like them, and over time I gradually fell in love with they, this they know too. And over time we got closer as friends and almost started dating once, but then they realized that they where just hurting and wanted affection so they turned me down, and that was like the fifth time at that point. But still our friendship is going strong with us both loving each other, them loving me as a friend and me loving them as a potential romantic partner. And the thing is we are crystal clear on where the other one stands, and want the best for each other, so it hurts us both to see each other hurt because of the way we each feel. And it's just a cluster of crap that we can't get over, but neither of us mind that much.
