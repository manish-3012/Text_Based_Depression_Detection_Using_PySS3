How many times have you been asked to give instructions on how to make peanut butter and jelly? This feels like the silliest thing to rant about, but this seemingly pointless activity (at least after the first time) keeps being assigned to me. Iâ€™ve done it twice in middle school, probably at least once in elementary school, and Iâ€™m now onto the second time doing it in high school. Iâ€™m getting pretty tired of it. Iâ€™d find it hard to believe if any of you havenâ€™t done this yet, what are your thoughts?
