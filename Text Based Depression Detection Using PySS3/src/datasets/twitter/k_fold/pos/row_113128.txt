I need some advice on how I can be friends with this girl &amp; get to know her more/be with her alone. Iâ€™m a teen guy &amp; I really like this girl that was in my previous class (but I didnâ€™t talk to her that much at the time).
I have meet her in a group like 3 times with another guy &amp; sometimes a third guy this summer. 

I really like her although I hate being in groups. She seem like a intresting person and I would like to meet her more/be friends with her. How can I get to know her more? I could obviously ask her if she wanted to hang out but I did that with another girl one time alone &amp; it didnâ€™t go that well so my confidence is low around that.

It would be a good thing to hang out/meet in a group but itâ€™s not that fun when Iâ€™m close friends w the guys I meet that girl with.

I have her on snapchat &amp; we send each other funny snaps &amp; talk sometimes...
What can I do? Would love some advice. :)
