See Idk why my older cousin is doing this I have 2 cousins and they are like brothers to me. One of them turned 18 this year and the other one 19. The 18 year old just starts being VERY nice. Like this dude just matured. I washed his car right n he said if i wash it again he would either take me to get 2 games or go to tj maxx. He even gave me 2 pairs of vans and some clothes. It's uncomfortable. Not in a bad way. See our bound has always been rough we play wrestle and insult each other but holy shit I just wanna go back to like 2014.
