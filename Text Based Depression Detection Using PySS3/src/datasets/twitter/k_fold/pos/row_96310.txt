hello i wrote a little song any feedback?&lt;3 ive been tearing up my legs in the shower.
bruising up my skin in the park.
ive been tearing up my mindset in the mirror.
because they broke me apart.
and if its true heaven is a place on earth, im almost there.
just one more incision till i lose my mind.
then will it be fair?
