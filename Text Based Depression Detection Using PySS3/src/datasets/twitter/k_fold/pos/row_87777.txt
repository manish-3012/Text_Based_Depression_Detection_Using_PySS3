I'm very preoccupied about the new school year and don't know how to stop being scared about it In less than a few weeks I'm gonna start my first year of high school (dunno if that is , and I'm really scared, I don't know what to expect, I dunno if it's gonna be hard, and I don't know if I'm gonna be bullied or make any friends, and this feeling just kicked in like yesterday the 1st of September, I felt like summer just flew by so fast and I dunno what to do to I'm really anxious. Is there any way to get over this fear?
