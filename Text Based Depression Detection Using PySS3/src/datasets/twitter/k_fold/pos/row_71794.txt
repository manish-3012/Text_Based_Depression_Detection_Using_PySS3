I'm watching Big Mouth right now and I ha e a question for you girls So when a guy does something wrong and you're mad at them, what do you want us to do? Should we talk about it? Should we give you space? It seems like a dumb question, and the answer is probably different for every girl, but I want to better myself and my interactions with my peers in general, so lmk lol
