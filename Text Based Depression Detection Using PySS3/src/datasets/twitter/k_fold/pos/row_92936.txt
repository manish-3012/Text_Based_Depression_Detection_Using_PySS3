I only get good grades to look good in front of others. I was at the top of my class. I didnâ€™t have to be but I made the effort because I wanted to look good in front of my peers. Learning does come easily to me, but I hate all forms of work, especially homework. The only reason I did it diligently was so I could seem like a reliable friend, I could help them if they donâ€™t understand, I could exchange answers with other lazy smart people. I wouldnâ€™t have to suffer the embarrassment of being the last to finish assignments and not be able to spend more free time with my friends who finished early. If I finished late I would be out of the loop of what they were talking about.

Virtual learning destroyed all of that. All my friends arenâ€™t in my classes and making new friends is hard. The only person who sees me failing is the teacher, and any confrontation they make is nullified by the screen. There is no one the acknowledge the work I do. I lose all motivation to do any work.

My grades are dropping and I know that. But I feel no consequence of that, nor any urgency. This isnâ€™t good though and I know it. But getting good grades donâ€™t make me happy like it used to, not without someone to share it to. I donâ€™t see any point in learning these subjects.
