I hate "inspirational quotes" that glorify selfishness You've probably seen one of those, saying something like "cutting contact with someone who isn't good for you anymore is improvement" or some stupid shit like that. Doing something for someone that wouldn't do the same for you isn't foolish, it's saint-like behavior. It doesn't matter if the person will pay you back, because at the end of the day, you're the good person. You shouldn't be disappointed after putting others before you, because it's what makes an individual valuable. The meaning of life is to help your own kind, make life a bit more enjoyable for everyone while you're at it. It doesn't matter if people aren't respectful or thankful afterwards, because you did the right thing. 

During class, ethics to be exact, our teacher showed us the Heinz dilemma (look it up) and I was surprised at how many of my peers would rather do the blatantly selfish option. I could've argued for hours, trying to explain to them that saving someone's life is infinitely more valuable than avoiding going to prison for theft. It's not about being respectful, it's about making life better.

To me, personal gain is less valuable than giving to others.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
