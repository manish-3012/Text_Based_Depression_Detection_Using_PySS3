CaNcElLiNg eMiNeM Okay bitches, I don't even care what sort of reaction this post receives, but here we fucking go

Fully aware that Redditors are least likely to agree with stupid things from Tiktok, but IF ANY OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS WHO ARE TRYNA CANCEL EMINEM READ THIS, YOU NEED A REALITY CHECK

The reason he's being "cancelled" is for the line in Love the Way You Lie where he says "if she ever tries to fucking leave again, imma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire"

If you DIDN'T FUCKING NOTICE, the song depicts an abusive relationship from the dude's perspective. The line fits pretty fucking perfectly in context

This shit is tame compared to his earlier stuff. Go listen to "Kill You" from the Marshall Mathers LP. Go listen to "Kim" from the same album. "My Mom" from Relapse has some shit that would blow your pussy little mind out of the fucking water

Aww, you didn't like what the rapper said 11 years ago? Eat a dick. If this is the first time you're hearing this song, you're too fucking young to be complaining about it, because this song was EVERYWHERE

No, it's not advocating or supporting domestic abuse. Literally the opposite. Jesus

How about we cancel Cardi B for writing GRAPHIC songs about deepthroating guys? Fuck outta here. If you don't like it, don't listen to it. Jesus fucking christ
