I feel nostalgic Every since I was 3 I've watched the movie "cars" a lot. Like everyday. I never got bored of it and then I watched the sequel and I had mission impossible vibes and it was great. When cars 3 came out I didn't really care. Yesterday I watched it on Disney Plus just for the hell of it. It felt good.
