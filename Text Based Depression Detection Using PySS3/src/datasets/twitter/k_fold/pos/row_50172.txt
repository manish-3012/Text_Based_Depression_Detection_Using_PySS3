I have a question for the sleep deprived gang! How the heck do you run off of 6 hours or less of sleep? Today I am running off of 6 and a half and I barely got through a workout. I had to use pre workout just to get through it. I hear people all the time at my school saying â€œ lol I pulled 2 all nighters in a rowâ€ Iâ€™m sitting over hear like HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD? And even more puzzling is how in the absolute fuck do you play entire football games only sleeping for 4 hours?!?! usually go off of 9 hours I still feel tired. Do you just get used to it? Are you even human? I want to know because it honestly itâ€™s intriguing to me how you survive on a day to day basis.
