Are you feeling down? Don't worry I'm there with you, even if people around you, your family doesn't support you ik you can do it. Some goals might be very hard to achieve but when you realise their worth and value you can overcome any constable.
Stay determined, don't give a fuck to anyone who give you negativity, if you think you can do it then you can do it!

Things get better even if it seems they never will, but you have to stay determined. It's okay feeling low, and you should look what saddens you. Just go on and you'll reach there. You may haven't reached your destination but believe me no matter how many fails there were, if you are a good traveller you'll get what you deserve.
