I didnâ€™t know where else I could post this Hi, Iâ€™ve been wanting to start a text to speech meme channel on YouTube for a long time. Only one thing, I donâ€™t know how to put everything together. I know how to get memes, get the David uk voice (for tts) but I donâ€™t know how to put it together. If anyone could help, pm me
