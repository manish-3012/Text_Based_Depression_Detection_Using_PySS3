It doesn't matter what year it is y'all are still gonna complain 2020 is probably the only actual exception to this but seriously every goddamn year all I hear is "OMG THIS YEAR IS SOO BAD CANT WAIT TILL ITS OVER". fr you only think that because the media only reports bad shit. Like I said 2020 is actually shit for just about anyone and I know personal experiences can change a year from person to person. But just watch, 2021 people are still gonna be complaining for some bullshit reason, it happened in every year preceeding this one. I only really noticed it in 2016, remember when that was "the worst year ever"? That shit had nothing on 1918 when 2% of the world population died from another virus. I've noticed that same mentality from 2016 has stayed the same. Imagine this year without covid, people will still say its the worst year ever because kobe died (no disrespect to him), California is on fire for the 5th year in a row, and trump threatened a nuclear capable country that hates the U.S. again.
