My one wish for my 18th birthday today is to be banned from Applebees and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m going to do Iâ€™ve never been to an Applebees before and one experience is all I need. The plan is for 3 of my buddies and I to go Applebees for the first time, have one meal, and upon paying the bill ask the waiter if he/she can fulfill my 18th birthday wish of being banned from the restaurant chain for good. Expect the whole story later tonight when we are done.
