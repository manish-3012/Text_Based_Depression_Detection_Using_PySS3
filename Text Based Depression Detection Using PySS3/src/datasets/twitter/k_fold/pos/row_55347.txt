No Nut November (NNN) - Day 1 Journal It's the end of the day, and I'm gonna write about how well I'm doing so far In No Nut November (NNN). I almost failed on day 1, I forgot it was November and at 01:30 I was about to jerk off but I wasn't in the mood. The next day after going back to sleep I remember it was NNN. Now that I know it's NNN, I might be able to make it. So far so good I'd say.
