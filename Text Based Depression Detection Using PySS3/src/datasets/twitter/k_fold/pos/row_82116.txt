i feel like I'm too dumb for my girlfriend to like me i don't read books and my grades are meh, I'm not studying often, I'm also not interested in sports really. while she does a of these things, has good grades AND her English is so good that she wants to go to us as exchange student (we're not native speakers). guys I'm literally a worse version of her, how do I force myself to read books or study hard? as much as I love her a lot I'd like to not think to myself "jeez I'm worse than her in literally everything"
