I'm so tired of getting told I look angry all the timeðŸ§ Since I was in like 3rd grade I've been told that I have or look like I have anger issues. I'm a sophomore now. I know for a fact that I don't have anger issues and I just get upset like everyone else the "normal" amount. I can't really help how my face scrunches up if I'm not paying attention. People call it a resting bitch face but I genuinely don't see it. Just because I don't smile a lot doesn't mean I have anger issues. What type of logic is that anyway? It's one of the many things that has lead me to hate the way I look and it's so frustrating ðŸ¤
