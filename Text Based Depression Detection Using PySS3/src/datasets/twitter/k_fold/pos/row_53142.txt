My life is the worst Why does my life suck so much

My life has been a train wreck,

I been depressed since I was 10, suicidal when I was 13, and 14 I started to get better and I almost was happy until my dad died at 15 and it reset me.

Of course I picked a great fucking time to decide to stop cutting myself so now I am just sitting here crying, wanting to do it but forcing myself not to because I know if I do I will go to far.

Sometimes I wonder if going to far is what I need, maybe itâ€™s what other people want me to do, I wouldnâ€™t be surprised.

Please can I talk to someone before I do something stupid.
