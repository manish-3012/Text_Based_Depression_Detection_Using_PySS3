Just cried for the first time in a while So my district uses a grading app called â€œSkywardâ€. Most of my teachers donâ€™t update the grades there and when they donâ€™t update the grades it says that the assignments are missing therefore lowering my grade in said class. This leads to me â€œhavingâ€ 25 missing assignments. My mom has always been on my back about my grades so when she saw this she flipped out. My parents are divorced and I go to my dads house every other week so sometimes itâ€™s hard to get work done like this and it puts a lot of pressure on me (this will be important later on). So I explained to my mom how my teachers havenâ€™t updated the grades and she tells me to email my teachers which I have multiple times before and it hasnâ€™t worked so I told her that. And I said something that mightâ€™ve been a bit disrespectful which was â€œIâ€™ve already tried emailing them itâ€™s so hard with you on my back it puts a lot of pressure on meâ€. And get this she says â€œfirst off Iâ€™m not on your back so donâ€™t talk to me like that and second we all have to deal with pressureâ€. Wtf Iâ€™m 14 years old and you care more about my grades then my well being I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m depressed but I donâ€™t really feel happy as often as I should and I have bad thoughts. And my mom was scared that I was depressed a year and when I told her I wasnâ€™t she just shrugged it off. And then the pressure got to me and I started crying!

I donâ€™t ask for anything in return I kinda just wanted a place to vent thanks for reading the whole thing though!
