I think Iâ€™m having somewhat of a personality switch Like, I used to be unable to manage criticism, I used to be so insecure, I always needed someone to encourage me. Lately Iâ€™ve been getting farther and farther from my comfort zone and Iâ€™m starting to feel more and more confident, and now criticism just fuels me to do and be better. I guess thatâ€™s great for me tho
