My Eyes Once Bled I bled out of my eyes once. It stung. The pain I felt that day was excruciating and crying hurt more. Nobody was going to help me. Nobody else was there. After a little while, the pain turned to an intense tingling sensation. Not necessarily pleasant but it was better. Nobody believes me. Nobody thinks you are capable of being the monster you truly are. All over my body there was written proof but you made sure I was covered up. I just wanted you to love me. I wanted to make you proud. I tried to. You were done with me and I just slept. I had no more tears. I had no more energy. I had no more life.
