i feel like im faking it idk im 15 and while my body is alive, i just feel dead. i feel im just going through the motions to survive. im just so alone and don't see my life going anywhere. but i can't help but feel like im doing it for attention, even though the only time i talk about it is on reddit. i have never talked to anyone irl about it. im not officially diagnosed with depression so i dont say i have it, but i really feel like i do. as soon as i turn 18 im getting a test done. 

even making this post feels like attention seeking
