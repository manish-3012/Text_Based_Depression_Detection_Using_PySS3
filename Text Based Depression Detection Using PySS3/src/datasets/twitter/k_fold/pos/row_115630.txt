Dear Eduardo Minudo Coralez the III and Savannah Milsburry: FUCK YOU On the 21st of September, 2009, you two stole my pencil. I wouldn't have been mad if it weren't for the fact that it was the one WITH THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on it. I was left to write from the ink of my own blood and subsequently got expelled because of it. Smdh. (I hope nobody actually has those names lmaoo)
