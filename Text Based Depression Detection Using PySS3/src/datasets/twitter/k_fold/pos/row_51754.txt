Im feeling just about ten emotions right now I'm happy but I'm so sad and I'm hyper but I want to go to sleep and just about every other combination of emotions. I could talk to this girl that I pretty much met on new years ( she and I had met before but just started talking on new years and I've talked to her about twice since ) or I could just force myself asleep. What should I do?
