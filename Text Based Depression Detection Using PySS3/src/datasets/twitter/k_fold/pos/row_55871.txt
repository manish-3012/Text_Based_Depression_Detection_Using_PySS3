So much is going through my mind right now... The East Troublesome Fire is burning a nearby town, Grand Lake. Iâ€™ve gone there every year for 4th of July. Now itâ€™s all going to be gone. The fishing spots, the historical sites, the hiking, I am so conflicted inside, watching the news as people show footage of the fire burning down a home and saw one of the largest smoke plumes Iâ€™ve ever seen, looking like the Mt. Saint Hellens eruption. What the hell am I feeling, what is happening, is this a dream...
