Anyone else ever been in the middle of like a calculus or a linear algebra problem set and just been working on it for about 45 minutes and you realize A really desperately need to know how many miles of  railway tracks Run the length and breath of Afghanistan so you have to research that for about half an hour just to find out and answer that question and not because you want to avoid problem 7 On that particular problem set because  You have no  Freaking idea had a solve it and the app you usually use to give you some idea if you're completely stuck said error 1497 which means it's unable to compute.

And you haven't swallowed your pride enough to go ask your friend Maddox is the math wizard.
 So instead you learn about the public transit system and railway shipping network of world Afghanistan and find out how many pounds of dynamite they had to use to blast those mountains back in the eighties to lay some tracks.

It's quite interesting given the circumstances
