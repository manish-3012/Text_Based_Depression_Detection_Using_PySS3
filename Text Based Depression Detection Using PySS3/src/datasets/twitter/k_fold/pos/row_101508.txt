For those whose parents installed a search tracker/blocker on their devices, try using TOR Browser My parents installed McAfee Safe Family on my Android phone and it showed all of my searches and blocked potentially inappropriate websites and sent alerts to my parents, even on incognito (although I'm pretty sure my parents don't know that they can see this, they just use the app for location tracking). I tried using TOR and the searches didn't get picked up by McAfee. I searched "porn (to test mcafee i dont actually want it" on incognito in Chrome and on Tor and it was blocked on Chrome but not Tor. Test it out and see if it works.
