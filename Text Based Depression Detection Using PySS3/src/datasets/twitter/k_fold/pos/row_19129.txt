Yo, if you think you're ugly... Remember that what we consider "ugly" vs "beautiful" is nothing more than our biological programing and societal standards. Materialistically speaking we're all just sacks of meat and bones with sentience and you're no uglier or prettier than the most attractive guy/girl you know. Your looks do not define you and anyone who says otherwise is too stupid for you to give a fuck about their opinion.
