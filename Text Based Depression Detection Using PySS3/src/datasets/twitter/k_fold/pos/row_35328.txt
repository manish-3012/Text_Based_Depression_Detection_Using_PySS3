So me and this girl spend 7 months (nearly 8) talking... (Sorry for the shit layout)

this is the most serious ever relationship ive ever been in. She was my everything- we were gonna beat the world together. But she left me for good today :/
I hurt that girl (or at least i think i did)
The last month has been quite tragic, a lot happening between us, little squabbles here and there, long rants etc etc. She was my guidance, she motivated me to be the best ever version of myself and did that effectively. But last Friday she blocked me after a very long paragraph from her about how she cant take my depressive thoughts, cant take my negative talk, cant do this anymore. I left her be for the the weekend n all but i needed to talk to her. I literally cannot live without this girl, i need her to get till tomorrow. 
I messaged her today and poured my fucking heart out, completely. Because her leaving has drained every single bit of emotion/thought(everything) out of me... i told her i can change. Maybe we genuinely needed a break but she doesnâ€™t care. She thinks that i can just get over someone who i got SO emotionally attached to in the past few months to the point where i threw absolutely everyone aside, including family (which i regret) and she acts as if iâ€™ll be completely fine. She juggled around with my feelings and guilt tripped me. Because i went off disputing all my emotions into that chat and sheâ€™s saying that im such a low, pathetic person, who makes her feel shit and makes her cry. 

I would have given that girl the world- we were genuine soulmates up until shit started falling down... and now im thinking of just committing suicide because there wont ever be anyone better, more similar, more perfect than her. Maybe i am addicted- but i cannot love anyone else and never will. But she doesnâ€™t want me, at all and will never talk to me again. 

Im sorry for those who read this- im crying and i dont even know what im typing. I dont know what to do.... at all. Help?
