Iâ€™m done I hate everything, Iâ€™m part of a private play test which I thought was pretty cool, I told my dad and he proceeded to berate me for talking to him about video games, Iâ€™m going to a school Iâ€™m not smart enough to be in, my dad wonâ€™t let me get a real job and is just forcing me to work for him, my parents are insanely Christian. Iâ€™ve tried everything I can think of and I still donâ€™t have any skills, I tried music, couldnâ€™t do it, I tried coding, didnâ€™t work, I tried sports, didnâ€™t work, Iâ€™m terrible at every single video game I play, and I just found out my best friend almost committed suicide last year, and I wasnâ€™t there, some random class mate stopped him and I canâ€™t stop thinking what if he hadnâ€™t been there. I just donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m leaving all my friends and my old school to go the afore mentioned school, in get excluded from my other friends because I canâ€™t hang out most of the time due to my fucking parents, Iâ€™m 15 years old and they put screen time with nothing enabled in my phone, only reason I can post is because I figured out the password, life has to be better than this right? There has to a reason.
