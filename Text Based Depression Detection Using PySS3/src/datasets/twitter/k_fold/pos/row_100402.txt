Rant about actors So, i do not know where to post this so i am posting it here. 

I recently watched a movie called "black lightning" or something where there was this guy and his daughter and something happened to his daughter so the father remembered his long lost superpowers and went and saved his daughter (Think the story of God of War 4). plot sounds legit right? well no, because father shoots lightning out of his hands which are NOT black but, the father is black. my problem with this is that whenever an african american person is cast as a superhero, over 50 percent of the time, their names have the prefix - black. this however does not happen to caucasian actors like nobody calls hawkeye, white hawkeye or whiteye and nobody calls captain america, white american superhero. So, maybe there is racism in hollywood. Examples of black superheroes if anyone's interested- **black** panther- the most notable one (RIP chadwick boseman), **Black** marvel, **Black** racer. Thank you for coming to my rant.
