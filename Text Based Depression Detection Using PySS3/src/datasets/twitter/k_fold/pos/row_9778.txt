Youtube can go SMD Lately youtube has been starting to enforce its age restriction and it fucking sucks. I have watched age restricted content in yt since i was 10 and now when i try to watch edgy content it asks for my fucking credit card info or id. WHY?!. Only 2 weeks ago i could just click a box that said that the following content is nsfw and now i cant. Im only 14 so for 4 years im not supposed to watch any edgy content? Wtf like i can watch that type of shit on tv so why not yt. Jesus christ its not like a fucking 14 old is gonna get traumatised from maxmoefoe throwing up on camera. The family friendly disney chanel type shit yt is trying to force people to enjoy is complete crap. Honestly im so waiting for the day that someone is gonna create a platform thats gonna overthrow yt. Why does yt have to censor good content and why is it categorised into only 2 different groups, over and under 18. Why not something like under 12, under 14, 16 etc. It doesnt make sence that i cant watch content that i can handle because some fucking busines man decided that 14 are fucking babies.
