Going through old groupchat political debates is weird On the one group chat there are *so many* and a lot of them devolve into yelling (usually after I get pissed off for being called a xenophobe for hating the chinese government, or something like that). None of the debates are really productive cause no one can debate let alone get along while debating.  Weird times.
