Poll: buy a replacement waterbed heater or buy foam for my bed As the title suggests the heater for my waterbed broke, now im laying in top of the covers so i can last a few nights but i need the communities opinion, Iâ€™ve had a waterbed for 4 years now and i can either replace the heater or just get a twin size mattress from future foam and fill in the space the bag used to go. So, which do you think?
