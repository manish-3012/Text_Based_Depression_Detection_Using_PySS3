My mom just got diagnosed with terminal cancer So my mom and dad just went to the hospital today which isn't abnormal since she's been going there for two years now so me and my brother stayed at home for the day.

So my dad comes back from there without my mom which is not normal and my dad says that she's staying there to get some blood tests done.

Now my dad has told me that her cancer is terminal. We don't know how long we have left before she goes.
