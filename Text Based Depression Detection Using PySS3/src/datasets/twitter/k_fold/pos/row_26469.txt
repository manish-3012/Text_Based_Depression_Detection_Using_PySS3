With my birthday coming up, I'm reminiscing a lot My teenage years were the worst years of my life. I spent years trying to drug my way out of my problems and even tried ending it all when I was 14. I was constantly falling out with friends and switching schools. Only one of my friends (from probably dozens) has remained all these years. All in all, I was a miserable little rat. Still, I look back at these years as the ones I got away with the wildest stuff, really found who I was, and began to understand the world for what (I think) it truly is. I'm still so far and I still feel like a child. With about a month before my 20th birthday, I feel so bittersweetly nostalgic. I wish I had partied more instead of staying in every day. I wish I had gotten into trouble while I would still have been a "stupid kid". Now I am left with stupid memories of lying in bed crying about my life and crying because I was scared I would end it all once it got hard. Well, it is hard. I "should" have killed myself this year but of course I didn't. I have a life to live and there are people that I wish to keep seeing. I have things I want to do. So funny, I spent those years in fear of myself.

Guys, don't waste this precious time. It is the only time you will ever get the "teen" title. It is the only time you can act so stupidly and be so mopey. And if you're one of those kids like I was who keeps telling yourself, "I'll end it before I'm even 20 so what's the point?", stop!!!!! You probably won't. You probably won't die from global warming before you're 20 and you probably won't get murdered, sick, etc either. Live for now but don't forget that you do actually have a future. Don't be a dummy like me who wasted her years thinking she'd be dead before she would have to actually deal with life. Life is coming and it is painful and beautiful. Stay safe guys. Scared but looking forward to my 20s.
