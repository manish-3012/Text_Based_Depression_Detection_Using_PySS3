Why donâ€™t people on this sub Reddit understand that sarcasm doesnâ€™t translate well over text? Like, Iâ€™ll post something, and then someone will say something super rude or mean, and then Iâ€™ll call them out, and theyâ€™ll be like â€œbro I was just kidding, why you so serious?â€ 

Itâ€™s pisses me off, stop fucking doing it. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
