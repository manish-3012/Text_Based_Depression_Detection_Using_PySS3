I don't understand whats so bad about being basic? I mean if you have the same common interests as everyone else doesn't that mean it's easier to make friends? Not to mention that your interest is well liked and probably highly rated. Why do people think others are invalid because they're "basic" or "typical"? I really want to talk about this with other cause I used to think this way but I want to bring awareness to the fact that just because your interest is "common" doesn't mean its not meaningful. If you like ripped jeans and a crop top wear it! If you like sweaters and overalls wear it! I don't understand why we have to pit each other against one another. Does anyone else feel the same?
