A Progressive Rock Playlist Hello everyone! I made a playlist yesterday of some of my favorite prog rock bands! If you also enjoy prog rock and want to expand your horizons give a listen!

It has bands from Norway, The UK, and the US. I will be expanding my playlist as time goes on, but at this point in time it's 5 hours long so you can listen to it while studying, cleaning, etc.
 If you have any bands you really enjoy that "fit the vibe" let me know and I'll give a listen and maybe it'll go in tge playlist!
