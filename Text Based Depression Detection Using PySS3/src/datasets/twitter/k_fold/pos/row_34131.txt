Life fucking sucks My life is a mess. I've managed to cope for nearly a year but I can't handle this anymore. Because of all this covid crap, I'm now on this online school and haven't seen anyone other than my direct family for over a month. For a wile I still saw some of my friends through boyscout meetings but now that's gone too. I barely even remember what my friends faces look like. I barely sleep anymore I'm nearly failing half my classes and I don't know what to do. I used to do sports but I've got thus fucking divit in my chest so I can barely breath while running and there also forcing kids to wear fucking masks while running. At least im finely getting that fixed in a month by the doctors putting a metal rod in my chest but then I won't be able to do sports for another month and the school already canceled winter sports.

 I think I might need help. I've just had a mental breakdown and have considered things I'd wish to never thing of. I don't know what to do. I've been waiting thinking things will get better but it's been getting worse and I'm losing hope. Fuck you and fuck life. I don't care anymore. I just want a life to live but I have no options left. My mom's in financial ruin and selling the house I grew up in. I'm probably going to have to pick which parent I'm living with. I love them both but I'd rather live alone than have to choose. I don't even have a place to call home but I've got no where else to go. What am I going to do. I have no life anymore.
