My school is *supposed* to be a non-religious public school My secondary school is supposed to be a 'pobalscoil' or 'public school', which means that it is non-religious, and open to all cultures. But even though this is what's in their advertising pamphlet, there is still a mandatory catholic mass every year, as well as catholic based activities very frequently. Also- religion class, which is supposed to educate us on all world religion, just pushes Catholicism on us and tells us about how great it is. Just wondering if anyone else can relate?
