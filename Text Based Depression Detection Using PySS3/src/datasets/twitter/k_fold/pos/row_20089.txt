Girlfriend is texting other guys more than she texts me? She has another guy higher up than me on her best friends list on Snapchat. And me and my girlfriend text  everyday, throughout the day. She said itâ€™s just her best friend but idk man now Iâ€™m worried. Wtf isnâ€™t that not normal? Heâ€™s higher than anyone else on her best friends list. Why would she text a friend so often everyday? Should I be worried about this? Iâ€™m worried. Shit.
