Is this what depression is like? All of the games that used to make me excited, or gave me drive to go through my day seem boring. Sometimes I can't bring myself to turn on my switch or click on a game. Some days I don't have the energy to get out of bed. I pride myself with always waking up early, but now I wake up late and frequently sleep during the day. I know that it's weird that I'm posting this on reddit, but I just wanted to let it out. My family, as much as I love them, wouldn't understand.
