I got banned from r/lgbtteens for literally shaming the antagonist of a story. Ok someone said that yada yada in the bus for her Christian school she waved a pride flag and it got taken away. But some kid waved a trump flag and that was perfectly acceptable. Ok now im a gay mexican so what im about to say i really believe. If you disagree thats fine. I have evidence to believe what I do and if you disagree you may have caught different information. Maybe i havent been exposed to yours or you havenâ€™t been exposed to mine. Whatever. So I comment, hah jokes on the homophobic kid for supporting trump who is literally the most pro gay president. That was downvoted to shit and I got one reply and I simply said I disagree and so do you but thats fine. :) so i was respectful to every rely and boom. Ban.
