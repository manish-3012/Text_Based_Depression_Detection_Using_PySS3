I could never understand how people have one crush and constantly obsess over them I have a new crush every time I see a cute boy lmao like there's nothing super special about one boy, many are cute. And if they don't like me, then I'm not attracted to them at all and they're dead to me, idk how straight guys still like girls after they clearly show they are repelled by him.
