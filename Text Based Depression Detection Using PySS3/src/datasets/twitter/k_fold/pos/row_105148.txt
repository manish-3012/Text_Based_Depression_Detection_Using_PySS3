The first experience with a toxic Redditor So there I was looking for a certain PokÃ©mon on the PokÃ©mon subreddit, oh hey look! Someone wants to trade! Oh thatâ€™s not a deal I want to do, time to look for another one! And I get downvoted, probably by that guyâ€™s two alts...

Sorry just wanted to get that off my chest
