I'm going to sleep, and I want this post to reach 100 doots If this post I am making reaches 100 doots before I wake up, I will create a new youtube channel, and try to make good content. My current channel had videos of myself, but one day I decided to private them all. I am taking suggestions for content, and I may start streaming on Twitch, or other platforms. If this is successful, I will make my first video, and I will try to be consistent with future uploads. 

Once again, I am taking suggestions for content

I will see y'all in around 8 and a half hours
