I never quite realized it until now... So diseases are fucking terrifying. The stuff of nightmares tbh. I mean, I suppose I should've known that because of covid and all but like, there's far worse stuff that luckily for us doesn't affect humans...yet. 

I'm not convinced a sort of zombie virus is completely impossible if certain diseases became transferable to humans. Actually the game The Last of Us is based on just that concept. the fungus Cordyceps grows to affect humans basically making them mushroom zombies. It's actually not that unrealistic.

Jesus, even some of the names of these diseases give me the creeps, for example Chronic Wasting Disease and Scrapie. The second one sounds like some kind of creepypasta monster or something.
