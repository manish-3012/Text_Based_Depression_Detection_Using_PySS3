Drugs (medicine) side effects. Since 5 days ago, when I began taking Darcutane 400mg, I noticed that I am much more tired, to the point that I have to drink coffee or tea to be a Pearson. Something I have never done before, not even in the days I slept toooo little.

Is this normal? Have you experienced this with Darcutane or any other Drug?
