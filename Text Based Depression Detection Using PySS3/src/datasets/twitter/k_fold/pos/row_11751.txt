I've gone down into that pool of negativity, I've been there for too long, and I need to come up for air. It's been bad, we can't afford electricity, my dad lost his business, relationships with everyone failing, and I know it's worse for many others, but I need to come up for air before it's too late, and I'm further into this pit of despair. Just I need to figure out how to take that breath.
