Can anyone explain to me why we spent a whole year learning how to write fancy? Like I get that the American Education System is obsolete as fuck but cmon, was there ever a time that a child needed a whole year to learn how to write their signature? Cursive is dumb as shit and it makes no sense why itâ€™s apart of public education. Itâ€™s ridiculous.
