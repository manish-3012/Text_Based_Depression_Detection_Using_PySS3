Apparently I should stop speaking to the girl who treats me better than anyone else bc of her age So this girl who I really like, going on a date with soon, and me are getting like super close

Sheâ€™s 19 and Iâ€™m 17 and apparently according to people on here I should stop and not get with her, even tho itâ€™s completely legal in England. Even in regards to age, Iâ€™m 18 next April and sheâ€™s 20 in June so Iâ€™m 18 before sheâ€™s 20 meaning itâ€™s not that bad even tho people think itâ€™s weird af

Like if youâ€™re speaking to someone who treats you well; dont stop, unless itâ€™s illegal because your private life ainâ€™t no ones business
