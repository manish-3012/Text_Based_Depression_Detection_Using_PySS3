Fuck. So I know the whole meme about the avatar movie is that no one remembers it. But our stupid ass teacher decided to give us graded questions about the movie and I don't remember shit. I really need your help. I only have a couple of hours to answer the questions. thanks in advance for any help &lt;3

these are the questions:

1.What is the setting (time and place) of the story?

2. Describe the character Jake Sully. Explain why he was chosen for the Pandora project. What will he get if he is successful in the mission?

3.Describe the character Neytiri. Why is she important to Jake?

4.In your opinion, what is the most dramatic part of the movie? Describe what happens.

  
5. How does Jake help save Pandora at the end of the movie? How is he rewarded?
