Iâ€™m treated like a 10 year old Ok this isnâ€™t too serious but I feel the need to rant to someone. Starting in September Iâ€™m going to be a freshman is high school, Iâ€™m almost 15. Keep that in mind. I play for our schools tennis team, and have summer practices in the mornings. My mom, who drives me there, starts her new job this week, and would need to go in some days of the week, meaning she wonâ€™t be able to get me to practice. I know a senior on the team, and she offered to drive me. I also suggested to my mom to let me walk/bike to the school, since it would only be a couple minute bike ride. My mom replied with â€œAbsolutely not. I donâ€™t want you biking to tennis or having some girl I donâ€™t know driving you. If I canâ€™t get you to practice, youâ€™re not going.â€ I MEAN COME ON!! I have two valid options lined up, yet thatâ€™s not good enough for her! I feel like I still have the privileges of a ten year old! I mean she doesnâ€™t even let me walk around our neighborhood by myself!! She makes me feel like such a little kid! And because of that, Iâ€™m probably going to miss tennis too, which my coach will not be happy about.
