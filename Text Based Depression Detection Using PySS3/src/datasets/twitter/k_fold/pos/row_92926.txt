Nice, i'm gonna meet new people Last year our school hired some really young psychologists to be our mentors(emotional support, personalized stufy method,etc.), and I became good friends with one of them. So, i waited until school was over so we could properly hang out. Turns out 10 other friends of mine had the same idea, so we just hung out as a group. As the year is ending, there's a pretty good chance that the current last year has some people thinking about doing the same, so i'll probably meet new people joining the gang soon
