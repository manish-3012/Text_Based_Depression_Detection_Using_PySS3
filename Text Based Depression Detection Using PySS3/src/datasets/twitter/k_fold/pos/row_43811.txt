You guys are absolutely lucky I canâ€™t believe it, I wish I was like you guys. Idk man, I just feel so sorry and bad for myself because I canâ€™t even do the things you guys are doing.You guys have girlfriends, friends, dreams, talents, here I am sleeping during class, pleasuring myself everyday to women who would probably think I am ugly. I also canâ€™t even work on my dreams, I just jerk off and I donâ€™t even work on the ACT/SAT and AP Human Geography. Iâ€™m skinny, ugly, and Iâ€™m 15, I want to just end it sometimes man. I canâ€™t even work on my dreams that I want to do, Iâ€™ve always wanted to do them, maybe I should become a doctor instead. My dadâ€™s been telling me to get into a good college, idk how to get a 36 on the ACT and a 1600 on the SAT. I hate my life. I should just end it and die, no one liked me or cared about me. I think Iâ€™ll slit my wrists or eat some pills during winter break, I think maybe on Christmas I should end it. Anyway thanks for coming to my TedTalk. Bye.
