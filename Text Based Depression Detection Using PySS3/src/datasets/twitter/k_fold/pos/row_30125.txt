I am a fucking loser I am negative, I'm not even zero. I was trying to get in a relationship with a girl I've known for 8 years now, since the 2nd grade, and she likes me back. Not even 2 hours ago while we were talking, she said she can't even be with me, since she knows it's going to end. I am a Muslim, and she is a Catholic, so if we were to be married, she would be condoning sin for the rest of her life. I said I didn't care about the far future, since we might not even have a future if the events happening today become worse over time. I told her I just want her NOW, to be with her in the present, and not worry about the future. You know what she said? She said "I can't" and so I asked her try, and then she said "we can't." I fucking hate myself, now more than ever. I actually thought someone like me, could actually have a girlfriend with someone I've known for years, someone who is actually pretty popular (I dont really give a shit about that), someone who can complete me, a fucking non-athletic jock, not 6 pack having, poor ass, 5'8 ass, Bangladeshi, gamer, LOSER. After all, that's just what I am. A loser who's life is getting good grades and video games. A loser.
