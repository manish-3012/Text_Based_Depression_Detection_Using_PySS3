Learn to take a hint from your crush A guy in my class has had a crush on me for 2 years. He STARES at me every day. Tries to impress me with doing pull-ups before class. Throws his pencil (khm) near my desk so he could get attention. He stands 1 cm away from me, and when I move, he moves closer. Don't call me rude, I've been polite and tried to give him hints for a long time. 

I have anxiety. And coming to school, knowing that someone is always staring at me, makes it 100 times worse. 

So boys and girls, if you have a crush on someone, watch for the hints. If you notice that your crush is literally uncomfortable around you, please stop. The tension you're feeling isn't the good kind :)
