I saw Turning Point USA flyers on some lockers today... I ripped them off the lockers and walls of the school and threw them into the trash bin. We donâ€™t need a groups thatâ€™s stuck in 2016 ruining anyone else or radicalizing them into the far right like what happened to lots of people on here around the age of 14-15 years old.
