Its been 8hrs since my dad left to visit his friends. I've resorted to locking air in rooms just incase I run out of air rashons, I'm out of snacks and resorted eating cat treats to get through. I've been talking to my cat for the last hour and a half and learnt alot about her, for example she meows everytime I go into the kitchen and doesn't speak English. I've aged alot and no longer can look myself in the mirror without crying, though I couldn't do it before he left but I thought it was note worthy. I have revisited old shows. Overall I think I'm handling things pretty well.
