Its hard to show love I'm not asexual (I know that because I'm very straight and very horny) but I've never really bothered with getting a gf. I've only ever truly  crushed on one person before and it was overall a great feeling but after that I never cared about someone deeply. 

I know that I've got chances because I've gotten plenty more compliments in the past couple of years than I ever have but even having a crush feels so draining (but also kind of energising in its own way). I'm already having a lot of trouble expressing my love for my friends and family, I can't ever imagine having to show my love for a gf every few hours, let alone showing love to my own self. 

It's really draining to love

Even loving my own passions can get frustrating at times. 

Anyone else feel similar? 
Also, sorry for my grammar, I have no ideas how to use commas well (am not native English speaker)
