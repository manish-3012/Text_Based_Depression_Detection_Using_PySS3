This chick who I went to school with shared a video asking to get a girl who said the n word in a rap song expelled from her university but is now about to get kicked out for going to a COVID party. If that doesnâ€™t show whatâ€™s wrong with our generation I donâ€™t know what does.

Donâ€™t throw stones if you live in a glass house.

The bill always comes due...
