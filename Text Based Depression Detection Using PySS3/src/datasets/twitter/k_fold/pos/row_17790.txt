I asked out my crush today and it went well! I asked out my crush today to a local restaruant and she agreed. Now, i wanna say that i see posts on the internet all the time saying that your crush wont invite you out ^((theese weren't necessarily included in the posts: )) bc you're chubby or even fat, shy, not popular etc... and you keep doubting yourself but, the same is with me and it went great.

Now, this post might look like me asking her out went well and all but, i was nervous all day and trying to get the courage to ask her out.

**All i want to do with this post is give you hope**, bc i'm all of those things i listed:

&gt;bc you're chubby or even fat, shy, not popular etc...

i want to send a message to you: you can do it; even if it takes multiple days (wich it did for me) it'll be ok.
