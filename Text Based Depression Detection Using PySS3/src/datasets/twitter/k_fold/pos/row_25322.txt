I'm about to do something extremely outta pocket. I was playing Minecraft on this world that i have been slowly building up for months now and I just completed this cool wood lodge that took like 2 hours and I had so much shit on me. Then I was killed by a zombie while trying to eat and I didn't take down the cords or set a respawn point. 

I'm bouta put on my black air force 1s and jean shorts and terrorize the local populous.
