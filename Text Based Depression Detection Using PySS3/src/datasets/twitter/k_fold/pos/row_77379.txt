After moving to US, I really wonder if anyone has ever played DOTA2 here. Yeah, it's that game that is similar to LoL(which is very popular here for some reason) and the only PR it gets is a once-a-year article about The International beating prize pool record once again. The game is really challenging and complicated, I want to hear why would anyone choose LoL over Dota.
