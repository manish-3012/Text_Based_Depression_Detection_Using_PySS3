What should I do? I can either watch Modern Family (Iâ€™m on Season 10)

Or

I can call my friends on Discord

I cant do both because everyone knows youâ€™re a dick if youâ€™re watching TV while on a call with someone.

#Also Consider

- If I watch Modern Family, I can still text my friends
- If Iâ€™m on call with them, I can scroll through Reddit
