You into politics but donâ€™t want the toxicity of r/politics and youâ€™re a teenager, which being on this sub you hopefully should be! Join r/tooyoungtovote! â€œCommunity for anyone here interested in US politics

r/tooyoungtovote is a place for teenagers to discuss, make memes about, or get informed about American politics, while having an equal amount of experiences as the person you are discussing with. On other political subreddits, you have to argue with people more than twice your age, and you can be as smart and correct as possible, but somebody with years more of learning and experience is bound to win. You can post any discussion, political meme, or anything else that you want, just donâ€™t be toxic and you are welcomed!

This subreddit was created a few months ago, but not a lot of people joined, so it never grew.â€ -u/Jackyboy923

I basically copy pastaâ€™d his advert which he posted here before, anyway, hereâ€™s what I have to add. I am a moderator on the sub, and basically me and Jackyboy923 post discussions and make sure everything stays civil, which so far is has been. Basically you can go over there, share you thoughts, start discussion, etc. just follow the golden rule, keep everything civil please. I know I basically re-stated what was already said by Jackyboy but ye.
