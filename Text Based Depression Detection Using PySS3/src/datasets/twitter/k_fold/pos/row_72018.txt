I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever see my best friend again. Before corona started we used none of the same social medias, so we can't talk online. Same goes for all my other friends at the time. I do online school now, and I wonder if they still go to the same school or even live in this city anymore. I was going to tell my best friend my feelings for her, but corona cancelled school for the rest of the year the day before I was gonna tell her. I miss her so much. She was the one of the only people I could talk about anything to. She could almost always make me laugh, and make me happy. She's really cute as well. Whenever I think of her now, I start blushing. But at the same time I dont know if I'm ever gonna see her again, which fills me with this dread. I really really really hope she's doing okay during this virus. I hope I can see her again someday, but i dont know how too contact her.
