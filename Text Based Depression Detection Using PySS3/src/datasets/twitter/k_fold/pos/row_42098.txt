I am lonely I wish I was in school so I could go back to talking to girls because right now I feel sooo lonely. Sometimes I get a feeling where I feel empty because the only people I talked to are my family and asshole friends. (Thanks to quarantine) Sometimes I wish I could cry myself to sleep, but I can never think that my reasons to cry aren't good enough and I can't get any sleep.
I am sooo lonely.
