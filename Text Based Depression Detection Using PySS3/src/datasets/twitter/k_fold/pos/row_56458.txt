Need advice So my good friend led me on and made me think we were a couple (they literally said we were dating recently, and encouraged romantic shit). Yesterday they told me about a date they were gonna go on with somebody else. After we joked about something, I confronted them and was like I thought we were together, and they just said "no I don't think so". That hurt a lot. It feels like it was my fault for getting too emotionally invested, but idk. 


I just texted them that I need some time to think and then disabled notifications so I dont have to see their reply lmao. What should I do now about this friendship? I just feel so stupid and childish. 





I would have put this in r/relationshipadvice but that sub intimidates me and besides this sub probably understands dumb stuff like this better.
