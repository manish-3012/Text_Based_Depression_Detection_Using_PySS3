Try New (70) Trying. If something isn't working, try somewhere else. There are always other options to share. There is no point in waiting "to catch on". Their is brighter waiting for you. 

December 21. We have shifted. For Good. It is our time. Our time to end the year in the strongest way we have in our life. If you need rest, give yourself rest. If you want to start working on something come January, write them down now. If you are going hard until the hard year, keep on the gas. It will all pay off. We are all different. We must remember that.

The skies are Grey out today and thats ok, another chance to find the sunshine inside, even for just a moment, if so, we have won today. A moment where we sit there and say thank you for life, for what we have been given and for what we have. Its so easy to think in the future and what we want; yes, its good to set goals, to set intentions but everything is only available for what is who you are now. 

Living as a trans person, there are many times throughout each day that make me think, why? who am i? why is it difficult to be understood? 

I have learned in the recent days that the **only** person that needs to understand us, is our oneself. Isn't that beautiful though? Out of close to 8 billion people in the world, we are the only ones that truly know who we **TRULY** are. Thats pretty beautiful to me. Of course these realizations have taken me my whole life and I am constantly connecting with it more and more each day. Emotional Intelligence &amp; Resilience. Knowing that everything we are enduring and that we are living through is for our Highest and Greatest Self. Take the goods, the bad's and the uglies and use them to your advantage. It is meant for you in this present moment but even that will pass. I know it. We are divine. Together, Separately.

Today: Give yourself a hug and say out loud "I CAN", because I know you can. Wishing you well.
