I was addicted to cereal. Pop tarts saved me. I used to eat big bowls of sugary cereal every night. I was addicted, the cereal was so good. Every day I would tell myself no more. I lied to myself. I just ate and ate and ate. I would get hungry and had to satisfy myself. One night I went downstairs into the pantry, and all the boxes of cereal were there. I was about to dig in, when I noticed a new treat. Pop tarts. I decided to eat the poptarts instead. That was the best decision i have ever made. I am now sober, poptarts saved me.
