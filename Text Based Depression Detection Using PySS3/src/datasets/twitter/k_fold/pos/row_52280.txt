Apparently, I can't even spend my own money So recently, I (M16) saved up enough money to get a bicycle. My OWN money, working, money from relatives etc. I told my parents that I was gonna buy a bike and they told me to keep that money so whenever there is a need of some extra money for THEM, they will use it. 
I AM NOT A FUCKING BANK. I'm so angry. When I oppeosed them, they lashed out and now giving me the silent treatment.
Life sucks
