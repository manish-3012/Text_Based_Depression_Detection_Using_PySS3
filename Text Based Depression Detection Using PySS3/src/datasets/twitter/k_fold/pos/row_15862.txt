Would it be bad if I messaged this to my crush? Earlier today I said hey to this girl who I talk to frequently and she usually says hey back but today she left me on open, and obviously people get busy and all but I Iâ€™m contemplating on messaging her asking her if I annoyed her cause thatâ€™s one reason to ignore someone, Iâ€™m wondering if messaging â€œsorry if I annoyed you earlier todayâ€ is a bad idea or not.
