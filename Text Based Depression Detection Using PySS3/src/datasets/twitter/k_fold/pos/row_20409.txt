How do you accept who you are? For those of you here, however many there are, what did it take before you finally accepted who you are as a person? I've always been one to repress a lot of the stuff that makes me different, or special (though that makes it sound like an insult), say for example me being a repressive trans. It's not that I wouldn't have the support if I chose to be open about that, it's more that I've always seen it as just another problem, which is why I repress it. Either way, I'm just open to hearing anything you've got to say, either here or in my dms if you'd prefer that.
