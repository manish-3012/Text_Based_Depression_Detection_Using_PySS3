Just a little nostalgia I want to share... When I was little, like 7 or 8, I had a little hole in my backyard that connected to another dude's house. If you were lucky enough, a tiny grey kitten would squeeze its way through for a few minutes before going back to its owner. I remember playing with it while outside with my brother, Good times.
