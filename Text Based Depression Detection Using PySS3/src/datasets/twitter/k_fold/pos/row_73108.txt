I donâ€™t have an F for the first time in 4 years!!! so, a little context. Iâ€™ve always been a pretty bad student, usually not tiring i in a good chunk of assignments because i really donâ€™t care most of the time. But this year is different. This year, iâ€™ve actually tried my hardest and gotten the work done. For the first time in a very long time, i havenâ€™t received an email saying i have one or more F. You probably donâ€™t care, i just wanted to say this somewhere, but i am extremely proud of myself.
