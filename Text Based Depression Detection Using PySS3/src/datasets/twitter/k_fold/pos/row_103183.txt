All my friends are playing together vr and Iâ€™m left out Two out of my three friends has always had a vr headset and occasionally play them but then the other one just recently got one and now thatâ€™s all they have been doing. Even when Im in the voice chat they just come to decision and all play. One of them streams there screen for me, they probably think I think itâ€™s fun to watch them have fun for three days in a row. I donâ€™t have any other friends to go to so Iâ€™m lonely.
