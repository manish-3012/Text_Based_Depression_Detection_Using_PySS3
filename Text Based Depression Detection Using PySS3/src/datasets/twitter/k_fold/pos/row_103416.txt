How do I tell my parents that I'm not exactly into their religion? I've always been to all the religious stuff along with my parents and I've never really had any thought about it till now. My parents are great people, but sometimes they do slightly force me to go the services or do whatever. I have never really had a serious talk to my parents before, I usually avoid it if I can, but I think this is a talk that I've been delaying for far too long.

How should I tell them?
