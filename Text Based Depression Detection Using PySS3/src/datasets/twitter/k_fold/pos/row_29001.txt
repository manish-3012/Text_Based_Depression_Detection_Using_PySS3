I want to end it all I have no actual reason for it, I just want to get out of this world. I know that I have people that love me but it just feels like Iâ€™m disappointing everyone with how shit I am.

School has just started and it already feels like Iâ€™m falling behind. I think I might be autistic but what if itâ€™s just something my mind is making up as an excuse for me being so lazy.

I want a psychiatrist, but Iâ€™m afraid to ask friends and family for help in case they will just laugh it off or make fun of me. I pretend to be fine around my family and mask everything I do with my friends so they have no idea whatâ€™s going on.

All Iâ€™m asking you guys is for your support and some tips on how to make things better.

Bless you all
