My 13 year old sister is a huge asshole. Can the 13 year olds here prove that youâ€™re all not super stupid drama creating pieces of garbage? I seriously thought my sister would get better with age but ever since she became 13 sheâ€™s a huge asshole who back talks my dad all the time and hangs out with really shitty friends.

I honestly thought 13 year olds were smarter than that. Can you please prove to me that they are? I want to believe.
