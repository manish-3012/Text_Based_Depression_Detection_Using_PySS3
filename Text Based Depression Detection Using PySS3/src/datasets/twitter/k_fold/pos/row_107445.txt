I hate these group projects I have a group project due today and nobody else has done literally any work, and it has to include video of every member. I asked my teacher what to do and she basically said she can take out whoever isn't doing any work, but then it would be me as the only person left. She said the grade doesn't really change from one person to the next, so it looks like I'm getting an F for that class
