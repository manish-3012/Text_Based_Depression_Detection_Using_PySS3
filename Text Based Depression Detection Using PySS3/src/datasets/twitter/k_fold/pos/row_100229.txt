Hey, I'm a dumbass teenager who's friends with a horrible person. Warning: Long

Some background, I'm 15M and she's 13F, 9th and 8th graders. We haven't known each other for a while or anything (not even half a year), but we met through the venting channel of a discord server so we've known each other really well for a while. We're also online friends obviously and live hundreds of miles away.

First of all, she's really screwed up mentally, and has a lot of issues. She's addicted to vaping, self harm, has dabbled with another drug or two (i.e. cough syrup), has an awful relationship with her brother, very depressed, anxious and stressed, I think has been diagnosed with SAD and GAD, doesn't drink enough water, eats little, has attempted overdosing (at 12 years old), probably has ADHD, and I think there's a chance she's sociopathic. Her dad also died when she was 2, and yeah you get the deal. I've tried helping her a ton, too much actually lol. I tried reminding her to do get things done and even created a google doc to keep track of things, but it just isn't worth it since I'm not her therapist or anything, and she doesn't want me trying to help that much anyway lol. I've talked her out of killing herself, and I've given her advice dozens of times. She appreciates it, and trusts me a lot.

On the other hand, she isn't a good person. When I first started talking to her I thought she was just being self deprecating, but I've figured out over time that that isn't exactly true. She can be rude, she's wanted to kill before, she lies a lot (mainly to other people), and she lacks empathy in certain situations. I've had to talk her out of killing her brother one night when she was angry at him, no joke. Luckily, she isn't consistently homicidal, and I'm pretty sure she's never made plans. She's the last person you want angry, and she has no remorse when she is angry. Overall, she's fucking crazy.

With all of this in mind, I'm really close to her, since we both vent to each other a bunch. She's the only person I feel comfortable just randomly talking/venting to, and I'm probably the only person she goes to for advice, or when she feels absolutely suicidal. And even though we're pretty different people, we have some core similarities, and we can definitely agree on a few topics. She's honestly a really fun person to talk to, sadly. If it wasn't for this, and for how bad I feel for her, I would've dropped her out of my life already. Idk what to do with her, I talk to her several times a day and it'd be so hard to just suddenly stop talking to her due to how she's a bad influence and a bad person. Should I just talk a lot less and keep a distance, or what? idfk what to do and how to do it

TLDR: My friend is a bad person who is homicidal, and has a ton of mental issues which I try to help her through. Because we're so close, it's hard to just drop her out of my life or anything, and idk what to do.
