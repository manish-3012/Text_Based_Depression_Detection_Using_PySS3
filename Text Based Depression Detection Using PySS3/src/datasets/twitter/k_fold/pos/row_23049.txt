19 male, been having a really strong urge to smoke for a couple days I've smoked a couple times before, but I wasn't really into it and I really never thought of it that much
But in the last couple of days, I've  been having crazy vivid DREAMS ABOUT SMOKING and I'm just going crazy, can someone tell me is this normal or wtf is going on. BTW everyone in my family smokes regularly but I wasnt really interested in it before and kinda hated it, but I dont know what's happening in my mind rn.
