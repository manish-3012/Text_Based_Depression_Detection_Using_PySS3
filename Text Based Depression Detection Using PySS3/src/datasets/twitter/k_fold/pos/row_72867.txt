Im only 3 paychecks away from getting a pc!! Technically I could buy it in 2 paychecks if I like...don't eat food or pay for necessities. But, sadly necessities are needed ðŸ˜­

Still 3 weeks is gonna fly by! By next year I might having my first gaming pc ever, hopefully that will be a good start to my 2021
