Dentist appointment Just went to the dentist for a cleaning, and got a super nice dentist. Right before getting fluoride, she put up a picture of me from about nine years ago when I was pretty young to compare my teeth because I have braces. (Ended up taking a picture of it to show my mom, she loved it) i laughed about it, and she said that I looked pretty different, I agreed.

And then, my self esteem did not see this coming. She said how my smile looks pretty different, and then â€œyou still have those beautiful eyes thoughâ€. 

My ego and self image shot directly through the roof and into the earths orbit after that one.
