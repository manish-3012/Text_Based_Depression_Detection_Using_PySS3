After 30 years of lowkey dictatorship, ruling party of my country finally lost election. Finally freedom ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ I couldnt be more happy. Its 3 am and i cant sleep because of the excitement. I am 18 years old and my whole life i was under single regime. Our president has been announced as the "man of the year 2015 in organise crime and corruption" by occrp. He stole billions upon billions of dollars from the country, closed almost every factory in the country, almost comletelly crushed all my hopes and dreams. I cried out of happiness and pure joy tonight. Guys this means so much to me you wouldnt believe it
