Im actually kind of tired of pornhub People fucking each otherâ€™s brains out just doesnâ€™t do it for me anymore. 

I donâ€™t think this is because Iâ€™ve gotten used to it and only more hardcore stuff can get me aroused. In fact, hardcore stuff only makes it worse for me.

I just think that sex shouldnâ€™t be like this. The more Iâ€™ve been thinking about it, the more Iâ€™ve realized that I really donâ€™t want sex all that badly. Actually no. Thatâ€™s wrong. I want sex. But I donâ€™t want sex without love (Wow that is the fucking cheesiest thing I have ever written). This is coming from a guy who has never asked anyone out or has ever been asked out. But damn, I just wish I could fall in love.

Iâ€™m just writing down my thoughts. All in all, I think this is a beneficial development. Porn is a waste of time anyway.
