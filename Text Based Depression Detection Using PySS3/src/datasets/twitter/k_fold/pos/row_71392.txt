I think I did the right thing.... I didn't do it. Put my coat back on. Backed off from the railing. Called a hotline... 5 times. Talked for an hour. And yet the reasons are still there... Might as well try again? Nothing has actually changed... She still likes someone else, my best friend probably hates me now, I have no future and no idea why should I carry on... What should I do?
