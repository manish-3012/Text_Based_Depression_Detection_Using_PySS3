Ok so I'm assuming some of y'all know what kiss anime is but the website got taken down and I'm wondering if anyone knows an alternative? I watched dragon ball on it and other animes but since it's down I don't have any other way and I don't have a vaste amount of money I can afford to blow on a subscription for it, if anyone knows another way to watch me and the girl I'm talking to would highly appreciate it.ðŸ‘ðŸ»
