Exposure to COVID-19 So first off I want to start by saying that I am in no way shape or form bashing any sort of religion whatsoever.

So today being Tuesday, I went over to my grandfathers house on Saturday because we were going to be cooking. He goes to church on a regular basis, in which he gathers with many people. He tested positive for COVID 19 today and alerted us. He got tested on Friday and it came back positive just today as I stated. Now Iâ€™m not saying that it was but Iâ€™m pretty damn sure it was that church. No masks.In a crowded area. Iâ€™m 99% sure that it was that church. I went to hang out with my grandmother on Monday and we visited when I went home. She lives with 3 immune compromised people. I could potentially have spread it to them. I havenâ€™t had a mother figure at all so my grandma and those 3 others were basically my role models. The fact that they could have the virus because of me will haunt me. All of them will most certainly be dead if they do come i to contact with it. I live with my dad to and so he would be getting it too. Thankfully I am getting tested as of tomorrow morning first thing.

Thank you for reading and sorry if this seemed kind of scattered Iâ€™m not the best with writing lol
