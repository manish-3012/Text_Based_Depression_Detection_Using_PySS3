Things to know about Florida As a person who has lived in Florida my entire life I would like to say a few things about it.

 IT FUCKING SUCKS ASS

If you want to sweat your ass of all day and basically  become a human humidifier, come down to florida! 

Oh, you don't live in Orlando or Miami? WELL THEN I GUESS WE'RE JUST GONNA SHOVE A BUNCH OF HOTELS IN YOUR LITTLE TOWN/CITY AS A PIT STOP FOR TOURISTS!

Also we may be know for our tourist attractions and Florida man headlines but we have another fun secret down here. KARENS ARE FUCKING EVERYWHERE! you can't escape them, its impossible  I've tried over and over but to no avail, and it doesn't help when their unvaxinated troglodyte of a child who lookes more like Jeff Goldblum in the fly (look it up if you don't know) than an actual child start bitching because they didn't get a new toy and start screaming so loud that the sound alone can kill any living creature with a 5 mile radius. 

ALSO try driving next to the fuckers. They drive worse than my blind 93 year old grandmother while she's on acid. AND THATS NOT EVEN THE WORST PART! If you try to pass this monster in her 2005 Honda Passport FOR A SINGLE SECOND she will hunt you down to the ends of fucking earth.

I hope you enjoyed my information about Florida (if you have any serious questions or some meme questions about Florida that you would like to ask, I would happily respond)
