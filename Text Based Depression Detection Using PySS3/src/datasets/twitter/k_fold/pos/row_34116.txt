Hey guys! I'm no longer suicidal! For the last while, I've been having suicidal thoughts. Makes sense if your in my shoes, I just started a new high school after corona, and I get loads of work and my parents have wayy to high expectations. But, earlier today, I thought of my reasons for living, and I decided to make a couple of goals. Now that I have goals that I will try to achieve, I no longer want to kill my self, and I also find that I get dint get bored as easily. 

So, if your in a bad place, set some goals for you to achieve. It really helps.
