Classmates can be horrible I have a classmate named Steven. He is "the president of the class". Now, a president should do everything it takes to guide his people, and for the most part he did, but he is just a total ass. He plays the popular kid card, the dude who always has cool clothes and thinks spending his entire allowance on sneakers is a good idea, the dude who acts nice around teachers and then curses them with the other classmates. He thinks he is Roosevelt when he actually is Sid from Toy Story.
He is annoying and I usually just ignore him. But I finally saw the worst of him a week ago. Another classmate (who is transgender, it will be important to the story later) told me this: Steven invited him to come to the park and then told him that he will use the money from the class budget to buy himself nice things and he said this to him because he is the transgender kid and no one will believe him.
   I also found out that he is a full Trump supporter that doesn't judge Trump in any way. 
   And then there is the way he treats my classmates.
He considers my friend Vlad annoying even though Vlad only tries to be friendly, blackmails another kid into giving him anything he needs (pens, crayons, rulers, paper for painting) by threatening to not help him with the History tests, pushes people while playing Soccer, is pretty aggressive and hits hard, will use the harshest of words if you don't like Metallica and worst of all..... Slaps the girl's asses. And they still find him the best choice in a relationship. Better than the boys who stood up to him everytime he slapped ass.
So, what have we learned? That there are kids who only have friends because they are popular and those friends don't give a f*** if they get hurt emotionally or phisically, because there sure isn't any other friend group they can attach themselves to.
