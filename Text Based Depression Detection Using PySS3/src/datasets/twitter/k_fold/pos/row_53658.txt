I'm Going Back to School So basically today was the last day of the third quarter and my parents really wanted me to go to school in-person instead of virtual for the rest of the year. I guess they think it's slightly safer for me since all the vaccine distributions. I also moved over the summer and attended a new HS virtually for the entire year, so I don't know anyone well and honestly I'm kind of nervous especially after being indoors and only socializing with my family for the past few months. For anyone who has gone to school in person this year, what were some changes in school ever since the pandemic? Also next week will technically my first day of high school, so what are some things I should know before?
