Online friends were the biggest mistake ever. I donâ€™t hate them at all. I actually extremely miss my past and the fun I had with them. I just really wish I could go back to it but I canâ€™t fit in. I never shouldâ€™ve gotten so close. I shouldâ€™ve stuck to my irl friends. And yes this is related to my last post.
