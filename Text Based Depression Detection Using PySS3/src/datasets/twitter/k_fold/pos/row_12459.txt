This makes me wonder if time travel exists. 

So basically i was looking at Google Trends for VR headsets (and the snapdragon xr2 for some reason) anyway there was less than 1 in HTC Vive in Jan-June 2009. What the fuck? Oh and the Oculus Quest 2 was searched in DECEMBER 2012, thatâ€™s a bit more specific of a search than HTC Vive, in 2013 the Oculus Rift S was also searched. So, who the fuck do you think searched these and why?
