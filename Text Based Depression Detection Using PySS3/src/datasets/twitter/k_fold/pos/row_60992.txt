Men could be raped OK I'm an 18 years student and one day I was walking to school when a saw a 30 years old~man  in his car staring at me, he stopped besides me and and asked me about a place - I felt it was weird cause It's a very known place and I'm unlike him a foreign- I just told him and he thanked then he asked about my destination I also told him and then he said that it's on his way he can give a ride I said no but he insisted and under the pressure my anti-social ass agreed it was all fine until he started flirting with me saying I'm so cute and stuff then he touched my hand saying that he gonna teach me how to drive, I was so nervous and thought that I'm going to be raped but fortunately when I told him that I arrived (I lied) he stopped and let me go, Almost 2 months after that I was heading home after being at beach with the boys and an ancient man stopped me and asked me about the time, I just showed him my phone but he said that he can't see and asked me to say it, OK that makes sense I told it's 10:00 pm and walked just to realize he is walking as the same rate as mine then he started asking me if I want a job I said no I'm a very busy student then he said ur a handsome boy, I started panicking but I just said thanks, I was heading to the bus station and I started walking quickly so I can run away from him I finally arrived to the bus station and of course he never left me alone and my mofo bus didn't want to come the man started flirting so badly looking at my chest and that the cringest thing ever happened to me he started grabbing my arm the he touched my chest for a second acting it's just a part of his body language, I was sweating and took the first bus I saw coming.
