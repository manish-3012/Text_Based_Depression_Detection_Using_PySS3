Son wanted to try new underwear.. kids are weird! I (f35) thought itâ€™d be funny to let yâ€™all know that I gave my 8yo son $100 to spend on amazon for clothes a while back and about an hour into shopping he brings my laptop into the kitchen and says â€œcan I get these instead of regular underwear?â€.. I looked and he really found boys thong underwear on some weird website and wanted me to buy it ðŸ˜‚ I thought he was joking at first but he wasnâ€™t so I told him I KNEW he wasnâ€™t going to like having underwear up his butt crack.. but he still wanted them so I made a deal with him and said â€œ okay Iâ€™ll order them but if you end up not liking them you have to wear one around the house with nothing else on for an entire day because we canâ€™t return those..â€
(He has no problem wearing briefs around the house but has never done it for more than a few minutes lol) He was a hundred percent sure he was going to love this underwear....
Several days later and you know what he doesnâ€™t like? ...The underwear we ordered!!! He just wanted to throw $$$ away apparently!!
But now he really thinks Iâ€™m gonna make him wear one around the house and Iâ€™m loving every minute of it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’•
*I wasnâ€™t serious but should I make him go through with his end of the deal?? ðŸ¤·ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸

The funniest thing to do would be to let you guys decide! ðŸ’€
My daughter is 16 and told me to post here instead of Facebook.
