I'm 17(M) and my school found out about my foot fetish back in 9th grade and things still haven't changed  so back in 9th grade my school found out about my foot fetish and things have not been the same since I thought people will forget by the end of 9th grade but to be honest they didn't well I guess it make sense we only have 80 kids per grade level but this also affected my good friends they all drifted away from me and I've basically turned into a person who is friendly to everyone but with no actual friend group. I don't get bullied or anything but at least once a day in class someone says who hey what's up and my name and something about feet most girls in my grade blocked me on Instagram I don't really care about that as much but it makes me upset everyone thinks I'm a freak and now I'm a junior with junior prom coming up no one to go with and most people don't understand me calling me a creep and two girls think I'm a pedo and shit and with most people I am a background friend with no real friend group I don't know what to do any help would be appreciated
