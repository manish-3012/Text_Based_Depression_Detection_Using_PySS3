Am crying badly in my bed now for the past half hour. So a guy just told me im a complete asshole and piece of shit. It sucks. now that i look back on my texts, my social interactions and everything i realize hes totally right.
uts like i just dont know what im saying in the moment. im just a really big annoying piece of shit.
i just wish the world didnt have other people in it. just me, with no possibilities of me being shitty to someone.
And the moment you realize youre the shitty person not others, is just mentally horrible. 

I hope you others are nicer then me
