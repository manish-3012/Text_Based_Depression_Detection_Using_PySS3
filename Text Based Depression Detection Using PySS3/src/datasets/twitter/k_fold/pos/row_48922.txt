I miss my best friend In July my best friend and I had a disagreement and she said she thought I could be very rude and judgmental. Some other stuff was said between the 2 of us and we stopped talking for like 3 weeks but then we started talking again. Then I said something about not wanting my insta profile pic to be of me because I watched this messed up movie but then I decided it wasn't worth hiding my face cause it's not that big a deal everyone almost makes their profile pic of their face. She brought up me changing the pic and I explained that to her but she proceeded to question the logic I'd already explained. So I was kind of annoyed but we moved on. Then I said something about some guy I liked and started talking about him more, but I mentioned something about him that would've made it harder for us to get together then I started thinking ugh what chance do I have with him anyway this is ridiculous so I started backtracking on my previous messages. She got kind of annoyed with me, started saying how I always like some new guy every few months and she doesn't know how to respond. She's right and it was humiliating so I decided to just acknowledge it to not start another issue, so that's what I did and she left me on read. This was a little over 3 weeks ago and we haven't spoken since. So I mean I just miss my best friend. Idk what happened between us because we'd be getting into little quarrels like the insta profile pic thing since February but we never stopped talking. I don't even think I feel like talking to her right now but I'm just sad over it. You don't know anyone else like you know your best friend. I also only saw people my age twice since March so that definitely isn't helping.
