So I'm about a week free from porn/masterbation This is the second time I've seriously tried to do this the first time I went a month without masterbation and three and a half months without porn. Sadly the streak came to an end when I was in a really bad place after my girlfriend broke up with me. If anyone wants to talk to me about it or needs advice, I'll answer as many comments as a can. If you don't feel comfortable commenting dm me.
