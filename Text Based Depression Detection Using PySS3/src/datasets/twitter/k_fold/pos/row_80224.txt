I need help So there was this girl that I really liked. Like a lot. We dated for a few days until just recently. See Iâ€™m a sophomore in high school, and this girl is in 8th grade, but the thing is, Iâ€™m just now finding out about this. She had lied to me and said that she was a freshman because she knew that I wouldâ€™ve never dated an 8th grader. Now, I really like this girl and sheâ€™s only one year younger than me, but at the same time I donâ€™t want to be known as the weirdo who dates middle schoolers. AND she lied to me. Idk what to do and I already broke up with her for it... but I didnâ€™t really want to. I just wouldnâ€™t feel comfortable dating an 8th grader. I want to know what the best decision would be for this.
