i feel like i act too masculine disclaimer : thereâ€™s obviously NOTHING wrong with being masculine, but imo i wish i was more feminine ðŸ¥²

today in gym class, while we were playing rugby in the snow outside, i tackled this guy really hard (he was fine) and i was really proud of myself and hyped up so i jumped around screaming shit like â€œletâ€™s gooooâ€ and slapped my chest and stuff and this girl imitated me with caveman-like movements and a deep ass voice. i guess my reaction looked kinda manly but likeâ€¦??? 

it didnt really hurt me but it made me feel more self conscious about the fact that i barely ever naturally act feminine and i hate it. i always feel like iâ€™m too masculine for a girl and it fucking sucks. thanks for that valerie. suck a dick ðŸ¤ this whole thing is so dumb bye
