I hate having empathetic friends. Letting myself be me is inherently harmful for them, but they're so nice. And I keep using them as an therapist and dropping all my problems in their DMs. Why am I such a piece of shit. And how understanding they are forces me to drop my mask, and all the parts of my personality I hate shine through. Fuck
