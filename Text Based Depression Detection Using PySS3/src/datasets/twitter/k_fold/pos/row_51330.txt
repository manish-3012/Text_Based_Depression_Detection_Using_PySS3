Sad Cringe So I started talking to this girl on Houseparty (Itâ€™s like a FaceTime app). See I was going for her because my friend was and he threatened to beat me up if I talked to her. So I talked to her. I was hinting that I wanted to text her. I gave her my number and she didnâ€™t text me. ITS THE MOST OBVIOUS HINT EVER. I feel sad.
