Majority of Reddit shits on anti-maskers, right? Well, if you're still a minor living with your parents who are anti-maskers, it sucks. My parents already dislike me more than the rest of my siblings, and if I were to try to wear a mask they would want to disown me and crap\*. When people hard shit on anti-maskers [kinda like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/klvgoo/wear_a_mask_kids/), it just kinda sucks that I don't really have a choice, but I'm lumped into that same group of people.  


\*If you don't believe me, it's because you haven't met my parents.
