I need advice and didn't know who to ask, maybe you guys can help me Okay, I don't know if that belongs here, but I don't know where else, so I just hope that won't get deleted or something. 
So, a few days ago, the date of my birthday, a friend of mine lost her brother because of a car accident. She told me about it and I talked to her for a while this evening. But she didn't seem very sad or desperate. Now I don't know how to react to this. Is this a self defense mechanism or does she just not realise what happened yet? What should I do? I'm there for her if she needs help but she didn't asked for help yet. And I can't presume, that she's just pretending to be okay, because she would tell me, that I'm wrong and that she's fine. 
So is there anything more I can do, than I'm already doing? Or what would you do? I'm confused and very scared. 


Also, sorry for my poor English, I'm not a native speaker.
