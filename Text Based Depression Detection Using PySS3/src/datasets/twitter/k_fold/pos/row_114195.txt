I. Hate. Wasps. I guess you can call this a rant.

I hate the little devils. There is literally no such thing as a good wasp. Little buggers can burn in hell for all I care.

I have reasons too.

Alongside all the other shit things that happened in 2020, there were GIANT ASIAN GODDAMN MURDER HORNETS. Fiery little crapsacks killing all those buzzy friends that are bees.

They sting like they don't give an actual frick how much pain they're putting you in. Did you offend them? Of course not.

They love sugar. Eating an apple outside in summer? You've already got 3 wasps chasing you down the street. Popsicle? Lil' stingers go mad for that stuff and would murder you to get at it.

THEY NEVER LEAVE YOUR HOUSE. When one gets in your house they will never leave. You open every window in the house and cower in the cupboard? They just sit on the windowsill rather than leaving.

TLDR: SCREW WASPS
