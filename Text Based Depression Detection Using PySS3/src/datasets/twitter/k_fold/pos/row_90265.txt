i just finished my geometry summer work, so now i get into algebra 2 in my sophomore year! I FINISHED MY FUCKING GEOMETRY LFG

i'd like to thank a couple people for how far i've come.

first of all, u/-iia, who's consideration and kind heart gave me strength and motivation. she was there for me when no one else could be, and that could even be said outside of this. so if you're reading this: i cannot thank you enough for everything you've done for me.

second, u/miky0ni. the same i've said for -iia could be said for you, because you were an amazing friend and source of motivation as well, not to mention you cheered me up when shit got stressful.

i am getting into algebra 2 this year as a sophomore because of my newfound motivation mostly thanks to these 2 gentle souls. my gratitude is immeasurable, and i cant imagine where i'd have gone without them. there are reasons i call you my best friends, and it's times like this where you really shine as some of the most amazing friends to grace this earth. thank you so much.
