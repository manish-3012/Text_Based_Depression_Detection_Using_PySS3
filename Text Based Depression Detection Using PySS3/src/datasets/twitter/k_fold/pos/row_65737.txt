anyone else feel like their parents donâ€™t care anymore lol iâ€™m the youngest by a lot so by the time i hit puberty both my siblings were in/graduated college. it feels like my parents forgot they still have a kid. i see my dad maybe one day a week before midnight and my mom just. doesnâ€™t do anything. she hasnâ€™t gone grocery shopping in a month and weâ€™ve had either takeout or something out of a box for the last however long . like shit, i know iâ€™m an independent personality but i am also still a kid who canâ€™t drive and canâ€™t cook and still needs guidance. 

itâ€™s gotten better since my mom has been home more (so i donâ€™t have to balance school, pets, and making dinner) but i feel it was almost better that way so i was guaranteed a decent meal at least during the week. 

itâ€™s such a stupid complaint and i probably sound spoiled but i just. want to be able to live as a kid without worrying about everything
