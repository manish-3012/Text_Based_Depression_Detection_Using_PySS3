Maybe this is weird but I'm not looking forward to my birthday, It's in a few days. Like idrc about it. Maybe it's because I'm getting older n' stuff but like, I've also had to put about more than half of my money into my own birthday present, which was a laptop cuz I needed it for school and my last one broke. like I'm not trying to be greedy but yeah. It's not all about that anyways, but I just don't think I'll have much fun, idek if my dad will remember it's my bday. 

It will be my 16th and idk, I guess I'm just feeling kinda down about it..
