Iâ€™ve run into quite the predicament....(why so fancy? Idk) Hi teens of reddit I kind of pressed a self destruct button on a timeline GROUP project. My class was using this program called Sutori for this timeline project. I was making last minute edits and final touches when I accidentally pressed delete, there was no â€œhey you sure you want to delete this?â€ Button.... I checked and it wasnâ€™t trashed so I can bring it back. Nope none of that. It was deleted from the face of the internet. And I donâ€™t have the guts to message my group mates about it so here I am. Currently sending a message to my teacher in all hopes he already looked at it.... Moral of story? Do not let me be the admin of the doc T-T
