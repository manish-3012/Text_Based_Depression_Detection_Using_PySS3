Being 18 sucks but at least I can about the possibility that I can have sex with adults now fuck my life I donâ€™t wanna think about the future uggggh.

I just wish that being an adult was an immediate shift and not like a slow progression. Iâ€™m gonna fucking shit my pants when I graduate holy shit. What the hell fo I do?

I donâ€™t have any college picked out and I donâ€™t know what I want to go to school for. 

Can someone old offer me some comfort what the fuck is gonna happen? I am terrified
