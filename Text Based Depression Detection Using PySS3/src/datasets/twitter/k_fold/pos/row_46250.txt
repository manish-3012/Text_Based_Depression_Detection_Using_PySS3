I *almost* made a friend So we're building trebuchets in engineering class in the woodshop, and there are a couple tables for everyone and most people have partners except like me and this one girl who also is working at my table. But she's been slow on her project, and took a while to even get plans while I'm over here already putting shit together. So she glanced over at my work a bit and I asked her how she's doing. Seems like a nice person, doesn't talk much. A lot of it was me talking out load and she laughed a few times. So maybe I can make a friend. But probably not because Christmas Break and then she won't be in my class.
