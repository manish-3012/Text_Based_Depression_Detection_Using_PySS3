Welp my mom just made me feel very invalidated (not on purpose) So I had a psychological assessment done earlier this month after I started therapy after my parents found out I self harmed

And the reports came so me and my mom were going through coz my therapist told me to

And my mom's all like,oh this is common,oh this is nothing to worry about
And on every para was either like oh this isn't you,or oh this isn't that bad,or said it was very common

Then at the end it stated I had depression, anxeity,social anxeity,anger issues and a few other stuff


And then she's like,oh but I'm pretty sure 60% of the teenagers would fall in the same category


Probably gonna relapse in a bit idk,fuck
