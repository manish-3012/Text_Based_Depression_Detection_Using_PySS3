Just my luck So I meet a girl, friend of a friend. And you know me and her kinda hit it off, and I catch feelings naturally. After heavy debate with myself I decided I wanna push it. So I tell her, after a painstakingly long day (she is the type of person to not check her phone often enough, kinda sucks), she responded. And honestly still kinda confused but I understood it I guess. She says that itâ€™s not that she doesnâ€™t like me, but she does. But sheâ€™s not sure if she fully does? We only ever really talked before over the phone and FaceTime. Sheâ€™s worried about how we never actually interacted in real life, that we could be different people? So just my luck I guess, finally getting the balls to ask a girl out, finding out she likes me yet not getting a straight answer. And I canâ€™t see her irl, not yet at least, itâ€™s what she wants from what I can tell, sadly I cannot deliver.
