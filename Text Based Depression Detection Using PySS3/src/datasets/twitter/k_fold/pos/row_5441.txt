My brother called me a meanie. This was my payback First, i deleted his Minecraft world heâ€™s been working on since age 11 (currently 17). Heâ€™s also gotten accepted into multiple top IV schools, so naturally I posted racist comments on his social media accounts (I got his password). I also blamed him for the murder of multiple small children.

I hope you learn your lesson!
