what do you guys think about divorce after having a child? divorce is completely fine because people change and stuff happens, but what about divorce after having a child? when you break up before having a child it doesn't matter much because no one is affected (or only the two people who made the decision are affected) but after having a child there's a person that will be affected, at least mentally. is it be fine to divorce after having a child?

P.S. this I am NOT against or for the topic, this is just a discussion, I do not have any (I do but I'm not willing to share it) opinion on it, and this post isn't against or for the idea

I simply don't know where to post this, so I decided to post here
