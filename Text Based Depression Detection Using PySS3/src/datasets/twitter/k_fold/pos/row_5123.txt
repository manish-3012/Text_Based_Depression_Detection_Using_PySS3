why is literally every girl at my school either bi or lesbian i swear i haven't seen a SINGLE straight girl in there and this is quite concerning. there's so many of them, it can't be real. and i know i sound like a bitch saying this, but seems like a lot of them are just pretending so they can stay relevant.

bruh
