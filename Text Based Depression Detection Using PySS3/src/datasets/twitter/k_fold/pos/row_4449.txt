idk it's 1am so have some verbal throw up i get new glasses tomorrow with round frames so maybe i'll look less like a dork or yknow i could end up looking like a pedophile who knows 

also we had to rehome my puppy a couple days ago and i miss her so much she was a good dog until she wasn't

i still miss my girlfriend if she's even still my girlfriend i have no clue honestly

i'm listening to the punk band Crass right now and they're good and for some reason my mood right now is between "listen to girl in red and cry" and "go out and kill some cops and pedophiles" 

if i listen to girl in red and i'm a guy does that make me an honorary lesbian 

on a nostalgia trip i looked up my old internet friends on quora and one of them who still is on reddit and now i feel sad bleh

i add chocolate syrup to my hot chocolate because consume sugar 

my ex girlfriend from two or three years ago lives right behind me and her house has a trump flag out so ew pretty sure i dodged a bullet with her honestly 

anyways don't know what this is good night
