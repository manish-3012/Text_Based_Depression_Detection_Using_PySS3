Who are you? This shouldnt be some kind of philosophical wanna be deep post, I was just thinking about it recently.
Who are you?
Are you yourself when talking to your family?
Are you yourself when having fun with friends?
Are you yourself when youre crying alone in your room?
Who are you really?
Are you someone different every time you talk to different people?
Are you yourself when posting a comment on the internet?
What are we?
Thank you for comming to my Ted talk
