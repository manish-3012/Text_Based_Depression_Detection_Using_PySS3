Some things I feel like people need to know Gender is scientifically a spectrum; ask any scientist. There's no specific number of genders. 

Trans-women who start medically transitioning early have little to no advantage in sports.

Even if trans people are "against your religion", unless you completely ignore science, you still have to accept that they exist and can't change, and all you can do is accept it.

Sex is also scientifically a spectrum (there isn't just XX and XY, there are up to 8 combinations of chromosomes found in people, like XXY, XXXY, and more.) Plus, the people who fit outside of being physically male and female aren't even rare, it is 2% of the population, the same amount of people with red hair or green eyes.

Sure, you can have your own opinion, but if it's actively hurting someone or a group of people then it really can't be considered one anymore. 

Just because you have free speech doesn't mean you're free from consequence.
