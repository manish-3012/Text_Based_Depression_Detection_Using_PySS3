I shared a couple songs I made a few days ago, and people seemed to like them. So here's another one that I finished today. I tried out a different style with this song, so it sounds completely different from anything else I've made. I like how this one turned out though, so I might make similar styled songs in the future.

Btw, I hate being a beg and shit, but I'd appreciate a subscription or a like at the least. Small stuff like that really helps me build traction.
