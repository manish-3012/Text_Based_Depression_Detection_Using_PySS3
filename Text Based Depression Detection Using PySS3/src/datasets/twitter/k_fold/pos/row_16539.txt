Guys someone really wants to be my friend on discord I guess So for 2 weeks Iâ€™ve been getting a friend request of random accounts on discord... I keep blocking but I think itâ€™s very annoying to keep doing that...  Itâ€™s a random name, sometimes a random letter and then a random number... They donâ€™t have a profile picture so I guess itâ€™s a bit maybe but what do I do?
