Hey guys, I listened to your feedback about my site, and Iâ€™d like to show you guys the improvements :) BTW Thanks for being a supportive community!  

Hey guys, a few days ago, I posted here showing you guys my site which I had been working on, and it was met with positive feedback. It really made my day, so I decided to work on the site more. Now, I have completely revamped the theme and UI, and I would like your guysâ€™ honest feedback on it.  Oh and I added and contact me page for more feedback! Thanks for all of the support, as this subreddit was a big motivation to keep working on it.

The link to the site is [https://riggedcoinflip.com](https://riggedcoinflip.com/) if you guys want to check it out. Any feedback is welcome, and like last time, make sure to have a nice day!
