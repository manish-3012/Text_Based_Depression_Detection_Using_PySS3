My friend group is the most toxic place Iâ€™ve ever been but theyâ€™re all I have Day after day I just get slammed with the most hurtful shit Iâ€™ve ever heard, calling me trash at games that I started playing a week ago, scolding me for speaking, telling me to shut up every 3 seconds. Now I know every friend group has that one kid everyone picks on, but Iâ€™m tired of it. And for some reason, whenever I say I canâ€™t play, they go apeshit for the dumbest reason. I have a question for you guys. What do you usually do when youâ€™re tired? Most probably would say go to bed. So thatâ€™s what I did. I was tired and went to bed. The next morning I was bombarded with texts about how Iâ€™m a pussy for wanting to sleep instead of â€œgaming with the boysâ€. They expect me to play every day, and when I canâ€™t I get verbally harassed for the dumbest reasons. But if Iâ€™m being honest, I donâ€™t have any other friend group. Sure, I have other friends, but not a group. I just canâ€™t take this anymore, theyâ€™re suffocating. What should I do?
