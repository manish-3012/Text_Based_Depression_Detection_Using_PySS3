I've been doing better at socialising After a bit of encouragement from my friends and teachers I've started trying to talk to my classmates more.

It's scary but I feel I'm making progress. They aren't bad people or anything, some of them are really cool actually. But I just feel like I'm intruding every time I talk. It sucks but I'm working on it. I'm proud of myself for the effort.
