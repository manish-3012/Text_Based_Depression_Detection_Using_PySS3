Saying hi and reminding you to drink water every day till I get a girlfriend (THE END!!!) Day 244 **(Final)**

Hi everyone... So today is the last day I'll be posting because I got myself a girlfriend. When I started I didn't think things would go like they did, but now we're here, and I'll have to stop. I don't know what I'll do now, I didn't think this far, but I'm sure I'll think of something.

Anyways, for one final time, remember to drink some water and stay hydrated... especially now that I won't be around.

**Some quick stats**

It has taken me 8 months and 1 day

I've gained 99 followers

and you should have drunk 488 litres of water
