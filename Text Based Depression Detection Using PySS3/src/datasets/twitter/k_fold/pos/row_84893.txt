Can't fucking stand my parents' controlling nature anymore I just finished my UG entrance a few days ago. I'm 18 now and I have never been allowed to go out with friends ever in my life, making me a socially awkward person. Today when I turned 18, I thought things would change. I had a date with this girl, but guess what? My parents forbade me from going out, stating I'm not "mature" enough to go out, though I used to travel far for my tutions. I just can't take this shit anymore. I'm tired of being treated like a child then blamed about not behaving like an adult. And I fucking hate it when they control me and everything in my life. Can't wait to leave this house, but I'll probably get in a nearby college so no hostel.

Thanks for your time.
