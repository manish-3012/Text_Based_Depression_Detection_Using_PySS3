Remember that time when Preschool and Kindergarden Teachers promoted straight up vore? I remember that time when my Kindergarden Teacher would sing â€œThere was an old lady who shallowed a fly.â€ The old lady basically just shallowed up a fly, a spider, a bird, a cat, a dog, a cow, and a horse and then fucking exploded. What the fuck were they teaching?
