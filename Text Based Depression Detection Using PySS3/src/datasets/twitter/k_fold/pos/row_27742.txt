I hate my school. A few kids in my school were using their phones to talk about "inappropriate things" (probably swears lol) and meet up in different parts of the school. Now they have banned literally everyone from using devices in school. This includes lunch and bus call. This shit is so stupid. Just have the teachers of those kids make sure they aren't using devices. It's also bullshit because the district has BYOD (bring your own device) rule. It says that students can use their devices outside of classes (lunch, bus call, homeroom, etc) and during classes if the teacher gives permission you can use them for educational reasons. 

tl;dr school made a bullshit rule that bans all phones
