Ugh why is my sister so cute Like come on, how is she so cute to the point that she doesn't leave my mind? She just is too lovely and it's almost frightening at this point.

Maybe I have biases because I mostly have only good memories of her or that she kind of looks like me and I fucking love myself. 

She doesn't live with me anymore because she left home for university so maybe the separation is why I'm having constant thoughts about her. 

Anyways, I love her so much and I miss her :(
