So guys what do i do I could've had a gf a year ago, but she lives far from here so we decided to not to get in a relationship. We haven't texted/talked since that. Today is her birthday, so i texted happy birthday to her. I want to talk to her because i am dumb and i cant let her go. I know what i would be talking about with her (i have it all planned, its a bit creepy i know lol), but i dont want to make her unconfortable by texting her. Any advice?
