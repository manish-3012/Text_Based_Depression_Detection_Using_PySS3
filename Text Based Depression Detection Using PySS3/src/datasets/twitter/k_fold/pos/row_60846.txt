I've lost most of my friends and don't know what to do? -I'm 18f and I'm on my gap year, finished college this year.
-I started getting left out of my group over summer because I'm an essential worker so I'd have to work and they'd all meet up.
-I live by myself (sort of - my dad works 12hours a day so I'm always alone)


My friend killed himself in September so that made me really depressed as he lived abroad. I didn't get out of bed for days and had no energy to go on my phone. I got asked "are you OK? You can measage me about it" once by one of the girls in the group, friend 1. Its now almost December and none of them measage me, unless it's to use me for my car. A few went to uni and the others work full time, which I understand but they literally go on Snapchat and ignore my measages for hours but are active on snap maps not long ago.

Friend 1 was my closest but I introduced her to a boy and now they're dating. It's her first boyfriend. She doesn't even tell me if they've kissed. She ignores my measages the most but is active. I always have to ask to meet (before lockdown) but always got denied, always asked to facetime but got denied etc. We met 3 times when restrictions got lifted but that's it. She can meet her bf tho. I've had one of the worst years of my life, my mother moved abroad, my boyfriend doesn't live close, my friend died. 

I just feel so lonley. I don't know what to do anymore. I have 2 other good friends that I talk too but this whole situation makes me feel sad.
