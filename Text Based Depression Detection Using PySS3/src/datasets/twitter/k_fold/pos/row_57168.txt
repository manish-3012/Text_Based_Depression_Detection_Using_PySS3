Difficult 14 year old! My 14 y/o brother in law is pretty difficult teenager. He is raised my single mother, his sister and I live far away and I canâ€™t be in his life as after figure much. Meanwhile he is driving crazy his mother.

He is 14, his GF 15 and they started having sex, not using condoms or anything, no to condoms because it  doesnâ€™t feel good. Issue is GFâ€™s parents allowing them have sex in their home, mother in law doesnâ€™t allow it. Therefore he runs off to them every night. 

Itâ€™s really irresponsible for her parents to allow this to happen in their home, most of the time they are gone as well. Can we do something from legal standpoint to stop this from happening?

I donâ€™t want her to get pregnant or her to accuse him of epar perhaps, shit is crazy nowadays and no one can be trusted.
