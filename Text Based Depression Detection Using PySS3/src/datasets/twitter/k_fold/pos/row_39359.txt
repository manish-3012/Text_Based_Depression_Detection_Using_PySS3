how to tell if sheâ€™s flirting as a joke/platonically or seriously?? iâ€™ve been talking to this one girl for a little bit, and she treats me like a friend would, but we flirt a lot. even though a lot of itâ€™s just through memes, itâ€™s still flirting. i dont know whether or not i should â€œpushâ€ further, or how iâ€™d do that if i wanted to?
