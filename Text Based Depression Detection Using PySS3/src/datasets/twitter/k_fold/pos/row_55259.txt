This subreddit is a giant Circle jerk So if you are early offended and like to defend this sub then don't read this or do i will have fun reading your comment
 Literally anything gets to the front page such as

someone complaining about school 


someone complaining about there parents

 
Someone complaining about how they don't have a girlfriend or boyfriend 


Someone using the death of some kid to get on the front page 

 
Someone talking about anime 


Someone who drew art  which can be good but ruined by shit titles


Someone posting a video of them doing fucking push-ups everyday 



Someone posting a fake story to get on the front page

And I know on the comments will be the defenders who will say ThEn sTop LooKiNg AT tHe SUb tHEN and NoOne Is fOrCINg YOu tO lOokAt It because they cant take criticism on anything
