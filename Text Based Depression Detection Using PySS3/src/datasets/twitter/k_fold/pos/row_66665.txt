Anyone wish they could restart high school over I feel like i wasted 4 years being an asocial loser.. i finally figured it out socially the month i graduated so i at least had some "typical teen" memories like partying n shit like that, but i feel like i wasted 4 years just bein a loser when i couldve been partying, having sex/relationships, playing sports, etc. Reason it took me so long to become social cuz I wasnt diagnosed with adhd until last year and wasnt receiving adderall until then. It really sucks cuz I coulda joined the basketball team as a freshmen and became popular since i recently found out im really good at basketball, but no i was lazy and unmotivated so i just ended up being a quiet gross smelly guy who ppl thought was a school shooter
