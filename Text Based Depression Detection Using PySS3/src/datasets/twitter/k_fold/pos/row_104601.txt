Let me just rant for a minute- I don't get it. You ask me out, I say yes because I have a hard time saying no, and now not even an hour passed and you're all over with other females. It makes no sense. And for everyone! Me coming to you with very intrusive thoughts isn't an excuse for you to go cheat on me! I'm really stuck here. I've been in such shitty relationships, now my trust issues are like, really big! I feel like I'm not enough for those who I've been with. And who I'm currently with. I'm ready to just I don't know. I'm sorry for this, I just needed to let my weird anger out.
