You gotta love this constant alone and shit feeling I wake up and get excited. I hope I got a message from someone. Possibly an, "I missed you" or, "Yesterday was nice, we should talk/hangout more." maybe even, "Are you fine, you sound unhappy." (That part just randomly asked, don't go into my dms and put that, it means nothing if forced. This goes along with the rest of that.). I wish I could could just wake up and be happy. I wanna wake up and have someone to talk to, maybe someone to cuddle with, or even just greet and make sure I'm alive. That's be great.
