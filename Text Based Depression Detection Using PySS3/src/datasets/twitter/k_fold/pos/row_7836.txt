Things You Don't Learn In School: What Exactly Is The FAFSA FAFSA â€“ Federal Application for Student Aid. Financial Aid is composed of grants, scholarships, work-study jobs, and federally backed student loans (donâ€™t take out loans!) 

To start filling out the 2021-2022 FAFSA, youâ€™ll need some document like: 

â€¢ Previous yearâ€™s tax return along with a W2 or 1099 (if your parents are contractors) â€¢ Bank and investment statements to show the dollar value of your assets 

â€¢ Records of untaxed income (i.e. child support) 

â€¢ Bank and investment statements showing your net worth FAFSA Deadlines â€“ Big Picture, the absolute final deadline to submit the FAFSA is the June prior to the start of a school year, but each state and college will have their own deadline requirements so understand what those are, many are months earlier! 

Your potential aid is calculated by: 

â€¢ Taking the cost of attendance (COA) 

â€¢ Estimating your expected family contribution (EFC) 

â€¢ Subtract the COA from your EFC
