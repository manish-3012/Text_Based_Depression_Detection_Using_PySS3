Guys, idk what to do. I was cleaning my mom and sisters bathroom and I pulled the bag out of the trash can and there was a bug that ran out of the bottom of the can. I wasn't too worried until I saw a second one come out. I can't figure out what it was and I didn't have my phone with me to take a picture. I didn't recognize what bug it was. It had like two pinchers on its asshole. I know that sounds funny but it's true. What should I do? Just spray the bathroom with febreeze? Or just pour some bleach on the floor and let it envelope the bathroom.

I'm thinking febreeze will scare them away, cause maybe my mom and sisters bathroom has girl smells that the bugs like. I didn't smell anything. I just don't know man. I don't want bugs in my house
