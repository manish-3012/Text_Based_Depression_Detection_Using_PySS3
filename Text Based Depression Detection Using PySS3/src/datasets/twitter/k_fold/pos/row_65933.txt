People donâ€™t seem to talk about how much damage the Black Lives Matter rioters have done to this nation. Yes, Black Lives do indeed matter, but do these people seriously need to do this just to say that?

What fucking happened? The police killed one person, IN FUCKING MAY. Yes, that was a terrible act for on the police, but GEORGE FLOYD GOT JUSTICE. The cops that were involved in the killing were arrested for 2nd degree murder. And these people do this. Cars have been destroyed, buildings have been lit on fire, people heave died, etc etc. Iâ€™d BET you that in the 4 months it was happening, the protesters/rioters killed more black people than the cops have. Notice how the states where the protests were really bad, COVID-19 has hotspots in? Yeah, thatâ€™s a lot the protesters fault. People are leaving their own country into a country with a possibly more corrupt government for their own safety.these people are fucking unforgiving fucking assholes that I hate with every cell of my goddamned body.
