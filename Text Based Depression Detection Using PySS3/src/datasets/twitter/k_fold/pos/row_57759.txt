Iâ€™m in a 6 month relationship and need some help. So I just hit the 6 month mark with my girlfriend yesterday and we both got really exited. However bc of quarantine weâ€™ve only been able to trade/ FaceTime yk? So she is getting really serious and wants to progress once COVID is over and Iâ€™m not ready for having s3x yet. It against my religion and Iâ€™m just not comfortable with it if that makes sense. She thinks I want to and I feel like itâ€™s making my lose feelings and become uninterested. I really donâ€™t want to hurt her but I want to stay true to myself. Any thoughts?
