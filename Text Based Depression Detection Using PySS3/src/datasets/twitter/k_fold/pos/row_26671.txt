As of life could get better So I really liked this girl in my class and she liked me to back and were both 15 and we have been friends since middle school and she has been talking about other guys and stuff she still showed affection then boom 3 days ago she comes  and tells me she's non-binary and I just was giving her words of inspiration. She still shows affection and now she is telling me that she is she wants a tall boy with big pp and deep voice and I only have one of those things 
Big pp (5.7 inch), what the fuck should I do. I want her to date me but what should I do.
