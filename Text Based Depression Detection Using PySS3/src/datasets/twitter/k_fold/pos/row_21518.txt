I miss being around people and having conversations that flowed really well That happens really rarely for me and Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s because I canâ€™t hold a conversation 

I just feel too tense now when I talk to people and I can tell they arenâ€™t comfortable either

Even with people that Iâ€™m sort of â€œcloseâ€ to, the words just donâ€™t come out smoothly. I donâ€™t wanna talk if I have to think that much if that makes sense. If weâ€™re not comfortable and we have to force the conversation then I donâ€™t see the point.

It might sound stupid bc if you like someone then you should be willing to work a little to talk to them. I feel like if we really did get along then this wouldnâ€™t even be an issue. It canâ€™t just be my responsibility to talk u know
