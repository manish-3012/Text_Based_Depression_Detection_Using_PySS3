Please, help me. So hereâ€™s the deal. 

Yesterday my mom and I where having breakfast in the table when she told me that she has had a headache since Friday (imma make a quick stop here to say that literally every single day she is sick of something. And I donâ€™t know what to do since my father, well heâ€™s not with us.) and I brought up the fact that sheâ€™s always sick. 

BIG MISTAKE.

She went full defensive telling me that if sheâ€™s a pain to me then she wonâ€™t tell me shit about her aches and pains. 

She then just picked up her food plate from the table and rushed to her room before I could tell her a single word. I mean, I tried to tell her that I did not mean that but she did not seem to listen. 

Iâ€™ve been depressed because I canâ€™t figure out what I did wrong.  Because sheâ€™s still mad at me and I canâ€™t figure out what did I say wrong. 

So hereâ€™s the why to why did I post this here. 

I would greatly appreciate that the crowd here can help me to figure out what did I do wrong. 

tl;dr: No. read the whole thing I canâ€™t summarize this. 

Also sorry if My English is bad.
