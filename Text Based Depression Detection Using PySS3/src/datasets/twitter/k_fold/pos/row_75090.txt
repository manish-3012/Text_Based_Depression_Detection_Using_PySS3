Update: I made fuckin bagels I made one with liverwurst and toasted it and one with pb and plain.
Preferred it toasted. If you havenâ€™t had a bagel 10/10 do recommend other Than the fact it cost 3 dollars for 4 bagels. When I can get a loaf of bread for 2 bucks. 
Like Thicc bread essentially but with a light sweetness to the dough, and toasted was nice cuz it was warm and crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. Quite enjoyable.
