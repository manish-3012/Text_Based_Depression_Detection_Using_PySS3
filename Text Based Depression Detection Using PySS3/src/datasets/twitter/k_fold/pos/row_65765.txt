Socializing is difficult, now it's even harder As the title says, it's even harder to talk to people now then before since.. well.. quarantine and stuff. I have pretty much talked to 2 friends since this started despite there not being much to talk about. It always has been getting dryer and dryer by the day but we still manage to get by.

The real problem here is how do I talk to my female friends now? Before it was like we had something to talk about in school that was wacky or crazy, and now it's just boring. I have no interest, and I'm not all too close with them, but I just want to get a combo going rather than just a simple "hi" every now and then yk?

Sorry for those who had a stroke reading this my mind cannot regurgitate my thoughts correctly at times and it ends up in pieces.
