Hey boys why do you treat girls who arenâ€™t as pretty kinda mean? Iâ€™m not some short blonde or brown straight haired pretty girl, but I have feelings yk. I canâ€™t even count how many times a guy has made fun of how I looked or completely ignored me because I wasnâ€™t as pretty, but a pretty girl said/did the same thing as me and theyâ€™re all for it.
