i feel like iâ€™ve done everything i wanted to do in my teenage years in every aspect except romantic/sexual iâ€™ve had a lot of good experiences with friends, gone to parties and had fun whilst still managing to pass my classes. but iâ€™ve literally never had any real romantic experiences. iâ€™ve kissed people but they were all just dares and shit at parties. and kissing is literally as far as iâ€™ve gone with anyone

now iâ€™ve graduated and i feel like i missed an important part of the high school experience. all my friends have had these kinds of experiences except for me :/
