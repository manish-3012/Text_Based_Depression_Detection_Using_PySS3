So im just gonna have a fat rant about toilets My room is right next to a toilet right? Me and my parents share it and it is the worst thing in the world. Every now and then at night they wake me up by using the toilet.whats worst is that the neighbours toilet is also connected to my room which means that i have to listen to people shit and piss all fucking day
