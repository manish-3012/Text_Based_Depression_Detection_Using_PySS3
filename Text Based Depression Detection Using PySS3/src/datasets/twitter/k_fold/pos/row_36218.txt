I came out to my mom... This isn't a joke post I actually did it! But she told me that the internet was influencing me and that I don't know what I want and that she raised a baby girl and stuff like that, and I tried to explain to her how I feel but she wouldn't listen. The strangest part is that no matter how hot headed I am Im still not mad at her Im just...sad about it. Am I in the wrong? I know what I want but should I not have told her?
