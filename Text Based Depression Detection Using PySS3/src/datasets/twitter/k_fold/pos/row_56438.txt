There is one thing in this world I hate with an absolute burning passion well actually there are a lotof things, but the reason for this post is to BE ANGRY ABOUT PAYING FOR SHIPPING HOLY HELL ITS SO ANNOYING. WHY IS ANYONE OKAY WITH PAYING 5 DOLLARS FOR A 5 DOLLAR ITEM?!?!


This rage is brought to you by the 5below website cancelling the secret free shipping code I stumbled upon on tiktok. I JUST WANT *ONE* MORE SQUISHMALLOW AND I DON'T WANT TO PAY $5.95 FOR A $5 ITEM UGHHHH
