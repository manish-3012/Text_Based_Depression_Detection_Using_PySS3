Is anyone else like me Im an introvert. I spend most of my time indoors browsing the internet, masturbating or playing games. I struggle to concentrate in school and randomly get severe bouts of depression. I have no friends, just some people i speak to occasionally. I barely trust anyone. I trust 1.5 million random strangers more than anyone in my real life. Is anyone else like me or am i an exception.
