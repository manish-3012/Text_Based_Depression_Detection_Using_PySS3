Allow me to explain to you my absolute annoyance with all of us at the moment What in the absolute hell are we doing? We are continually at each other's throat for perpetuating behavior that we continue to endorse. Why, why, why? It makes no sense. I have yet to find a reason as to why it perpetuates itself.

On a scale of 1 to 5, how annoyed are you with your fellows?

Might I list a few of my grievances...
You know what, no. There's no point in fighting the absolute that drives us. Questioning it is a philosophical farse as is this statement. 

If anyone wishes to enlighten me on the philosophical reasoning behind our actions, please.
