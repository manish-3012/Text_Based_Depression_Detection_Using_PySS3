Help, im so bored Im feeling kinda depressed...

My electronics and privileges have been taken away until new year for reasons i will not clarify, and im not allowed to go outside until new years either, it would mean the world to me if someone could recommend something or become a pen pal, i haven't had any real contact with my friends for a while now.

|Yesterday i found myself literally banging my head against a wall out of boredom, my parents said that if i want to do something, i have to do it with them, but when i ask to spend time with them, they decline, and when i try to contact my friends with my laptop, i get scolded.|I wanted to leave to get a book in the local library, but the library counts as outside, i cannot do this. I cannot last 3 months like this, i have filled my 50 page diary in a week, and its not a narrow diary. Every day i just sit in my bed, go to school, come home, do my homework, turn on the radio and listen to whatever shitty mainstream radio station i can find.|Im also lonely. I spend most of my time within 10 feet of my stepfather (no i do not hate my stepfather, just to clarify) is a bit nosey. I haven't had much privacy, i live in a household where if i try to take a nap, my parents hit me with the - SLEEPINGIS FOR NIGHT, GET THE FUCK UP.|

|Please, it would mean the world if someone could reach out and give some advice.|||
