I came out as bi to my friends I donâ€™t know how they reacted I mean I think good. My close friend just didnâ€™t respond and send memes and the other one was like. By Q you mean Bi right. I said maybe. And he said all right and that was the end of it. I mean they didnâ€™t hate on me or anything. So itâ€™s pretty good. 

Also the by q thing is because I havenâ€™t made my full decision yet so I told them I was Questioning instead of bi but he figured it out lol
