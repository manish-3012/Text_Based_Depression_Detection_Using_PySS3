I've been worried about the lack of homework our AP Pre-Calculus teacher gives us... i mean he just explains the material (i guess that's ok, since its what i heard of AP classes.)

But i'm in another AP class (Biology) and she *does* gives us hw. 

So to all the other people who have already taken, is this normal? My profesor is good, but he's kinda new, so yeah i'm a bit worried
