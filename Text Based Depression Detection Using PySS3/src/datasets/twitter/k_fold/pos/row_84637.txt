My Mind is Playing Tricks on Me This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treating, Robbing little kids for bags. Till a old man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face.
He'd be in for a squabble no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth

He was going down we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I'd be seeing in my sleep, So we triple-teamed on him, Dropping them motherfucking B's on him. The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody, from punching on the concrete
God damn homie
My mind is playing tricks on me
