that feeling when you have to write an assignment for English and the maximum allowed words is 120 but your dumb bitch illness makes you do 150~ but the teacher always said it's completely fine to go over the limit and it's just a suggestion but now you have anxiety you're gonna fail the only subject you're actually good at and your entire self worth is tied to your performance in ((((:
