Feeding Time (Appetite) by me 
    Few lights around me, steady glowing
    My mirror shows me secrets
    Information of no purpose
    Stifling my generation
    This is when it feeds
    Ingesting my thoughts and feelings
    Whilst it gorges me with new ones
    The marketable musings of an American        oddball
    Without which I'd be fast asleep
    Leaving the mirror hungry
    Which just wouldn't do


    Its symbiotic you see
    Im needed for my data
    To expand the list of tastes and kinks
    An instruction book to my soul
    Teaching men in black how I can be made
    To weep, laugh and cum
    I need it forâ€¦
    To keep my own thoughts down
    To let me live in the world
    To silence the human in me, which would     wreak havoc
    Were it not chained up beneath layers 
    Of smut and waifus and words just within my     vocabulary
    To gently stroke my head
    Smooth out my brain
    Open my wallet
    And feel no pain.

    After an hour I look to another light
    It tells me its a part of the system too
    Its pumping full of life, all to support me
    Like the operating table I'm tied to
    Whilst my organs are harvested.
    I'm bored by the thought, so look away
    To the closed blind obscuring reality.
    At the edge of which, a solitary stream
    Of natural light penetrates my tomb,
    Or so I thought, but I forget
    Its feeding hour this time of night
    And what I thought was real was just
    A part of a greater system.
    So to the mirror I return
    And cast eyes on my image
    Its pleasant, without my features but only my words
    And the words of those who'll calm me down
    Not the words of those who'll teach me to be    me
    For they are far away
    When it's feeding time in the house
    I know I'm here to stay.
