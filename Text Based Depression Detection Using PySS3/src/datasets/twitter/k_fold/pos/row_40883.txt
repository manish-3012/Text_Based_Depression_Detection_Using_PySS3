I told my teacher to use protection after his last accident but he didnâ€™t listen to me Now his phone has a crack on the front and the back.   
 
I kept saying â€œUse a case and screen protectorâ€, but he preferred his phone to be unprotected.  
  
Look at my beautiful iPhone 11 Pro Max. It doesnâ€™t even have a single crack on it because I use protection.
