Have any if you guys noticed that once you're into high school classrooms have moved from rowdy to pretty much constant dead silence? I'm a junior in hs right now and looking back, I remember all my elementary, middle and some of freshman year as all classes being loud and rowdy. Now literally every one of my classes except for one is pretty much dead silent except for the teacher. It's like as people get older they talk less.

I will say it's probably a bit more extreme this year with half the people being virtual and what not but still, even last year there were a lot of full classes where nobody would say anything. Like the teacher would ask a question and even though everyone knew the answer they didn't want to talk.

Anyone else notice this at all? I go to a school with over 5,000 students so the chances you know someone who you'd talk to in your classes is slim but I want to know what your guy's experience has been with this.
