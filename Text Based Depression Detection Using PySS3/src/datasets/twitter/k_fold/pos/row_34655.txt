Frick the penis hole supremacists! Okay so I've been peeing for years by just slightly pulling down the waistband and popping my cock out to take a piss. No big deal right? Well... Let me tell you. It's these cockhole supremacists who are ruining everything. They pretend like wiggling your penis through the maze of a hole on the front of your underwear is somehow more effective?! That is just false!!! There is no need for the penis hole on underwear, and Its not even included on newer underwear brands. We do not live with the dinosaurs or in Paleolithic era. We are big strong men! We don't need the penis hole!

I was reading on ask reddit that people who use the penis hole think people who don't drop their pants all the way to the ground to pee! Real men have dignity! This would never happen! Surely these people have peed while wearing gym shorts (which frequently don't have flys.) I DO NOT PEE WITH MY PANTS AROUND MY ANKLES!! Simply put it's easier for me to flop my massive 4 incher over the top of the waistband than weave my penis through the maze like penis hole.

If you use the penis hole for anything at all you are pathetic and useless. #closethegap

I am declaring today the start to the penis hole war. For now on we must shame anyone and everyone who unironically uses the penis hole to pee for anything other than wearing formal attire!! Even then we should still mock them regardless!
