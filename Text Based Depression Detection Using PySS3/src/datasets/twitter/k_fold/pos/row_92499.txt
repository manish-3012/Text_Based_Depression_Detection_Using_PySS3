I will practice my violin every day at least 20 minutes I haven't been practicing my violin at all, I need to start focusing in my orchestra class as well, even though it's on online school I will focus and I will practice for at least 20 minutes after school, like right after school, I have orchestra 7th period which is the last class of the day so then I'll practice on my violin right after school
