I never thought I would say this, but... I fucking miss 2017.

Like we didn't have to worry about anything. 

I fucking miss diss tracks.

There was something magical about seeing 2 grown men diss eachother like children, through YouTube.

I fucking miss everything being more innocent 

I fucking miss 2017

And here is a haiku for 2020

Fuck you very much 

I hate you with my whole heart 

Miss me with your shit
