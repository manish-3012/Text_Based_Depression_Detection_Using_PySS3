I hate myself and walnuts So I was grocery shopping today and saw a nice looking bread. I told the baker that I want it and he was like â€žThis one? With walnuts?â€œ
I freaking hate walnuts.
But I didnâ€™t dare to say I want a different bread, so I smiled and said â€žyeah, exactly thatâ€œ.
I AM A 19 YO ADULT, WHY AM I TOO SHY TO SHOP A FREAKING BREAD WITHOUT WALNUTS??!
