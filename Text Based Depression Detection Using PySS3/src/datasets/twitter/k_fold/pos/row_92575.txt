My parents say I don't try hard enough I play volleyball, I am definitely not the strongest player on the team. I have already thought that I'm a failure, and I don't have good self esteem. I try really hard to become better, but it never works. I put in everything I got and in return my parents yell at me about how I need to try harder.
