Who needs a heart these days ? Heydo,, this will probably be my first and last post here but I'm 18F and I have never been in a relationship before.

And for little over a month I have been speaking to someone and we were a little more than close. We'd call, facetime, game together and vibed well ,, today everything was called off :)

I feel like everything has been torn out me and thrown to the kerb , I dont know where I went wrong, but this person has really helped me through some dark stuff..  so I just wanted to come on here and say , you know, who needs relationships really? can we all just have one big platonic love for each other?
