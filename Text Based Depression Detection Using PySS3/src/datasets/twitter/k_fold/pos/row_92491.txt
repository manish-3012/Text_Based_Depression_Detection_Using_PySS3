Even my mom stopped supporting my hobby of building plastic models For a long time my mom was supporting me in building these plastic models. Now she said no because apparently I won't be interested in this anymore. She also said she won't help me buy an airbrush to help me making models because apparently I won't need it aince i won't be interested anymore. She was the onlynone in my family that supported me in this and just like that apparently I don't need this.
