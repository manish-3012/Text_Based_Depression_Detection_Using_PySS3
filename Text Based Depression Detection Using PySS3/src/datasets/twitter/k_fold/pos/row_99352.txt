Im so sick of my mom. So, last saturday we were out shopping in the city, i wore a mask and used hand sanitizer constantly, though today ive started to feel some covid symptons (dry coughing, mild headache and something that feels like a fever) which is 7 days ago, normally youre infected for 5 to 6 days before experiencing symptoms.

So i told her, obviously, and she got so *offended* and started accusing me of self diagnosing myself with covid.

I LITERALLY JUST TOLD HER I HAD SYMPTOMS, A WEEK AFTER BEING OUT NEAR PEOPLE FOR A WHOLE FUCKING DAY
