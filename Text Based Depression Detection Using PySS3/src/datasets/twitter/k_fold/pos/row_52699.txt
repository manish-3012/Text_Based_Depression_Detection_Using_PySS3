Reviewing random things every day until I get a boyfriend: Day 15 Day 15: 

So today Iâ€™m reviewing ponytails. So today I had pe so I decided to wear my hair in a ponytail, *a high ponytail...* 

Needless to say I regretted it the moment I left the house but at that point it was too late to take it off coz my hair was already ponytail-shaped (idk what to call it??) 

Well overall Iâ€™m giving ponytails a 3/10 coz they hurt and also since I donâ€™t have a particularly nice jawline then it makes my face look rly fat and weird BUT they are quite practical and also they are fun to walk around with coz they swing on the back of your head...

Anyways I hope you have a lovely day guys &lt;3
