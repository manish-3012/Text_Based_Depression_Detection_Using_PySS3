Another 3am crying in bed post I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s wrong right now, I just feel like Iâ€™m missing something and itâ€™s depressing me and I donâ€™t know why, Iâ€™m stressing out and feel like breaking down every three seconds, and itâ€™s not helping that I have 3 tests today, two of which I have no clue what itâ€™s even on, I just want to lay down and die right now
