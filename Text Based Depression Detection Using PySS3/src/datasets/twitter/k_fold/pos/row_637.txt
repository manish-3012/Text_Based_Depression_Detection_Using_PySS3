Hello teenagers of reddit, what advice do you have for me, a dad, to help raise my little people? I could ask other parents but for real, we grow up and kinda forget what it was like growing up you know? My parents never took much of an interest in me besides the necessities like food, clothing, and shelter. Which is a solid start I suppose. What are some things you wish youâ€™re parents would do more often? What are some things you absolutely wish they would just stop right away if they actually listened to you?
