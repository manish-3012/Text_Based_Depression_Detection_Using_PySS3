I let my brother eat hair I saw a long piece of hair (my mom's) at the bottom of a rice bowl.I told my dad about it and he laughed. Then, my brother ended up eating thay bowl of rice today and found the strand of hair in his mouth. (HAHAHAHHA.)

My mom yelled at me for not removing it. AND my dad turned on me! Am I immoral 0_0?
