How do I convince my parents to let me transfer? I seriously hateeeee the school that Iâ€™m at right now I constantly get talked shit about, lost almost all my friends, and I want a fresh start. Iâ€™m an incoming sophomore and my parents keep saying switching schools is like running away from my problems. Does anyone have any experience with transferring schools? What should I do?
