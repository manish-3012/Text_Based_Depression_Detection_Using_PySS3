You deserve happiness I'm crying right now but, not because I'm upset or sad or just in the mood cry, but I'm happy. And it's making me realize something. Everyone deserves happiness. 2 months ago when my Dad passed I basically fell numb, but now through therapy and some self improvement, I was able to feel happiness and that was just weird. But no matter how deep a trench you are in, just know that you deserve the best and greatest and most of all happiness.
