So I started this notebook where I write down my random thoughts and Iâ€™d like to share some of them - who the fuck looked at a beehive and thought they should eat it?

- King Henry VIII was a legend. He was so pissed off that the Catholics wouldnâ€™t let him get married a second time that he really said â€œfuck it, Iâ€™ll do it myselfâ€

- that squishy wind protector at the end of the mic on my gaming headset? Yeah I want to eat that 

- maybe all of my mental illnesses can be classified as female hysteria?

- gay panic- do I want to fuck her or be her?

- did the babushka lady kill JFK?

- lol I got raped

- starting to fall in love again. (You have become the very thing you swore to destroy)

- Heyo, absent father check


Thatâ€™s all thank you.
