â€œI thought we had a good timeâ€ 
So yesterday, I went to the mall with a friend, we got to talking and catching up, and overall I continuously hyped her up, showering her with a stream of compliments. We went to a clothing store at one point and she noticed somebody with really cool fashion sense whom she wanted to compliment. I left her to it, because I figured that I might make her uncomfortable if she gave the compliment while I was there. I even asked her how it went after. I didnâ€™t think much of it, and I thought it was a pretty good day. The following morning she tags me in a post talking about how I walked away after she gave the compliment because I was â€œembarrassed of her.â€ 

I have never felt so shitty over something I didnâ€™t really do. Mood basically went from a 100 to 1, and my brain is struggling to process that. Already in a bit of a vulnerable emotional state bc pandemic/rigorous coursework, and this being the first time I hung out with someone in a while, Iâ€™m kinda pissed it ended up like this. Iâ€™m likely seriously overreacting to this situation and you may call me out on it if you wish. It was a momentary lapse of judgement, but not one I thought was particularly rude, but Iâ€™ll leave that up to you guys. Iâ€™m just a bit shocked at how much we hyped each other up, and she proceeds to twist a story which essentially makes me look like an ass in front of our friends, which is a feeling I just canâ€™t seem to handle. 

I miss the age before social media (bit hypocritical since Reddit is form of a social media I know) so I could be oblivious to such things.
