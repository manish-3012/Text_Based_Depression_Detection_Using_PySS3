Sad bruh moment I have just realized that I donâ€™t have any good friends. I thought I had some very good friends but there is always someone that they like more. I just see all the posts on instagram and Snapchat when they were with other people hanging out.
It also applies in other things, such as: I am the only one left playing on our Minecraft server, I now skateboard alone, I play battlefield alone, I play the guitar alone, I listen to music no one listens to, I play HOI4 alone.
My best friend is probably my cousin who is barely one year older than me. We grew up together, we went to same school now for 9 freaking years. But when heâ€™s away or just goes out with his friends I feel so sad. I am also sad that no girl likes me. I now get why people wanna end all things.



PS: I was listening to Megadeth while I was writing this. Thrash Metal helps me with overcoming things like this.
