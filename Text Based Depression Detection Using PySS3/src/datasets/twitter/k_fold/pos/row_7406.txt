I have been invited to a party and Iâ€™m not going So my friend invited me to her halloween party (which is today) and I was happy and stuff because that was a first time for me. And I joined the partyâ€™s group chat and stuff and everything was fine. I knew they would have alcohol and I was kinda pkay with that, but I wouldnâ€™t have drank (I think its pretty bad for our health as teenagers). But then someone sent a group selfie into this chat about another event where they were drunk and it just made me realise that I donâ€™t want to see them like that. So I told her that I would rather not come, because Iâ€™m not really prepared mentally (idk if this counts as a lie or not, its not very specific but itâ€™s the truth). So now I kinda feel like I made the right and the wrong choidr at the same time. What do you guys think?
