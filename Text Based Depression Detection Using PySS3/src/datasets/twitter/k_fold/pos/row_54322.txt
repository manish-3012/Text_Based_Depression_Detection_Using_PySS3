Being stalked in-school As you see from the title of the post I was stalked by someone, here is the full story. To begin with, in 2017 I began Middle School (In Greece we do 3 years of it)  and found a guy at the time being alone as me. Hence I decided to start a friendship. The start was good but then everything changed. At the start of 2018 I was bullied or being ridiculed of by him and his brother. We also went at the same '' school '' to do our homework and all of that. Then at the end of my first year I was lets say '' attacked '' by their mother. Then I did not trust him for the following years and have been in numerous fights with him. All the fights were in the end about how he was envied by my grades. Back to the story, he did not have any friends. So he believed I was a friend of his. He followed everywhere, to the bathroom doors, to the cafeteria, to my buddies and more. I was angry and said him numerous time to stop it, it was useless as it continued. This was it, they were my best /worst years of my life until now. Now I have began HS and have many great friends who support me in many ways. Thank you for reading my story and keep redditing
