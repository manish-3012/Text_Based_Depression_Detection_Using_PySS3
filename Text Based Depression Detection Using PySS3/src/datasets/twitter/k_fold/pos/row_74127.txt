A new predicament that I figured was coming at some point So one of my friends found out that her dad isn't actually her father. And that her sister was also only her half sister.




Basically her mom was cheating for many years and it only came out recent when her dad has his suspicions and hot two dna tests. 

Both showed he wasn't the father for either kid.


So her parents split up and if course the dad easily won the case.


She and her sister decided to stay with their dad, because even if he wasn't their father he still loves and she's super close with him. 


So she's taking it a little harder than I thought she would, and is still ha ing to come to terms with it. 


I feel bad for her dad, he's such a nice guy who didn't deserve any of this. 


(I consider her dad to be the one that raised her and her father to be the man her mom cheated with.)
