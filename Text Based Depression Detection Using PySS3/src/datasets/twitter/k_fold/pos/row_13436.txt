I just watched oompaville for the first time in a fat minute And it was great. He is very funny, and if u haven't watched oompaville in like a week or more... go watch Him he never seizes to make me laugh. 

Also, I deleted TikTok because of the way it made me feel about myself so that's y I wandered back to YouTube
