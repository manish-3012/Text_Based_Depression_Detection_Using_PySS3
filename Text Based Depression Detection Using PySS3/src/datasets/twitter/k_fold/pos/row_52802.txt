So, peeps who got back to school, and I mean PHYSICAL school.... What is it like? Here in Florida, we're gonna start the 31st. Of course, I picked online school because my mom's immune system is compromised. So for those who actually went back to school, what is it like? I picture it like everyone wearing masks, the smart dudes with the hazmat suits.
