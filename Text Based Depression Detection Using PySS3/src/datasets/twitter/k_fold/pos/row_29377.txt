saying "we should just print more money" is the greatest way to piss off a group of boys talking about economy (or literally anything else) i always do it and its just hilarious hearing them yell n mansplain at me while i make more points lol. Makes me feel powerful ðŸ˜Œanyways yeah let's just print more money and no it wont cause inflation if we dont tell anybody, just dont be snitches and we'll have more money ðŸ˜œ
