I am now officially 18 Today is my IRL birthday which most ppl donâ€™t believe but itâ€™s true. Iâ€™m now officially recognized as an adult. Thatâ€™s all. Idk what else to say. 

(Oh also Iâ€™m finally back from a three day reddit  suspension which was kind of like a surprise from Reddit if you think about it)
