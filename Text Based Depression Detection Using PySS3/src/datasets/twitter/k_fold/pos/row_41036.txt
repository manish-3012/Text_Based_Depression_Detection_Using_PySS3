Manual car tip I have a manual car that only goes up to 5th gear (I think and I think its the proper wording) and to be quite honest, I donâ€™t know how to drive a manual car, can someone just give me some pointers? Or a helpful YouTube video? (Iâ€™m not sure about the year I think 2010 but itâ€™s a Mini Cooper) Iâ€™ll check out the videos and tips when I wake up. 

Thank you in advance &lt;3
