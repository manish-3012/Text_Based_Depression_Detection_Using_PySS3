Fuuuuck. this is the worst. First off, let me say I have never seen or heard my friend, we have only chatted online, and that their mom would get super mad if they caught them talking with us.

Earlier today. My friend's mom threw a bottle at her. She was bleeding all over, arms, legs, head, neck, everywhere. She told the group chat what was happening and we all immediately started panicking. We made the quick decision to call 911 because her mom had the only phone in the house. We had to call like 4 different phone numbers because we don't live in the same city. We had to rush questions out of her because we were terrified that she might bleed out. At one point she said she couldn't breath, and felt lightheaded and dizzy. After the operator stopped asking questions, there was a wait that felt like an eternity. She wasn't replying to anything we sent. We thought she was dead. Around a half an our later, the operator said that they were able to reach the scene, and we are still waiting on the full story of what happened. This was the most stressful event of my life, I am so fucking tired.

TL;DR: my friend was attacked by their abusive mom and we had to call 911
