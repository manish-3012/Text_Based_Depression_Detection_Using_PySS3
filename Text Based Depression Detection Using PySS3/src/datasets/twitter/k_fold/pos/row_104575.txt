I have no idea what to-do with my future, so I need help You're probably wondering why this 15 year old is worried about his future, well I'm not I just don't know what I want to-do. I have some ideas
1. Join the army at 21 become a medic, sniper, or a combat engineer(and/or become a ranger)

1A. Go to a trade school(mechanic), then join the army(at 21)

1B. The other two but instead I go in-to the army national guard( medic or combat engineer)



2. I go to a community college(and get a degree in engineer or astronomy) and live out my live like a normal person

2A. Go to a community college like above but at the age of ~28 I go into the army(so I could live out a live before an army live style) and I go in-to the army national guard



3. I just let life happen and see where it goes which I've been doing my entire life. 

Or if you have another idea please feel free to mention it.
