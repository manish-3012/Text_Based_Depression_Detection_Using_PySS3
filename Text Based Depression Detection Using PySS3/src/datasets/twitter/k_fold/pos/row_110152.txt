I need someone to tell me if Iâ€™m the brat here, or if Iâ€™m in the right. So Iâ€™ve decided that I need to start going to the gym, Iâ€™m weak as fuck, and would like to improve. One of my mates and I recently went and worked out together at his local gym and I really enjoyed it. So I tell my mum that Iâ€™d like to start going to the gym, itâ€™s the same company as the one me and my mate went to and itâ€™s right down the road. We go there to check it out and it looks great. Clean, good equipment, nice/genuine staff, and a lot of kids to socialise with. My mum says sheâ€™ll get me a membership for $12 a week, but I have to go 3 times a week in return, I agree and itâ€™s a deal, sheâ€™s says sheâ€™ll do it next week. 

So, fast forward like two months later and nothing, she hadnâ€™t even mentioned it, so I approach her about it and she says thatâ€™s because weâ€™re going to check out her gym instead. First of all, there were already some cons to it. Itâ€™s like 15 kilometres from my house so I definitely wonâ€™t be able to go there on my own, and Iâ€™ll have to go with mum every time I want to go there. This means two things, If I want to go to the gym, then mum has to want to go as well, so if she doesnâ€™t want to go the gym, than I donâ€™t get to go the gym, and also it means every time I go to the gym, itâ€™ll be with my mum. No offence, I love her, but it just seems so lame to go to the gym with your mum, and it makes me feel so dependant.

But hey, could be fine, I have an open mind. So, we go there and itâ€™s fine, itâ€™s way bigger than the other one but it just feels so lifeless. The staff are all uncaring and you can tell that theyâ€™re just there for their pay check, there are zero kids there to talk with, and itâ€™s just way too big, so big I could just get lost in it. So yeah, really not into it. On the way home Mum asks which one I prefer so I tell her that I do prefer the other one over this one, she says Ok sounds good, if you didnâ€™t like it you didnâ€™t like it and that sheâ€™ll sign me up the the other one soon.

Fast forward again by like three weeks (today) and still nothing. So I decide to ask her about it because Iâ€™m getting sick of waiting. So I ask and she says sheâ€™s signed me up to her gym because itâ€™s like $2 cheaper, didnâ€™t bother to ask me she just did. Weâ€™ll be going twice a week. This just sucks to me, I hate that gym and love the other one, and now going to the gym is gonna feel like a burden, it should be fun but now itâ€™s something that Iâ€™m gonna get annoyed when I remember that I have to go. I now have no agency in the matter, â€œOh you wanna go the gym? Yeah well you canâ€™t until mummy says you canâ€

Am I being a spoiled brat, or was that a truly dick move on my mumâ€™s part?
