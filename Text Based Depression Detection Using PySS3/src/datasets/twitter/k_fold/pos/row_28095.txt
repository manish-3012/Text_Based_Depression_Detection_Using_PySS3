I feel like Iâ€™m about to die I havenâ€™t gotten a full sleep in 3 days, my anxiety attacks are persistent.

Iâ€™m anxious as we speak.

My allergies are intense too.

I got up to use the bathroom and I felt so weak, I felt like nothing was real and it felt like my body was moving slower than my brain was.

I felt woozy.

What if Iâ€™m dying??
