So, I forgot to pause my music while doing a presentation over zoom... and I was the one sharing his screen, with audio enabled. The teacher didn't say anything though, so I assume she liked it, or I fucked up and nobody could hear any of the audio. At least I'm not the guy who got called out for eating during his presentation and then attempted to argue with the teacher. Props to him for talking down to the teacher though.
