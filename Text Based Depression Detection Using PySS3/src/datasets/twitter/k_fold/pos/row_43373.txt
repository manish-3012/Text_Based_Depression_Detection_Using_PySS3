How do i know that i have a crush on someone? I have had 3 crushes before and each one feels different. but i never got one of them due to many reasons.  


1st - 2nd Grade. This Hit like lightning. It's instant. I had a crush on her the moment i saw her. God feels so good when i'm near her.   
2nd - 6th Grade Slowly but steady. At first i don't have a crush on her but as i see her everyday the more it developed. She's pretty and smells good and everytime i see her the more i have a crush on her.    


3rd - 7th Grade. Same as 2 but not because of pretty or smells good. I like talking to her but eventually we only became friends. I even ask her requirements and quizzes today lol.   


So how do i know i have a crush on someone? How can i tell it's not?   


But nah i'll just focus on myself and have a Girlfriend later on.   


Have a Good Day/Night.
