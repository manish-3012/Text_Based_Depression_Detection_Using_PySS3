My mum tells me I can tell her anything yet when I tell her something sheâ€™s wrong she gets mad All day my stomach has felt really empty. I am burping more and I get this really horrible taste in my mouth. I told her this after suffering all day and it not going away and she got really mad saying â€œthereâ€™s always something wrong with you!!!â€. Ik she wouldnâ€™t be able to help or anything but I thought it was best to tell her in case itâ€™s still like this tomorrow :( next time I get really ill Iâ€™m just not gonna tell her. She doesnâ€™t care.
