Taking precautions online during COVID to prevent sexual abuse, harassment, and grooming #getthehelpyoudeserve  [Pedophilia is not okay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YJTQhPHuAg)

Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic, a lot of us have taken to online means to acquire that social interaction we've all been stripped of. However, this can open up all-new avenues to potential abuse and people trying to prey on you. I myself have recently fallen victim to a sexual predator on a Discord channel I frequent, and when I went to search for help beyond Discord support, I found my resources were very barren. So, I've taken it upon myself to compile this message and list of resources to help people out there experiencing abuse online, or even help for those that may be predators themselves. Share the message with anyone you know that may be experiencing online abuse or maybe starting acting strange since they've taken to online interactions.

If you are being groomed online or in real life don't be silent about it, tell a parent, guardian, or any adult you trust. If you believe you suffer from pedophilia disorder, you can still get help! [https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/res...](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/reslist/tollfree/)â€‹
