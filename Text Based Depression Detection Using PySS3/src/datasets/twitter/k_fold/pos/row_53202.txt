Ok so need some advice. So about a year ago my parents got divorced so me (m) and my two sisters and my mom all moved across the country. So weâ€™ve been living in a different state for a while now and my mom has a new job and sheâ€™s met some people at work. Well about 8 months living here she meets this guy at work. She invited him over yesterday and he came over and hung out a little bit. Heâ€™s a pretty chill dude so that cool. He came over again today and spent literally the whole day here. So he has a daughter whoâ€™s one grade above me who seems decently nice and came over today with him. Basically I need help with the big changes that are happening because I donâ€™t know how to handle them. My mom (knowing her) is probably going to marry this man at some point because theyâ€™ve already gotten pretty close. Meaning that Iâ€™ll have a step dad and a step sister pretty soon. Pls help I donâ€™t know how to handle these things.
