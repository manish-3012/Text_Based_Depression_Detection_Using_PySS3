Dream girl February 2020, I have a dream, it starts off and itâ€™s my birthday, my dads in the room talking about something on the phone and he leaves. My step brother was also in the room and he says something about going to lunch and how itâ€™s my birthday and how he promised my father heâ€™d take me today as a surprise. I declined as I was about to go on a date. The next scene in the dream was set up like a side scroller, I was holding this girls hand and we were leaping through ruble and flames as this city around us crumbled. There was nobody to be seen, we soon found ourselves scrounging for snacks in a disheveled meijer, and we were about to come out empty handed when we spot the corner of the store had caved in, there was a fancy metal garden table with just the snacks we were looking for sitting on the pile of concrete and roof tiles as god rays shown through an orange dust. We go to the table and take the snacks, it really wouldâ€™ve been a neat spot for a date but instead we climbed up to the roof. We sat on the edge of the building overlooking the city. From there we watched a sunset so vibrant red and orange it almost matched the intensity of the flames dotting and covering the horizon below. 

I had that dream in late February. 

I met a girl in late March 

This girl, with out having me told her about the dream and before we told eachother how we felt, asked if I wanted to climb on top of this old building that she lives by, get some snacks and watch the sunset. I do believe I have met my dream girl. It feels like the stars have aligned and the gods hand crafted her sheâ€™s perfect in every way and Iâ€™m not usually this much of a hopeless romantic but for her? Yeah
