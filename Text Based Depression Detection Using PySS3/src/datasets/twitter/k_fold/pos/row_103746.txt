does anyone feel this way too? i just feel like i donâ€™t add anything to my group. like sure, they donâ€™t mind it when iâ€™m there, but iâ€™m nobodies best friend. and then even when i am somebodies best friend, iâ€™d easily get replaced with somebody. 

I would once again have to walk by myself to classes. nobody would want to talk to me outside of school. 
nobody really asks me how my day would be. 

itâ€™s so much worse to feel lonely when youâ€™re in a group then when youâ€™re actually by yourself :( 

does anybody know the way to overcome this?
