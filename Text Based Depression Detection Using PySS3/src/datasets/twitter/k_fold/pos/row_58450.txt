I got sexualized for the first time yesterday. I gotta say, I did not hate it. So Iâ€™m a femboy. Yesterday I bought my first pair of thigh highs socks and wanted to share it with the world, so I did on r/femboy. A few hours later, some guy commented that I looked sexy in the stockings. I gotta say, Iâ€™m not against that. Should I feel different about it? Iâ€™m genuinely not sure. I think the worst part about this is that itâ€™s the nicest compliment Iâ€™ve gotten in the last 6 months. So do any of you guys have any input?
