What can I improve in terms of music production Hey!

Recently I bought FL-Studio with the money I got for Birthday (it was totally worth it). The tiny issue is that I don't have again 200â‚¬ for e.g Serum or other expensive Plugins yet, thus I don't achieve the perfect sounds, but that's no problem, I don't need that yet. 

What I need are suggestions for improvement of you, because I'm not very experienced in like "how to get the right deep "volume" and ambiency into the track". Since I started to listen to (House) Music my tracks were just "flat" in comparison. My goal in future is to produce tracks like Lithuania HQ Tracks, Old Tchami tracks or anything like that. 

You may note that I don't have many financial "rescources" so I cannot buy the expensive tools, vocals etc. If there's a plattform that provides Producers with not-so-expensive vocals, oneshots etc. that would be amazing (I think Splice is such a plattform, but I do not know if it is worth it to buy stuff there as a newbie Producer hehe)!

Here's my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b5i8qaEfTo) and my [old](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1PLYuW3zqjQbiCTvD0acTA) channel (only newer ones were something like OK) 

Thank you for your feedback!
