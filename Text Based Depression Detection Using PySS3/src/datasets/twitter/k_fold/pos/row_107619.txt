My girlfriend (16) cheated on me We had been going strong for 6 months when her 17 year old â€œboyfriendâ€ texted my older brother telling me to back off. I did some research and found that they had been going for 3 months. We told him and we both split up from her, she lied to us and tried to hide it. That did not work out too well.
