I desperately need a job but my mom is pretty much against it. Hey. So for the record, im a rapper. And i take this rap shit serious as fuck, like im willing to put all my time, effort and money into this shit. But the problem is money.

Now just so you guys are aware, i am 16 turning 17 in a few months. I had a job before but they only had me working twice a week, i was making like 200 a paycheck, and my mom hardly let me work anymore shifts because frankly shes lazy.

I mean i could drive myself, i just finished my driving classes. But she wont let me take my road test until i practice more but she hardly takes me out to practice! Shes just protective as fuck and doesnt want me driving.

I but back to the whole job thing. My old job went down because corona but reopened like 2 or 3 months ago and never called me back in and chances are they probably wont. I was hardly making money off that anyway. 

I tried talking to my mom about it, but she made a bunch of excuses. â€œThe virus is out there its dangerous â€œ, i know plenty of jobs that have really good and safe health regulations in place. â€œI dont want to constantly leave the houseâ€ wouldnt be an issue if you let me drive. â€œI already give you 100 dollars a monthâ€ thats not nearly enough of what i need to actually accomplish shit. Plus i dont want to use her money.

All i want to do is get an early start on my career but she always makes shit difficult. It all stems down to the fact that shes over protective as fuck and wants me to stay inside all the time. Im turning 17 in 2 MONTHS FOR FUCKS SAKE. I know my purpose and place in the world, i know what i want to do, so let me do it geez.
