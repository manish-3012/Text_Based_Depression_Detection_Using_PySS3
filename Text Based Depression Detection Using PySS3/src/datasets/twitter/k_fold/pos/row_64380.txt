How do i know if my crush(es) likes me? I currently have 3 crushes. One guy is very extroverted but nerdy. We talk alot at school but he doesn't seem to get my hints. I have no idea if he's friendly or likes me in that way.

Second guy came a little late into the school year and had trouble making friends. I helped him and we still talk. He's very very shy and usually hangs around. I invite him to play cards and we usually walk to the train station after school together.

the second guy is not conventionally attractive(ugly), to me he's very attractive though. his personality is very special to me and we also talk. He's a little awkward sometimes though.

All of these three are great choices tbh, but they also all have flaws which is perfectly normal. The thing i wanna figure out is how do I know if they like me? What kind of things should i look for?

also who should i go for out of the three? 

keep in mind that these descriptions were very short and simple.

tldr; what do i look for to know if someone likes you. and who do i choose.
