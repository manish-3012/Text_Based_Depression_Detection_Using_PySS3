I'm Creating a Minecraft Server Hey, what's up everybody.

I'm wanting to create a Minecraft Survival Server, similar to the YouTube series HermitCraft, so I was wanting to see if any of y'all would be interested because I don't have any members yet. 

I think it would be really fun to get a group of us together, probably around 16 players, and create a great server!

If any of y'all are interested, just let me know and I'll give you information about the entire process.
