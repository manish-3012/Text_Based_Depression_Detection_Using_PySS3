This year was a very fucked up year but I learned somethings that teenagers gotta know before passing this difficult phase of life so, here is my *2021 GUIDE FOR DUMB TEENAGERS* 1- the first thing you gotta know is that you ARE alone. And youâ€™ll be alone FOREVER. Doesnâ€™t matter if you have a girlfriend or friends, youâ€™ll still be alone forever. The only thing you need to realize is how to deal with this. Being alone is the best thing in the world and now I recognize that. Be happy with your own company.

2- grades. â€œOh, I got an A so Iâ€™m smarter then youâ€ â€œson, if you donâ€™t get an A youâ€™ll be groundedâ€. Thatâ€™s bullshit. Grades are just numbers based on an exam of a determined subject so THEY CANNOT MEASURE IF YOURE SMART OR NOT. You have other qualities like other people and be proud of that! Itâ€™s not a grade thatâ€™s going to tell you who you are.

3- school. Yeah guys, school is such a toxic place. Students are extremely cruel and you have to fake who you really are, otherwise youâ€™ll be bullied. The only thing I have to say is that itâ€™s just a phase. You are in school just to study, nothing else so fuck them. Be yourself. Hatters will hate and yeah, I donâ€™t fucking care cuz even Jesus had haters so FUCK IT. ( also, if someone is trying to copy your personality or style, just remember that every good movie has its pirated copies ðŸ˜Ž) 


4- just LIVE. It seems difficult but itâ€™s not. Youâ€™ll fall, youâ€™ll get up, youâ€™ll cry, youâ€™ll be happy, youâ€™ll be scared and itâ€™s normal! Thatâ€™s why life is amazing. So get up from this bed and LIVE. Do wrong shit, or right shit, idc,  if you knew how quickly youâ€™ll be forgotten when you die, you wouldnâ€™t stop doing everything you dream thinking about what others think.

Anyways, that was a fucking cringe text but I donâ€™t care, just enjoy life guys
