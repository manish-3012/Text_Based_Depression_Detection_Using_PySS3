Am I really the "bad guy" of the story? Basically I banned a racist transphobic scum from MY discord server.

Everything started in my peaceful discord server with all of my friends in it.

 A good friend of mine(let's call him Smeagol, it fits him perfectly) got into his "edgy phase". He was a really nice and chill dude with a strange sense of humor. But it didn't last to long.

One day, Smeagol suddenly started using the n-word and saying some really bad stuff, so naturally I told him to stop.
Two of my other friends came in. One is trans, and the other is autistic (let's call them karl and paul)

Then everything went to shit, Smeagol started swearing at karl and paul, while making fun of autism and saying even more racist bullshit. I said "dude wtf are you even aware of what you're doing?"

And OH NO!! He started saying some nazi shit involving race superiority while speaking with a fake chinese accent because I'm asian.

So I banned him.

But what now?? That moron is back. Begging me to unban me. So I argued back, and blocked him. But it's not over yet. He's back with some allies... And it's one of my oldest friends... (let's call him "nice guy fred") 

Nice guy fred started calling me a dictator. So I argue back, but he keeps defending that idiot with "bUt iT's dArK hUmOr"

Now you know why I called that parasite "Smeagol". 

And now I don't know what to do and I'm in some trouble. 

Do you guys have some clever ways to get rid of that tumor?
