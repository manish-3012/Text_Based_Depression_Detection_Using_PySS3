I Need Help Hello, I am a 13 M that lives in america and lives in a middle upper class living style I have my father, mother,and brother that takes care  of me so I was wondering is it wrong to think this way I can have anything in the world except one thing and that is my father noticing me and treat me human all my life my mother took care of me and my father spending all day in his office but when my grades are 70 or below he would be mad at me and tell me to study on stuff that I don't even understand the basics of  that's where my brother comes along and teaches me better then all of my teachers combined that is how it worked for me then the day came.

I was getting my braces adjusted then my dad got a call about a math quiz I got a 37 a 37 I just wanted to end it there but just something inside just wouldn't let me  once we got home from the car ride that felt 5 hours long I ran up to my room as fast as I can and I cried and I cried for what felt like like hours yet it was just a minute or 2 then my father open   up and saw me my mind was broken he told me "why not work on your assignments"

"yea-a-a \*sniff\*" I got up went to my chair open up the classwork and cried some more I was taking huge breaths that were soon followed up with more tears of sadness my father told me to go downstairs and watch some TV and cool down I replied with this.

"NO if I don't complete it now I never well and beside I am useless to this globe anyway"

"horse shit the world needs you \[insert name\] everyone cares about and needs you just come on I need you"

I look up I see the first tear that ever saw come from him and first time I saw him by not seeing me as a name on a spread sheet but another human like how I do for him I replied with "yea" and gave him a bear hug.

It has be 3 days since that happened and now I noticed how much time I have lost with my dad and all that I want is no Disney trip nor Play Station 5 or the next best thing all I want is a game of cache is this to much to ask for him or should I grow up and accept that  he well always say no and also I am scared and feel like I am to old to ask him to play I just don't know what to do.
