I don't know what to do after high school. My whole life I felt like I HAD to go to college. But now that I'm getting closer, I don't really want to. The pandemic shattered my GPA and my overall attitude towards school. And I don't want to spend tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars on a 4 year degree, and then not even use it in my job. 

But I know that having a degree in general helps with getting a job. So I think I want to get a 2 year degree at my town's community college or something like that.

I don't know, what do you think?
