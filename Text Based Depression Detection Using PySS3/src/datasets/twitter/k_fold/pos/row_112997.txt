Advice please I have a group of friends that I play video games with and such. The problem is I donâ€™t hang out with people out of school much anymore (not due to covid) and whenever people hangout Iâ€™m simply just not invited and I donâ€™t wanna be that guy that forced himself in.

I also have a girl thatâ€™s asked me out on a Christmas date with 2 other couples which I said yes to but I simply just havenâ€™t talked to her. I havenâ€™t talked to her at school and I donâ€™t really â€œdoâ€ snap either. 

My life is pretty fucking depressing everyday I either study or play video games. Going to school sucks then I go home and being at home sucks. I play guitar but I just miss the times where I hung out with my friends every Friday and did whatever the fuck until 3 am.
