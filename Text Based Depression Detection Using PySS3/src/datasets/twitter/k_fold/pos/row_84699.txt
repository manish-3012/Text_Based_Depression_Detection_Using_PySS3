Iâ€™m just an uninteresting person, and I canâ€™t keep people interested in me. Iâ€™m just uninteresting, my relationship rn scares me because my friends are just funnier and have more interesting stories, I donâ€™t think sheâ€™ll break up with me for it, but I hope she doesnâ€™t feel stuck with like just because I give her affection and make her feel good.  I wouldnâ€™t blame her to leave me but I feel like if I donâ€™t keep her interested Iâ€™ll weigh her down.  I just want to feel like Iâ€™m gonna loose her and not because sheâ€™s wrong, sheâ€™s not, sheâ€™s a wonderful and I love her but if Iâ€™m not satisfying her I want her to go, ik weird rant but Iâ€™d rather her be happy being friends with my friends than being boringly in love with me.
