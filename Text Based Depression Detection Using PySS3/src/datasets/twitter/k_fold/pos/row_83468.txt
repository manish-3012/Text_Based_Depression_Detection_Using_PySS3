My school is trying to be politically correct and is making us read this book call "this book is anti racist" and it literally said its impossible to be racist to white people...  So my school is making us read that book and the entire thing is horse shit. its literally written by the softest snowflake in this planet. The entire book basically demonizes white cis males like they are the scum of society. Yesterday, the school had to read this chapter about how its impossible to be racist towards white people because there were no institutional rules or smth to discriminate against them. It talks about things like how saying "I dont see colour" is racist because you are not acknowledging their culture.  I am not racist but I think that is absolute horse shit. I am also asian and it NEVER mentions asians in the book. It also says other dumb things like if your librarian keeps on putting out books by cis white authors, you should make them change and ONLY have boooks by black minorities. Like listen, im not trying to be racist, some things in the book I do agree with but a majority is just special snowflakes complaining.

TL:DR   
School makes us read a stupid book by a REALLY FKIN SPECIAL snowflake that thinks its impossible to be racist against white people and everything is a micro aggression. They basically want the entire world to be nicer to special snowflakes like them.
