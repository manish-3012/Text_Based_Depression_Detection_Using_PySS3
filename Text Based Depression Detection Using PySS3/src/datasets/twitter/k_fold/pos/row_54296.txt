Do this when incountering an anti masker at school So there is this kid in my class thatâ€™s always complaining about how you canâ€™t breath in mask and that they arenâ€™t worth it and other anti mask shit like that. So I decided to just start ruthlessly bully him, stay stuff like he is a baby because he can breath with a cloth over his face and calling him a wimp and stuff. Long story short he shut up and it was a lot easier then explaining why he was wrong. Bullying works.
