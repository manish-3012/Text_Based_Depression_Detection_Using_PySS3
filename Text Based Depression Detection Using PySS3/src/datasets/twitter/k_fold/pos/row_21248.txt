So I just got a Girlfriend after 8 months of texting each other. Yesterday, she, her friend and me went shopping and her friend was reallyyy dedicated to make us go next to each other and to sit next to each other. Anyway. Her friend and some other people went to make some Photos. And she and me were sitting on a bank and were just talking and goofing around. We were in front of a big fountain and it was honestly really 'romantic'. At that moment I noticed that I wanted her to be my Girlfriend. But at that moment I really didn't have any self confidence to really do a move.

Anyway after that there was a Party at my house the same day and again... her friend was really desperate to make us sit together and that stuff. So we both had a beer and a shot. We weren't drunk, but we didn't thought as much as when being sober.

Her friend was again looking at me and making signs that I should hold hands or to put my Hand around her shoulder. Me being a little bit drunk thought: FUCK YES LET'S DO THIS. Then I put my Hand around her shoulder and she was actually pretty responsive to it. She started leaning against me and I started leaning against which was actually quite the great feeling.

After I put my Hand around her shoulder the entire Table was like: YEAHHHHHHHHH YOU GOT THIS MATEEEEE. And that was actually really funny...

Afterwards we were holding hands and laying on the ground and watching the stars. And that was actually really romantic. Except that we were laying on the hard Asphalt. That wasn't so great. But she put her head on my chest anyway so she was really comfortable which was really the only thing I cared about. And now I'm really happy. I hope that she is really happy and I hope that whoever is single right now will get a Girlfriend. There is always someone who will love you lol.

I'm sorry that I didn't bake any cookies for people sorting by new. But I hope you could enjoy my little love story here.
