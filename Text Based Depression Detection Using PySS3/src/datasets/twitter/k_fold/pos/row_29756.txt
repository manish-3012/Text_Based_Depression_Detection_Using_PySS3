I thought I was invincible I really did. I've been sleeping less than four hours a night every day for the past month. Because that's the obvious thing to do when you have a heavy workload right? You're a big kid now. It's totally normal to fight to keep your eyes open whenever you hear a song. Totally normal. Highschool huh? So much dude... so, so much. I'm ambitious. But I don't want my ambition to kill me. As in, I don't want to become a shell of my childhood self. Success tastes good. But the price was to get a forked tongue. 

It hit me so hard yesterday..everything that I'm putting myself through. I had a mild panic attack. I've never experienced anything close to it before. It felt like I wanted to shrivel up so bad while there were a million stones being pelted at me.

Today, I felt the physical hit. My headache is killing me. My face experienced a breakout.

But  you know what? I think I'm going to get through this one.
