I don't know what to do now I know I've posted stuff like this before but I truly don't know what to do. I sometimes think I am either actually depressed or it's hormones but idk cuz I am sad all the time and sometimes even think that nobody loves me and that i don't have friends where the people who say they are just play videogames because they are bored asf. I act happy when I feel it necessary but I am not happy. Idk what to do now. I know I need social interaction with people other than just family but it is still too dangerous. I just want to be happy again :'( also Ive tried counseling but no places are open due to covid f*cking 19.
