Mosquitoes should not exist in this world I was in Georgia for a vacation about two weeks ago, and some bitch ass mosquito decides to bite a scar I had for over three years (bike ride accident). So I started scratching it that day and it started bleeding and pussing. And not only that, as my fellow blood cells made protection for it over that past week just now it decides to randomly fall off. So now it's just puss everywhere and not bleeding which is even more annoying than bleeding. ALL BECAUSE OF ONE SMALL BITCH ASS MOSQUITO. So yeah now I have a scar on a scar. Fuck mosquitoes
