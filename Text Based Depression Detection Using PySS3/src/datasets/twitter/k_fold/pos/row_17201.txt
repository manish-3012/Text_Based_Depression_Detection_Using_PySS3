I SAVED OVER THE WRONG SLOT THERE WAS A GLITCH WHERE IT SAID I HAD ACCESS TO AN IMPORTANT PLACE WHEN I DIDNT AND I SPENT LIKE 5 HOURS YESTERDAY HALF TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW TO FIX IT, THEN I FIXED IT AND PLAYED FOR A BIT.THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE BUT WITH AN ITEM, LOCKING IMPORTANT STUFF.SO I LOADED AND OLD SAVE AND SPED THROUGH SOME STUFF AND SAVED ON MY MAIN SLOT INSTEAD OF AN EMPTY ONE. SAVES ARE TXT FILES. IT ASKED IF I WANTED TO REPLACE A FILE BECAUSE IT HAD THE SAME NAME AS MY MAIN ONE. MY DUMB ASS AUTOMATICLY CLICKED YES AND LOST LIKE ANOTHER FEW HOURS. AND THEN I CHECKED AND THAT PLACE WAS INECCESSIBLE TOO.THAT MUCH TIME GONE TO WASTE.AND THE GAME IS ACTULY HAS AN INTRESSTING STORY AND STUFF. I HALF WANNA GO BACK AND SPEED THROUGH AND GET MY PROGRESS BUT I'M ALSO REALLY MAD BECAUSE OF IT.

Anyone know how to restore replaced txt files? I went to previous versions and it says none. I think it deletes them and puts the new one in it's place, skipping the recycle bin.
