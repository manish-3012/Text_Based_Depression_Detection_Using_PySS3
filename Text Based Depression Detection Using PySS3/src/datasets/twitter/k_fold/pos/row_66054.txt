Stop giving your cat milk Cats are lactose intolerant. You are hurting your cat. 

They enjoy drinking milk because they can smell all the protein and vitamins in it however it has lactose in it and only baby's can digest that. Anything other than a kitten shouldn't drink milk, your giving your cat stomach pain and probably diarrhea. I can tell you more about lactose if someone wants.
