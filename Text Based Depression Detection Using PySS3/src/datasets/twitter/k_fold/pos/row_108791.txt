MY MOM LET ME DRIVE HER CAR ON AN ACTUAL ROAD I'm 12, turning 13 in a month so I've been scoping out this subreddit to see what is going on here, this is one of my first posts here. Me and my mom were in her car driving to my little brother's friend's house to pick him up an take him to the farm, all of the sudden my mom asked if I wanted too drive, I said sure. I got into the driver's seat of the little mazda CX9, and my mom told me the speed limit was 35 for me and I kept that speed the entire time. Once we got to his friend's house and he climbed in the back to see me in the driver's seat was priceless. We drove for about 5 miles out on the country back roads, I've driven in fields and I know how to drive a riding mower and a Yamaha mule, but that was the first time I drove on the open road and frankly, I'm addicted.
