Iâ€™m in so much pain  covid has taken my entire senior year away from me. My school is open but my mom is forbidding me from going back because my sister has cancer and is at high risk. I understand and accept this but it sucks nonetheless 

I spend every day of my life laying in bed crying, doing nothing all day long, I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to, no friends. Thereâ€™s one girl I talk to on a daily basis and I have really strong feelings for her, I confessed this to her and she said she likes me back but she still refers to me as a friend and had never once asked me to hang out. (Sheâ€™s the only one with a car, I canâ€™t work to get one for the same reason I canâ€™t go school) We used to fall asleep on FaceTime every day and now she can barely call because she goes to in person school. I fantasize about marrying her but i know it will probably never happen. Weâ€™re a grade apart too so once I graduate I will likely never see her again.

My dad recently physically attacked me for the first time in my life and it left me traumatized. He did it in front of my whole family including my sister and her boyfriend, I canâ€™t even look at them in the eye anymore out of embarrassment. 

I have no aspirations for the future, and Iâ€™m scared to take on college/go into debt for a worthless degree. I donâ€™t know much about these things but I really just hate capitalism from what I know. I hate how the system works I donâ€™t want to have to slave away and take high risks just to be able to live comfortably, I donâ€™t look forward to the adult world at all.. 

Iâ€™ve missed out on so many experiences , I see people hanging out with their friends on snap and it pains me because I donâ€™t have any friends. I am in so much emotional pain and I just want it all to go away.
