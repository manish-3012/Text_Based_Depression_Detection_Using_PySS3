okay so last night I had a dream about one of my close(?) friends Idk what's that supposed to mean. so the thing is, we haven't really talked or met since quarantine began early this year. we texted like once or twice idek, but we were really close before all this shit went down. Should I text him or nahh, I already tried texting him like 2 months ago but we had a conversation and it was over then and there. idk what to do
