Yeah I get bitches Bad grades
Insomnia
Told that my mental illness isn't real, and that my symptoms are me just trying to annoy my parents
Complete lack of motivation to do anything besides sit in bed all day after zoom classes until I fall asleep
Hope for a good future gone
Eating 700 calories a day and still getting lectured about how much I weigh
Slowly rising urge to pack my bags and take off in the middle of the night because I hate how manipulative my mother is

For legal reasons this is a joke
