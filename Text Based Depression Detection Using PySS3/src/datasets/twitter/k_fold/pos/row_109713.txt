My parents just made fun of me for playing Minecraft Sorry if this is worded weird, Iâ€™m on mobile

So I have this Minecraft server with a mix of irl and online friends (which Iâ€™m pretty sure theyâ€™re already weirded out by) and itâ€™s gotten to the point where surviving isnâ€™t really a problem for most people on the server. So we decided to build this cool kingdom thing with a few of our houses.

This is where my parents come in, they ask me to come upstairs and ask what I was doing. I said â€œnothing interesting just mining out a mountainâ€ they then asked why and I said â€œwere gonnna build this cool kingdom thing-â€œ my dad cut me off and said â€œdonâ€™t you think thatâ€™s for little kids? Your friends are playing gta and youâ€™re building kingdoms in Minecraft?â€

So if youâ€™re trying to make me feel bad about myself, great job.
