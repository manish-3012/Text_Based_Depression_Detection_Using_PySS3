You are all happy that Biden has become president, but just because trump isn't in the White House anymore doesn't mean it's all cupcakes and rainbows (This might get controversial, but I'll state my opinion anyway.) 

I'm happy that Biden has finally spanked Trump off the Oval Office, but considering the situation America is in, it's still gonna be a hard journey for y'all. Biden is gonna have to work a lot to get your country back up and running how it should be, so don't expect everything's fine now, because it isn't yet. Look at the graphs for example, you are seeing over 100K cases now, and considering the little social distancing, it's gonna continue getting higher, unless Biden does something to prevent more cases.

As I said, Biden's gonna have to adapt ALOT in his position as POTUS, so don't celebrate a lot, don't forget the situation you are in.
