A question to Gen Z What is your genuine opinion about Millennials?

Kinda curious because Iâ€™ve seen truly mixed reviews. Some would say they view Millennials as the whiny spineless generation that does nothing except moaning about Boomers.

Some others said they look up to Millennials for being the first whistleblowers about how the world is well and truly fucked and something needs to change.

The rest didnâ€™t have much opinion on Millennials other than â€œuh, idk why they like to post cringe gifs instead of reaction memesâ€ or â€œsaw them defend us once, thatâ€™s kinda niceâ€ or â€œappreciate them for inventing memes but those were kinda clapped nglâ€ or â€œwhy are they so obsessed with Harry Potter housesâ€.

Disclaimer, Iâ€™m a pro-Zoomer gen Y guy so feel free to be really honest about us.
