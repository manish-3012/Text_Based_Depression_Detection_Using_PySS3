Any advice? Since school started in September for some reason I've just been unable to bring myself to study. I'm total over there past few months I must have studied less than 10 hours. I can't afford to do this cause my exams are soon and will determine if I can even attend a university so I really need to get my shit together. 

It's like I can't even bring myself to start revising. And even if I'm lucky enough to get there, I get distracted by literally anything and will start losing my train of thought. Either that or I get overwhelmed by how much I need to remember and I just don't revise at all cause I'm too afraid. What do I do?
