Y'all surprise me when I wake up by mixing these elements into whatever. Base elements are Water, Fire, Earth, and Air.

Comment combinations like this: [Element]+[Element]=[New Element]

Only use base elements or elements other people or you have created.

Examples:

Water+Earth=Mud

Mud+Water=Swamp

Swamp+Swamp=Shrek

This is just for fun Im curious what ppl will come up with if this gets any attention.
