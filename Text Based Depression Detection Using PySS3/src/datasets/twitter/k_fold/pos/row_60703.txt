My first 2 weeks in high school Fucking sucked. Who knew public transit would be hot, cramped, anxiety-inducing, and painful if you don't get a seat and have to stand? It's like an hour ride from my hs to my house. Also, classes are long AF. I'm falling behind on assignments, and making no friends. Also, I have to carry around a 15 pound backpack all day because I'm not allowed a locker because of COVID! (Lockers were a bad idea, but opening schools was not, apparently.)
