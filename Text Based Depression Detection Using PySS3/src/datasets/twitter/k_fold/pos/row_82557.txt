Why do movies for little children have scenes like these in them?

Like what the fuck? "Haha, girl kicks boy in the balls so hard he collapses, girlpower! So funny how he crashes to the floor in agony and humiliation!"

How does the FETISHIZATION of this as "girlpower" NOT make it sexual violence and humiliation?

Why is this in movies for little children? Why are boys so worthless that this is portrayed as funny in movies for little children?  
Exploiting a boy's most vulnerable part, his genitals, his manhood, to extremely humiliate and hurt him as a male, at the hands of a girl.  
And this is fetishized as "girlpower". Why?  
When a girl does this to a boy irl, why should he NOT give her a hard punch in the fucking face for it once he can stand again?  
What the FUCK is wrong with girls who find this funny or awesome irl? How are they better than guys who laugh when girls get groped and put in that kind of agony?
