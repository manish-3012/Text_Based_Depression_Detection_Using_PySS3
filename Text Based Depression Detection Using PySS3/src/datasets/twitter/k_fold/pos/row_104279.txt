Things you should know if you really care for animals or if plan on visiting India Feeding stray dogs - We love that people who visit AAU care so much that they want to help as_x000D_
many animals as they can. We recommend that if you feed any street animals, you ensure they_x000D_
donâ€™t become dependent on you for food. If you are just visiting for a few days that wonâ€™t be a_x000D_
problem, but if you are here for many weeks, make sure that the food you give is only a bonus and_x000D_
they are getting their main food from a local source so that when you leave they wonâ€™t suffer any_x000D_
consequences. Please also be aware of where you are feeding them - feeding dogs in a busy place_x000D_
where they might be considered a nuisance could annoy locals and put the dogs more at risk.

Animal rides - Many tourist sites will offer elephant, camel or horse rides. We strongly recommend_x000D_
you do not ride them. These animals are tied almost constantly, never let roam free with another_x000D_
of their kind, usually tied in the hot sun on cement, they have been taken out of their native_x000D_
habitat and â€œbrokenâ€ which literally means their spirits and will to be who they really are has been_x000D_
destroyed.

Consuming animal products - Avoid milk, eggs and leather. India is one of the worldâ€™s largest_x000D_
producers of milk and one of the biggest leather exporters. If you are drinking milk in India because_x000D_
you believe cows are treated better here it is not the case. Every glass of milk tea or lassi is the_x000D_
milk that belonged to a motherâ€™s baby and is being starved and tied, killed or abandoned on the_x000D_
road._x000D_
80% of eggs in India were laid by hens confined in factory farm battery cages. These hens will live_x000D_
their whole lives, about 2 years, in awful confinement until they are slaughtered. Chickens are_x000D_
every bit as maternal as other animals are but are robbed of their every mothering need to nest_x000D_
and care for their babies.

_x000D_
Leather - Leather is a huge industry across India, used to make bags, shoes and cover items such as_x000D_
notepads. Many shopkeepers will try and persuade you that this is â€œethicalâ€ leather that comes_x000D_
from an animal who died naturally. This is absolutely not the case. Some will deny that an item is_x000D_
real leather when it clearly is (basically they will tell you whatever they think will make a sale!)._x000D_
Being slaughtered for leather is the fate of many unwanted male calves and bulls, many of whom_x000D_
are bred only for this purpose, so avoiding leather products is the only way to avoid contributing to_x000D_
this cruel industry.

_x000D_
Snake charmers - Donâ€™t give money to so-called â€œsnake charmersâ€. Cobras in a basket are always_x000D_
kept in that basket until they die about a month or so later after their venom glands have been_x000D_
burned or cut out. Their salivary glands are injured in this barbaric process and they cannot_x000D_
survive. Forced to live curled up in a tiny basket and only taken on to be surrounded by crowds and_x000D_
taunted is the cruellest abuse and must not be entertained. It is also illegal under the Wildlife_x000D_
Protection Act._x000D_
Begging monkeys - You might be unfortunate enough to come across monkeys being used to â€œbegâ€_x000D_
for money or perform in other ways. Captive monkeys are trained by being beaten and being_x000D_
deprived of food, and will have their teeth pulled out so they canâ€™t attack their owner. Not only_x000D_
are these monkeys forced to endure immense suffering in order for a human to make money,_x000D_
keeping and using monkeys in such a way is actually illegal in India. If you do come across this,_x000D_
absolutely do not give money and if you are able, report it to the police and/or PETA India.

_x000D_
Zoos - You will find many zoos in India, sometimes under the name of a â€œbiological parkâ€. These_x000D_
zoos are notorious for keeping majestic animals such as tigers and leopards in completely_x000D_
inadequate conditions, with the animals often malnourished and psychologically damaged from_x000D_
being kept in spaces that are too small with no enrichment. The only way to improve the situation_x000D_
for these animals is to show that there is no demand to see them in captivity. Donâ€™t visit these_x000D_
places. You can see tigers, elephants, leopards etc. in the wild in India on a safari in one of Indiaâ€™s_x000D_
many national parks.

_x000D_
Animal souvenirs - Avoid purchasing camel or other bone. You might be told that there is bone_x000D_
inlaid in a table top and that it has come from a camel or other animal who died a natural death._x000D_
This is not true. Every time you purchase an animal product you are sponsoring an animalâ€™s death._x000D_
Donâ€™t buy or take shells. They should be left on the shore for the role they play in the ecosystem_x000D_
for thousands of species. Buying shells contributes to the degradation of the ocean floor and_x000D_
animals._x000D_
Donâ€™t purchase peacock feathers. You will be told that these feathers were collected from natural_x000D_
moulting/shedding but just think about it: millions of peacock feathers are sold across the countryand it is extremely difficult to find even a single full length feather even in areas where peacocks_x000D_
live. There are no legal peacock farms so these gorgeous birds are being killed for their feathers.

_x000D_
Plastic - Try to avoid plastic - especially single use plastic. Many places in India do not have a_x000D_
robust waste-management system, so plastic garbage often stays littered on the ground or in open_x000D_
garbage bins and can very easily end up in a cowâ€™s stomach. Plastic bags are one of the biggest_x000D_
killers of cows on the street who eat them especially if they have remnants of food inside. Reuse_x000D_
plastic bottles, refuse plastic straws, try to take your own bags when shopping, snack on fresh_x000D_
fruits in peel (bananas, oranges etc.) rather than crisps and other cheap snacks, and if you do end_x000D_
up with plastic then make sure it goes in a bin rather than on the street.
