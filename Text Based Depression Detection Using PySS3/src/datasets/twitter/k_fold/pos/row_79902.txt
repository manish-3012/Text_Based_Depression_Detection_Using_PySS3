I am sorry... A girl posted a selfie on the sub an I commented one of those cringe "haha unless?" lines on the post. Yes, it was mostly ironic, but this doesn't excuse my sin. I am truly sorry for letting the horny take my mind over and allowing myself to be a simp, even if I was doing it partially ironically. I hope that the boys can forgive me and give me another chance.
