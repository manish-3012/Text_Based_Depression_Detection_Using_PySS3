This tiktok scared me half to death until I discovered what it actually was So I was born in Saudi Arabia to Lebanese parents and I've lived here my whole life. And growing up in this country I'm just like any other teen but people on reddit act like I live in the sand. They say stuff about how dangerous and backwards it is and how there are public executions everywhere.
Obviously I would discredit it because to me it's a normal country and I've never seen a dead body in my life. A few minutes ago this video came into my recommendation page [here](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSJLHy2jq/) I was so confused because the guys were dressed like old english executioners and there was a guy kneeling down. What I didn't get was why his head wasn't covered so I went to the comments. Everyone was acting normal and I didn't see anything about the guy about to be 'killed'. 
Then I found this comment:
Drip Ø¹Ø§Ù…Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø¸Ø§ÙØ© ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥µ
Which means the janitor (I think? I don't know the actual word for it) has drip.
These guys weren't going to kill anyone they were just protected from the dust which is normal here. It's just I've never seen that specific mask before and the broom looked like a sword
