A girl agreed to get food with me but I don't know if she is seeing it as a hangout or date We know each other because we went to the same school from 8th-12th grade, we never hung out outside of school and only talked a bit in school and stopped talking in the 8th grade.

 we just recently started texting again and I asked her if she would be down to get food one day and she said sure but idk if she sees it as just a hangout or as a date..

I want her to know that im interested in her to be more than friends. What could I do or ask her for her to know that? Also should I ask her if she has a boyfriend / if she is single?
