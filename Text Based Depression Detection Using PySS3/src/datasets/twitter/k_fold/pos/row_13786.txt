What ruins sports... I personally have no problems with people playing or watching sports. The problem is that they feel obligated to talk(or just shout) about said sport everywhere they go even if nobody cares. Its what keeps me from watching any non esport since in esports you usually have a stratergy to discuss(tho if its COD or driving gamesi tell them to shut up coz there is no actual plan, just push mid and A or B in COD)
In conclusion people fanatically talking about sports is a real pain and they should enjoy it silently or in similar company quietly.
