I need some advice So basically there this girl I find cute and well she lives in my home country which I visit for a month every year

She is my cousins best friend so I see her sometimes on my holiday but not a lot which is sad she just so kind and like has a beautiful smile and well she is very tall like me which is kool

We have Met each other a few times but she is always taking to my cousins but she does look at me and smile a lot so I have barely talked to her
It's kinda because I don't know the language to well so everything I say probably sounds weird which is a problem

I always see her at my cousins birthday so we sometimes talk I remember this weird moment when we started at each other for like 10 seconds and then just started smiling
Sadly this year she can't come to my cousins birthday because she is busy on a week camp thing so I am kinda sad

Another weird thing is my parents and cousin and grandparents love to ship me with her they have never said it In front of her but any time love is mentioned they love to ship me with her which is kinda funny

I just don't know what to do now like how do I speak to her more and just idk this is my first time so Idk what to do or anything I need some advice
