A teenage love story. So it all started in 2nd grade. I really liked that one girl in my class (let's call her Sara for sake of privacy) and never knew how to tell her. 

Fast forward to 3rd grade and our teacher was pissed at our class so she decided to rearrange our seats, now... take a hot guess, who was chosen to seat with me. If you guessed Sara, you were right.

We started getting along, having fun on lessons and lunch breaks. We were best friends.

Fast forward again now to 4th grade. All the classes were mixed and we sadly weren't in the same one. We still hung out and stuff but didn't have as much time for each other as before. Year 2016, February 14th, Valentines day. "It's my chance!" so since we didn't finish lessons at the same time I gave my close friend a letter from me to give to her after school. He gave it to her. Same day, just after class, she messages me and tells me she had a big crush on me since 1st grade "The fuck!?" was exactly what I wanted to say. So we started dating (as much as two 10 year olds can date).

5th grade. I was moving to another house so we broke up. Damn, I really liked her (and I still do).

Fast forward to 9th grade (present day). Guess what. I'm in the same school as Sara. Our school is now in a 3 month lockdown so we have online lessons. While still in different classes, we text each other and have fun. I even have a plan to ask her out as soon as we get back to school and I'll keep you updated.
