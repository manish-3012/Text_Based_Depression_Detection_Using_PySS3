Welcome to r/teenagers This is a sub where reposts are popular than original posts. Where mods banned repost bot because they couldn't do their job and asking crush out posts pops up every 2 days. I might get downvoted and tons of hate but srsly, i am ok with crush posts but reposts without crediting original poster are getting annoying. Anyways well i guess imma watch what people think now.
