I really did just... So I was playing PokÃ©mon ruby on my old gameboy advance and I was about to beat this gym leader then my game reset itself, mind you I was playing this for 3 hours without saving so I set back to and old save point and letâ€™s just say things didnâ€™t go well for my gameboy. I unleashed my rage the same way a kid would playing fortnite on a crappy tv, so to sum it up my gameboy is now in pieces at the bottom of a pond. I am very disappointed and now I will not be able to beat that game
