Save me from this confusion!! hello fellow teens, iâ€™m sure you have seen many posts like this but iâ€™ve been considering posting this for a while because it has been going on for so long, so here goes nothing. 

So back in like late 2019 I met this girl in my health class, and we started talking, and talking, and talking (oversimplifying a lot) and in early 2020 she had confessed that she liked me. now I had liked her too and well we did what any confused early teens trying to date did and just acted all flirty, but after a couple weeks she messages me saying sheâ€™s just not ready for dating and she is sorry. so we didnâ€™t talk for about a month (especially because that was the time schools started closing.) so after a while she starts talking to me again like nothing ever happened but hereâ€™s the confusing part. she says iâ€™m a â€œreally good friendâ€ but very often does things like very often hugs when we meet up, texts like â€œi miss youâ€ or ending conversations by saying â€œlove you.â€ she does the most non-friend things but says iâ€™m a friend. help!!!!
