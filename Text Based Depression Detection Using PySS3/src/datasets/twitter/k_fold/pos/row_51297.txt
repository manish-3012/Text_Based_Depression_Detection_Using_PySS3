Chapter 1: Why are they called Sleepers?
Coldness swept through his body like raindrops from sky. But that coldness wasnâ€™t the one that woke him from the earth. His wake was more like a preset timer. Questions filled up his head as he struggled a bit to get back on his feet but the biggest one was how he ended up here. In the middle of a jungle. He tried to get a bearing of his surrounding before his eyes laid on the sword struck to the ground and the ghillie suit on top of that. He felt a strong connection to the sword. But he didnâ€™t think much about it maybe not to fill his head with more questions. For now.
