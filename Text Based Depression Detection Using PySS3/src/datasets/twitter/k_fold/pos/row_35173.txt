Imma finally keep up with something for once in my life! I have bad acne and I've wanted to get my nose pierced for a good while now but my dad doesn't want me to. so my mom said if I keep up with washing my face and keep it nice to the best of my abilities in 3 months I CAN GET MY NOSE PIERCED BEHIND MY DADS BACK!!

frick yeah &gt;:)
