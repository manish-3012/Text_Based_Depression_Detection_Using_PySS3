Stop misusing the word simp. Pretty much copy and paste from a post I saw earlier and I think this belongs here

A simp is a man who worships a woman and puts them on a pedestal not a man who treats a women with dignity and respect. Itâ€™s indicative of a larger issue that involved Reddit and the overwhelming amount of sexism on the site towards men and women. 

Itâ€™s to the point where I canâ€™t find out if people are using the term ironically or not anymore. Oh and obligatory â€œfound the simpâ€ before I hear that shit a million times.
