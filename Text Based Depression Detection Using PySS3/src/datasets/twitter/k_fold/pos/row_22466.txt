Best day of my life so far 
I was planning to apply in a few South Korean universities and was going to collect all the certificates that Iâ€™ve ever received.,, I went to my parents to ask them where my certificates are kept and there reply was, â€œWe thought they were useless so we threw them some time agoâ€.. I dont even know how to feel right now,, why does all the bad stuff has to happen with me!!!
