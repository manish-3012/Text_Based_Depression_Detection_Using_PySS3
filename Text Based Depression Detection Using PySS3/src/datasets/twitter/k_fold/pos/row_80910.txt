Nervous for an interview So today I applied for a job as a kitchen porter (cleaning dishes etc) and it said they would provide training if you have no experience so i sent my cv and now I just got a phone call asking me to come in tomorrow and Iâ€™m really nervous.

Iâ€™m thinking they may be kinda desperate for someone as they replied really fast while other places took about a week to reply?? But Iâ€™m not sure and this is going to be my 2nd ever interview and Iâ€™m really scared (letâ€™s just say I donâ€™t think I did well with my first).
