Well I decided to go for it I didnt ask anyone out but I decided to start going after a girl. When I thinking about this I thought "maybe she doesn't like me. Maybe ill fuck something up" but in the end it doesnt really matter. If anyone here thinks its a bad idea to pursue someone and isn't gonna go for it, well you really should since in the future you are gonna think about that moment and probably reggret it. So yea shoot your shot.

(Bad grammar go brrrr)
