My life is going shit rn. I need some help. So basically my parents are a little strict to say the least, not only they have put a password on my own computer (the only good device I have), so I can't use it when I want (which means I'll have to nag my siblings or parents every time to turn it on), but they also fucking poisoned my computer with a Parental Controls App, which I can't get rid of unless I know their password.

The Parental Controls thing is alright, because it blocks off the no-no websites from me, but the thing that I ABHOR is the time limit. Any gamer on reddit can imagine how stressful and nerve-wrecking it could be to have limited time on your computer per day. Imagine how much hastle I make when I need to hand in homework late, and then I find this shitty time limit in the way.

I feel like I'm the only nerd here that has Time limits and Bed times.

The problem here is, that not only we are in the worst year of mankind imagineable, but I also have puberty and I am that one nerd at school that has no good friends. And you can imagine how fucking depressed I feel because of these traits.

Forgot to mention they "burrow" ~~steal~~ and hide my mobile phones so I can't use them. *Childish*.

Do I have any chance to break free and get my computer ownership back?

How else am I going to kill time in this shitty year?
