For all the people in this sub who think that getting a girlfriend will solve all your problems, it won't. Instead focus making yourself happy as an individual and don't make your happiness dependent on other people. The vast majority of relationships at this stage of your life are temporary and and wouldn't be a reliable long term source of happiness. Getting a girlfriend won't raise your grades, won't get you in shape, won't give you money, and most importantly, isn't the only, or the best, source of happiness. There's so much more to life than relationships and there are so many other sources of happiness for you to discover for yourself, whether that's self improvement, a hobby you enjoy, or anything. Not everybody is the same, so you need to find what makes YOU happy in the long term. That doesn't mean something that only makes you happy while you're doing it, but something that improves your overall mood throughout the entire day. Long story short, the only way you will find happiness is through yourself, not a girlfriend.
