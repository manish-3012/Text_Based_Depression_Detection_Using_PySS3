Why can't old people understand or try and engage in anybody's life that isn't just politics? I asked my dad if could get a tripod for recording videos so don't have to set up books on top of each other and balance my phone on those. He started laughing because he thought I was kidding then my Stepmom started laughing at it and saying I can't have everything. If have the money to buy it why can't It's not there money. When I said was serious my dad said that we'll talk about it which he always fucking says. I all that means is he doesn't care enough to try and understand anything that do or enjoy. tried to talk to him about what was trying to code and all he could think about was how one time he used punch cards and wrote a sentence that tried to fix the code was doing that didn't even have problems on it. And he has no fucking patience! When was building my PC he grabbed my m.2 ssd and tried to plug it into a fucking PCI Express slot without even thinking about it. love my dad but he doesn't hardly understand anything.He also can't even fathom the idea of someone who doesn't want there whole life to be political shit and trying to tell people that 9/11 was an inside job.
Thank you for coming to my tedtalk.
