Can you guys help me ? Our chemistry teacher is very rude to us. She bullies us if we don't know the smallest details and only gives us very short breaks. Now she wants to make class even longer. She made a pool asking us if we want to make the class longer. Now she has some students who she knows personally and has them on a leash, so they will definetely vote yes. They are the ones who made the pool. They even made a second one (on google forms), when the first one had many no votes.

Now I ask you to help me. Vote Nu (i am from romania, "nu" means No and "da" means yes).

I linked the pool.
