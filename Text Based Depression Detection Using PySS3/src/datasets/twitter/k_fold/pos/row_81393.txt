IF it wasn't hurting me I wouldn't have written about it! Hey guys.... So I broke up with my girlfriend recently for some awkward reasons...and I've tried to move on, but it doesn't seem to be working! We still text each other cuz she really is also my best friend. anyway... I always act like I'm already over it, but when she acts the same.... It hurts me! In fact, everything she does hurts me now... I became so sensitive to her, and I literally don't have the strength to block her! She is such a good girl, but I really can't go back, and I'm hurting everyday now... Anyone knows how to deal with my situation!? I guess I really need help :/
