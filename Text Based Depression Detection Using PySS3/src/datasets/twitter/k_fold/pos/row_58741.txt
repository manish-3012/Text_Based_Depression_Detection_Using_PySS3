Why... No seriously WHY. Just went to bed, felt like crying dunno why just did. So I cried fo about 30 minutes constantly asking "why am I crying?" To no answer. Nothing bad happened to me today, I didn't watch anything sad, I didn't see anything that made me upset. And I'm still asking why was I crying?
