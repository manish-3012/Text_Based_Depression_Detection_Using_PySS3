Anyone need a friend? This is a tough time for many, especially those transitioning from childhood to adulthood. I'm here for anyone who needs a friend. I'm stuck at home for my freshman year of college, so I don't really have any high school or college friends. Just letting you know I understand what many are going through and I'm here for you! :) I sure need a few friends myself.
