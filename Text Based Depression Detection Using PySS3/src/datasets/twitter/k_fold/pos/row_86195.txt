Guys I need your opinion on something Alright so me and my crush messaged a lot over lockdown but Iâ€™m person itâ€™s been pretty much stagnant and apart from asking her a question about the lesson 3 or 4 times, thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s happened in the past two weeks

I sit on the table next to her in psychology and her partner wasnâ€™t here today (I donâ€™t have one) and so we got out together for a task

Pretty much I ask her about her favourite childhood experiences and she tells me about them

Only issue was that I was super nervous and because I was meant to make her elaborate on her answers, I didnâ€™t because my mind stopped working I guess

So it was pretty awkward and I was smiling a lot but it was nice I guess

This any good? I guess it broke the ice as we never have really sat down and talked but yeah, I was super awkward
