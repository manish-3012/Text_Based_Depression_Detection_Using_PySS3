Found while browsing Netflix While I was Netflix a few days ago I found an anime called BNA. I decided to give it a look, after finishing it Iâ€™ve come the conclusion that itâ€™s a great show. It contains a completely original storyline with a great art style. Although it only has one season Iâ€™m excited to see what it will have in the future. Some parts of the story can be a bit odd or even engaging. It contains a good song with it as well that I have constantly listened to on Spotify. I donâ€™t know what everyone else likes or hates so in my opinion just give it a try. Iâ€™m not telling you too but you can if you want
