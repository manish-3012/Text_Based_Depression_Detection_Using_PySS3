How to watch all the Ted-Ed videos in under two months I know you spend hours every day watching YouTube or Reddit, so take just 2 hours and 20 minutes of that time every day to watch Ted-Ed videos, starting with the oldest and ending with the newest. 

You will be done in three months, but if you watch them at 1.5x speed, it will take 60 days. 

That way you can have ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD. Imagine how smart youâ€™ll be. ;)
