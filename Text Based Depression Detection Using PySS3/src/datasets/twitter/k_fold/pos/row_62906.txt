Nobody gets enough love anymore Some people say attractive people think the world is a lot more polite than it actually is. Which I think sucks because the world should be more polite and accepting. I have a few black friends that get a lot of hate online and in person. Like wtf it's not their fault they were born that way. I'm here to make the internet a little more polite. Here's a virtual hug (and maybe a kiss) for you because you deserve it. I notice your pain and I want you to know you're doing so well. Love you all and I hope I made your day/night just a little better. For those not suffering, take the hug anyways. I love you all and you're all amazing people with incredible talents and personalities.
