Here are the reasons I have PTSD. He got mad at me for "leaving" a single piece of trash on the counter that was put there while I was taking out the trash. Another time he got mad at me after for crying when I took a chunk of flesh out of my foot. He also got mad at me because my mom reported him to police because he threatened to fucking hang me. And now I have PTSD.
