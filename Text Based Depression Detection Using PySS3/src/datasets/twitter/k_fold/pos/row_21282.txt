Are you interested in tech? Hello everyone!

I want to let you know about an exciting opportunity to join my team, a fairly new social media brand &amp; upcoming YouTube channel sharing some amazing innovations, facts and tutorials in computer science and coding.

We have a variety of voluntary roles available, with many requiring no specific skills or experience. The main role weâ€™re currently looking for is:

\- Graphic designers: we are looking for some more graphic designers to create interesting and informative posts for our audiences. A little experience is beneficial but we provide all the assets, post templates, training and support you need!

\- We have a few other roles available which we'd love to discuss with you on an individual basis. Please get in touch and we'll see what role might suit you.

&amp;#x200B;

In return for your contribution, we have lots of benefits to offer:

\- We respect your free time, we know you're a volunteer and you'll only work as much as YOU want to. Workload is generally managed on a freelance style basis, meaning you can choose and work on tasks at your own pace.

\- Training, progression &amp; award opportunities. You'll get free access to our award scheme, recognising your talent and giving you extra things to boost your CV.

\- Supportive culture. We want you to enjoy yourself while learning new skills, meeting new people and helping to educate and inspire more people on coding &amp; computer science.

And more... we'll discuss the full benefits package once you've applied.

&amp;#x200B;

HOW TO APPLY:

Please DM me or leave a comment below. I'll speak to you and we will most likely want to progress your application to a 2 week trial in the team.

Upon completion of your trial, we'll ask whether you want to accept a permanent position in the team. And of course you can end the trial or position any time, if you feel like it's not for you!


Thank you, I look forward to reading all your responses!
