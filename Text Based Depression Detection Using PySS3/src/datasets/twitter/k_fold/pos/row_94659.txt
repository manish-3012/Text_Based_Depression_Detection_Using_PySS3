I got an accident This is not a joke. I was riding my motorbike down to the bridge. My bike light was broken, so I couldnt really see anything. The street lights also havent turned on yet. Suddenly, I crashed into someone motorbike. Thankfully they was parking, if they had move forward a little, I would have been dead by now.

The person was fine, but my arms and left leg are hurt as fuck. Like, I cant even hold anything properly. Right now im recovering as im typing this

I dont type this for internet points or awards. I just want to warn you guys 2 things: 1) please for fuck sake, ride ur transportation carefully. I made a painful and humiliating mistake, and I want to make sure you guys and me wont make the same mistake as I do. 2) The person I encountered was friendly and understanding, so I was a bit comfortable. But, there are some ppl out there, will never forgive your mistake, and even make ur mistake more serious, so avoid accidents at all cost, not just vehicles accidents.

Yes, Im recovering. Yall dont need to comment Hope you feel better soon!. I just want to type this and share to everyone to get some relieves and comfort, and let ppl know about my mistakes and avoid them.

Thats all, hope yall have a good day.
