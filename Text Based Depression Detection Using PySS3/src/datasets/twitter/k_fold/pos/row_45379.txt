My fashion sense is just â€œpainâ€. I want to be emo, like, all black with maybe tints of white here and there, ceo of hot topic kind off vibe but without too much stuff tho.

But also I want to be a pirate and by that I mean the frilly top thingy with a corset, high heels and tight pants. Ya know?
