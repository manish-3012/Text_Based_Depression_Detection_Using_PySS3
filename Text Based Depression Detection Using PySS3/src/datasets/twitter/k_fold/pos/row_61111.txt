Complain about Instagram stealing memes is stupid Memes are supposed to spread. I don't give a shit about who made a meme, also watermarks are useless, nobody goes back to the original creator page anyways, memes aren't art, they are just silly jokes, Stop commenting "sToLeN fRoM R/sUbReDdIt", you look ridiculous
