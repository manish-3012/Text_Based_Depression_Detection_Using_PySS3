How I met the love of my life. (/s) So I went on a walk. Just minding my business. Then he drove by, stuck his head out the window and started pspsps-ing me.

The idea of me being treated like a cat was just so romantic, so original. 

So naturally I shouted "stop driving", and he did. Then he got out of the car and we had a nice conversation, even exchanged numbers.














(Is this what catcallers expect to happen?)
