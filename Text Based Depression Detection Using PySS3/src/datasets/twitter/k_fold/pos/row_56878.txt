Iâ€™m 16 days off of self harm Hello everyone. Lots of you have been wondering where the hell I was for the past 2 weeks. I got my phone taken away which let me spend more time with my family. Iâ€™ve had an addiction to self harm and I want self harming to be a thing of the past to be honest.

Iâ€™ll get back to my reddit now but I just wanted to clear up why I was gone for 2 weeks. I want to end this addiction now
