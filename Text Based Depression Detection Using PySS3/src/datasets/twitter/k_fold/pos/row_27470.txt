Do anyone else feel that people who are supposed to be close to you only care about who they think you are. So one time I tried to tell my mom why I have no motivation to do anything. The reason was the realization that at one point, nothing any humans do will matter cause at one point the universe will end. When I tried to explain this to her, she threatened me to not drop out of school. I'm not mad anymore about that but I thought over it and came to the conclusion that while people close to me claim they know me, thats not true and they only care about who they think I am. I guess its a logical conclusion but I still dont like it.
