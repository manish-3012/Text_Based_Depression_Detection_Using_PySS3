Asking an acquaintance out? Ok so thereâ€™s this girl Iâ€™ve known for a bit. Iâ€™m a junior now and I met her during the play at the end of my freshman year. Weâ€˜ve talked a little bit  since then, but itâ€™s been one or two conversations. Sheâ€™s in my English class this year, however itâ€™s all been on Zoom. But, this gave me a reason to talk to her (help with the class yknow). However, essentially what happens, is that Iâ€™ll text her on Snapchat asking for help, sheâ€™ll respond, Iâ€™ll try and talk about something else, and if Iâ€™m lucky sheâ€™ll respond. Anything after that has me left on delivered. Iâ€™ll text again a couple days-a week later, half because I need help and half because I want to talk to her. Once, sheâ€™s texted me first asking for help, but nothing more really came of that. Side note but I hate being left on delivered since I canâ€™t tell if theyâ€™re deliberately ignoring me or if theyâ€™re just bad at opening stuff. Anyways, Iâ€™ve tried getting us into a â€œtalking phaseâ€ and itâ€™s clearly not working for whatever reason. So fuck it should I just ask her out? Or should I just move on because asking an acquaintance out is bound to fail?
