When I was 14 I tried to impress a senior girl by doing the knife game and I stabbed my fucking finger Turns out I wasnâ€™t as good at it as I thought i was. It was at a party where the knives were actually sharpened at the tips, not like at restaurants where most of them are sort of rounded off. Shit fucking hurt and there was blood everywhere. 

Never even talked to her again after that night.
