Rage. I am rage. I am rage.

I graduated 10th grade last year, so I SHOULD have around 17 credits. I am currently in a "Fast Track" program so I can graduate earlier. 

Turns out, they cut my credits in half when I joined the Fast track program and each class I do in the program is only .5 credits.

I currently have 11.5 credits

I've done 12 classes this school year ( I take roughly 3 classes at once)
I've finished 8 of those 12
I SHOULD have enough credits to graduate IF the classes that NORMALLY give 1 credit actually gave 1 credit in the Fast Track program

Like Geometry is 1 credit normally, but .5 credits in the programThey also took away credits I earned in a different state because "they dont have that here" (I had 14.5 credits in 9th grade in New York because of MCJROTC and a couple double credit classes, but they took off the MCJROTC credit because my school doesnt have an ROTC class and halved my double credit classes, some only giving .5 credits now)

Any advice on what I should do???
