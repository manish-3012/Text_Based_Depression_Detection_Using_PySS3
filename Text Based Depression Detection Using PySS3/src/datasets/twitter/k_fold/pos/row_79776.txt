I have just had the worst 1 1/2 months of my quarantine I donâ€™t know who to describe it... I was treated so badly by a discord server full of mostly terrible people, it isnâ€™t funny. They canceled me and spread lies. Sure, the thing I did in that server was bad and unintentional, but they didnâ€™t care. It felt like they needed to take out all the anger they had in life at me. I think Iâ€™m starting to have trust issues because 2 people in that server that I actually had a good opinion on ended up exposing secrets of mine and causing me to get banned from something, respectively. I even got depression because when I was in that server, it felt like I belonged in it. When I was banned, gone are most of the people who cared and liked me. And worst of all, i canâ€™t tell a higher power the horrible things they have said and done to me, because the higher power is on thier side. So there. I have an entire discord server that hates me and making me depressed as crap. Thanks to the 7 people who have read this through.
