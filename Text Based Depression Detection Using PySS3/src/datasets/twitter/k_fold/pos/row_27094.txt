Human bites getting red and tender Alright I need some advice here. First of all, I'm serious, and this is not a joke, so keep that in mind if you comment. I don't know where else to post this, so I apologize if this is not the right place. And please spare me the lecture about how I should get myself under control and stop lashing out on myself. I'm autistic, and have a lot of sensory issues. This is just the only way I've found to prevent myself from having a meltdown and/or completely destroying the place when I get a sensory overload from washing dishes. What I'm talking about it biting my own arms, don't ask why it helps me, it just does. Yes, it hurts. Yes, I know it's bad. I just need advice on what to do now. I have to bit my arms every time, but this time it was particularly bad, and I ended up biting myself harder than usual. My left arm has many bite marks that haven't disappeared yet, when they usually would've already, and it's the same with my right, except it's two big ones. Both arms are tender and bruised from previous bites, but the right one is the one I'm most worried about. The biggest hardest bite it on that one. It's very red, and the actual mark has gone from pale sunken tooth marks to a painful red ridge. It's super bumpy, and won't go away. I'm not really sure what to do?? It's never been like this before, and I really don't want to mention it to my parents. They don't know the full extent of my issues, and I seriously don't need them worrying over me and trying to suck information out of me when I don't want to talk.
