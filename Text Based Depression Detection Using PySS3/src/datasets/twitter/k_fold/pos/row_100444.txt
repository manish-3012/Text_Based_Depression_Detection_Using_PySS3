Soo why? I just was made co-captain of the football (soccer) team in my highschool. My highschool is absolutly shit, they lost to a middle school friendly last year, twice and they are so bad that they didn't even compete in any turnoments. I didn't even have one match and for some reason the coach made me co-captain. I am a freshman btw, and so is the most of the squad. There are just like two seniors and both of them are goalkeepers (one of them is the captain). The coach is the PE teacher and the basketball coach, so he doesn't give much effort. But at least I will have game time, I hope.
