you can't imagine how exited i am!!! tomorrow i'm throwing a "party" at my house with my childhood friends that i haven't seen in a long time, i'm so happy i'll see them (don't cancel me or anything, we'll be just a couple of people, exactly what the legality of our city lets us, and they all healthy and no covid)
