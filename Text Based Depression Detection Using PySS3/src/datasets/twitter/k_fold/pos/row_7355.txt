I'm gonna gate doing this, but fuck it. TYPING OUT A SONG ON MOBILE PART 4: What is my Life by jacksepticeye Bouncin' around at the speed of sound, I'm all alone, all alone.Can you see me? No lights around Hello, hello? Hello, hello? You're so light, but your battery might die
I'm beyond words and I don't know why, God, could you deactivate? (Deactivate) My heart made of stone (Of stone)
What is my Life? (oh-o-oh) Am I doing this right? (oh-o-oh) I just realized that I might not know what the hell is going on. Fool me once, Fool me twice, I'm still gonna try! (Oh!) I'm gonna carry on, (Oh!) You can break these bones of mine, I'm still the champion! What is my Life? (oh-o-oh) my life, my life, 
(oh-o-oh) my life. 
How do I play? (Ay, ay) And I'm here to say, I'm gonna smack your ass in a major way. This game (Game, game) Is designed to play badly and that's not what a game should be!Down, down into the windy river we go, the angsty teen should know all about being in the shadows. What if this is reality and out here is the dream? I don't even know, just be the best you can be! 
What is my Life? (oh-o-oh) Am I doing this right? (oh-o-oh) I just realized that I might not know what the hell is going on. Fool me once, Fool me twice, I'm still gonna try! (Oh!) I'm gonna carry on, (Oh!) You can break these bones of mine, I'm still the champion! What is my Life? (oh-o-oh) my life, my life, 
(oh-o-oh) my life. Come along, run away with me. The more I fail, the better I feel, come at me, gravity! Good ol' Eggs Benedict, that's me, that's me! Good ol' Jacksepti-benedict! That's all I wanna be. Eggs Benedict, they're fuckin' delicious, by the way. I might need eggs benedict. Every day, every day, Eggs Benedict, Eggs Benedict, Eggs Benedict. At the end of the day we're all just tryin' to find Eggs Benedict! What is my Life? (oh-o-oh) Am I doing this right? (oh-o-oh) I just realized that I might not know what the hell is going on. Fool me once, Fool me twice, I'm still gonna try! (Oh!) I'm gonna carry on, (Oh!) You can break these bones of mine, I'm still the champion! What is my Life? (oh-o-oh) my life, my life, 
(oh-o-oh) my life.


If I do this again it will probably be Get back up, also by jacksepticeye. I've already done All the Way and 2 songs by bad lip reading.
