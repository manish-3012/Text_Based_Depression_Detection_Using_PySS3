Why am I so disorganized? Iâ€™ve lost 8 debit cards and my license 3 times over the past 3 months


. I usually find my homework crushed into a gravitational singularity at the bottom of my backpack. 

I have 2 pairs of socks left. 

I dropped a bowl of cereal this morning because I forgot it was in my hands.

I lose everything

Sometimes Iâ€™ll try to force myself to be organized but that motivation quickly dies when I find something more interesting
