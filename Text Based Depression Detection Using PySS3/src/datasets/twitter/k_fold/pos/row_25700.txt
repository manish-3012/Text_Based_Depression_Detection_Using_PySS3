Omfg I did it CONTEXT: Iâ€™ve liked a friend of mine for about a year now, but I didnâ€™t tell her, out of fear of ruining what was essentially a perfect friendship.

I was talking to said friend, and she sent an image with different words corresponding to different words that you could rate people. I said 13 (bff), and we got to talking about something else.

The next day, I worked up the courage to say â€œhey, I realized I made a typo yesterday. I said 13 when I meant 14 (my world).â€

A week later, weâ€™re dating.
