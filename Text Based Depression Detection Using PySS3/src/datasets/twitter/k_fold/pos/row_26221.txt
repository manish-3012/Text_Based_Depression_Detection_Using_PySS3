A follow-up to my shitty school for the few who cared... So I think we figured out their plan after the meeting on Friday. They want to completely open the school by the second half of the year, blame the kids for not taking education into their own hands and all this for 1.5 million dollars they didnâ€™t want to spend. Yes, thatâ€™s a lot of money but I donâ€™t think they realize that lives can change depending on someoneâ€™s education. Itâ€™s pissing me off a bit. Idk what to do. Protest is my number one option but tbh, Iâ€™m not sure how to protest from home and peacefully.
