Can someone talk some sense into me? I just left my dad after spending two weeks with him. I donâ€™t get to see him often (a couple times a year) and I was really sad when I left him. I was also upset because I left his dog, who I really miss. Sheâ€™s 16 and I donâ€™t know if sheâ€™ll be there when I visit my dad again. Iâ€™m crying uncontrollably now, and I need help but I donâ€™t want to worry my mom. Thank you.
