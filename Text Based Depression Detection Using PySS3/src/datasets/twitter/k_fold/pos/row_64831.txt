I just fucked up So i was talking with my friend on discord during my math class on zoom. So some how my mic on zoom unmuted at that moment when my friend turned on his camera and when he did that, i said get ur ugly face off my screen bcs i was watching some youtube and my teacher heard that and basicley she thought that i said that to her and i go to private school any tips what to do? i really don't want to get expelled. And she records her zoom meetings so am i fucked or is there any hope left for me not to get expelled?
