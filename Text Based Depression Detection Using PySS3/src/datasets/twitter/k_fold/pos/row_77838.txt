My achievements, my near suicide attempt, and why you shouldn't go with it. Before I begin, I want everyone who sees this to know that while I may not be able to relate exactly to your current situation, that I know what you are going through, and I want anyone who reads this to know that you can always feel free to dm me or talk to me about mental health or something you are going through, no matter what you've done or why you did it. We all need to be there for each other.

So like the title says, I started a suicidal tendency chart in mid-August and I finally surpassed one month of having my tendency levels to be less than 10 daily. 

My story: When I was 2, my mother was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma and when I was 5 she passed from it. As you can expect it left a lasting impact on me, and is a big factor in my depression and struggle with suicidal thoughts. Around March-April 2019 I started to have first signs of depression, and I started to really just lose care, in anything. I was distant, my grades would drop, and I really just lost care so fast. This spiraled fast, and I'll spare you details but it eventually led to suicidal thoughts and tendencies. With the 2020 quarantine, however, everything went way downhill. Where light suicidal thoughts turned into desperation. While some of you may not understand what I mean, I know that there will be many who relate. I began to want to die, because I thought that I was never going to be happy again. So on July 16th 2020 I grabbed my pocket knife and damn near attempted to kill myself. I never had the courage to do it. But looking back on it I knew it wasn't the right decision. I knew that if I really was going to go through with this, that if I really wanted to slice my wrists I would've done it without a care... I have yet to feel my parent anything, but due to a recent achievement I've made in my process, I'm hoping that I will soon.

Suicide is *never* the answer. I'll tell you even now I sometimes struggle to see that. I have compiled a list of varying hotlines from varying countries that you can call, and different resources that you can visit to find the help you need. Who cares what you've done. That doesn't matter anymore you can grow.

I care.

I know that almost this entire subreddit cares. 

So please if you ever are considering going through, before you do anything you're going to regret call one of these numbers or visit one of these websites and if all else fails dm me.
