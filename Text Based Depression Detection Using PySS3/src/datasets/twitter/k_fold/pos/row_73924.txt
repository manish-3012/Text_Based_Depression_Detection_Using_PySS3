Soooo I have to stay at home again... Sooo basically a teacher at my school was tested positive for Covid-19 aand the Dutch Healthcare Organization said everyone who had been in contact with her had to stay at home. I'm one of the few students of our school who has directly been jn contact with her so basically I have to stay at home until the 2nd of september. We have to "avoid crowded places, and keep distance from adults and other teens/kids". But it also said we "are allowed to go to school". But 30 kids in a classroom, I'd call that a "crowded place". 

So basically, I'm fucked. Yay.
