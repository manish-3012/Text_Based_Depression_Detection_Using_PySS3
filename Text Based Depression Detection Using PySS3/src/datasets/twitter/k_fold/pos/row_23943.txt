The time I also told choked on an airhead One time in online class I was sitting at my computer and wanted a snack,so I got an airhead I was saving from my kitchen popped half of it in my mouth and started chocking. So I pounded my chest and eventually it popped out but my nose was burning for some reason and closed my nostril (the side that didnâ€™t burn) and blew as hard as I could and it shot out of my nose after like 4 tries. 
Thank you for listening to my Ted talk
