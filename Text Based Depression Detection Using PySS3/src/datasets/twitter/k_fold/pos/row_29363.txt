Ever just get that feeling when... When you see a friend, and they seem pretty close, and you just really need a supportive hug, but you have a huge feeling it would be really awkward for them, because you are like 100 pounds lighter than them, but older by a year and a half, so it will show emotional weakness, so they see you as an old baby, so you just sit there dying from no hugs?
