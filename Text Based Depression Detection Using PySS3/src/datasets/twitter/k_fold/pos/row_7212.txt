ppl kept saying that every time a girl posts here they get hella people on their dms but i have yet to see it happen to me tf probs bcs iâ€™m 18 and i think the majority here are like 15 or 16 so they feel weird talking to someone whoâ€™s legally an adult or maybe iâ€™m just overthinking this whole concept :/
