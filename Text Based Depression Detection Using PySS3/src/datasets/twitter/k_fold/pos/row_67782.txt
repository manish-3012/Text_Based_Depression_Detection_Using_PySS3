I feel stupid I was playing in the gym at school during our break time (they let us if we wore our masks and there was only a few of us anyways), I shot the basketball, it bounced off the board and hit my crush in the face, breaking her glasses. I feel so bad considering how Iâ€™d react if that were me, also about how she didnâ€™t even care to ask who shot the ball. I feel stupid as hell. 
And yeah I just had to mention this.
