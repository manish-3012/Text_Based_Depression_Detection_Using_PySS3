What is wrong with Pop and Rap these days? Now, donâ€™t get me wrong... Iâ€™m not a hater of current pop and rap and I do listen to it pretty frequently. Problem is, every day I feel like worse and worse songs are reaching the charts and itâ€™s becoming harder and harder to find good music. So many songs these days are just so bad and have no meaning AT ALL... 

Why are we in a world that popular songs are people talking about Gang activity and Drugs? Why is a song called *â€œI am a pedo and a rapist lolâ€* allowed to be even published? What step did we take wrong for the Freddie Mercurys and Whitney Houstons to get replaced by DaBabys and Cardi Bs? Just... why?
