I'M THE SHIT  I came out of a butthole and I bathe myself in piss

Smelliest mothafucka ever known to exist I'm big and brown, like Mike Tyson's dick 

You can't even flush me, cuz I'm that fuckin' thick  

I was formed in your bowels, I come out for play time If you're healthy I'll be solid, if not, I'm slime

 I can be a tiny turd or a mothafuckin' linkin log

 If you don't let me loose then I'll be stinkin' up your booty fog 

I say that I'm the shit, and that's not a metaphor I'm a mothafuckin' poopy, the subject of folklore 

Ask anyone about me, they'll blush with shame 

Don't eat Tabasco sauce, or you'll be covered in flames

I'm the leftover nutrients your body don't need 

If I'm big enough I'll make your butthole bleed 

If you wanna talk to me after I finish this rap, 

Get yourself some taco bell and take a monster crap

 I'm a piece of feces 

Because I'm the shit 

No for real, I'm a poop

Because I'm the shit I come from your bum 

Because I'm the shit Why don't you understand? Because I'm the shit
