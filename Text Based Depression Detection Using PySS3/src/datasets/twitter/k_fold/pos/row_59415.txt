i snorted pencil grafite/lead? at school for a joke explanation: i was sitting in arts and craft class, talking to my friends about regular teen shit, and i was sharpening my pencil and i got the brilliant idea to try and snort the powder that came out of the pencil so i tried to and it was a pretty little amount.

but still, i feel pretty bad rn (i actually feel sick) and i am wondering what the fuck i am gonna do, do i have some kind of lead poisoning or some shit?? pls help
