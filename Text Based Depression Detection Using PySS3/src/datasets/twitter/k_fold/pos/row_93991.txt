Can we stop asking for advise? Ok hear me out.

I get that you need help with a situation and if it's universal then I get it, but things that's got something to do with yourself and your own personality like asking someone out or asking for relationship advise, because we CANNOT decide for you since we're not the same person. If you use a pick-up line from Reddit and it works, then it doesn't mean that it'll work for the rest of your personality. It's very simple: you are you and we cannot be you, so you've got to do the thing that YOU think is best. Don't go on reddit and ask other people, because that's not gonna last in most cases. If she doesn't like your OWN pick-up line or your personality, then it's not meant to be. Time to accept that.

Just what I wanted to say.
