I donâ€™t know where else to post this Seriously like I donâ€™t, Iâ€™m just like fuckin bawling right now. My fam is fostering a bunch of puppies and I just stayed up with one of them all night because it was sick and this morning it finally passed away and Iâ€™m just crying and crying and I donâ€™t know what to do because this was my favorite puppy and it like stuck with me for so long and now itâ€™s dead and yeah. Sorry again I donâ€™t know where else to post this Iâ€™m just really fucking sad and I donâ€™t have people to talk about this to lol.
