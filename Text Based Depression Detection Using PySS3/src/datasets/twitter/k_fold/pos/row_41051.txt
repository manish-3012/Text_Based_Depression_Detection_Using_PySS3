My whole plan has gone to shambles I had this plan that in two weeks I would ask out my crush (btw I know everyone has this story but I think mine is a little different) but recently my friend has been hanging out with this girl and well now shit I think I like her Iâ€™m not sure tho and I have only two weeks to decide who Iâ€™m going to ask out and Iâ€™ve never even asked anyone out. This is were you come in random internet man how can I find out who I like more and if I even like this second person
