r/teenagers, I need your help So, I just moved into a new school and there is this girl I like, the problem is that we are so different from one another, for example - she likes pop I like metal, she likes anime I like politics, she doesn't really like to study while I enjoy studying, etc. So, how do I find out if she has a bf/ a crush on someone else and if she has how do I avoid making it awkward. How do I confess to her without making it awkward again? And no, "moving on" isn't an option because I really like her.
P.S. some details from me - im a male teenager about to turn 14, she's already 14 but she looks 17. And if you think im karmawhoring, fuck you. And if you think that this is not the place where I should ask for advice, you maybe are right but its just a deep secret that I don't even want to tell to my parents.
