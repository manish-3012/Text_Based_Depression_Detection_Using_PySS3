Good news in fact a lot of good news If youâ€™ve been reading my posts recently about how my sister got Covid and since Iâ€™m high risk me and my dad decided to stay in our camper for about a week and Iâ€™ve now moved back into my house, my sister (my only sibling) got married yesterday and left for a weeks vacation, witch is ok, sheâ€™s now Covid free and Iâ€™ve recently been talking to a girl whoâ€™s been through a lot in her life even more then I have and thatâ€™s saying a lot weâ€™ve both have had heart transplants mine was 5 years ago hers was 6 months ago and sheâ€™s still in the hospital witch I feel bad for her I know what itâ€™s like to be in there and since covid started she canâ€™t see anyone but her parents witch is sad, weâ€™ve been talking since May and she says I brighten her day and make it easier to get through and that makes me feel so good, she means a lot to me I only want her to go home and find her new normal life, we both like each other but have agreed to stay friends since she has a lot going on right now and we live so far away, Iâ€™d rather be her best friend for life we can relate to so many things and we are into a lot of the same things, and I might add boyfriend-girlfriend relationships only last so long friends are forever, I do worry and care about her not because I like her, but because weâ€™re such good friends. Iâ€™m really hoping she can go home by the end of august.


Iâ€™m going to leave you guys with these words donâ€™t take your life for any reason, you might be the only person that makes someone happy, Iâ€™ve been close to death a couple times and I can say itâ€™s great to alive no matter how shitty my life gets, and hey be a true friend to your friends tell them how much you like hanging out with them.

Thanks for coming to our ted talk
