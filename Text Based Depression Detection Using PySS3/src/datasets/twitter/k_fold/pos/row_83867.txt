Donâ€™t you love it when a character is both best girl, and best boy https://interspecies-reviewers.fandom.com/wiki/Crimvael

This is crim, from the best, and most controversial, anime of 2020, interspecies reviewers! Crim goes by a he, in the show, which they explain this most in episode 3.  His outward appearance is rather feminine, but, as explained, in episode 3, he has both, sexual organs. This was to much for me, I shouldnâ€™t have gone into this to much.
