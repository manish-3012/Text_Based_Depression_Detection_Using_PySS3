maybe im weird but idk me and this guy that i met while i was watching someone's stream on twitch have been texted for probably like a month or so and he says he likes me which i have no clue why but that's not important. but he always says "i love you" to me and i kinda feel like i have to say that i love him too but i don't have those kinds of feelings towards him yet but i also don't want to sound "mean" idk, i just wanna seem like a really nice person all the time and i don't know what to do. he's a really nice guy and i don't wanna hurt his feelings by said i don't really truly love him but i don't know what else to do. i think i said enough to kind of understand what's happening but im not sure if i explained it good enough. what should i do because im so confused, it's not like i can't just ignore him saying that
