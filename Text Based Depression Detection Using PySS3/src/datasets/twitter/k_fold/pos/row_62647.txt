I think I just fcked up big time There's this guy who was a friend I guess you could call it (I'm a girl) and he sounded really sad during online class. We haven't talked in a while (by that I mean a year+) and I asked him out of the blue if he was alright because idk dumb me thought it was caring and I care about him. Then he was all confused and said he's alright and asked me how I was doing. I think it looks like I was missing him or something I wanna die idk what in saying rn lol still haven't responded
