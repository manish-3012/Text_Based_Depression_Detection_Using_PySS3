Im stuck. So... I've had a gf for 2 months now and I really like her. The thing is, I'm stuck between "I'm too young for this" and "I really really like her". I don't know what to choose. On one hand, I feel like I am too young, on the other, if I broke up with her she and her friends would probably hate me and I don't want that to happen.
