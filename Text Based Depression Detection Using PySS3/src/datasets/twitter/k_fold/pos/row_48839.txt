Sheâ€™s such a little baby bitch So weâ€™re on a vacation in Idaho (I know we shouldnâ€™t be, but I didnâ€™t have a say in it).  We had a good time at the water park, and when we were leaving my sister gave our dad HIS drink.  He was carrying a big bag btw.  My dadâ€™s girlfriend said â€œCome on, you can carry that. Your dad has been carrying things all day,â€ (not really but ok).  My dad said â€œItâ€™s fine, itâ€™s my drink anyways,â€, and then his girlfriend said â€œNo, sheâ€™s being lazy,â€.  The drink weighs like a pound, it doesnâ€™t fucking matter.  You hold it if you care that much

90% of the time I talk to her (and most of the time I hear her talk) sheâ€™s yelling at me (or someone) for something petty.  Not washing a dish.  Being inside all day.  Not taking a shower soon enough. 

If my dad ever marries his girlfriend (I really hope not). Iâ€™ve decided to never say â€œMy step-mom,â€ to anyone, but â€œMy dadâ€™s wife,â€.  My dad isnâ€™t strict at all, so that might be why Iâ€™m reacting like this.  But am I being a baby? I just think sheâ€™s immature.  I have more rant posts up about other things that might give you some context
