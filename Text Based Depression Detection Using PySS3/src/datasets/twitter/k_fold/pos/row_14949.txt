Finally, ended my friendship w my best friend (17M)  

March 10, 2021, is the date I ended my friendship with my best friend after I got to see his true colors. He was my best friend for over 2 years.

So it started around mid-October when I saw him being actually jealous of me. He would just randomly go through my following and just send requests to the girls I was friends with and after a few days or weeks of talking with them, he would brainwash the girls how big of a jerk I was. He tried convincing so many people the same and most of them fell into his trap. (I am no simp, but I do respect girls) and he's out calling his girlfriend wh\*\*e and sh\*t.

He wouldn't stop brainwashing and talking shi\*t about me till the person unfollowed and removed me from Snapchat.

My one close friend contacted me telling me how he tried brainwashing her as well but she kind of had faith and me, so she let me know.

After this brainwashing thing I had lost over 10s of friends. And he slowly tried to figure it out that I knew what he was up to.

I still acted like I didn't know what did he do but told him to meet him in person just to f him up but every time he refused.

I tried calling him yesterday, but he rejected my phone call and something struck me as I shouldn't let this continue and ended my friendship, I'm sure he did the same months ago.

Sometimes the people closest are the people your parents say you should stay away from.

I've got to find a new friend circle which is difficult with a destroyed image. I thank this universe for letting me know this life lesson at a young age so that I don't make a mistake of opening myself to such an extent to any other person.
