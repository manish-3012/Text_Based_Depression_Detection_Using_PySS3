Should I just stop trying? So I have the biggest crush on this girl, sheâ€™s amazing but... She doesnâ€™t seem interested, or like she drops a hint here and there but then there are these moments where I feel like: You donâ€™t feel the same do you?
So idk, should I just stop trying? Iâ€™ve done so many things, things I wouldnâ€™t do for just a friend, but now itâ€™s starting to feel pointless.
Will my heart just break even more if I keep going? Idk, what do you guys think?
