To you "Incels" on this sub. You aren't incels. If you are under 20, you aren't an incel. Unless you truly have the worst genes then you aren't an incel. At this age you can go to the gym (unless COVID), get good sleep, have a good diet and do general body excersizes and improve your environmental factors to become better good looking (which is the most important thing in dating)

Teens, you aren't incels. Coming from a 20 year old.
