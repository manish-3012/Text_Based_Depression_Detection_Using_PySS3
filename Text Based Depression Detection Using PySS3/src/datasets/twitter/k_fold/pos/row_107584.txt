I'm in a bit of a pickle... Hey there. Let me introduce myself: I'm a 17 y.o., interested in science and video games. Lately, I haven't been feeling too good due to one single thing - a friend of mine. 
	I have known him for 3-4 years now. He's close to me, he was one of my best friends, but lately, we haven't been on the best terms. We often have arguments that result in extended periods of "silence."
	Now we get to the part that I need help with: why can't I get him out of my mind? I often have anxiety attacks due to the mere thought of him. At nights, when I'm left alone with my thoughts, I break down crying, thinking about him and the things that we've been through. 
	I care about him, but I couldn't possibly think that this would bring me to my knees. F.Y.I: I'm a male. I still don't know my sexual orientation. This can't be love, can it? 
	Talking about my mental health - it's terrible. I constantly overpush myself during my studies, and I face immense pressure from my family and myself to achieve academic success. My social skills are despicable, so I only have a few close friends. As you can imagine, not a lot of people to talk to about such topics. 
	So, what should I do with my friend? If I block him, I won't stop thinking about him, which will lead me to madness. If I continue speaking to him, my mental health will continue to deteriorate. If I tell him how I feel, he might react negatively, worsening the situation even more.
