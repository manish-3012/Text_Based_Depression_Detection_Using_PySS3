Life isn't getting any better I feel like im all alone in this world my grandpa has emphysema in both lungs he has chronic lung disease and stage 3 lung cancer i feel like my parents hate me bc they are always scolding me and yelling at me (especially my dad) my dad treats  my sister like a princess im 14m btw i have no friends and the ones i had stabbed me in the back then left me. 

TL:DR my life sucks
