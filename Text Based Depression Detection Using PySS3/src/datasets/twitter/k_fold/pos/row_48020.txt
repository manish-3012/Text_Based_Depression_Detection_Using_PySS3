My English teacher was suprised when she found out I learnt Japanese from anime... So yesterday my English teacher hosted a test on sentences and adjectives. Many of my class mates got a low grade...so today she said â€œwe will be improving our Englishâ€ (English is my second language so many people in my class canâ€™t speak it fluently)so then she said
â€œIâ€™ll ask you some stuff and you give me answersâ€ then she called me and asked â€œDid you learn anything during this quarantine? I did not learn anything in the quarantine so I was like Kuso...(which meant aww man in Japanese)and I was like â€hey!â€ I learned Japanese in quarantine!
And I said that to my teacher... she was like â€œinteresting, did you take any classes online?â€
I said no the she said â€œwhere did you learn it?â€
I said on a website, she replied â€œdulingo?â€ I was like no r then she asked â€œwhich websiteâ€
I said â€œCrunchyroll.comâ€, all my classmates started giggling..she said everyone turn off your camera why are you giggling?
I was about to say to her that itâ€™s an anime website but she said tell me some Japanese words..
So I did then. She was like let me check this crunchyroll website even Iâ€™m interested in learning Japanese and opened it on her phone and was like â€œis the URL correct? Crunchyroll.comâ€
I said yes..the she was like â€œwhy is it showing some kind of cartoon Netflix?â€ Then my friend said â€œitâ€™s where you watch anime!â€ She was like â€œwhatâ€™s anime?â€ The me and by friends explained her what anime is....
And she said.
â€œSo you are telling me that you learned Japanese by watching these Japan cartoons?â€
Thatâ€™s wonderful!
