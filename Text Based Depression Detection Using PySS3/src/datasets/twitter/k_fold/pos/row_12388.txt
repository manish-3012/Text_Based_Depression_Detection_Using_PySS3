Why donâ€™t i want to eat? iâ€™m 13 and For some reason, iâ€™m never too bothered about eating, not because i feel like iâ€™m gaining weight but i can never be bothered or have the motivation to go get some PROPER food, sometimes when iâ€™m hungry i just eat a cookie and thatâ€™s it. i donâ€™t eat breakfast, sometimes eat lunch and sometimes dinner why do i barely feel like eating?
