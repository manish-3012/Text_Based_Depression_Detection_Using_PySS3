My school is horrible and it doesn't even care about our rights This happened last winter. One of the two school's janitors got sick therefore, the other janitor would have a lot more work(the school isn't that big anyway). So, 2 students from my class were asigned to clean the classroom, and take out the trash. Problem is, one day they forgot to do this, and we all went to our homes. That same day the ministry of education organised unannounced inspections, and found all the trash in our classroom, so they had a talk with the school's principal. The principal got so mad, the next day he called ALL of us outside the school, to clear the snow out of the way from the other teachers parking spots. Of course,it was freezing outside and everybody got a serious cold as we stood there for quite some time. Another day we carried some benches from a class to another just because "That's how the principal wills". This all happened after school. The main school gate was locked as well. 

Another thing that happened, was when I was going to buy some snacks with a friend(he had shorts because it was summer and 38Â°) and the principal got mad about it and he just kicked his leg so hard, the poor guy almost screamed.

Most teachers think they are above all of us, and that they can treat us like shit.I hate my school.
