Iâ€™m trying to upload an Image Post, but the Subreddit wonâ€™t allow me. So, I tried uploading a stupid comment meme I made about Death Metal Growls, yet I canâ€™t post the damn comment and it says It doesnâ€™t allow it. Like WTF, I mean Iâ€™d get it if the mods wouldnâ€™t allow Image posts, but câ€™mon man, theyâ€™re allowing other teens to make image posts. So why canâ€™t I? Is there something wrong with my Goddamn Phone, or am I just being an Idiot?
