I think it's getting bad again lol This isn't fair
I did everything I could but you fucking left me
I loved you, so fucking much
We used to sit in that car park and listen to music together
Now we can't even hold a fucking conversation
I did everything for you
I changed my makeup, my personality, my music taste
But you left me for someone else
I genuinely think I loved you
