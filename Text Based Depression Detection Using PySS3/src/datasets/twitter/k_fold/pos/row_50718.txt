Hey, so I wanna try something My english teacher is making us write short stories and it including a horror aspect (A. Because its Halloween and B. It's the program theme)

.

I'm flushed out of new ideas so, I wanted to try something, 

.

I'm not sure if this is against the rules or not but I wanted you guys to give me an idea! I feel like this would be a fun thing to do, so why not try it! The only thing I want is like a sentence or 2 to start it off, and by the end of tomorrow, I'll look and read everyone's, and choose one that I kinda like the most, (and I'll dm you if you want some sort of credit : ) ) 

.

So, have at it!
