How the hell are you supposed to spar with a girl without it feeling like sexual assault? It just feels so wrong when I'm doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and I get matched up with a girl as my sparring partner. Like, BJJ requires a lot of touching, pressure on sensitive areas, and... smothering. A chick straight up almost suffocated me with her chest area this evening. It becomes even more awkward when I inevitably get a boner, and there's no way she doesn't notice it since she's literally sitting directly on it, made even worse by the fact that it's nofap season. Martial artists of r/teenagers, how actually the hell do y'all do it and actually focus on the technique?
