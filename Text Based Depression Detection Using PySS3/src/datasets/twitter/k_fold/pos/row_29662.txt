It's happening I've been a straight-A student my entire life and now I'm basically failing algebra.  My parents are super uptight about grades and stuff and this is new to them, and me. I also want to mention that this is an advanced algebra class and I also have A's in every other class. Is this the fall of another "Gifted" kid? If this has happened to you can you give me some advice or stories in the comments section, thanks.
