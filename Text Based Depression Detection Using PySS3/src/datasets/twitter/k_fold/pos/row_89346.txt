A common misconception between pog and poggers Pog is a emote on twitch which most people know, people use it when something awesome happens. Poggers is the same thing but with things with fortnite and games mainly made for little kids. Twitch users use it as a sarcastic way of saying "wow fortnite is epic!" 

I know some of reddit doesnt like fortnite, so to those people in that part of the hivemind I wouldn't recommend saying that. And if you used poggers just like pog on twitch you would probably made fun of and be called a "normand"

Also I am not making fun of fortnite, as long as you are having fun with it, it is fine with me :)
