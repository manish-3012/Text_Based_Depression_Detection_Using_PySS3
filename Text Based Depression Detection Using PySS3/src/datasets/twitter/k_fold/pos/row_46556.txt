I think this girl is saying she likes me through music A few weeks ago she sent me a video of her dancing to single ladies. (We dated last summer). Today we were in a FaceTime call for 6 hours and she put on one song and the lyrics were â€œwe werenâ€™t perfect but Iâ€™ve never felt this way before with anyoneâ€. Or am I just over thinking it?
