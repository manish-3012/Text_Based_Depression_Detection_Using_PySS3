LGBTQ+ situation in Malaysia Iâ€™m sure most of you saw a petition about Malaysia. So let me clear the air. Such punishments have been denounced by our previous prime minister. There has only been 3 cases of people being punished by practising LGBT+ activities. The petition was made two years ago when a lesbian couple tried to have sex in their car. Majority of Malaysia DO NOT CARE if youâ€™re gay or not. The three punishments were only conducted cuz they did it in PAS controlled areas. PAS is a very religious political party, imagine your church taking over your country, itâ€™s just that. Thereâ€™s not much areas controlled by PAS. The religious court is responsible for these punishments. The polis donâ€™t care if you are gay or not. Itâ€™s the really holy Muslims and Christians that report on these people to the religious police. Yes thereâ€™s still consequences but only you get reported by those aunties or uncles who are very religious Christians or Muslims. So please donâ€™t spread false information.
