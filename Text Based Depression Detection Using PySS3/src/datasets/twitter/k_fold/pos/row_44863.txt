i must share my opinion on the trollface it's fucking awesome in my opinion. it's rarely used because so many people dislike it, unlike doge which is a pretty common meme. i like stuff like almost every meme at first, but then i just get bored of it cuz they used so often. in fact, i like all forms of rage comics because i rarely see on most meme subs.
