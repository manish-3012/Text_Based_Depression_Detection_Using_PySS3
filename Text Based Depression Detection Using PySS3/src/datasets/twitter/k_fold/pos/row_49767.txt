Iâ€™m just so fucking tired Iâ€™m 18.  

Iâ€™m at my first choice school, (albeit online for the moment because America) Iâ€™m majoring in one of my passions, and Iâ€™m gonna have a roof over my head as the weather gets cold and the holidays approach.

I should be ecstatic.  This should be the best time of my life.  But itâ€™s not.  Itâ€™s hell on earth.

My parents are both bipolar nightmares to live with.  My best friends are all either too busy or too far away to hang out or talk.  My gf is the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me but she lives in the next state over so we never see each other.  I canâ€™t remember to take my antidepressants reliably and I donâ€™t know how to fix it.  And on top of all that, Iâ€™m trying to lose weight and finally be healthy for the first time in my life but thatâ€™s a long, difficult journey in and of itself.

Every day I wake up and I hear about how the country and the world has no future and how Iâ€™ll never be able to have my own family and a stable career like those before me did.  Every day I hear about how itâ€™s all up to Gen Z to fix the last twenty years of fuckups that we werenâ€™t even socially conscious for most of.

Iâ€™m so tired.  So tired of living here and going through the motions every day with none of the things that make life *worth* living.  So tired of the weight of the world resting on my shoulders and breaking my back.  So tired of living with mental illness.

Iâ€™m just so fucking tired.
