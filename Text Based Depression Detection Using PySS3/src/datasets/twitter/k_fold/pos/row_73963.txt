Why the fuck is social media like this? So my cousin who is 14 got obsessed with looking into serial killers, and read books like the darkling, shit with damon salvatore, and other books with edgy men in them. All of this was because of social media, and how it influenced her to think like this. She thought it was cool and constantly went on about how ted bundy was hot. She then met a 23 year old man. She thought he was cute, and GOT IN HIS FUCKING CAR. She then was kidnapped and raped over the course of 2 days.

Stop pushing the narrative that dangerous men are hot. Itâ€™s fucking scary, and most of the people that think so are girls under the age of 18. Media is what starts this shit. Fucking stop, joking or not.
