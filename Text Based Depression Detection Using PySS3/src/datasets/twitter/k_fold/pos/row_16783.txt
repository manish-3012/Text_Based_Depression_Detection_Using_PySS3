Pt2 to another redditors rant        A while ago on r/teenagers I saw a post about that fat kids are fat because of their parents because they don't listen to their kids that they are full and that they don't need more food, I blew it off as "yeah whatever" until today. For context I have been in a growth spurt for the past 3 years and have grown average of 3.5 inches per year, eating like crazy whilst keeping a good body.

       for the past couple days I have been feeling less hungry and today I got open about it and I finished my meal 3/4 the way through  and said I'm full; I usually finish my meal the fastest and my sister finishes last, I wait until the end of dinner, because I thought that they understood that I was full, and I didn't have to finish it (my sister often doesn't eat all her food and gives it to my stepdad), so I thought I was fine. Boy was I fucking wrong.

         Dinner is being cleaned and My stepdad looks at my plate and says "why haven't you eaten all your food" I say "I'm not hungry" he stands up and starts yelling at me, my mom advocates for me and says he isn't hungry.

       Mom takes him into their room and I hear the most fucking angry tone anyone could hear yelling "what the fuck he hasn't said I'm not hungry in forever, why is he not hungry now" he comes out, mom in tears, and fuckin yells at me again "you fuckin eat your food or I'm taking your phone, xbox, and you're grounded for a month.  I sit there sobbing and eating my food one rice grain at a time.

Sorry for the wall of text and possible grammar mistakes I'm on phone. I just needed to get a rant out and feel like someone cares about me. 

I probobly will not comment it is 12:30 and I'll get my ass beat if they find out I'm on my phone ranting this.

Goodnight, goodmorning, and good afternoon to y'all, I hope you're having a better night or day than me. See ya later
