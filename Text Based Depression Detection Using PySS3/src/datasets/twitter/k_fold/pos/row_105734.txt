When was the last time you felt something. When was the last time you felt something,
Really felt something 

When you lay down in your bed did you feel the smooth cold cotton, the warm embracing blanket or the threded pillow carrying your heavily crafted thoughts telling you to rest?
Or did you just lay there wonder how your going to get through?

When you waved your hand did you feel the air dance around like a baltering moon drinker of the night, ever so carefully planed like something from the start?
Or was that hand being moved by hate to end a bond you have known since time began?

When you were out in the rain did you feel the water hit your face like the world was telling you to be pure in mind as its wheel turns?
Or where you running to shelter leaving those ways intact so you could wallow in what could have been?

The bed is waiting, the air untouched, and the water riseing forever up 

So I ask you again my traveler.

When was the last time you felt something Alive?
