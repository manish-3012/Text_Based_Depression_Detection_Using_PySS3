Can anybody explain why parents are so goddamn stubborn? Fair warning, you are about to read a rant. Turn back now if you wish to avoid this.

My dog is absolutely terrified of the "bing" noise that facebook and facebook messenger notifications make. I understand how to turn off these sounds so that I can keep my notification volume up. My parents, on the other hand, opted to never address the problem and just keep their phones on vibrate. Forever.

I have told them each about 20 times "I can stop the noises, just give me your phone for 2 minutes" but they both say that they're fine with keeping their phone silent.

But they aren't! Both of them bitch about each other never picking up their goddamn phones because they're both always on silent! Neither of them can hear when a text or a call comes through because their hearing is fucked and they can't feel their phones vibrate!

Can anybody explain this logic? Why would anybody live for YEARS with a problem that could be fixed painlessly in 2 minutes? I'm absolutely stumped.
