Watching part of Dreams Minecraft SMP just literally like, made me sad? Disappointed? There are so many streamers, so many that try so hard. I watched SapNap for about half an hour just now, and he literally did.. nothing..? He probably made well over 1000 dollars just while i was watching him, and it literally wasnt entertaining? It was sad? That he could just sit there mining blocks and repeating thr same thing more than 5 times over and over (his height?), and would just succeed more than anyone else could imagine. 

I habe multiple friends that are absolutely in love with those streams and try to get me into them, and it literally makes no sense? Like, like what you like, i wont judge that, but it literally makes me sad? And confused?

Ig this is a rant, but i am like legitimately now sad bc of it.
