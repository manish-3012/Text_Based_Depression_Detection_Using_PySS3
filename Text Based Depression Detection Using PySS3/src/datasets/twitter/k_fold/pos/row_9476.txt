I am starting to like country music ðŸ˜Ÿ Tik tok has introduced me to some actually pretty good country songs. I was surprised I liked it too. Anyways here are the top three so far (feel free to add): 7 Summers- Morgan Wallen, God Made Girls- RaeLynn, and Drinkinâ€™ Problem- Midland. Theyâ€™re just so catchy and soothing I caNNOT. I never thought Iâ€™d like this genre of music but here I am.
