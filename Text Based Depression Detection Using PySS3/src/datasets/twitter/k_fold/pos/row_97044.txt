So idk whatâ€™s going on with me? Before we start I just wanna say Iâ€™m autistic so I have no idea wether or not this relates to that but here it is. I was scrolling through instagram when I saw a post about the whole â€œPedophilia is a sexuality not a crimeâ€ article that popped up back in July and it was one of those IGTV posts with a guy in a suit talking behind a TV. And strangely it wasnâ€™t the subject matter he was talking about that is making me feel this way, however it was the image displayed on the TV behind him. It was a little girl who looked no more than 4 hugging her teddy bear while looking horribly distressed. I donâ€™t know why but this image threw me WAY off. I just didnâ€™t feel anything or any desire to do anything. Iâ€™m not sure if it was me seeing my younger sister like this after getting yelled at a few weeks back just like the picture (Iâ€™m not gonna say why) but I just felt...weird. Anyways sorry for the whole essay but I felt I needed to get this off my chest.
