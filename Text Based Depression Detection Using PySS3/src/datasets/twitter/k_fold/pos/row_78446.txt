My mom is trying to force me into liking stuff I donâ€™t want to do, and Iâ€™m so goddamn sick of it The title pretty much says it all. I (18F) have recently gotten into some new hobbies and interests cause quarantine has given me a lot of time to just explore new things and all that. 

Anyways. A lot of stuff I used to be interested in when I was like 13 or whatever isnâ€™t really stuff I care about any more, and I assume thatâ€™s natural, right? I mean people change, they grow and they develop new interests, thatâ€™s normal. 

My mom doesnâ€™t seem to get that. She constantly keeps nagging me, saying stuff like how I need other interests, how I should be doing other stuff that involves being more social with others and has me getting out of the house more. 

She keeps telling me I should be helping my older sister with her business, which is making felt animals to sell to kindergarten teachers. She always says stuff like â€œoh but you like designâ€ and â€œyou like working on tings like this.â€ 

NO I DONâ€™T! I mightâ€™ve enjoyed making scrapbooks when I was 13/14, but not anymore! I have new interests now, Iâ€™ve explored new things, and Iâ€™m different!

Apparently, though, my hobbies arenâ€™t â€œgood enoughâ€ for her. Apparently my hobbies and interests arenâ€™t â€œChristian enoughâ€ for her. Yes she actually said this. 

Iâ€™m so sick of it. People change. I get that itâ€™s probably hard to see your kids growing up, but she is way too clingy. She needs to control every aspect of life, and Iâ€™m fucking sick of it. 

Anyways, thatâ€™s about it. I know I got a little off topic, but whatever. The point is, my mom is trying to make me feel say for liking things she doesnâ€™t. This has been going on for months. And Iâ€™m tired of it.
