surgery I had surgery yesterday for my meniscus after I tore it in wrestling and it hurts like hell. when I woke up after surgery it hurt really bad and they gave me another nerve block. just wondering if yall had any surgeries and how bad was the pain. also if you took opiods how drowsy did they make you since I'm trying online school and I want to take the pain away but not trying to look high while trying to pay attention
