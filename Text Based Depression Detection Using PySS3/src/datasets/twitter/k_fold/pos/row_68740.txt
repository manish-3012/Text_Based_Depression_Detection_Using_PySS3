A bit of advice for people who donâ€™t like gym classes. Tearing your ACL will get you out of gym. I tore my ACL playing football and boom I was out of gym for the rest of the year. It was great to just sit in the corner and play MTG with my friends. Do keep in mind it is really painful and I already have arthritis in my knee from the surgery.
