I thought being 15 would be so cool, but nah, its lame asf I always looked up at my friends who were 15 and saw how happy n tall they were. Cuz like.. 15 is literally between a teenager and an adult. One day youre talking about when youre gonna start driving and another day youre gonna start building a lego space shit. Its like both responsibilities combine into one human. But now that im 15, (not tryna sound like an e-boy bitch or whatever but) life is fuckin lame and depressing. I now see how they acted so happy on the inside, but deep down..... Nvm ill sound emo. And im not even that tall! Wtf god! (Im 5'3",  yea, can u believe that?)
