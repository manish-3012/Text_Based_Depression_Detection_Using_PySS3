I feel a little hurt now. I was talking to this girl, we both established to each clear interest and made this official. I asked her to homecoming, she said she's not allowed to go. 

Fast forward to homecoming, I see her tagged in an Instagram post with her... at homecoming. So it seems she lied to me, completely, to add salt to my wounds she was with one of my least favorite people who we'll call Jamie. 

 I'm close to texting the girl who lied to me about it, or one of her friends who she went with. I'm thinking I don't have anything to say to her and should just ghost her.
