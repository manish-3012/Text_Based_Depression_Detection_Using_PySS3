I want (mostly) Indians to read this post As you all know that recently Halloween happened which isn't a festival in India so we could just see their celebration. So I want all of you Indians to post Diwali wishes and all the Diwali related posts also so we can also show that Indians aren't less celebrating festivals

NON - INDIANS - DIWALI IS A FESTIVAL OF INDIA WHICH IS THE BIGGEST FESTIVAL CELEBRATED IN INDIA, ON DIWALI WE BURST CRACKERS, LIGHT DIYAS TO CELEBRATE THIS OCCASION
