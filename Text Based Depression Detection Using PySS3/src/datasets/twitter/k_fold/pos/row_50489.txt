Finally broke up with my emotionally abusive boyfriend of 1 year. I ended my relationship rn and feel a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I was with a guy who put me through hell and back. He stalked me and hid behind cars and watched me hang out with my friends numerous times even though I told him not to. Every time I told him not to do things like that, he said he just missed me a lot and couldn't help it, and worst of all, he molested me and expected me to forgive him. There have been so many messed up things about the relationship, and I tried leaving him several times. When I tried to leave, he would start crying and guilt-tripping me. Oh! I must mention, he threatened his life on numerous occasions too if I ever left him. I finally had enough and left him. I want to let all the guys and girls out there, consider your feelings and well being in a relationship and don't endure bs just to make your partner feel better all the time and justify his/her wrongdoings.
