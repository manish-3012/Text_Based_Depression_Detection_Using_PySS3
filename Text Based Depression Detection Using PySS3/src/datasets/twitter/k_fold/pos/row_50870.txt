Stop making your sexuality/gender your whole life Back Story: I was playing Among Us and this dude was saying that he is gay. I told him congrats and stuff, just being inclusive. After the match he says he's gay again, and I said "Okay, no one asked, being gay isn't an accomplishment, stop trying to get attention."


My Point: Homosexuals of Reddit, please know that just because you like the opposite sex, it doesn't mean you're special. Honestly, I don't care about your sexuality or preference. It doesn't matter to me. No, I'm not going to alienate you, or single you out. I just don't give a fuck about you. Sure, coming out the closet is a huge thing, but please don't try and milk attention out of people just because you're different.

Disclaimer: Nothing I say is offensive and if it is then ignore it because I don't care. I just came here to make a point. That's all.
