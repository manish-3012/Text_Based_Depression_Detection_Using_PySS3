Is it just me, or do I think that the majority of the world this that the corruption of China on the entire country, and not the government? I donâ€™t understand, why would you blame the corruption on the people of China, who little to no bad things to cause that would corrupt China? The corruption is originated from the government. Take, for example, the Tiananmen Square massacre. We all know what happened in this event. Well, guess what the people were protesting for? A VOICE IN THE GOVERNMENT. And guess what? The government decided to just put a stop to the protests by killing their own people. THEIR OWN PEOPLE. So, what am I saying here? Am I saying we should assassinate Xi? No. Am I saying we should declare war on China? No. Am I saying that we should just tell China to stop doing such corrupt things? Yes. AND,DO NOT FORGET ABOUT THIS THING: CHINA IS TORTURING UIGHUR VIA RAPE AS A KEY TACTIC.
