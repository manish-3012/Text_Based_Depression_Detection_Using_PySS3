Reddit has given me the opportunity to make new friends in real life, and I couldnâ€™t be more grateful. I donâ€™t know if this is the right place to post, but I really want to tell someone. 

I like to stream on r/RedditSessions occasionally. One night, about two months ago, I was streaming at midnight (I was bored) and I got around 4K viewers. 
After I finished the stream, I got a DM from someone:

â€œHow the fuck do yuo have 700 followrrrsâ€

Spelled exactly like that. I had mentioned during the stream that I had a lot of followers on Reddit. 
I responded. I quickly realized that he was your average Redditor: a 14 yr old boy. 

We talked for a while, then discovered that we live in the same state. Turns out we live about 45 minutes from each other.
He wanted to talk some more, so we switched over to Instagram for a bit, so that I could see his face and make sure that heâ€™s not a 60 yr old man. 

To save time for anyone reading this, long story short we ended up FaceTiming every night for almost 2 weeks. He introduced me to a few of his friends, who I now consider my friends. He convinced me to buy Minecraft (I only bedrock up until then) and added me to a realm with his friends, along with a discord server with all of them. 
I played daily, and still do, talking with people on the server as we play. 

Today is his birthday, so yesterday I went to his his house for a party and finally met him and 3 of his friends in real life!! 
It was awesome, and Iâ€™m so grateful that I got to make new friends from Reddit. Not to mention some one the nicest and funniest people Iâ€™ve ever met. 

Ben, if you happen to see this, happy birthday!!


And for anyone else reading this, I apologize for the length of this.
