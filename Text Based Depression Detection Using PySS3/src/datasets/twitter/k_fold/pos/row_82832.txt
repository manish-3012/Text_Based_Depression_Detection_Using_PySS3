Please read this, i need some help So this post is all about me (13M) and my crush (14F)
So for the past 2 months we have been texting and videocalling everyday, A few weeks ago we and some other guys were trying to find eachothers crushes, and I didn't want to say mine, but I did say 2 names, I think she figured it out right there and then. She said to me she has a crush on someone in our friendgroup, i thought it was me, but now i'm not sure anymore, now she doesn't text back as often and when we are calling she will often invite other people into the call. Please give me some advice.
