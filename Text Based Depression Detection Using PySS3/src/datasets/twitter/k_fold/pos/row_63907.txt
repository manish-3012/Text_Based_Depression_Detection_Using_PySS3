I feel like Europeans (and other non americans) got a small hint of what the american education system is like. And all it took was a global pandemic and poorly organized homeschooling. I've been so stressed with school these last few months and cried 3 times just because i couldn't get anything done and it was way too much (my teachers didn't communicate and probably forgot i have other homework to make. Normally in lessons we can tell a teacher we can't do something because we have a test next day and they'll reduce the homework). Anyway I thought 'this is how most american teens must feel in their normal lives. And i just wanna say i'm sorry that your country sucks.
