Change is possible. RDJ is proof people change. So if you believe the person that hurt you canâ€™t change, think again and give em another go if they say theyâ€™ve changed. 


Every mistake I make, I push myself to learn where I went wrong and I fix it. I made one in the past month and Iâ€™ll be damned if I didnâ€™t fix myself.
