Are my friends selfish or am I? So we have a summerhouse and I have friends there. And I have friends here. For the last few months me and my friends here have been playing games together but last few weeks my friends at the summerhouse have been all over me wanting me to stop playing games with my friends here and chat with them. I went there and the first few days were fun but one time I refused coming and they kicked me from our server. It stayed like that for a few days and when I came back they wanted me to stop playing with my friends here and play only with them. But whenever I went there they just stopped talking and went to play on their own. So after that when they called me I just ignored and continued playing with my friends here. Yesterday they called me and said it was urgent so I went. And when I was there they threaten me with beating me up when I come to the summerhouse if I didn't stop playing with my friends here. So we argued and I blocked them on every connection we had. And it got me thinking was I being selfish not hanging with them or were they selfish wanting me to play games only with them?
