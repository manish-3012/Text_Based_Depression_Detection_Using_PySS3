Day 4 of quote till i get a gf â€œI love life...Yeah, I'm sad, but at the same time, I'm really happy that something could make me feel that sad. It's like...It makes me feel alive, you know. It makes me feel human. The only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt something really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good. So I guess what I'm feeling is like a beautiful sadness.â€

Also something i learned, u know that annoying ass pop up thatâ€™s like â€œUndo Typingâ€. Well if u accidentally delete something and u click undo on that it reappears.
