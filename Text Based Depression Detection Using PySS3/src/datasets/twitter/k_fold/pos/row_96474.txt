Can you guys draw Donald Trump on MS Paint using only the default colors? Please post the result in the comments.
Reason will be explained below but please don't read it until after you draw him.

Reason:
&gt;! The reason is because I want to perform a test on human color perception and how it might be heavily corelated to context. The idea started out when I was on Photoshop making a meme and colorpicked Trump's hair and it was closer to white than yellow now and yet the cartoon illustrations of him depict him with having clear yellow hair. Now after this, I started to wonder; is it because he's blonde and blonde is often drawn with a vibrant yellow? Or maybe it's cause I just wanted you guys to draw Donald Trump!&lt;
