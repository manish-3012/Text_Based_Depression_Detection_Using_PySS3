Having a gf/bf will make you happier person in some cases I have seen people say that just because you end up in relationship it won't make you happy, and while I do agree with that to certian extent it's also worth pointing out that it depends on reason why you are sad.

If let's say your sadness comes from being lonely, having a SO that you love and who loves you by your side will make you a happier person, it all depends on circumstances.
