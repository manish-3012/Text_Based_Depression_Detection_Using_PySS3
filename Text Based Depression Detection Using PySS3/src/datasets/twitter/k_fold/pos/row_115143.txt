I turn 18 tomorrow. This doesnâ€™t feel the way I thought it would. In movies this is supposed to be a celebration of my independence. I just feel like iâ€™ve let myself down. Tomorrow  I will have dinner with my family, maybe blow out a candle, and sleep. A celebration of my independence. This sucks.
