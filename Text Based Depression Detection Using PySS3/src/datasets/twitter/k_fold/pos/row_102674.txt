Don't circumcise your children please Specifically boys, since in most places it's not legal to circumcise girls anyway (yes, girls can be circumcised) 

I recall reading a post on r/MenRights written by a man who claims that he used to be a street fighter, and was loaded with tattoos, very high pain tolerance. He decided to be circumcised as an adult, and apparently that was his breaking point. He says it's the most painful thing he'd ever experienced. And we're doing this to newborn babies. What the fuck? Why is that even legal? 

Also, I've read that it can cause psychological issues. 

Essentially, it's genital mutilation and it's fucked up. 

Girls, here's your motivation--it also makes sex less pleasurable for guys and girls alike. 

Circumcised boys, ever wondered why the tip of your cock is...dried out? Yeah, it's not supposed to be that way. 

Don't fucking circumcise your kids
