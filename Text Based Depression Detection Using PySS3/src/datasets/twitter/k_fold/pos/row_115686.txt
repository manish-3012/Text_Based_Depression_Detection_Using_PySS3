UPDATE: I am 99% sure my 12 YO is self-harming. What should i do? RECAP: I feel so helpless and i need advice, i see most of you have had experience with self harm and i need help.  One day when my kid was at school i entered his room to clean some of his mess, then something caught my [eye](https://imgur.com/a/IqvVYGK) .  At first i thought nothing of it, maybe just cut himself accidentally or had a nose bleed, but fast forward to 11pm. I walk into his room to make sure heâ€™s asleep and he is.   So i go to leave and then he turns revealing many [cuts](https://imgur.com/a/hg2NKjW) there are much much more cuts, but these were the only ones i could take without waking him up.  I was quite worried and didnâ€™t get much sleep that night, because he is a happy kid that always jokes around, there hasnâ€™t been many times where Iâ€™ve seen him without a smile on his face.  The next day, after he went to school i searched his room, i know it sounds like i donâ€™t give him any privacy but Iâ€™m just worried about his wellbeing, i found [this](https://imgur.com/a/0vgUur2) it appears to be a stick duck taped with two sharpener blades on the end.  Im scared for my son, he never looks sad and he hasnâ€™t cried in 5 years. He has friends though he is quite introverted. I think i should sit down and talk to him but the few times ive seen him incredibly upset is when we have serious talks. Should i show him more love? Or scold him? Idk you guys are the teens the ones that most likely know what you would want your parents to do if you were in a situation like this. Please help.

UPDATE: I told him everything i know.He got quite upset but he told me everything, apparently he gets picked on at school by a certain group of kids for having a moustache he has Turkish blood so he hit puberty incredibly early this (he has hairier legs than certain adults i know) means none of his classmates were experiencing what he was. His friends defended him but that doesnâ€™t stop them. From calling him names.

I told him that it wasnâ€™t worth forcing himself to endure more pain than he already was. After a bit of crying and consoling, he said he would stop he gave me the razor blade thing, and i dont think i will be seeing anymore cuts on him anymore. Thanks, to all the people who responded helping me. :)
