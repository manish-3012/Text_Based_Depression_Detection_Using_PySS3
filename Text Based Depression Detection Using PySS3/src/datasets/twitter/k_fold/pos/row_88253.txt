so, fellow teenagers, i wanna ask something a lil controversial and wanna know your opinion i saw a post about founding fathers that owned slaves and there was a comment that said something like this:


we should remember not to judge this 1780â€™s people with a 2020â€™s mentality. have in mind this was what society taught them to do, and it was common, it was what people with a little wealth did and it was seen as NORMAL. so the goodness in this people wasnâ€™t measured as in â€œif they owned slaves or notâ€ but as in â€œdo you treat well your slaves or notâ€. 
Have in mind Thomas Jefferson. He even raped some of his slaves. Now have Aaron Burr. He ensured each and every of his slaves had an education. People only started to speak against slavery until some years later.
People (often rich) completely against it, AND not owning slaves were very rare and ahead of their time.

so i guess thatâ€™s my question. based on what i said: can we judge slave owners from 1780, with a 2020 mentality?
