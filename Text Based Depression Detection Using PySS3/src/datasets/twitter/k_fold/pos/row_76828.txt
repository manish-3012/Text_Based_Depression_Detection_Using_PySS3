Fortnite doesnâ€™t have a great reputation here, but we need your help. 

This will totally get downvoted to hell, but I just want to spread the word about it. Currently Epic Games has defied the App Store by creating direct payments for their in game currency / cosmetics, so they wouldnâ€™t have to pay App Store 30% of what Epic earns. Because of this, the App Store has decided to ban Fortnite from being downloaded on any Apple device. Epic Games is now filing a lawsuit against Apple. We need your help to bring Fortnite back to the App Store. Thank you. #FreeFortnite
