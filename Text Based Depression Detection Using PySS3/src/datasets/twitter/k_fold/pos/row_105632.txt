I don't care what anyone says, I like my Dad Now let me explain, my father and mom divorced a few years ago, and she obviously doesn't like him and vise versa. Up until recently I hadn't really had an opinion on him, I felt indifferent.  But now I try to see how he treats us, and I like him. He usually calls us first, to check up on us. He asks about school, how we are shit like that. He is always rooting for us to be top of the class. TBH my mom only tells us to call him when we need something (and I've realized that's not okay, and I wanna change that. if we don't  it would just make us spoiled little asshole). He also takes us that once every few months. Before it was once a year, but now it's way more often. For example he's getting us the PS5, and Miles Morales, on fucking RELEASE DAY (which is also my sister's birthday), and I'm so goddamn excited. Now I don't like my dad just cause he buys us stuff once in awhile, it's cause he's doing everything he can to show us he cares about us. Now I don't he's like the best father in the world, but he's doing what he can, and I love him for that. Sometimes before I'd think negative things about you, but I realize I'm wrong for that.

Now my mom has been through alot of shit since my dad left, and the shit she's going through is my dads fault. The things she's been going through happened 7 years ago (almost 8), and yeah its rough.  For that, I love and appreciate my mom, and I love and appreciate my dad for other reasons.  But I mean I'm not gonna tell my mom how I really feel about my dad, because she finna kill me lol

But yeah, what do you guys think of this? Would you also like my dad, if you were me?
