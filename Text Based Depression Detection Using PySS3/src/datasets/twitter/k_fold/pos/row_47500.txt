(Poem) â€œLost in Thoughtâ€ Feeling like Iâ€™m never going to have it

Going to panic when I do 

Dreamful hazes in deep night 

Accompanied with stages of fright 

Feeling like Iâ€™m behind,

Getting closer to the line 



Itâ€™s my fault, the current situation isnâ€™t helping 

All these years, constructing a wall 

Without even knowing 


But the tide has shifted a bit 

 Spring was a long time coming,

After years of winter 

Proud of what Iâ€™ve become 

But thereâ€™s a lot left to be done 

Wanting to take a next step, once opportunity allows 

Because all Iâ€™ve ever done is daydream
