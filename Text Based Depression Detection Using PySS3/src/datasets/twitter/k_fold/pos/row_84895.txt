Your mom might have walked in on you watching porn... But has she ever walked in on you drawing (mediocre at best) fanart of demon girls (Helltaker), while you were zoomed in on the breasts, then walked closer, and told you: that's not your art style, where did you take that outline from? I literally want to die, send help.
