My school is amazing at solving problems A little context: My school is divided into 2 main buildings. The first one is where all the classrooms are and the second is where the two gyms are. The biggest gym had a cork ceiling, but the roof was leeking and, eventually, it collapsed and that whole section had to be renewed. Skip some odd number of months later and the gym is looking much nicer with no possibility of the ceiling falling................................. Because there is no ceiling now. Instead of fixing the roof they just replaced the ceiling with a metal grate.
Truly a marvel of problem solving
