Iâ€™m kinda pissed off bc my mom still keeps asking why I broke up with my ex from 8 MONTHS AGO when I gave her an answer already and they never logged out of his Hulu account until today when I found out (he logged in when we were together on my tv) Itâ€™s annoying cause I get she liked him a lot n he was a cool guy but things just didnâ€™t work out but apparently thatâ€™s not a good anwser and also I have a new boyfriend now (which they havenâ€™t met yet but still) so idk it feels wrong to me. Like I wish they were interested in getting to know my current bf. They havenâ€™t even asked to meet him or anything.
