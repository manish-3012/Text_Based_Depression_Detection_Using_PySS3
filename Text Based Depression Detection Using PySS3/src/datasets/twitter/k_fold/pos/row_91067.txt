Mental health rant.. Tell me why Iâ€™ve had like no tics(I have a motor tic disorder, not tourrettes, but kinda like it.) for the past idk 4 months, but the moment I step back into a church yesterday morning Iâ€™m about to have a full blown mini panic attackðŸ¤¡. I hate complaining about my stupidly privileged life but god do I hate it sometimes. I was so weirdly Internally frustrated that I sang so hard my face was sore and when I got home, normal conversation had me holding back tears. Either gods real and punishing me for my sins or Quarentine really has fucked up my mental state beyond a jokey â€œhaha Iâ€™m so quirky wayâ€. Iâ€™m normally great around people and do well in crowds. But damn yesterday it was hard. Iâ€™m an extravert and thrive of off people, but I was like physically Drained afterwords. Welp Ted yâ€™all rant overðŸ’€
