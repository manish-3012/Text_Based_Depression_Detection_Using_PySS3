About that whole â€œsuper straight thingâ€ Form what I read it means you are not attracted to trans people, even if they identify as the gender you are attracted to, but Iâ€™ve also heard people say that being super straight is transphobic.

Am I missing something because no way in hell is not being attracted to someone because of that transphobic, sure it wouldnâ€™t surprise me if transphobic are also outwardly super straight. 

It seems silly to think that not being attracted to trans people= transphobic, as transphobia is intense dislike of trans people. Not attracted toâ‰ intense dislike.

Is is just me or do people just throw around the -phobic or -ist terms whenever someone does or says anything negative about a gender/race even if it is not racist according to every credible dictionary?

For example I am not attracted to trans people or (generally) people outside of my respective race, but thatâ€™s because of commonalities shared, not because I have anything against them or am racist/transphobic.

Ngl I have a feeling â€œnot attracted to trans peopleâ€ isnâ€™t the whole definition.

Thanks yâ€™all :D
