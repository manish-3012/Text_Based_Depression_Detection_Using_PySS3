my first day back in school today hi guys, today was my first day in the swedish equivalent of high school. i was nervous but it went well, and i had fun :) the good thing about the school i chose to go to is that one day a week we donâ€™t have school (but itâ€™s expected that we work on our assignments that day) which is really nice.
