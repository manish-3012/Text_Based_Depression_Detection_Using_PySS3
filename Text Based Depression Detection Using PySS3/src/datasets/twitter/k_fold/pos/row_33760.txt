awk situations with crush So I pretty much told my crush during Thanksgiving Break that I had feelings for her and she replied by telling me that she had feelings for me too a year ago but got over it cuz she thought I hater her. For the past month or so, she's been acting really weird and I even asked her if she's mad about me telling her I liked her and she insists not. At this point, whenever I talk to her she gives like 1-word responses and seems like she doesn't wanna talk to me so I'm really confused about what to do. Any comments or suggestions or feedback would be rly appreciated.
