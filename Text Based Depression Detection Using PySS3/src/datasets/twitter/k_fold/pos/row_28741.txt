My first crush, my first love, my first relationship. Both our parents ended it. My first crush, my first love, my first relationship. Both our parents ended it. Idk, this is just a tiny rant. I never loved anyone before (outside of family of course) My parents are extremely strict with the no sex before marriage thing, so what they do Is basically limit the amount of girls I come in contact with until I'm 18. Because then "I'll be more responsible" although I'm pretty sure by then I'd want have more of a lust, especially because I've been deprived of it all my life.

 I'm 16 now, almost 17, and a few months ago I started a relationship with someone I really truly loved. It's a feeling completely undescribable. I actually met her two years ago and have been crushing on her ever since, turns out she was too. Anyways, I couldn't get enough of her, I couldn't go one hour without talking to her. And neither could she. We kept talking about our future together, and no matter how bad things got it would still be heaven with eachother. 

Her parents are as strict as mine too tho, and soon; both pairs found out. Her phone was raised and all our texts discovered. We're both for clean minded people, and only once talked about sex, but we did send one pic each.. our parents wouldn't believe that tho. They insisted we deleted our chats and everything.

They forced our relationship to stop. We heavily relied on our phones and computers to text eachother. But her parents took everything of hers. Even tho she worked her butt off to afford her own laptop, they took that too. 
It's just so annoying how our parents have to control even our own hearts...
      How cruel...
