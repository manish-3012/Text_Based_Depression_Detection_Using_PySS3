I have friends, but I see some ppl going to dance clubs and parties (pre quarantine) and I would have nooo clue how to act or even dance in that situation. I can't flirt for shit and am definitely can't dance, so I would be screwed. I have friends and social skills, but would absolutely suck in a dance situation.
