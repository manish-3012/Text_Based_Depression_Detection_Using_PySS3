Got killed in a dream..... wasn't too painful So there was a compound, and a high tower in front of it. I had to climb it with a bow and arrow...and shoot people sent to kill me who were of same age as me(15), I shot some of em, but eventually got surrounded by them. I knew my fate...I put down my Bow and Arrow, and told them to kill me and to make it quick, I turned around, one shot me right through the heart, then shot a bunch of arrows together. It wasn't too painful. Last thing I remember is me getting down to my knees...lol
