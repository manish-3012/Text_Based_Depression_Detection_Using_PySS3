To the garlic bread guy Please stop it is all fun and games but commenting garlic bread on a serious post .. bruh. I literally saw a guy talking about how he was gonna k*ll himself but the guy commented garlic bread is there for u. Do not do that there is another guy who talks about the Nintendo ds but he knows the limits and I have never seen him comment on a serious post. There was a post on how someone got tear gassed and the guy commented garlic bread. Please stop commenting this on serious posts. Maybe u enjoy the attention but it is not funny or cool.
