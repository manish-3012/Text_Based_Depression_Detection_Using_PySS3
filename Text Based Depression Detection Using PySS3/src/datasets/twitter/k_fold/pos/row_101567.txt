weâ€™re moving from one of the best houses weâ€™ve ever lived in the potentially one of the worst i live in california, aka one of the most expensive places to live ever

My previous house was on the same street as my best friend since first grade, it also had a Rite Aid and a GameStop I would shop at frequently because, yknow itâ€™s convinient. It also was near a bunch of my other good friends. 

My mom couldnâ€™t afford a house in the same area so now weâ€™re in the old town part of it, 3.5 miles away with no driverâ€™s license. Itâ€™s always been a dream of mine to move away from my best friends and all my favorite shops in town, now I get to live near an Indian restaurant, a liquor store, and a tattoo parlor. And I hate Indian food.  

At least I have my own bathroom. Now I can vent to Reddit and cry in here without wasting anyones time
