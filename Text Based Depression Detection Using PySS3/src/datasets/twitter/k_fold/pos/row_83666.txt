My friends are boring My friend group is not the kind that i want around anymore.

Itâ€™s frustrating, Iâ€™m oriented towards self-improvement, self-awareness plus in this period iâ€™m also more interested in politics and philosophy.

They are not even excited of going out. 
Like,, i want to do late night drives, go to the beach, play bowling idk and they are not happy even when I say â€œIâ€™ll took you in this place, i will pay for thatâ€ 

Itâ€™s like they donâ€™t want to live their fucking lives. 

The only two people that go out the most are annoying as fuck, they are childish and depressed and they are clingy. 
Like ok, i was depressed too but i donâ€™t want this energy around me.

Sounds selfish but i want the best for me and I know there are people like me in the world.

They are kinda stopping me from living that life.
I see other friends group doing all that stuffs while iâ€™m here complaining.

Sorry for that lmao.
