Is it a man's responsibility to "give his seat in a life boat" for women? Should men risk, or straight up sacrifice their lives to save those of women? When a man refuses to risk his life for a woman, is that immoral or worthy of disgust/contempt?  

I do not believe so. Men who do that are heroes. Instead we shame men who DON'T do that, and pretend like it should be a given for them to make that sacrifice.
