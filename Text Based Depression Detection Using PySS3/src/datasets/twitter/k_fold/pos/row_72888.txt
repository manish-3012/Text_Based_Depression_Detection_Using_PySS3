I know this sounds kinda sad but Iâ€™ve never been to a real party before and tomorrow night i will be Iâ€™ve drank like half a white claw before but never gotten drunk at all. Also I gotta go back home (Iâ€™m walking donâ€™t worry) and Iâ€™m worried my mom will notice.

If anyone could share their first experience being drunk or any advice Iâ€™d appreciate it.
