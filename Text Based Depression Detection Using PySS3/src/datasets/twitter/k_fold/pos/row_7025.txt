Unpopular opinion: engaging in the stock market is morally wrong, most of the time How the stock market works is pretty simple. A company sells a part of its shares to a few investors, for a one-time investment that they could actually work with. After said initial investment, the company rarely ever gets more money from the stock market. When the company grows, so do the shares that they've already sold. When you buy shares, you usually buy them not from the company but from what are basically private individuals, and basically profit off of, well, owning the right thing at the right time, without really adding any value to society.

Do correct me if I'm wrong, but that's how I understood that it works.
