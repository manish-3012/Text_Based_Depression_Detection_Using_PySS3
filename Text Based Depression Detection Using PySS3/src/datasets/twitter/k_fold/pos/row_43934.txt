I wish i was dead... Thereâ€™s just nothing to live for honesty, no one likes me and i love no one, i feel nothing and I probably am a sociopath or empathetic... no one loves me either 

I have almost no close or good friends, and no love whatsoever... my parents say they love me but they are mostly complaining 

I feel bad, all the time... sometimes a little happy but thats it. Not even sad... just nothing or bad. 

I have almost 0 contact with the few people i consider my friends. And they will hang out together without me. 

I guess i have many symptoms of depression even though I refuse to believe I have it. For now i jusr wish it all ended
