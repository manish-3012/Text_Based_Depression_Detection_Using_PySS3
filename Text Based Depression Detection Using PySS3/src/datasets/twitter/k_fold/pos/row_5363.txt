If you ever want to be a reddit mod or discord mod, just don't I deal with so much garbage over on r/cultofechidna and its respective discord server that it's not worth it. There was a karen ruining everyone's fun and I've had to deal with so much that I can't even tell you everything. We aren't even 10000 members large and it's a hassle. And I can't quit the mod staff because I'm the owner of the discord server (not that I plan on quitting) I have to argue with the other mods so much and there has been a lot of cum just so much cum. It hurts my brain. The other mods don't even do their job, they spend all their time playing the gacha game in our discord server. Fuck.
