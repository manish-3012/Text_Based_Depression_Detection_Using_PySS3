Be more aware. I recently read a post about pedophilia on the subreddit, I agree, itâ€™s disgusting. However as the internet is a place for everyone, regardless of their beliefs - legal or not legal, you need to accept that no matter what you do on the internet, it can be seen by anyone at any time, anywhere.

No I am not excusing pedophilia, or hate speech, or racism, or anything of the sort and I despise all those who use someoneâ€™s vulnerability to make advances into dehumanising them in any way. But as a society that is abundantly reliant on technology, we need to start being more aware of what we post and what we say online.

There will always be somebody who will dislike or disagree with what you post, thatâ€™s how life works. That doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t post it, but be aware that if you post something online, anybody can see it. Literally anybody. So only post something online if youâ€™re happy with the whole world viewing it on a big screen because thatâ€™s what itâ€™s like.

However as this is a sub *literally* titled â€œTeenagersâ€ you need to be more aware that people will be on here in an attempt to seek out â€œTeenagersâ€ and again, I know itâ€™s disgusting but itâ€™s the truth; the mods can only deal with it somewhat and we need to be more realistic and only post stuff on here that youâ€™re happy with anybody knowing/seeing. 

Itâ€™s hard to convey this message without sounding like a degenerate or a person whoâ€™s causing the problem, but it needs to be said. If you are under 18, you should not be posting your face (or any other body part!) on the internet in a subreddit that anybody has access to. Itâ€™s a sad fact because I see peoples workout progress or a lovely new outfit and to not see those is less wholesome but to be sure that youâ€™re not being targeted by somebody illegally, we need to be more sensible and only post images and say things were happy with everyone seeing/hearing.

Youâ€™re never going to stop people being and doing illegal things on the internet, thatâ€™s why it sucks. But the internet is great too so please just be more aware of what you post, to protect yourself and potentially your future as well. 

Stay safe :) x
