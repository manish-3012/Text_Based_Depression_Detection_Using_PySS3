Today at school I was having a depressive episode When it happens I can't focus on anything, my head hurts, I want to cry loud and usually try to sleep ignoring the lesson. 

Today one of my best friends when we had our pause just went out and came back 5 minutes later with 4 of my other friends from our school for lifting me up. 

I'm not even sure I deserve such awesome friends. I feel like a total mess of a teenager and a person, but for sure I have the best friends I could ever wish for. 

I just wish I can heal from everything, forgive myself and get to a decent point with therapy, because I'm tired of wasting time hating myself and wanting to disappear from this planet.
