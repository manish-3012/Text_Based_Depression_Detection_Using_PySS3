Never tell someone â€œyou wouldnâ€™t understand my painâ€ itâ€™s so selfish and close-minded to say, especially when you donâ€™t know that person. One of my â€œfriendsâ€ I know talked to me today about his girlfriend of 2 years breaking up with him because she needed space. He said â€œBro idek why iâ€™m talking to you, you donâ€™t understand the concept of pain very well.â€

I didnâ€™t even say anything to him when he was telling me what happened, which made it weirder I was just being respectful and listening.

He doesnâ€™t go to my school, and we donâ€™t know each other too well but it was shitty of him to say that. Considering that I have shit going on that would make him crack under the pressure.
