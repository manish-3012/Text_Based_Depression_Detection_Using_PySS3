I cannot be the only teenager... Who does not party. I do not like to drink because.. reasons. I hate the smell of smoke and do not smoke. I absolutely do not do drugs(although my mom would disagree). Oh and also drunk and high people just really make me uncomfortable. 

I want to note Iâ€™m not saying anything is wrong with these things... although with drugs depends on what it is... but seriously Iâ€™ve been called basic and boring. Am I seriously the only teen like this? I had to grow up for a living and never got to be a kid, I would KILL to like doing these things. But I just donâ€™t.
