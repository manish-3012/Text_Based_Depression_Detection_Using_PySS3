Any advice on how to deal with lonelyness? Tldr: I am lonely due to a lack of romantic relationships, any advice how to deal with that during covid? 

So I am a 18 year old virgin who never even came close to ever having a relationship and that lately have been effecting me way more than usual.

I been feeling lonely, worthless and someone who will never find love. Partialy because I more closely resemble a whale then a human and I have the social awarness and grace of a brick being thrown through a window.

But the biggest problem is, covid. Even though I think trying to fix the former issue and hoping to find someone who will ignore the latter out of pity for a week before they give up on me,  cause of covid I dont want to go around trying to meet strangers.

So after a point less rambling the actual question comes out, how do I deal with this kind of lonelyness during covid?
