I'm gay and I like younger guys. And I was thinking if I wanted to adopt when I'm 21+, imagine my boyfriend is an 18 year old twink which usually look younger than their age. And then the kid I adopt is 16 and looks older than my boyfriend lmaoo ðŸ˜­ And I wouldn't adopt a little kid because I don't feel like I'm suitable to take care of a kid 100% of the day and raise him that initial part of their life.

That situation is completely possible tho I've seen 14 year olds who are hairy and 6'3 ft tall and facial hair
