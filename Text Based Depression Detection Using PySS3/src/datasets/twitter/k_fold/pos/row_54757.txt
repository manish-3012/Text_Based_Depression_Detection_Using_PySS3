I feel like overeating rn I'm not even hungry, just semi-bored and food tastes good. I've already had like 2 snacks after supper and i know it's not good for me to eat out of pure boredom but holy shit the urge is strong. I'm holing myself up i my room so i can't see any of the food and cave in. bruh why is my brain tryina tell me to eat stuff when I'm not even hungryyyy. Quarantine amplified my issues and now they won't go away ðŸ˜”
