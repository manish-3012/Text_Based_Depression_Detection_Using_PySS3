I've never been more angry with my parents than now We were watching the news and my parents started saying how some politician lady is sick and disgusting,a piece of thrash and all that. I don't know shit about politics so l asked them why, because l thought she really did something messed up. Nope, she's apparently disgusting because she's a lesbian and has wife. My parents then went on and said the same thing about a celebrity from our country because they were born a woman,but they have short hair and dress as a man. They said how "those kinds of people"(the lgbtq+ community and people who support them) are sick and disgusting,how being in a same sex relationship is an awful and disgusting thing and then they said that l better not have a girlfriend ever. After I explained that I don't want to have a spouse or children when l grow up they laughed at me and dismissed it. I have never been more disappointed in someone.
