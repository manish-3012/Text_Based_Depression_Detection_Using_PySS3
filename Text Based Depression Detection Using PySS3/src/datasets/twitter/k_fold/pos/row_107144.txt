Who else is trying to grow on YouTube or Twitch? For anyone working to grow on a social platform what are you doing and are you finding any success so far? I recently hit 4.2k on Twitch and almost 250 subs on YouTube. I personally am looking for better ways to promote my channel without being that guy that self-promos his content everywhere. Anyone got some ideas or found success in any areas so far?
