It is very unpleasant to hear a lot of 17 y/o teens talking about looking forward to finally becoming 18 to be able to do porn. I have become disappointed in our society. How is it possible that everything is already so over-sexualized that I hear from 16 and 17 year olds that they are looking forward to becoming 18 so that they can produce pornographic content?

I personally think this is a terrible development...
