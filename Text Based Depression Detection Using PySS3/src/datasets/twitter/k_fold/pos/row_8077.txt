I don't understand how people can use animals as target practice and not think it's disgusting You're not killing them for meat. You're not killing them because you're freezing and you need their fur. You're killing them just because you wanna shoot something alive that's legal to shoot. It's basically driving out to the woods with a rifle thinking "Imma go look for a bear just so I can kill it." Then you see the bear and think "I could just leave it alone, or I could shoot it just because." Then takes some photos with it because they're so proud they think disrupting the environment is cool. Maybe prize off a souvenir or something.  Make a necklace out of its claws.

It's disgusting.
