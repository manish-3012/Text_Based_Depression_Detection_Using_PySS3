Ok guys I changed my mind If you say my previous post saying that I hate this subreddit and that I unsubscribed. But I actually think I was wrong. Now that â€œâ€â€â€memesâ€â€â€ are gone I feel as if this subreddit is just like how it was when I joined. A chill, laid back area for teenage discussion. You guys have no idea how much I appreciate you. Lockdown has been pretty rough bc I havenâ€™t been able to see my friends for a while. Being able to hang out with people in my age group online is pretty cool. And being able to help out ppl in need that come to this subreddit for help is amazing as well.

Thank you all for being the (mostly) amazing teenagers you are. ðŸ¤—
