So I just finished reading Romeo And Juliet in Honors English and I want to know your guy's thoughts about it. In my opinion itâ€™s a story about how 2 kids make bad decision after bad decision and basically dug their own graves. They talk about how "fateâ€ was the reason for their misfortune, but I believe that their future was felt by their own hand. Anyways I want to know about your thoughts and interpretations of the play. 


(iâ€™m sorry if this feels like a homework quest lol)
