Iâ€™m considering contacting people I havenâ€™t talked to in like 5 years bc Iâ€™m curious what theyâ€™re up to but Iâ€™ve been putting it off for so long because Iâ€™m scared weâ€™ll have a dry conversation Thatâ€™s literally the only reason I havenâ€™t tried but I feel like I need to because I think about them all the time
