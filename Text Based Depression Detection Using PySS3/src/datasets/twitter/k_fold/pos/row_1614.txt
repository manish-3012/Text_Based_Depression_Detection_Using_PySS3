The loneliness during lockdown has now really gotten to me. Ever since the lockdown, I've been gradually getting more and more detached from reality; all the games I play have now become boring, and having no contact with my friends really doesn't help.

As of writing, my sleep schedule has started to make me wake up at night and sleep through the entire day. I always drift off at around 3-6 AM and then wake up at 3-6PM at the earliest and latest. As a result, my routine I'm trying to get to is ripped apart because of it.

I've been administered around two sleeping pills every night multiple times but my body quickly adapts to it and puts up a tolerance to the sleeping pills after one or two nights when given a dosage, and one of my siblings are convinced I'm suffering from Insomnia. I'm convinced it's getting worse by each passing night.

I can barely be bothered to get myself up from bed now due to lack of motivation. I'm not good with arts, writing, or music anymore, and the games I once enjoyed playing I've now grown more distant with each passing day, losing more motivation by each one.

I have a feeling that I might lose so much motivation that one day when I go to sleep and wake up, I'll just go back to sleep again. And then the cycle will repeat itself.

School is not helping either; I can't cope with the online work given, especially since I only have one computer that is **not** used for playing games. As a result, I've given that up too.

I just can't cope with this lockdown any longer, and that's coming from a borderline introvert.

TL;DR: Lockdown sucks, signed by an introvert
