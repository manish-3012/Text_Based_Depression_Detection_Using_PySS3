What if I don't love you anymore? Please help He told me he'd probably kill himself if I left him.

But I don't love him anymore. I like him as a friend, a close friend.. but not as a lover. 

I want to leave him but I don't want him to hate himself and start cutting again. 

It's not his fault I don't love him anymore, it's me.

TDLTR: He said he'd kill himself if I left him but I want to leave him. 

What do I do?
