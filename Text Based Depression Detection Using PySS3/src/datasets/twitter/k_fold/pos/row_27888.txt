Really wanna come out as nonbinary to my family but my Dad has loose lips y'all. He's terrible at keeping secrets so coming out to him risks getting outed to my super religious aunt and honestly I don't want that. I know I really shouldn't but I'm gonna stay in the closet a bit longer, it hurts but at least it's predictable.
