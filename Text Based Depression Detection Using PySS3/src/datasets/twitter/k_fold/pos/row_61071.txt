My friendâ€™s dog humped my brother So yesterday, I was at a friends house. My brother is playing with their dog. This is a big dog, too. And the dog attempted to hump my brother. Twice. It was pretty funny. Unfortunately, I was laughing so hard, I couldnâ€™t get a picture. And Iâ€™m still laughing thinking about it.
