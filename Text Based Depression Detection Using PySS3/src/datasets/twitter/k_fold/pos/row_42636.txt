I'm just now realizing that my friends see me as a cat They treat me like one at least 

They "pet" my hair like a cat and sometimes comb my hair

They ask if I want a treat when I'm having a bad day to try to cheer me up with something sweet which usually works XD

And they sometimes just squeeze me 

I'm starting to understand why my nickname is coffee cat...
