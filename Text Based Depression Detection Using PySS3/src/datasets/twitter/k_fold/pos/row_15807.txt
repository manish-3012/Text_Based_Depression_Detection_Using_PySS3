My gf of 4 years just left me for someone else. Again I've been off and on dating this girl for a little over 4 years, and she has always found ways to manipulate me, she has cheated on me, she has left me for other men, and she has always threatened that if I leave her, she will kill herself. And she has been doing this for so long she has me wrapped around her fucking finger. I hate it. I'm sick and tired of being treated like trash. This has really caused some self esteem issues as well because I cant believe I've somehow allowed myself to fall into this cycle. And I keep falling and I know myself and I'm ashamed to say if she came back today I'd probably fall again. I don't have the guts to block her. Every bit of me wants to just text her but I know that would only make things worse. I don't have a job or school, or really anything else I can put my focus into. I have a couple friends that I talk to occasionally but most are busy with school now. So I just sit and think, but I can't get her out of my head. I'm just disappointed in myself, for not being able to stand up for myself.
