Magic and the imagination. You know how in anime that have magic, when learning you have to visualise it and the better the visualisation the stronger it is.

Different humans can visualize in different levels (no magic, I'm talking about us rn) some people can create images that are black and white, some can add minimal colour, or some have full colour.

What if the people's magic level is determined by the colour of the visualisation can be, and that's why there are loads of weak people becuase it's rare to get a full colour imagination.
