I don't care about women Women on the internet be like: my boyfriend my period my vagina I was sexually harassed I was sexually assaulted I was catcalled my crush my boyfriend I was creeped on my boyfriend birth control my boyfriend

I just don't listen. Girls I know in real life, like my friend's gfs or my classmates, I don't talk to them, theres no real reason to talk to them as they are incapable of intelligent conversation. This isnt sexist because its a fact. So can all women do us a favor and keep to your own kind
