Ok can we talk about Loveleo for a second? Like, the man is like the coolest person ever. Everything, the music, his style, his videos and even his lifestyle are all so amazing!!! I absolutely adore his outfits, his earrings, and just the overall vibe he has. Do you/have you listened to him? If you haven't, you should! If you have, I'd totally love to talk about his music or music in general. Also, music recommendations would would be appreciated! Have a nice day :)
