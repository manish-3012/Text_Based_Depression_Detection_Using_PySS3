Iâ€™m a real fuck up Iâ€™ve fucked up. Iâ€™ve really really fucked up. I couldâ€™ve avoided this whole day I couldâ€™ve stopped my brother from sneaking out I couldâ€™ve fucking stopped all the shit from happening. But I was to fucking selfish to see that. I was to fucking selfish to think of them first. I really fucked up and I blame myself for all of this fucking shit. This is a shit show and Iâ€™ve made it myself.
