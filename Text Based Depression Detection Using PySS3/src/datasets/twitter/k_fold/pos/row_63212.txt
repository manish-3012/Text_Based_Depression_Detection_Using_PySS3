(Serious) *Trigger Warning* I am doing a survey on how American teens are affected by eating disorders and body dysmorphia and need participants *This is just a test run for my survey to find any flaws. It will not be the final result*


Tidbit about me: I am a highschool senior in Health Science. We are doing a competition/senior project and I decided to choose a poster about a health issue that affects the community, which as you see above is about eating disorders.



The survey should take about 5 to 10 minutes with most being multiple choice with a few written answers.



If you choose to take the survey, I would love for any comments and/or suggestions to improve it. Whether adding or removing questions, rewording for clarity, even format changes, anything is on the table. The only thing I ask is for you to be as honest as possible!




Survey deleted.  Closed 


(Hopefully the link works)



Edit for clarity: Anyone can take this survey, especially if you don't have an eating disorder or body dysmorphia.
