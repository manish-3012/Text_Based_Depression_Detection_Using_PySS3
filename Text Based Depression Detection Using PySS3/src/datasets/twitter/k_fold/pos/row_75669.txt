do u ever get upset just cus ur parents apologize my dad pointed out that i have a hole in my pants on my butt my poking it with the broom in his hand but then my mom told him to leave me alone and he apologized and now iâ€™m just upset and uncomfortable   

like iâ€™d be fine and wouldnâ€™t give it a second thought if he hadnâ€™t apologized but since he did i feel upset like itâ€™s bigger than it is

i hate my life i shouldnâ€™t be this upset fuckfuckfuck
