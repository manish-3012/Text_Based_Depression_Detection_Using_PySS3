Sup, I need ideas for art/small tokens that are popular in gaming, movies, and TV shows, pls add suggestions Iâ€™m making art to sell and I would like to have some fan art in between my original stuff, donâ€™t suggest Among Us pls, I know itâ€™s popular, Iâ€™m looking for other suggestions because I donâ€™t keep up with a lot of stuff, what franchises or characters would be good for general audiences to sell as art?
