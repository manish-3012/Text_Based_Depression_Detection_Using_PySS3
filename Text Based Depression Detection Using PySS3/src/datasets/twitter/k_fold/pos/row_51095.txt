In still salty about something with you guys. About two months ago I told you guys that a girl I had a crush on was ranting about feminism and that eventually led to asking me this question. Do I think women should be allowed to walk around top less like men? And I didn't know what to say because if I said no, she would have made me look like a misogynist against frminism. If I had said yes, same thing but with rapist. So I asked you guys what should I say. Not. One. Comment. And now she hates me because I said I don't know. Honestly, now that she showed how much of a bitch she is (not because she is a Feminis, but because she is a bitch), I'm glad she doesn't want to be with my anymore. But seriously, what was I supposed to say?!
