I'm upset-  

Fifty thousand on my head, is disrespect  
So offended that I had to double check  
I'ma always take the money over sex  
That's why they need me out the way  
What you expect?

Got a lot of blood and it's cold  
They keep tryna get me for my soul  
Thankful for the women that I know  
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoe  
Every month, I'm supposed to pay her bills  
And get her what she want  
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want  
My dad still got child support from 1991 (one, one, one)  
Outta town (town), people love to pop a lot of shit then come around  
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down  
Niggas askin' if I'm cool
