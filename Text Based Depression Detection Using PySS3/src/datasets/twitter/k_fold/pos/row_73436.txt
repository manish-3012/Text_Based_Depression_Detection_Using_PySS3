Is this considered stalking? 
 A few months ago I was told by some people that this girl liked me. I was interested in someone else but didnâ€™t want to be mean so I kept on talking to her. She eventually became really invasive in my privacy so I stopped talking to her. Eventually she found my sisters Snapchat and began texting asking all of this stuff. After my sister ignored her then she went to my sisters boyfriend to find out if I liked her. I decided that that was enough and I told her to stop because it was getting out of hand. She now occasionally pops up to try to talk to me but I still ignore her.
