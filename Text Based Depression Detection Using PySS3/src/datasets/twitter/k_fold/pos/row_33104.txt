I beat a really hard CoderZ mission and I'm celebrating with pizza beagles. I fucking hate all the gyro levels. They never explained how it worked. Sometimes it would work but the next time it wouldn't. This is because I thought the gyro was subjective and only counted the degrees turned from the *activation* of the block, not your starting position. 

Fuck you coderz.
