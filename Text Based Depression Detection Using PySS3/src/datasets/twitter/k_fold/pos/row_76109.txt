Ok ok ok ok I have a very important question How TF would a complete beginner know how to complete Minecraft (with no hints as well)? When I say this, for "complete Minecraft", I am talking about just defeating the Ender Dragon. And for a complete beginner, I am talking about someone who knows not a single thing about Minecraft. Obviously there are hints(in the name) about the first few steps, and you could brute force your way to getting the crafting table, as well as going mining, and now you have the recipes menu.

See but here's where we need to talk, how would they know how to get to, or why to go to the nether? Then, to me at least, after you get your first blaze rod it's a pretty clear path. So my question is, how TF would a complete beginner know that you need to create a 3x4 (or 2x3 for the real gamers) obsidian structure and light it with a deformed metal Schlong and some flint to get to the nether?

This is very serious.
