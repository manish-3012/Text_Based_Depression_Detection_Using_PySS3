I can only see like 10% right now, i just put in some cosplay contact lenses. Its kind of weird ngl, i can barely make out letters.

I actually just wanted to know how contact lenses felt like. 

They dont really hurt, but the loss of sight kinda bugs me ngl.

Im actually looking for a few people to chat with, hit me up if you want to.
