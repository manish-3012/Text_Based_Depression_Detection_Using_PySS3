the look on my best friend's face so it was new year's eve and I was hanging out with my best friend and his girlfriend and another female friend of mine and it was 10 mins until Jan 1st before the fireworks in our area set off, so I was just sitting there and waiting and reflecting over what happened throughout the year and I look at him and his girlfriend was talking to that other friend of mine and the look on his face was just so wholesome and genuine like he wanted to kiss his girlfriend so bad but he couldn't cuz we were in public and pda isn't allowed where we live in but like, that look on his face was just so wholesome and it lives rent free in my head, it's like he appreciates her existence so much and all the troubles in his life are just gone when he's with her and he's just so grateful, it's really interesting seeing how much we can deduce from plain emotions and looks and yea that's it that kinda made me really happy knowing my best friend has a source of happiness and im glad they're together
