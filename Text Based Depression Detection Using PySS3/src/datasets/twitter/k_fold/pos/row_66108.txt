reddit is actually pretty fatphobic "uGhH cRINgE wOrD" oh just don't, i really don't care if it's "cringe". You wanna be treated like an adult? Act like one.

Anyways, reddit is fatphobic. I constantly see posts about fat people. Either its the 706th post on r/unpopularopinion saying "uhhhh fat isn't beautiful" or it's a post on r/trueoffmychest saying "god obese people are disgusting" (yes, those are real examples)

Um, don't do that? First off, no one with half a brain is going to tell you that fat is beautiful or healthy or whatever the fuck you want to complain about. That was a trend years ago but people thought and still think it's being pushed. It's not, it's just not. It died many years ago, tbh it was never alive. Second off, uhh its a bit fucking rude to say someone is gross and disgusting. I don't think you'd ever say that to their face?

You seriously don't need to tell people they're fat. They know. They aren't fucking stupid.

You don't know that person. You don't know why they are the way they are. 

Nobody is asking you to call everyone beautiful. Nobody. Shit, nobody is telling you to not think being fat is unhealthy. It is unhealthy and even fat people know that. But if you can't even have the decency to not be blatantly fucking disrespectful towards them, that is *your* problem.
