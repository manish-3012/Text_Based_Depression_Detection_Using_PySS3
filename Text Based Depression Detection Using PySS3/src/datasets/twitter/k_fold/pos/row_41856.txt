I'm fucking sick of my life For over a year now I've been making false promises to myself. Haven't started working out, eating healthier, meditating. I have enough spiritual knowledge to literally levitate in the air. I just never apply it. I fucked up relationships with people. For what? For me sitting around doing nothing. I went off of social media thinking I'd actually do something productive with my life. Now I just sit around missing people. I've hurt people. And I want to talk to them. But I deleted social media. And I don't know what to do. Over the 3 months I deleted social media I've gained probably 20 pounds of fat. And I hate myself for it. I'm a fucking 5'4 14 year old who weighs 160 pounds. My PMO addiction has gotten 10 times worse and it's something I can't control anymore. I miss people. Specifically this friend. We stopped talking because I fucked things up. I ruined that friendship for a shitty 2 week relationship. It was completely my fault. I didn't communicate with her. I finally texted the friend back apologizing 6 months later. And now I just want to talk to her and catch up. I hate my life because I'm not doing anything productive. And now I need to find a job so fuck this shit. I don't know what to do anymore. I have so many dreams and ambitions but no fucking courage or self control, no will power.
