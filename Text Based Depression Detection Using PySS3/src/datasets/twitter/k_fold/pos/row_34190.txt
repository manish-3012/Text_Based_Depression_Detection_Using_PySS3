I'm getting braces soon No more sticky candy ):  
No more ice cream ):  
No more pizza ):  
No more chips ):  
Constant pain everyday I wake up ):  
Me thinking about how painful its going to be when its time to get them removed every day ):  
Having to brush my teeth for 40 minutes in the morning and 60 minutes at night ):  


I see no joy in getting braces at all ):
