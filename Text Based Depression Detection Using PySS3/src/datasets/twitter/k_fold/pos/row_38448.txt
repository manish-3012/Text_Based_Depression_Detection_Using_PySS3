Iâ€™ve been scammed So I wanted to install fall guys 
We donâ€™t have windows so we installed it in our ps4

If you arenâ€™t aware of it fall guys is FREE on ps plus wich is 8â€™99 a month (ye it gets Lower Ik )

My cousin told me if we payed the full fee we could play the game 
Even if we donâ€™t have ps plus for a lifetime and not as long as we have the subscription

So we bought. The full game for 20 bucks 

And IT RQUIRES PS PLUS TO PLAY 

GODDAMG IT SONY IF U NEED PS PLUS ANYWAY 

YOU COULD TELL IT BEFORE YOU BUY THE FULL GAME 

 AND JUST DONT GIVE ANOTHER OPTION 

I am also a dumb human being but still

(It actually says it on a very small caption as Iâ€™ve been informed 

But small enough I wasnâ€™t able to tell it was there)
