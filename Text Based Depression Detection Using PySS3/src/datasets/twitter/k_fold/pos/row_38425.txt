My parents get so angry at me when I have food in my room, there's so many worse things I could be doing, but they choose to get angry at me for literally nothing. Its honestly bullshit like go away, instead of coming in my room to check for food why don't you come in and check on my mental health and ask if I'm doing ok, because a lot of the time I'm not and its because of you.
