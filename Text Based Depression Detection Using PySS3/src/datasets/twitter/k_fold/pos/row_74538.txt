I'm thinking of just killing myself Not like anybody cares. My parents are pretty much ignoring calls from the school about getting my therapy, they also don't believe in non binary so I won't be telling them.. It's not like I have any use in this world. The kids at school are homophobic and my best friend is moving away at the end of the year so whats the point? I'm sick of not being enough, not being thin enough.  I know I'm a failure to my mom and dad. It's not like I matter. I've done all I can in my life. I've asked and got a sort of answer to why my dad abused the dogs to death, I've finished all my school shit. Whats the fucking point. I don't matter. I just need to find a rope and a place to hang it...
