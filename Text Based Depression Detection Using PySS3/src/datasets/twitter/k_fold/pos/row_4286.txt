Iâ€™m doing maths majoring in applied math (going into third year) If I had my time again Iâ€™d do computer science and major in data science or machine learning 

This is a really good career path thatâ€™s growing. You get math courses as well as coding and some data analysis which is also a hot industry rn.

Idk Iâ€™d say that is really worth it
