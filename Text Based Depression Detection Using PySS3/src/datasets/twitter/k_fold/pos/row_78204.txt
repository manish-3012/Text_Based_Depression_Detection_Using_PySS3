Kind of an update from the last post for the few that care.. It turns out it wasn't as bad as i thought.  The extremely embarrassing part is that i made myself look like a crying piece of shit over the phone (which, thankfully, she didn't care about).  The good news is that she helped calm me down and eventually we just told each other how much we love and care about each other.  I would say it wasn't a total fail because we expressed feelings we normally wouldn't get the chance to express.  And something i thought was real nice was that she said i was the best thing that ever happened to her... and she continued by saying that even if our relationship doesn't work out, i will still be the best thing that happened... i just didnt know how to respond.  I felt a feeling i never felt before... and then i sobbed some more.  But it was extremely nice that she said those things because i never knew i made such an impact on someone.  

Sorry for making this long for those who are gonna bitch about it
