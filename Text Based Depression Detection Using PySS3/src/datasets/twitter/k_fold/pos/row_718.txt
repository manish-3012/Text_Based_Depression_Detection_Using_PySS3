How do you guys feel about going on dates without knowing if you wish to start a relationship? The question is pretty self-explanatory- Iâ€™m not super sure whether I like this girl or not and Iâ€™ve been scared to get in a relationship after my last one damaged me a few years back. My therapist suggested I ask to go on a date without for sure knowing I want a relationship, and I was wondering how fellow teens feel about this idea? Iâ€™m honestly not sure where other people stand. 

Thanks in advance and Iâ€™ll answer any questions ASAP
