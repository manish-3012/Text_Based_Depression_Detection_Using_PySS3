People who cheat because their bf/gf doesn't talk with them and then doesn't tell them are the literal worst of society 
There may be people who kill others, people who fuck kids, but the worst people ever are these type of people. Seriously. 

First of all why do you not try to talk with your other one if they aren't texting you? Maybe they're going through a very bad time and they need your support but can't ask for it, maybe their phone was taken away, maybe they're at the hospital, and what do you do? You cheat on them? Maybe even with their friend? That's a mega-asshole move.

Secondly, why the fuck do you not tell them you're cheating on them? Because they will get mad? Would they not be even more mad if they found out later? Are you stupid? Or if you still love them, why the fuck did you cheat on them in the first place you stupid a??

I'm sorry for all the stupid people here who feel offended for being associated with these kind of people.
