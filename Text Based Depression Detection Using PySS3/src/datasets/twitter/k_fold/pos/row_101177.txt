Idfk what to do I'm currently freaking out because I'm having severe anxiety over my math class tomorrow (yes I physically go to school) and my math teacher scares tf out of me, I've seen him get pissed off at students for not doing work before and getting extremely annoyed with kids that dont keep up with his stupid fast teaching speed, and I want to wake up my parents and talk to them bc I cant sleep and I'm scared if I have to drop honors math they'd be disappointed in me, but rn I know nothing of what is going on in that class and I'm terrified bc he calls on random students to do the math he writes on the board and it's only a matter of time before I get called on and he gets upset that I'm completely drawing a blank on wtf I'm doing
