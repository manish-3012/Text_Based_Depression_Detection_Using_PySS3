I feel like such a shitty person Me and some of my friends were messing around and I was one of them was the sister of the friend whoâ€™s the main target of this story. She shared me his Spotify account which I made fun of which I donâ€™t know why I did.  He went to talk to his sister and I could hear him crying. I feel like such a shitty person for doing this and Iâ€™ve messaged him apologizing but I havenâ€™t heard back.  Is there anything I could do to make him feel better? I just feel so shitty that I just became a bully and I never imagined myself stooping this low and being such an asshole
