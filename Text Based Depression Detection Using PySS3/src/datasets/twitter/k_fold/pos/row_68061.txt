Ok I want to understand. And have a question for my fellow teens. What is your allâ€™s opinion on the military? Forget the government side of it. Anything the government gets involved in gets ruined. But do you respect those who sacrifice anything, and often times everything? Or Id not, why not ? 
This is mostly centered at the US military, if your not from the US Iâ€™m still curious what your answer is, but Iâ€™m more asking my fellow American teens.
