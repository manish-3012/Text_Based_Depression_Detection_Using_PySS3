Why are people so stupid sometimes So our school had this hybrid schedule for a while were we had 2 days in school and 3 days online or if you opted you could go full online. So after after about 5 weeks of this hybrid schedule we are allowed back into school full time for anybody who wanted to go havk full time and anybody who wanted to remain online coyld do so. For weeks all was well and only 1 Covid case was reported which was quickly handled and anybody who was in contact with said person was quarantined for 2 weeks and things resumed to normal. Then we get to homecoming week and on friday there was a football game were the homecoming king and queen were announced. Well apparently after this game a large party with the homecoming candidates and a lot of other students decide to go and throw a huge party. Fast forward a week to today and the school makes an announcement that due to a number of Covid cases from this party, all students would return online until monday of next week. Initially i thought it wouldn't be so bad because it was only until monday but apparently nearly 16 cpnfirmed cases were reported and number is likely to rise so now there's a high probability everybody will be onlime indefinitely because of some idiot seniors throwing a homecoming party.

tl;dr a bunch of seniors threa a homecoming party were a bunch of people obviously caught Covid so now the whole school will return to online indefinitely most likely

Also sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors. It's late and i didnt feel like checking
