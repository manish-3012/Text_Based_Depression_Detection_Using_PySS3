I got asked out by a girl for the first time. I rejected her Today I (16M) hot asked out by a girl. I have never been asked out by a girl ever before, and I was worried that I might never get a girlfriend because I am kinda overweight and I am not that handsome and am kinda nerdy. So I was really happy when I was asked out. But then something clicked into place. The girl that asked me out has a boyfriend. In fact,  The only reson that I was single came up in the conversation was because she was talking about her boyfriend. I asked her about this, and she said, "He won't say anything. Because I won't say anything to him". I was shocked. I rejected her on the spot and told her that I don't want to be someone's sidepiece.

I posted this here Cuz I see a lot of people talking  their relationship status, so I thought this fitted here. The other thing is, I am not sure I made the right call, as I am worried this might be the only chance I could've had a Girlfriend, and I feel like I have sealed my destiny to be single forever. I just want to get your opinion whether it not I made the right call
