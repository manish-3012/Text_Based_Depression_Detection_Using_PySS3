An overlooked issue in america - in support of Asian Americans There is a system currently in place that has been overlooked or even praised too often. This system actively discriminates against people of Asian decent (particularly southeastern Asians). This system is the current system for college admissions. 

The way this system is designed is to help minorities have an easier time getting admissions to colleges in order to counteract the fact that many minorities don't have access to the top level of education because they live in poorer areas. The problem is this system actively makes it harder for Asians to get admitted their preferred college. The reason for this is because the system forces people to compete against their own race for a spot at a college. Because Asians perform better in school on average than other races, a higher bar is set for them to gain acceptance into a college.

I believe that this system should be done away with. Instead it should be replaced with a system that looks at the individuals school and mae's accommodations based on the level of funding and resources at that school. This system would be able to target the students who were most disadvantaged due to quality of school instead of blanket accommodations for race.

I think it is important to not punish a race simply because they over perform in a certain area and I believe that any system that punished a specific race is in fact a racist system that should be treated as such.
