do u ever just get extremely embarrassed about things you do naturally For example, at school Iâ€™d have coughing fits in class and I wouldnâ€™t be able to stop coughing. It felt like everyone was staring at me and I was being a hide distraction. Literal tears would be flying from my eyes from coughing so much and Iâ€™d just leave the class to cough in the bathroom. Then Iâ€™d only come back to class to cough more and people would ask me if Iâ€™m dying. Also itâ€™s really embarrassing to be the only one who keeps getting up to use the tissues. Do I just have bad allergies or is everyone else just dealing with it? My teacher put the tissue box right next to me bc I needed it so much
