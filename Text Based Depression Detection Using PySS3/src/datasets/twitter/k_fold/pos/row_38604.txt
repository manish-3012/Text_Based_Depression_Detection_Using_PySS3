I did it. I managed to gain over a thousand karma in seven after being inactive on reddit for almost a year. Now, don't get me wrong, a thousand karma in seven hours is not a lot, but to me, it is. It's a lot to me because I literally have never posted anything on reddit, only lurking in the subreddits and occasionally looking at memes or something similar to that. You could also check my timeline to see that almost every point of karma I gained was from today's posts. And honestly, this calls for celebration with my girlfr- oh. Nevermind. 

Anyways, I just wanted to share this with you all. Have a great day.
