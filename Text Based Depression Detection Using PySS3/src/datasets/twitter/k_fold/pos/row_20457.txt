I need internet privacy help My parents have recently started to track my history and idk how exactly but I think through the isp(?).

Apparently they can see how long I spend on a site and what site I am using. Iâ€™ve tried to search online but I couldnâ€™t understand a thing.

Apparently they can see what I do on reddit too so maybe they can see this post.

I just want to know how to hide my isp history )or whatever it is) from my parents. So far Iâ€™m using VPN but itâ€™s really slow and Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™d using duck duck go.

Does anyone know how to hide history from the the isp router? Any help is appreciated and I hope this helps other teens as well.

I just wanna protect my privacy:(
