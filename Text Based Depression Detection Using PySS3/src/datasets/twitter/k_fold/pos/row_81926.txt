Maintaining online friends is hard! I've met a lot of nice people online. But I never manage to stay as friends for more then 2 months. A lot people (including myself) just lose interest and just leave. And also finding out what to talk about is a lot harder with online friends then the ones you meet everyday on school. Finding up subjects to talk about is a lot harder, so it'll eventually just leave to the convo ending and not talking to each other for a long time. It's also hard to know when to start a convo, especially when the others don't start the convo first. And all these issues aren't becosue we have nothing in common, I've dudes that have a lot same interest as me. 

Idk, it could just me. But I thought I'd post this here.
