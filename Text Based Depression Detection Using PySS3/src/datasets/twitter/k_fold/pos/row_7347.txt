Holy fuck do i have corona Last tuesday i woke up kinda tired, nauseous, and slightly feverish? Then i felt like i had an itch in my throat. That just kept developing, getting worse and worse, and now, sunday morning, i woke up with a full on sore throat. Are these the early symptoms? Or do i just have the cold or the flu? Idk why im asking a bunch of teenagers im just scared and this was the first place i thought of oh god
