Whenever you see me actively commenting on reddit, tell me to get the fuck off Reddit and stop being distracted. Read description for more info. Hi it's me. I'm just leaving this here to tell you guys that I keep getting distracted and scrolling through reddit because I have ADHD, the actual diagnosed condition. Not that stupid shit that 14 year old white girls claim they have because they're too lazy to do something. I don't want to delete my account because I'll just end up creating a new one and the problem will start all over again. I also can't use a site blocker, because I'll just disable it. So you have my full permission, whenever you see me commenting on a post, to tell me to get the fuck off Reddit and stop being distracted. Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a good day.
