Anyone wish you had a better relationship with your dad? Hey Teens,

I know there's a lot of kids growing up without a positive relationship with their dads.

My parents were divorced before I was born, and I grew up that way back in the 60s and 70s.

It hurt to not have my dad in my daily life.

I started a YouTube channel for teens, and especially teenage boys (though girls are welcome too!), who may be growing up without their dad in their daily lives.

If you're feeling a hole because your dad isn't there, then I invite you to visit my YouTube channel, the "My Stepdad" channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodnY\_LHqZm9WPQ7pzLr\_aQ/](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodnY_LHqZm9WPQ7pzLr_aQ/)
