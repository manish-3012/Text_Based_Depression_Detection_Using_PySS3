I wish we didn't have to stand for the pledge or do salutes Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with being proud bro be an american or being patriotic. But I always found the salutes and "standings" if that makes any sense, very cringe lol. And just not my thing. I find it very unecissary is all.
