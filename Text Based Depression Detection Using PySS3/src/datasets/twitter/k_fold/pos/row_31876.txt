Listen to me for a second here. Appreciate your friends. I finally saw my friends after so long, of course all proper precautions were taken, we were out on more of a mission, and I just truly found out how much I was missing without seeing them. Appreciate your friends, platonically love your friends, and make sure they do that to you. Just take all the people you love, hold them ever so tightly, and do as much in your power to not let them go. Go, go tell your best friends just how much you love them, you really, truly should.
