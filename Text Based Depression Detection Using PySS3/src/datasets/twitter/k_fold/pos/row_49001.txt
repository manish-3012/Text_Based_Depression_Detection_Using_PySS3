I figured out a sad metaphor in my dream today So I could figure out today's metaphor in my dream

The dream was about me getting a Cherry from the fridge, it was a newer one cuz it had light yellow on it.

My dad said to throw it away. I did as I was told to becuz I'm naturally scared of being hated.

So I got a different one. He said "Oh no you don't need one."

I believe this metaphor is that the first Cherry was my first date, he didn't like that so he made me get rid of them.
So when I got a new one, he said it was to early and I shouldn't get one.

This is the first time I could see the metaphor right when I woke up.
