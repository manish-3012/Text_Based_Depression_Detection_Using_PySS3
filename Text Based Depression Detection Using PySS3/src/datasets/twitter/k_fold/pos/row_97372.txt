Thereâ€™s a line in a Mr Gum book I relate to a lot â€œ...Mr publisher of this book, and Mrs publisher of this book.â€ Then went on to say â€œWhich is actually Mr publisher this book, wearing a dressâ€ implying that the publisher was lonely and had to dress as a girl to replace a wife/gf. Very relatable.
