Nothing I hate more. There is nothing I hate more than awards on Reddit. The most annoying, nonsensical piece of trivial internet bullshit. I hope I never get an award. And you shouldnâ€™t be giving people awards either. Theyâ€™re foolish, a waste of time, and I think reddit would be better without them.
