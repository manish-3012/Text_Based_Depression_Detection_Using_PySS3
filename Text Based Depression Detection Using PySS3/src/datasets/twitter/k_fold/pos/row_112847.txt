Ok time for super obscure question that 2 people would know. So Iâ€™m looking for a book, i remember the back and itâ€™s something about a guy that finds his way into a secret organization, an Asian one. Itâ€™s a young adults book. Anything would be helpful. 

Also if you know of any books about a secret organization and stuff like that tell me about them. Iâ€™m a huge fan of secret societies and mystery books.
