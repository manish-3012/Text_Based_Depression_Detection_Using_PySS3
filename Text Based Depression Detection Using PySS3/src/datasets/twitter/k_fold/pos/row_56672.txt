Thought some of the single people out there might relate to this Its so funny that always the  friend who is single always tends to give most of the relationship advices to the other friends in the group

Btw i am that single friend ;) 

I mean most of the guys in my group still tend to impress all the girls in the class by doing crazy stud stuff and but i guess i've been that guy who doesn't care that much about what people think about me  as well as too lazy to ask anyone about their opinion on me . Its not like i don't talk to girls , i do but i didn't feel some kind of attraction to girls i talk to . As well as the biggest factor of me staying single is i am not a social media guy so i dont usually dm anyone that much except for the 'bois' and few others if i need some work . I did had a crush on few of my seniors but was shit scared to say anything and obviously they had bfs but i didnt care that much as if i would just go crazy for them . I am 18 now and now i am at that stage of life where i guess having a relationship will be too risky for me as i am preparing for getting into good college as well as trying to develop few hobbies because of which i might not even give much time to the girl i would be in with .

My advice to the younger ones would be to just go on with the flow of life and dont stress out over stuff like if someone says  you're not their type or the relationship type material etc etc .I mean at this stage of life there are several other stuff you all can spend your time instead of just stressing over why  one doesn't like you. If You find true love thats pretty good but if you don't there is no need to worry as life is pretty big. You will find some idiot at the end of the day who will like you for what you are.
