I feel like people think Iâ€™m this hardcore girl but Iâ€™m not if you look at me youâ€™d think I only own clothes and items in earthy colors, listen to hard rock and rap, dont care about anyone or there feelings, doesnâ€™t care about school work, etc. but I appear that way by no I listen to soft music, care about everyone and there feelings, care about my school work, own everything in a girly color, really soft person, and other stuff. maybe I seem like the hardcore jock girl but thatâ€™s my outside personality lol. idk this is kind of a random post but ya know thanks for reading
