Update with me and my girlfriend: We're still together! It's going great and I'm so happy to have her. We're helping each other out a bunch with all of our baggage and I'm so happy and lucky to have her. Last time we hung out, we watched The Lighthouse and I kept on spooking her all throughout! It was adorable.

In some sadder news.. the end may be soon. She's like, super smart and applied to 3 different boarding schools that she will most definitely get into, and all of them are in different states. It's sad but at least I'll know when the end is, and if she ends up going we'll spend the summer like it's our last months alive.

No clue who's going to read this or who's going to care, just wanted to put it out there! 

love you all and stay strong &lt;3
