Why am I so fucking scared of getting help. I actually desperately need a therapist or Iâ€™m not gonna make it to eighteen. I swear to fucking god. My friend today even said I need a therapist and he doesnâ€™t even know the extent of whatâ€™s going on. Iâ€™m so fucked. I just canâ€™t bring myself to alert my parents. I feel like I failed them. I donâ€™t wanna stress them. I donâ€™t even know how to bring it up. â€œHey so Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for at least 4 years and didnâ€™t feel like telling you, oopsâ€ oh my fucking god. Theyâ€™re gonna feel like shit. Theyâ€™re gonna think they failed as parents since their son is so closed off about his feelings to them. Iâ€™ve already caused enough pain to people I care about, I really donâ€™t need this shit. I never tell them ANYTHING about my personal life. My friend/crush killed him self last month, my mom found out, and I lied and said I didnâ€™t even know him. Why am I so closed off about my feelings. This is going to be my demise and I know it.
