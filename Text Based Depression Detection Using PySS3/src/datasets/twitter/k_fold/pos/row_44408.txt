I'm very frustrated My sister is going on a trip this Monday. My parents paid for it like 36$ and also are giving her 20$ to go to McDonald's. I've asked her to buy smth for like 3$ and then my mom came home and started bitchin how I should give my MONEY to my sister for whatever I want her to buy for me. My mom never gives me any money. All the cash that I have is given to me by my grandma. And not only my mom is willing to spent like 56$ on my sis and 0$ on me but she also said that I didn't give her a gift on the 8th of March.  EX-FUCKING-CUSE ME WHO I BAKED THOSE FUCKING CUPCAKES FOR??? DO ONLY MONEY-PRESENTS COUNT AS FUCKING PRESENTS NOW???!???
