Is it okay to call myself Irish? 

Im 50% irish. I don't remember where its from on my dads side but I know my great grandpa on my moms side came from Ireland to new york and married a girl who did the same, because of this my grandpa on my moms side is pretty irish. 

My immediate family doesnt make any big deal of it besides my mom who talks about how much of an irish girl she is and how were all irish.  She always listens to irish music (i mean the old country stuff i don't remember what you guys call it) i also have a very irish name. 

Whenever i say im an American my mom makes a big deal to say were irish and it seems like she's desperate for a culture she or any of us are actually part of. I know many people do this stuff because "my uncles, friends, daughters, cousins, dogs puppies met a dog at the park from ireland. Im part irish" 

Is it okay to say im irish?
