Guys and gals. I made a sub. If your from any of the USâ€™s southern state. Youâ€™ll probably like it. Itâ€™s about sharing Southern thing that you do. Whack drive a diesel or tear fields up with a dirtbike or hunt or enjoy country music or southern rock. No racism allowed. And no confederate glorification. r/hillbillyhangout
