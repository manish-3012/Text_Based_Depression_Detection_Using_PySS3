Gfâ€™s ex wonâ€™t get the hint Hey guys, so basically me and my gf are real happy ya know? But her ex always acts weird around us. I personally think the dude is a bit odd, but I know heâ€™s a good guy deep down so I donâ€™t get mad at him or anything like that. But he constantly comes to social media, one of them being this very subreddit, posting about her and me and complaining about how she dumped him when they werenâ€™t even together that long, and from what Iâ€™ve been told, she didnâ€™t like the relationship pretty much at all. Does anyone have advice on how I could politely let him know that she doesnâ€™t want him and he needs to move on? Because like I said, heâ€™s a good dude, just a bit weird.
