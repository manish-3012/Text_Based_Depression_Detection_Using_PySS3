What should I do? I noticed that one of my friends has been ignoring me when I talk a lot. Iâ€™m not sure if she just doesnâ€™t understand social standards because she is a little awkward, but last week I told her something that can change my life forever and she said â€œcool! Wanna hear about my crazy dream?â€ Iâ€™m in 7th grade so idk if I should post here but Iâ€™m going to highschool in a couple years. I will most likely not be her friend in highschool so Iâ€™m just trying to figure out what to do for now. Also, Iâ€™m terrible at confronting people and I go to a small private school so I canâ€™t really just make new friends easily, especially with COVID happening. I donâ€™t really want to drop her as a friend but I seriously donâ€™t know what else I can do.
