What the fuck?? I finally had the confidence to go meet someone in real life again, I was really excited to see my only real life friend and we would just walk around in the city and shop a bit. A few days ago my mum forced me to go on an activity I absolutely hate, my parents always force me to du stuff I really don't wanna do. Well it turns out on that free time activity I went to, which I absolutely hated, I talked to no one and just stayed away from everybody. Someone MAYBE has covid so now I can't go to the city and I will miss the first two days of irl schools which would have given me a plan on how this school year starts. Great! Now I cried for the past two hours, I was in a really good mood. I was really looking forward to get my school life together and I built up the confidence and now I feel even worse than before and I fucking hate it.
