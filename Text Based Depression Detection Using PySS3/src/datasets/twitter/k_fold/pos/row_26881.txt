anyone else hate this we start school soon and oh boy i can't wait for linda to present us a slideshow about where she went to college and how she goes hiking on the weekends with her two children, husband, and dog, and how she likes yoga. like fr i don't care about your life does that sound insensitive or whatever? i also hate when they read the whole syllabus to us like... we can read and we can read it outside of class. i would rather just jump into taking notes honestly. oh yeah not to mention the whole "2 truths and a lie" or "tell the class something about yourself and we'll go around in a circle!"... jfc
