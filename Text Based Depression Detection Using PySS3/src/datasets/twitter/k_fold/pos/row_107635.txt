If you suspect a post is from a predator please let me know so I can keep tabs on the user and any possible affiliates. (Iâ€™m not a mod) Please alert mods and if you donâ€™t have enough to go off of tag me and Iâ€™d be happy to look into myself. I have a feeling that a lot of predators have been coming out a lot more, Iâ€™ve noticed a few strange accounts and posts recently. I have a sub, r/predatorwatch that is only me, but I try and keep tabs on anyone I suspect to be a predator, rn it only has two names on it and they are both just suspected, you can find the list always tagged on the sub, and it will be updated accordingly. Also I donâ€™t just throw around baseless claims, I take recording and ss of stuff that can be used to back me up and I post it on the sub as well.

But if you find a predator Iâ€™d ask that youâ€™d try and capture ss and sr and post them on the sub so I can update the list and keep tabs on the people, this also goes for any sub not just this one.
