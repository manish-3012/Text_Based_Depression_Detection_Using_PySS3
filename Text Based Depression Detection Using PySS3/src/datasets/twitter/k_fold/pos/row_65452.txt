My dad can't talk anymore. So my dad just came home from work and he couldn't talk anymore he switched between talking in dutch to English to French but all that came out was just words tied together, so he went to sleep and when he woke up I was he alone with him and he tried to ask something but all that came out of him was the word 2019 and before that so when my mom came home she went to the hospital with him and that was all 10 minutes ago so yeah I just wanted to share this I don't know why but I'll try and keep this updated when they come back but I suspect it's either a brain tumor cuz he's already got long cancer that spread throughout his body or he had a minor stroke. I hope your having a better day than mine so far.
