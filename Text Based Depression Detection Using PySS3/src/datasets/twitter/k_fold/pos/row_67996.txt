Would you date me if I didn't have genitals? Hello, I'm an 18yo agender person, and I'm currently trying to get my vagina completely removed. The surgery is known as nullification (it's safe and a completely normal way of dealing with dysphoria), and will produce a completely smooth crotch area. While it's harder for someone AFAB like me, it is possible, and since I live in Manhattan and have a supportive family it is something I am able to do. 

Since this is a very taboo surgery I am worried about how it'll effect my chances of getting a girlfriend. My current gf/crush is already disappointed about me being afab (I look very androgynous so I don't think she knew at first). I'm worried any girls I meet in the future will be horrified by my body once I don't have genitals. 

Would you still be attracted sexually and romantically to someone without genitals? (I'm asking this question as a hypothetical, so assume I'm someone you'd be attracted to initially).
