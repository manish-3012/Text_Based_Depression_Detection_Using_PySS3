Why are most teens so moody 

Smh I canâ€™t even make friends with these bitches cause they donâ€™t know how to speak like normal people. Itâ€™s as if having zero social skills is common. When I ask â€œyo whatâ€™s goodâ€ and you respond with â€œIâ€™m failing all my classes teeheeâ€ itâ€™s hella annoying. Why canâ€™t an extrovert find some non awkward friends without having to go through a job interview process to decide whoâ€™s worth talking to. Rant over lmao
