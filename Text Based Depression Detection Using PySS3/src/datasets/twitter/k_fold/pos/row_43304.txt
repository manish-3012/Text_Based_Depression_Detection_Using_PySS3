Im so stupid When we still had school i used to play with rubix cubes i had like 4 different cubes and my teacher told me to go put them in the locker and covid hit and we were out of school but i forgot to get my stuff out of the locker and forgot about them and i didnâ€™t know they had locker pickups because my didnâ€™t told me about it so  after 100 days i remembered where i put my rubix cubes and now im mad at my self because they probably thrown them away so rip me
