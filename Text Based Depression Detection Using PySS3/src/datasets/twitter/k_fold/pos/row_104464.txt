I used to slather my penis with peanut butter or mayonnaise and get the family dog to give me fantastic head. 
Years ago, I used to live with family. We had a dog. He was a good boy. Smart, easily trained, affectionate, and loving.

One night during a summer, I found myself home alone with him. I was bored and horny as fuck. I couldn't get to a prostitute or a hookup, so I had an idea. I had once read a story about women and people who used peanut butter to get their dogs to do the work.

Why not? Let's give it a go!

I started out using peanut butter. Put it on rich and thick.

WHISTLES COME 'ERE, BOY. I GOT SOMETHING FOR YA!

WOW! Did the dog love it, and holy Christ did he ever do a good job! He licked the shit out of it and made me cum unbelievably. It worked great.

This became routine. The dog started BEGGING me for it. Somehow he started to know, whenever everyone went out and it was just him and I alone, what might go down. As soon as everybody was gone, I'd be sitting on the couch or wherever, and he'd start crying and sniffing around my crotch to see where his treat was at. Sometimes I wasn't even in the mood, but he wouldn't shut up. So I'd take my pants off, get the jar from the kitchen, and let him go to work anyway.

I started out using peanut butter but eventually switched to mayonnaise. The texture was better, and it was greasy so it provided more lube for his tongue.

Man, this dog REALLY knew what to do. I'd cover the key points on my penis in mayonnaise and reapply it occasionally and he'd go to town. I tried to keep him concentrated around the head and the frenulum. Eventually, he learned exactly where to stay without me directing him. I could just sit back with my legs spread, close my eyes, and pretend it was any woman I wanted. It was all automatic.

&gt; MFW I realize that I trained an animal to give explosive head on demand.
I had to make sure that we were absolutely alone because often I couldn't stop myself from moaning and screaming out in pleasure. His wide, long, wet, warm tongue was almost able to wrap completely around my cock in one stroke, in what felt like 100x a minute. He gave me mind-bending orgasms. So good that sometimes I felt like I was going to pass out.

It was heavenly. Just as good or better than a real blowjob. Why use hookers or sluts when I had the dog? He even somehow learned to tell when I was about to orgasm. He'd start panting and slobbering all over my dick as he licked furiously. Then when I came, he would wimper in excitement as he licked up and ate splurt after splurt of my load.

It was kind of a bonding experience. Afterwards when I had cleaned up, we'd sit together cuddled up, his head on my lap, and he was perfectly content to have serviced his master.

Sadly, he lived a long life but became ill in his old age. He got the diabetes and a few other things. We had to put him down. Maybe it was all that fucking peanut butter and mayonnaise.

Obviously, I'm not proud of this at all. Getting your dog to blow you and swallow your cum isn't something that's looked nicely upon.

But at the same time, maybe it's not so bad. People have been having sexual contact with animals for all of human history. The Greeks had a list of animals that you COULD have sex with and a list of animals that you COULDN'T, which was written into law. The Romans did it. They did it with farm animals in the Medieval period. Some European women were known for sex with horses during the Renaissance. Even TODAY, in some Middle Eastern and African countries, sex with animals is par for the course.

This isn't something unheard of. I didn't hurt or force the dog. He was happy to do it. And don't tell me that "animals can't consent" bullshit. I merely offered the dog a chance to lick my cock and sweetened the deal with a treat. He didn't have to do it. I didn't hold his head down on me. But he wanted the peanut butter and mayonnaise so he chose to tongue my head. That's consent. He was happy. I was happy. It was a fair trade.
