Well. Hasn't 2020 been fucking amazing? We're going through a global pandemic. I got dumped by a person who couldn't care less after so many months. 99% of my friends almost only send me messages for hw answers. That is, if they even send me shit. My grades have been slipping, I'm actually failing shit now. And I don't even have the motivation to leave my bed anymore. Can't wait for next year!
