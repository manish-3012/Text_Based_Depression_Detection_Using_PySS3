Today is one of those days One of those days where u have yet another massive argument with ur parents and then have to endure a two hour car journey in the rain with a huge box on ur lap obscuring ur vision whilst listening to ur mums favourite song which goes â€˜take me down Iâ€™m so tired now, leave me where I lie, shoot shoot shootâ€™ never mind the fact ur on ur period.

Anyway have a nice day ðŸ˜
