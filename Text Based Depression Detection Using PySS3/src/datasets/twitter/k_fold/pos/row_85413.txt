I has a new friend So I sit next to this boy I vaguely knew in my class, and he offered me to play online chess with him. The thing is, I didnâ€™t know how. HOWEVER, He showed me how to play and guided me through a game of chess against the computer (I won ðŸ˜Ž) and then we had a chess match against each other (he won). So now I know how to play chess and I think I have a new friend :D

I just wanted to share because Iâ€™m very happy about this.
