Tip: how to add your age at the end of username So I've seen a lot of people who don't have a user flair (that's what it's called btw) but say their age other places (so not for privacy)
That's why I made this Post just to let you guys know.

Mobile: tap the three dots in the top-right corner of the sub and tap "change user flair"

Desktop: click the community options dropdown under "about community" and then the edit button below "user flair preview
