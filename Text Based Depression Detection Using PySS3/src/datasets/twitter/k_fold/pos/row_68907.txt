Iâ€™m mad and sad and donâ€™t know what to do So my friend has moved in with me since she was kicked out and I told her she can stay with me till she has enough money to move out. it hasnâ€™t even been a full week since she has lived with me and she brought her gf over to sleep over. I only have a queen bed and once I was ready to go to bed there was no room for me. So I have been sitting outside it is currently 4 am I havenâ€™t slept at all and I have to work at 8 am Iâ€™m pissed and breaking down I hate my life
