Is it cheating to casually flirt with other girls? I have a beautiful girlfriend and Iâ€™m happy with her and would never cheat on her. What I want to know is, would casual flirting be classed as cheating? Not actually saying anything specifically flirty, but just like talking to an attractive girl and having a laugh, or laughing at her jokes even if they arenâ€™t funny etc.
