Oatmeal raisin cookies are better than chocolate chip ones. 
Oatmeal raisin cookies just hits different. The nutty buttery taste of the cookie goes wonderfully with the sweet and slight tartness of the raisins. Not only that, but it has a nice crumbly almost melt-in-your-mouth texture. On the other hand, chocolate chip cookies are just too constant. Itâ€™s just sweet and thatâ€™s it. Whereas the wonderful oatmeal raisin cookies have a delicious taste and many variations in flavor and texture which makes eating it a better experience overall.
