Im done So i asked a girl out a couple days ago... 
I got friendzoned... And thought to myself 'this can't get any worse right? "
I was wrong (as usual) it got A LOT worse.... But let's continue the story so I asked her out, the next day i had to go to my french lesson. There i go with one of my best and nearest friend. So as any human in my situation i wasn't on an exactly good mood... My friend could see the sadness... And what did his head thought of saying... He litteraly started telling to me that this dude told him that and the other this that i made it too awkward and all that kind of shit and the list of people that were into the gossip was growing and growing.... Then he was like can you show me the messages.... And as every people with an iq above the room temperature i said no then he remembered that i make posts about this things on reddit and  he found  the post  before  i was able to delete it..he screenshotted  everything and sended it to a lot of classmates.. 
I was really angry ( and i'm still angry) now everybody makes fun of me.. While before everyone wanted me to ask her  out  and were pushing me to do it now it's the completely opposite ... I haven't texted anyone after that (or talked to) 
Ive been introvented, gaming all day long.. I don't know who to trust anymore.. Any help??? 

Sorry for long post and i'm also not a native speaker... 

One Last thing(If my 'best " friend is reading this i want him to know  that he  betrayed my trust for the last time if he knows what i mean)
