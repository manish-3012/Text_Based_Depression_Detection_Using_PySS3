I finally asked my crush... â€œIf there are two conjoined twins, one of them is asleep but the other one is awake and murders someone, do both of them go to jail? Because if if the answer is yes then youâ€™d be putting an innocent person behind bars. But if you answer is no, then youâ€™d be letting a murderer go free...â€

She said

â€œWho the hell are you?â€
