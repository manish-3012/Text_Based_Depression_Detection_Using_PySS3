Iâ€™m more shy on the internet than irl Somehow I donâ€™t know why but my social skills are far worse on the internet than in real life. I know for most people itâ€™s the inverse because you donâ€™t know each other that well. It sucks because I wanna make friends with people but Iâ€™m like overthinking everything that I say. Although on second thought Iâ€™m not good with new people in real life either.
