Hello, I am here to bitch about things So I have muscular dystrophy and my subset is unknown and my back is also fucky, if i stand up for too long my back starts hurting or if i bend over to much. ^( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
Also I have to wear leg braces [here](http://imgur.com/a/X9wfNZ9) and there very irritating sometimes but they do help me walk so. I also have a wheelchair that my parents refuse to get new parts for because the brake broke and the seat is stained and ruined with paint. I also really wanna go into the military but nOoOo you can't have a pre existing medical condition to join the military. The only upside to this shit is that I get free health care over 18 until doctors figure out what the hell is wrong with me completely.  I also have to drove 2 hours to get to the only hospital that's good with with what I have. I have a muscular appointment soon thank god cause I've gotten much worse then what I was last time I saw them. I'm done bitching now. I love you all.
