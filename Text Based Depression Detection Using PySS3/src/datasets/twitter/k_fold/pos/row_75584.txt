Give me some dares to do Things I will not do: I won't do or say anything bigoted (racist, homophobic, etc), and I won't do anything illegal. I also won't do anything that requires me to break COVID precautions.

Anything else is fine though. I'll probably do most of the dares tomorrow since I'm going to bed soon.

Bring it on, teenagers.

(I'm so freakin bored bruh)
