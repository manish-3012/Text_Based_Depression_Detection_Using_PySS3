My Asian parents I donâ€™t know how many of you can relate to this but Iâ€™m not really the type of kid who revise or study for a text , hell I donâ€™t even play attention in class (having ADHD and dyslexia make it hard to study) . Anyway so I got an A in business and you might think wow your parents must be so proud, but you couldnâ€™t be more wrong. I got 69% on the test ( yeah Sâ‚¬x but it the actual percentage I got ) anyhow my parents was like 69% that all , your teacher gave you an A for 69% at least it should have been 75% and did everyone in your class get an A too , your teacher way too easy on you (they did not and my business study teacher is a qualified IGSE marker) . To be honest maybe 69% wasnâ€™t actually that good I got 40 out of 52 or something canâ€™t really remember correctly but it was a writhing test and spelling and grammar is kinda hard for me , English isnâ€™t even my first language, plus i was very sick that day but i went because there were like 3 test that day so yeah maybe I was tired and should have done better .
