My Chemistry Teacher is Worst Woman on Earth I do admit my title is misleading however I stick up for my opinions. Anyways, let me take you on a journey to why my chemistry teacher is the worst woman on Earth.                                                                                          
  
The first time I emailed her it was before the school year, and I had sent out an email to all my teachers saying that I have violin lessons and I participate in my cities youth symphony orchestra (I play the violin if you were wondering) and that those things might conflict with school. Most of my teachers gave me good responses except for her. She said AND I QUOTE "It's up to you to decide how your time is spent. You can either study and work hard for my class, or play in the orchestra all you want," I was like okay, mean but I get it.

When we had our first quiz, I had accidentally submitted a file for my english class, and she just refused to let me reasses. Striaght up like that. I emailed her twice asking her to let me resubmit the correct file. No response.

Also, I've never seen her wear a mask even when there were students in the classroom. So yeah, wrst woman in the world.
