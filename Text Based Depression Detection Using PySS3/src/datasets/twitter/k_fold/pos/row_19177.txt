Is anyone else nervous about how they'll do with online school? I really struggle with learning online. Not only is it harder to understand the material that you're confusesd with without being able to be in a classroom, it just feels really weird to be doing "school" in the same place that I sleep and play video games at, and I struggle to focus. Also I did an online school during 7th and 8th grade and struggled a lot, so I know this isn't new for me, or because I just wasn't focusing in the spring.

Thankfully I'll be a senior and don't have too many classes to take, but I know it won't be good for the colleges I'm applying to see that I have all C's.
