Iâ€™m Going To Go To The Police About Being Raped I was in a sexually abusive relationship with a guy who was a legal adult when I was 16. He would gaslight me, encourage my ED, and would constantly scream in my face or threaten me if I did ANYTHING he didnâ€™t like. We would do sexual things sometimes. Sometimes I consented. Sometimes I told him no. He touched me anyways. It all culminated in him sexually assaulting me in the back of his car. I just remember screaming for my mom and begging him to stop. He just kept repeating â€œfive more minutesâ€.
One day I decided I had enough. He started calling me a whore and accusing me of cheating because Iâ€™d hung out with a male friend. I dumped him
He harassed and stalked me for over a year. Sometimes, Iâ€™m scared to leave my house, or be in a relationship, or even talk to men.
Iâ€™m done. I want to change things. Iâ€™m talking to my parents tomorrow, and I want to report after Christmas. Iâ€™m terrified, and donâ€™t know where to start. 
I just thought Iâ€™d say this to anyone whoâ€™s experienced something similar ; youâ€™re not alone. Itâ€™s not your fault.  And you will be ok.
Merry Christmas everyone
