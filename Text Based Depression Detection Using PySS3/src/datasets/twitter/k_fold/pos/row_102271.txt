Just thought I'd share this I know you lot like video games. So I have a recommendation: Beyond The Wire
Itâ€™s a WW1 tactical shooter made in cooperation with the developers of SQUAD and is based off the same base game. 
In my opinion it is extremely enjoyable, I have had so much fun over the last few days playing it. I really think you should check it out maybe on YouTube or something, itâ€™s still early access so it does need some ironing out but still itâ€™s incredibly fun. Itâ€™s slow paced when it needs to be and action packed when you want it to be. I just thought Iâ€™d recommend it and maybe some of you could give the small dev team some support and allow it to more easily achieve itâ€™s potential. It also has an amazing soundtrack. Anyway thanks for reading you guys.
