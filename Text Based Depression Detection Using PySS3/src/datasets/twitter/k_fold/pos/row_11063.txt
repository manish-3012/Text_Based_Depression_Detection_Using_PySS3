Why hasn't anyone got thick skin anymore It seems like any joke will turn a shit ton of people on you, like who the fuck are you to judge my joke about skinny black lesbians when you're a straight fat man where the fuck did you get the knowledge of what they went through.

In fact furthermore who would know about what the fuck the rape of nanking was without hearing that one joke from history of the world I guess and who would know how bad it is in china without all these jokes. I didnt actually find out for something like 13 years because the funny people are the only people who say anything.

Also why do we just forget about 9 year old girls in africa getting mega diddled by middle aged men like come on it's still happening.
