3 teachers complimented me about how Iâ€™m smart and I feel really good. First, we were taking a test and there were two teachers as proctors: PE and history teacher. They are talking near me and when they were walking back the history teacher padded my shoulder and told my PE teacher that I was the best student from last year. 

Second, we were in math class and it was basically free time. I asked my math teacher about what median was (I get median and mode confused a lot) and she was like â€œyouâ€™re one of the smartest math kids and you ask me on median hahaâ€. 

Last was my chemistry teacher. So I helped a senior with their project by coding a simple website for them, and the student told me chem teacher. And today she was like youâ€™re really smart and youâ€™re like Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory (Sheldon is this super genius, one of the main characters). 

I am so happy. No one probably cares but I feel really good today and I just had to say this to someone. 

This is why I donâ€™t chase popularity or relationships.

Oh no, my imposter syndrome is acting up again...
