I feel so weird Itâ€™s 2 am and I went to my garage to unplug my lawn mower battery. On the door I saw a wasp. Keep this in mind I recently got stung by a wasp under the fingernail which was super painful. I instantly slammed the door and it didnâ€™t get inside. I feel on the edge and  feel creeped out.
