I hate this girl It all started with christmas prom last year...

Literally everyone in my class wanted me to ask her out to the prom.

I didnt so i went alone.

The moment of the prom itself she says â€œi hope for him that he wont make a moveâ€

Ofc i didnt because i dont like her.

Next day rumours spread about me and she was mad that i didnt make the first move.

Now like almost a year later she is still annoying asf, today i chose to sit alone in class. Where i sat were 2 desks sitting next to eachother, i was sitting on the left one. She comes to me and sits on the right one with her ass towards me and shakes it. She then calls me out for looking at it while i didnt even do that.

After that she takes a seat infront of me, she keeps hanging on my table so i told her to go fÃºcking away.

Before all of this i heard her talking to a friend of her about a new rape law where i live. Its basically that all unwanted sexual things will be charged as rape. She asked when this law will be used.

So the moment when she sat there and shook her ass i didnt do anything because she will def set me up.

She really is trying everything untill i get mad etc, just so she has something to use.

Now you probably understand why i hate her
