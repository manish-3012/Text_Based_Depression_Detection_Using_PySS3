guys, gals, and non-binary pals, I've realized the human body is an engineering disaster Like the spine, for example, who came up with that? Why would you make a support structure out of a stack of discs and then put curves in the stack? You're just asking for trouble there, you didn't even need to put a VITAL ELECTRICAL COMPONENT inside said curvy stack of discs to know somebody would have had a critical failure at some point

Another thing: fuel intake is super non-intuitive. You'd think you can just throw whatever food you want into it, but *no*, you gotta apply a careful mix of different foods for maximum nutrition. And the mouth is an accident waiting to happen, come on, you've got a grinding mechanism *and* an air intake valve *and* an interface module operating from the same exact port, no wonder people choke on food so often.

If I ever meet whoever designed this I'd like to give them a piece of my mind (and probably ask them for a refund on it as well)
