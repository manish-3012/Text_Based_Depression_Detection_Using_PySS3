IT HAPPENED AGAIN DAMMIT If you remember my post in here form a couple days ago I heard someone say â€œShhâ€ while I was walking my dog at night. Well this time me and my brother made a camp fire outside and I wen to get more would and in my way back to the fire I hear a â€œHey!â€ From behind me I look and see nothing I ask my brother if he did it and he said no also it wouldnâ€™t make sense if he said it since it was behind me
