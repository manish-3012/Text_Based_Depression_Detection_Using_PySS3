how to manifest ur dream life \- stop being rude to urself this includes self deprecating jokes 

\- visualise the HIGHEST VERSION OF URSELF and understand that if u can visualise it, its a potential reality &amp; u can make it come true

\- start showing up as ur highest self: what do they look like? how do they act, talk, and walk? what\\s a habit they have? what time do they wake up in the morning? how do they treat people? answer these questions and apply them to urself

\- listen to music that makes u feel good, NO SAD MUSIC

\- take care of urself, stop going back to ppl who dont value u 

\- write down ur goals (or try scripting, where u write a journal entry as if u already have everything u want)

\~\~\~ thats it !! \~\~\~ i manifested my crush, clear skin, and getting into a rlly competitive national program. this WORKS
