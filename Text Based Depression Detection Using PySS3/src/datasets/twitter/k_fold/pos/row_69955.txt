I need to stop being such an among us rules nazi So what Iâ€™ve noticed when I play among us is that, at one point someone will be talking when theyâ€™re dead, or talking when weâ€™re outside of meetings. I just donâ€™t like that cus someone will say that they have a Visual Task and they arenâ€™t sus anymore. I just donâ€™t wanna play with people who talk when they arenâ€™t supposed to. Another thing is that people complain about how my game is set up, it being to slow or too many tasks. Can anyone help me in ways to â€œloosen upâ€ my feelings on among us game rules?
