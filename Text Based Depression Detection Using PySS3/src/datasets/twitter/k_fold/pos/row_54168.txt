My dadâ€™s reaction to me asking for a ps4/ps5 So while eating dinner I asked my parents if I could get a playstation (since I used to have one before my brother brought it with him to college). I had never even used it that much, and was expecting them to say no. The reason why I asked is because they were saying they planned on canceling cable tv because we have netflix, to which I was like ok sure and then I thought if I was gonna get a ps â€” which could theoretically be used only to watch netflix (which i havenâ€™t been able to watch except on my sisterâ€™s computer with her because the ps4 is gone)â€” I would need to ask now or never. Before thinking at all or waiting for me to say anything more or letting my mom think, my dad says this: â€œ A ps4?! *You do not* need more video games. Why do you want **more** games?! No.â€ What he said was along those lines but not word for word, and it had the same attitude of â€œyou play to much videogames you lazy greedy little bastard.â€ &lt;- [Which I really donâ€™t, I only play among us and cod mobile and my computer is a potatoâ€™s ass.] And then it was silent. I contemplated saying my point that they could make it so I canâ€™t get games on it. After a few seconds, I began to say this and my dad just looked at me. So at that point I just left the table. He literally made it look like I was totally out of line; like Iâ€™d just asked him if I could have a machine gun. When I left my mom was like â€œwait wait! wanna watch the debate from last night?â€ We didnâ€™t watch it yesterday bc it isnt even a debate and I was like â€œnot rnâ€ and then my dad acts like nothing happened and says â€œwanna play chess?â€ (Btw, they very rarely ever get along and need a divorce. Staying together isnâ€™t helping anyone) So theyâ€™re begging me to hang out with them at this point. And when Iâ€™m half way upstairs to my room my mom calls up and is like â€œLetâ€™s watch a movie!â€ To which I respond, â€œCan you stop making me feel guilty for not hanging out with you!â€ And now I am in my room. Alone.
