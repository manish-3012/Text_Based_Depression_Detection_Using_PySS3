haha get away from me okay, so, I try my hardest to be a nice person. I do. 

I try to respond to people on time, I try to make them happy, I try my hardest. I know my hardest isn't ever enough. but I do know when it should be and *is* enough. 

I'm gonna sound super narcissistic when I say I know how I am. I know I'm mean sometimes, I know I'm distant. I've had multiple friends become too attached to me, and it sucks, because I'm not that time of friend to be able to provide comfort when needed. 

recently, I've had one of my friends become too close for comfort.

they keep asking for be to *be there.* and I'm trying so hard to be, to provide advice and say what I should say. but I'm genuinely not that type of person. most of my friends know this. so does this person. 

it's so annoying at this point. they want me to answer within seconds, and while I find it a little flattering, it's extremely exhausting for someone with insomnia and a sister to take care of. if I don't, they proceed to get angry. 

I feel like I'm doing enough with this friendship. I'm replying in under an hour, we have full conversations, we say stupid things, we hang out, etc etc. that's what I'm *used to* and *am willing to do.* that's what I'm comfortable with. 

I know it sounds mean, but god, I can't be there for them. whenever they vent I just wanna start crying and ripping out my hair right then and there.
