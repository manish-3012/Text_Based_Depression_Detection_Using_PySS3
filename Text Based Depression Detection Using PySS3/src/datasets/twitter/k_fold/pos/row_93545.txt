Why I think the caves update is a bad idea (criticism/feedback welcome) Okay so, I've always thought it was a bad idea to add a cave update to Minecraft, and now I want to be vocal about it.

I know many people have always wanted an update for caves because they are boring and stuff, but that's part of the procedural generation of the game.

If there was an update to caves like custom built caves that'll ruin the randomly generated terrain of the game, and with the look of the live event today, made it look like it will ruin the effect of the world being randomly generated.

I know there are other buildings like the mineshafts, nether fortresses, and the stronghold, but each of those has just separate custom rooms, and those rooms are randomly put together.

TLDR: I think it'll ruin the random generation of Minecraft worlds

And I want to know your thought on the new update. :)
