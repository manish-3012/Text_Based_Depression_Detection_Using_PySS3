I'm Scared I'm Going To Be Just Like My Parents I just need to rant because I'm scared.

I've been realizing lately just how toxic my parents are and how much it's messed me up. They're verbal abuse and have been physically abusive too. My opinions and beliefs aren't listened too and I'm not allowed to practice what I believe. They make me feel like everything's my fault. And I'm scared I'm going to be just like them when I get older and have kids. I already feel like I'm toxic towards my friends, what if I mess someone up just like they're messing me up right now?

I don't ever want to make someone feel how they make me feel, but what if I do? I try so hard to help my friends but I know I'm constantly just pulling them down and making everyone unhappy. What if I do that to my future family too? I feel like my present s/o already doesn't want me around because of me being a mess already. 

I know this is probably kind of jumbled and maybe doesn't make much sense, I just needed to get it out. Thanks for listening to my rant.
