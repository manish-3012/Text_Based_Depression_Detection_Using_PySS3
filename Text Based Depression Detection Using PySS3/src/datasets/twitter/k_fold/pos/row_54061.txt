I hate Respondus My bio teacher recently made us start using lockdown for quizzes and exams. That's all fine and dandy but the answers for the quiz aren't fucking available so idk what the fuck I got wrong so Idk what I need to fucking study so I can retake it and get a better fucking grade

And part of the problem is idek wtf the quiz was on prior to taking it. It just said Protosomes. So I went to the ppt's on canvas and only one mentioned them so I studied that ppt... the quiz had info for 2 other ppt that I hadn't studied

I am so fuckin done with this... prob gonna cheat via sticky notes next time I retake it
