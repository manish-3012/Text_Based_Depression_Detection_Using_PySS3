If you could remake the country what would you change about it (social issues, economy, education laws, ect.)? So for a project Im doing in school I have to create a political party and what the beliefs would be and the class will vote on what they think is best and I want to see what everyone's ideas are on here of what you would change

Edit: When I mean this country it can be any country but preferably USA
