Iâ€™m so overwhelmed I feel like I can do anything right anymore and my parent expect things that I canâ€™t deliver. Iâ€™ve had no motivation to do anything and nothing makes me happy anymore. I though about suicide a lot lately and it scares me. I donâ€™t want to die but I see no end to things and nothing I do is helping. I have no where to go and nowhere else to turn. I want to end feeling like this but I donâ€™t know how. I donâ€™t intend this be, but if these are my last remarks I want everyone that cares about me to know that I am grateful for you and I am glad I had a chance to know you.
