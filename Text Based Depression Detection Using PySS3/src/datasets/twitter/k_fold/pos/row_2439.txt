A song I wrote about a girl. Thoughts? With every day I pass, I feel like is should tell you in case its my last. I feel like I love you more than any other guy , but I'm too afraid to admit it yeah, I'm too shy. You might ask, why? Well that's a question I haven't answered for myself yet, I should probably just admit it before I regret. For christmas I got us matching hoodies, but I feel like I think more of us than should be. I want so bad just to be able to openly love you, and hug you, and cuddle you and snuggle you, but that's only in my dreams. I don't know, should I ask you how you feel? If you said yes would it even be real? I don't want to push anything on you but I need to say something about because I don't want it to be a big deal.
