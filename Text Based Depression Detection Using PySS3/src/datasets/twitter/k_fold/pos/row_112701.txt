Iâ€™m not digging the setup we have for e-learning. Now this is a little petty but I enjoy privacy and since my sisterâ€™s room is so small her desk will be put on the balcony next too my room wall because that is the only place it can be put because my house is so cluttered with antique stuff my mom likes and my sister already has an art table in her room, I just hope to god the walls are thick enough so the zoom calls will be muttered. I was gonna move my desk farther from my window but guess not now it doesnâ€™t matter that much and that she doesnâ€™t really use it outside of e-learning because it feels weird to go outside your room to have your sister sitting right by your door, I have a bigger room than her cause I got lucky and was born before her so maybe Iâ€™ll be far enough so it wonâ€™t bother my conscious. She usually gloats downstairs though and right now she has the worst sleep schedule so I should be fine for at least a couple weeks.
