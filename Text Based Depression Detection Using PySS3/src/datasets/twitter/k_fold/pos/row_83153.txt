Like you shouldn't encourage suicide but going out of your way to say that someone shouldn't do it is fucked up if they're really fucking suffering every day of their life It's like when you kill an animal that is suffering out of respect to it because you know it can't be saved and you don't want it to hurt any longer. 

That's what some people's lives are like and it's sad but the only way they won't feel pain is to end their life
