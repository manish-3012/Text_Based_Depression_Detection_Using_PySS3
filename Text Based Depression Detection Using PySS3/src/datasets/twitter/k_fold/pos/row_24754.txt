Closeted transgirl (conservative grandfather) Well, my parents and I are opening up my social transition for the comming weeks by buying new clothes and comming out at school.

Today were my parents and I surprised by a random visit of my grandfather and his girlfriend and like usual he started asking things like how my life is going and keeps referring me as male and he sometimes even asks for "my girlfriend" and when "he gets to meet her". Well my parents and I don't know how or if we actually should open up to him about this. He is a very conservative man and had in the begin trouble with me being mixed race. "Why don't you like chocolate, it grows where you are from!" One of his statements about that... But back to the subject:

I don't interact with my older relatives most of the time only my parents and some cousins. I avoid my grandfather, aunts and uncles. I go never to their birthday parties, because I don't dare to be my real self there. But the problem is is that my grandfather is a fragile old man and I know that he and his girlfriend are going visit us more as a surprise (since my dead ignored him for like five years) so I can't hold myself back in this situation.
