Anyone else hate being alone with their thoughts? I always try to avoid my thoughts. Every time im alone with them for more than 15 minutes, somehow i always end up sad, mad or not feeling as proud as i did before. I always listen to music, asmr, use reddit or do some other thing to distract me. Is this normal?
