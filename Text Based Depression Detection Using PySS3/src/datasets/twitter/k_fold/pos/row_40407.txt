Hey, something is bothering me and I need your guys help So, Iâ€™m a 17M and just recently a middle school friend who has gone somewhere else before graduating middle school was brought to the high school I go to now, and I was excited when I saw her because, Iâ€™m gonna be honest, that girl is beautiful and I love her, she doesnâ€™t though, sadly, but sees me as a wonderful friend and I see her that way as well. Well, just recently, she has not been attending class and she hasnâ€™t seen the messages I sent her on Instagram, she posted about 4 days ago on Instagram about how she was forced into a false sense of security and how sheâ€™s useless, and then in the comments, she put, in Japanese, help me... it is tearing me apart, I donâ€™t know if she is safe or not. This is just making me go crazy because I want her to be safe and everything and I feel she is not but there is nothing I can do... any advice will help, thank you...
