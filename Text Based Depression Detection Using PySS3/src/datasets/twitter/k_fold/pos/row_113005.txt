It's my birthday :( It's my 15th birthday and I'm happy but two of my best friends didn't wish me despite knowing it was my birthday :(

One of them sent me snaps ranting about her school but didn't wish me even once, though she could see it was my birthday (Snapchat shows them it's your birthday)

The other was my female bsf but she just said she's watching YouTube and so can't wish me :(

On the other hand, some friends I'd drifted from organised a zoom video call surprise for me and I laughed freely for the first time in forever, so I guess it's a lesson for me to try and be more friendly and appreciate my other friends more!

Still a bit sad that they didn't wish me but hey I've realized how much I should treasure everyone! Ig it's true that every cloud has a silver lining!
