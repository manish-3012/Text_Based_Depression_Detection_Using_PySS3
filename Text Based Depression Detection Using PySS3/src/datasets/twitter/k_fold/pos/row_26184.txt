Todays my 15th B-Day  I just turned 15 and I don't know how to feel. and lately I've been thinking about material possessions and how we humans give them as gifts and use them as a status symbol to somehow make us happy. Today I got a nice new Keyboard that I've kinda hyped myself up for and now I don't feel any different now that I have it. Then I applied this logic to other things that I worked for to make myself happier like this monitor that I'm looking at right now and the "new" iPad pro that I have lying on my bed. Yet I still feel the same as I did A few years back before I had these possessions.

Today I thought about this relative to my birthday and why birthday kids receive possessions they desire on that day, why do we feel it is necessary to give those we appreciate/love instant gratification?

forgive me for sounding a bit dumb but why do we have to find purpose in these possessions that serve no meaning when we get bored with it eventually.
