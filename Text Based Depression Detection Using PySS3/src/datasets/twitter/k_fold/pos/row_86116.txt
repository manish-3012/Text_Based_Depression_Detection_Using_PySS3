I'm now 6 months strong I just completed 6 months of no nut 2020 and I'm feeling epic. 

So basically I started this on April 2nd when the world was falling apart. I wanted to better myself and not rub my pp till new year's. I started at April and I'm 6 months strong. I haven't nutted once. Feeling good. Just wanted to share lmao bye
