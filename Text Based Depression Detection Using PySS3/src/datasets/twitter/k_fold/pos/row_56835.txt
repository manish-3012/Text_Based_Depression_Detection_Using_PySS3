Gcse options So im an indecisive piece of shit and need strangers to help me. What should i choose? I have 3 slots (i think) for gcse options.

1. Triple science - im 90 percent sure im gonna choose this

2. Music or art - i have no idea which one to choose. Im ok at both (but not amazing) and enjoy them both.

3. Wildcard - i have no idea. Maybe i should choose music and art or maybe i should choose something im good at for better results. Idk
