Really nervous rn I have a twitter account so I can try to make myself a lil popular in the art world, and I often post fanart of characters from splatoon. A few days ago I posted the splatoon idol characters in cow themed costumes and made the colors light and tried giving it pastel vibes, making the black character's skin also lighter because if I kept their skin the same color it would've looked very weird with all the pastel colors. My account is very small so I probably shouldn't worry too much, but so far 3 people are accusing me of white washing and I'm just so nervous I'm going to get doxxed or something.
