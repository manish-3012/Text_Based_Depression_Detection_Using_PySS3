I got a problem So I am sick and now i'm not sure if its Covid-19 or just common flu. But my mom don't believe me anything. She just says I am trying to skip school. But when I have the choice of   missing school to protect me and my classmates or just go I of course would stay at home. I have symptoms like a sore throat, sleepiness and headaches. Anyone knows what I should do
