GUYS i think im god so i have a few incidents to prove this i guess

1.when i got my new pc all i did was play minecraft . i got my friends to play minecraft and boom it got popular and relevant again

2.when i saw richardo milos for the first time when it wasnt popular it was funny as hell so i kinda liked it and then boom it blew up in memes

3.i liked the ghanna coffin dance stuff and guess what . BOOM IT BLEW UP TOO

4.recently the lmar roasting franklin meme was funny the n--gaaaaa part was pretty funny .at that time  no one posted those memes .a week later ,it blew up too .

i know you will 100% not believe me but .*tis the truth.*
