I'm going to type a paragraph using only the generated words above my keyboard. Here goes.

I'm gonna say you love me and I don't have to be able to make a decision on a new account and a half hour ago I have been in there. I have been able to make my own personal account for you and I know that you're going through a hard time and I just wanted you to know that I'm not getting my hair done for a week and then maybe you could come over and do it for me. But yeah imma be like yeah yeah that's why I'm going home to get my dad to go home. I just wanted y'all and my dad to go pick up the kids at the end.

this made no sense
