Wanna be part of a project? Hey guys! I am starting a social media movement called SORO, which encourages survivors of any form abuse to not keep silent speak out and share their story .It doesn't have to be big and public. But at least so you are not bottling up any negative feelings on the inside. Speaking up so that you can get out of the situation you may be in. It teaches people to speak up whenever they have been violated and teaches people to speak up and be more confident in general.  As well as starting a hashtag #sorospeaks, the instagram blog will be updated educating people on everything in regarding all forms of abuse. I'm on this sub because I am looking for people who would help out in any possible way they can. Please reply with any advice you have for me, or if you want to contribute to the account somehow. Right now I need someone to critique the slides [I.ve](https://I.ve) made for the launch, Thanks. You really should participate. It's a big deal where I am from
