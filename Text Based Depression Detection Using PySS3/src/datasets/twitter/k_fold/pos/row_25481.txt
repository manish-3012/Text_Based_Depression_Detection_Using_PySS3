I don't want homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism and general bigotry That's why I support strong borders and an ideological check up when taking any immigrants

I don't live in USA, I live in Turkey and I am fed up with this immigrant fetishism, being Arab on its own is not that bad but the Arab world is sexist, homophobic and racist towards the Western world/Jews. It is not progressive to easily take so many possible bigots because muh no illegals.
