I have To turn on "Appear offline" on my ps4 so he won't harrass me I already message this dude on Instagram and if I don't open his message but go on my ps4 to play games he'll start messaging me on my ps4.

Even worse is when he added me he immediately did that request for my full real name, like bro we are online friends just chill
