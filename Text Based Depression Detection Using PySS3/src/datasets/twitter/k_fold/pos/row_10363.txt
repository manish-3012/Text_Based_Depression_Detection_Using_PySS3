Is this weird, because it feels weird So there's this girl I've been into for a while, let's call her A for simplicity's sake. So I ask A out and she said she'd think about it,ok no big deal. 2 WEEKS after she said she'd think about it I realized, we were super close, and dating wouldn't change anything between us and would only really lead to breakup. After a month she FINALLY had an answer and she felt the same way, so we decided to stay friends, thing is, we go places together and do couple shit even though we're  not together, I'm just a friend, but that doesn't upset me because nothing would change if we were dating, except for the fact that we'd  be dating, we already treat each other like we would if we were together I was just wondering if this situation seemed odd to anyone
