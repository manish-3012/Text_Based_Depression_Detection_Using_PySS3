I literally already hate my gym teacher This year my school is using the hybrid model, so each week, half the kids are in school, and half are remote. In our gym class this year, when you're in class, you have to do physical activities, and when you're at home, you have to do assigned exercises and log them. Last week I completed all mine during the class period, and for whatever reason I forgot to click the 'turn in' button. Next week I realize this because she gave me a zero in the portal. No big deal, I figure if I explain the situation to her, and considering she can look at the document edit history to see that I completed it, it should be fine. Wrong. When I come to talk to her today, she tells me that there are "plenty of other kids in your situation and if I let you turn it in I'd have to do it for everyone". Bitch, who the fuck else also just happened to forget to click the turn in button this week? And even if they did, yes you should do it for everyone else. Now I'm going to lose credit for an assignment that I did because I forgot to click a button, while there's literal proof that I did it. Imagine being a fucking bitch just for the sake of it instead of actually trying to make sure your students do good in your class. I just can't even respect people like that.
