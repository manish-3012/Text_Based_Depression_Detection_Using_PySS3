I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m pissed off So I very recently found out my stepbrother who is basically just like my brother has been self harming and it was so out of nowhere and unexpected. Heâ€™s such a childish goof. After I found out from a mutual friend of ours I instantly told my mum and his dad. I expected him to hate me for telling even tho I new it was the right thing to do. He was also being picked up from his mums that night to stay with us for a few days but when he came in he was completely fine with me. I expected him to ignore me but with me he was fine. He then went after a few days and heâ€™s coming back today but Iv been really pissed off about the whole situation. A part of me thinks that itâ€™s because I thing harming yourself is stupid and I canâ€™t seem to be able to rap my head around how he thinks it will help at all. And I think that suicide is very selfish because your leaving everyone behind that love you but I understand thatâ€™s not the right attitude towards it. I want to learn more about to educate myself on it but the whole thing has really pissed me off and I donâ€™t completely understand why or how to stop it




Just realised this is quite long but if u read this long cheers.
