I wrote a poem. Dunno why. Just had an impulse to write something... Pieces.

I don't see myself as a whole anymore.
It feels like my soul is in pieces,
I used to hold myself together or atleast try,
But I don't try no more.

 My pieces aren't owned by me anymore.
Each person is given one piece,
One piece of my existence,
One piece of my core.

I have become stranger to myself,
It's not me who I have known before.
I used to be rational and sane,
But I don't do that anymore.

Ps: I don't do poems as such, I just woke up and had an impulse to write something, thought I should share it.
