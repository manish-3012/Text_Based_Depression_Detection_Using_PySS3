Iâ€™m so confused at myself So in photography she was showing us pictures and stuff. There was a picture of a seagull and some people in the background. I typed in chat â€œseagull&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;peopleâ€ and right after I typed â€œ*peopleâ€. Why did I do that, people was already spelt correctly why did I try correcting it
