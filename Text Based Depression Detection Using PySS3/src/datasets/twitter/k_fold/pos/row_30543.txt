Killing at least one mosquito every day, except each day I do it differently: Day #5 
Today at about 6pm (EST) I went outside in my front lawn with a plastic ziploc bag. I waited for no more than maybe 10 minutes before spotting a fairly large mosquito hovering around one of the lamps lining the walkway to my house. Like anybody else in the situation my first reaction was disgust at having to go within 10ft of such a vile creature. But I completed my mission successfully. It wasnâ€™t too hard to catch the mosquito with the bag and I quickly zipped it up. I then opened the zipper a tiny bit on the opposite side of the bag that the mosquito was on and I squeezed out as much air as possible without crushing or letting the mosquito out. Then I resealed the bag and brought up to my room.
Fast forward to about 9:30pm (EST). I had come back to my room to check on the mosquito. And sure enough, the bugger had died of asphyxiation!

Alright guys, this is how I killed a mosquito today, let me know if you like the detailed story style or the straight to the point â€œthis afternoon I stepped on a  mosquitoâ€ style
