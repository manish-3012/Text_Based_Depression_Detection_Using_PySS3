I had a dream that I didn't want to end (Serious) We've all had one of these. It's when the dream feels happy and meaningful. I was in hell or some dark afterlife with some girl. She meant so much to me that the fact we were in hell didn't matter at all. Now I don't know if I'll ever feel like that again. I feel like I've lost a part of myself. Help.
