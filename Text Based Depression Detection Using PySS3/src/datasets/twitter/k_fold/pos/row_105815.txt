Oh man, high school people were obnoxious, sure, but college has so many snobby, snooty mofos I swear lmao. Like ok, donâ€™t get too worried cuz most ppl Iâ€™ve met are nice, humble, cool people. This is mainly about Zoom classes, where thereâ€™s always those 2-3 kids. These  mofos are so up their own ass itâ€™s funny. 

My Computer science class has the guys who use terms like compile and assemble when you can just say run the program lol

Econ has this guy â€œso as someone who owns his own businessâ€  and â€œIâ€™m sorry I keep mentioning banks, I run a business so I deal with loansâ€

And of course, the person who asks a question to the professor thatâ€™s actually just a hot take on politics. 

Goddamn I kinda miss that about public school, people in class were normal
