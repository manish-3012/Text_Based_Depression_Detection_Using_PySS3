Realised I'm way more fortunate than most people of the world I'm not born in a first world country but still in a stable country not full of wars. I live comfortably with food on my plate and air conditioning in my room. I have a good loving family that is relatively well off. Both my parents have stable well paying jobs. I don't have to worry about money to get good education. My mom trained me in English since I was a baby so I'm fluent in English which opens up a ton of doors for me. I don't have physical disabilities and I have all my arms and legs.

Just feeling grateful for what I have.
