The worth of awards. (LOW END.) Gold. 500 coins for a 100 coin return.(1/5)
Platinum. 1800 coins for a 700 return (Best deal!) (2.5/3)
Argentium. 20000 coins for a 2500 return (1/8)
Unachievium, first off, don't ever buy this. 50000 coins. For a 5000 coin reward. (1/10)


Silver? What silver?

This is conclusive evidence that platinum is the most worth it in terms of coins.

*Premium~*

9.49 CAD or 7.18 for one month(30 or so days) 9.49 / 30 roughly amounts to 31 cents a day.


1 reddit coin in the highest end is 0.518 CAD. Lowest end 0.324 CAD (Calculated using the 'Buy Reddit Coins' and figuring out the both extremes of the store.)

Gold is 500 reddit coins. Gold roughly equates to... 162 CAD. On the lowest end.

Low End(Gold):
Gold gives one week of premium, which is in the ballpark of 2.17 CAD.

100 coins equals 32.4 CAD.

32.4 + 2.17 = 34.57 CAD total worth of value.

162 CAD for 34.57 worth is around a one fifth return, actually.

High End(Gold):

**[~Coming Soon~]**


Low End(Platinum):
Platinum gives one month of premium.
30 days of premium costs 9.30 CAD.

Platinum is 1800 reddit coins, and using the absolute lowest value for reddit coins, 583.20 CAD.

Platinum gives 700 reddit coins, which is 226.80.

226.80 + 9.30 = 236.10 CAD total worth.

583.20 CAD for 236.10, that's... Almost a third return, which is what platinum is, comparing it to the fact at the top of the post.

High End(Platinum):

**[~Coming Soon~]**

Low End(Argentium):
Argentium gives a semester, a whole three months.
Three months of platinum is 27.90 CAD.

Argentium also gives 2500 coins, which equal 810 CAD.

The 20000 coins for argentium costs 6480 CAD.

One eighth of 6480 is...810.

This is reconfirming that maybe 0.324 CAD is (or is close) to reddit coin value.

6480 for 837.90(810 + 27.90) worth of value is around a one eighth return. Still nothing beats the value of platinum.

High End(Argentium):

**[~Coming Soon!~]**

Low End(Unachievium):

Unachievium gives a whopping five months of being able to spend money on *~exclusive~* awards.

Unachievium is 50000 coins for 5000 coins, in other words...
Unachievium is 16200 CAD for 1620 CAD coin return.

5 months of premium is costing a whole 46.50 CAD.

1620 + 46.50 = 1666.50 CAD.

Maybe it's just the way i was calculating or some coincidences.


This is already way too much writing, I'll upload high end in a separate post, if that's okay.
