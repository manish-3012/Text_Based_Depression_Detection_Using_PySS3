Iâ€™m as Liberal as can be, but BLM needs to focus on black on black crime big time. The stuff theyâ€™ve already done is amazing. Theyâ€™ve already defunded a few police departments, and are pushing for what is right, but by far the biggest problem is black on black crime.

Many children live in impoverished hoods in large cities. They need to push to fund the families in those hoods and be able to support them. Many people in that place canâ€™t see any way out besides selling drugs, and with that comes violence and corruption. BLM and really everyone needs to work to end that relentless cycle in the hood and urban areas. Itâ€™s the main reason for black on black crime, which is by far the cause of most murders.

Itâ€™s horrible, and needs to be spoken of more.
