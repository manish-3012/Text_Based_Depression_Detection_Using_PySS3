What is the best video game villain, in your opinion? Mine is atlas( aka fontaine) from bioshock.  He's such a cool villain. A puppet master that the player is unaware of cuz he's with you the whole journey manipulating strings getting you to topple an underwater utopia. Absolutely brilliant I my opinion.
