I need math help Ok I just got back to school and my brain is numb. I may seem dumb but how do you solve this:

Cheese cost R34,59 per kg. How much will if u only have 0,45kg of cheese.

I'm very dumb so pls help me. Also I would prefer it if you'd explain how u solved it not just an answer.

And yes I know I'm a dumbass
