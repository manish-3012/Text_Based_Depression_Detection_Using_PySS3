SO LATELY EVERYONE HAS A GIRLFRIEND/BOYFRIEND OR SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR CRUSH! While I'm Single, Lonely and listening to depressing lofi music late at night and if i tell anyone i might get a lecture that goes like this (oh don't worry about being single, single life is the best life and you have nothing to worry about and you also have all the time for yourself OR I'll wish that i had just stayed out of a relationship) ðŸ˜
