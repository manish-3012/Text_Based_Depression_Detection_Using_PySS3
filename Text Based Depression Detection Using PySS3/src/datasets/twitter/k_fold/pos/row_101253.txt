Hi Guys, Need Help Hi Guys,  
This is a great community and I like spending time here a lot. Normally a post with this title would be quit worrying in this sub, but I just need to prove something to my friend. He has a new MacBook Pro that runs MINECRAFT at 300FPS. He says itâ€™s â€˜terribleâ€™ and just as bad as my laptop which almost blows up whenever I type in 2+2. Can you tell him that just because he can afford great laptops it doesnâ€™t mean that the non-RTX3090 ones are crap? Thanks guys.
