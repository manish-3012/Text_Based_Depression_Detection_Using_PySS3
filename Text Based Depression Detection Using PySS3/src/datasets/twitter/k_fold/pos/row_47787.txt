My family doesnâ€™t understand depression at all and Iâ€™m gonna snap It feels like we go through the same conversation every single time.
My grandparents ask me why Iâ€™ve stopped working out everyday and Iâ€™ll tell them my depression is just bad, and they act like itâ€™s the first time theyâ€™ve heard of me having it. My grandpa literally said â€œwell what are you doing that forâ€
I donâ€™t fucking know grandpa why is my brain not making the happy chemicals
I told him it isnâ€™t a choice and he proceeded to say â€œYouve got a good life, youâ€™re young youâ€™re beautiful, what do you want?!â€

I just cannot comprehend how someone can be so ignorant

My mom proceeded to explain to him what depression was because my grandparents like to say â€œwell everyone gets sad sometimesâ€.
Then he made it political?

I just s
I just cannot handle it
