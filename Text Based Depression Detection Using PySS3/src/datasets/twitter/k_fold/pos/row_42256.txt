i might be getting detention or worse on friday :) so this week is our first week back to school after they shut down for a few weeks bc of covid

and yall know what happened in Washington D.C. last wednesday

so because of what happened then, ive been sitting during the pledge of allegiance every morning :) (and even before, i just stood and mouthed it, i didn't actually say it but nobody noticed)

soooo a bunch of trumpies in my homeroom are planning on reporting me to the school administration if i continue to stay seated during the pledge

and im pretty sure a good amount of the administration are trumpies as well

so yeah im probably gonna get my first detention lmao

*however* i looked in my school's student policies and there's nothing about sitting during the pledge. the only way i could get punished is, quote,

&gt;"The following behaviors are prohibited: ...Denying instructions of school officials."

so unless my homeroom teacher *orders* me to stand for the pledge and i refuse, i cannot be punished based off the official policy
