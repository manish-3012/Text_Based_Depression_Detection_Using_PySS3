Animal abusers suck Earlier today I saw a video of a Karen per say holding a dog and it looked like she was definitely on some kind of illegal substance and for starters she was holding the dog from right behind it's front legs and letting the rest of the dog hang there and it looked very uncomfortable but when the guy she was getting on asked "Is that even your dog" she THREW it to the guy and the dog started crying and ran over to the man away from the woman. Even if you're on some kind of drug doing something like that infuriates me and if you do it consciously and you enjoy it then those kind of people need to have someone come over there and Kazuma Kiryu beatdown their ass. Ted talk cliche, thanks for reading, etc,

Also I heard that the man is now taking care of the dog so that makes me happy
