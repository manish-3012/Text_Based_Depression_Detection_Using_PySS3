Why does no one like me (shit post) So I was happily playing a game with my friend. (We will call him Kevin)Then another friend I have rang Kevin and asked him if he wanted to play splatoon. Kevin said yes. I donâ€™t have splatoon so canâ€™t play with them and so he left me. The other friend was going to text me when they could play ( obviously they didnâ€™t) and now I have no one to play with. Like I was happy for half an hour now I think Iâ€™ve lost a friend because â€˜â€™ friend â€œ has done this before. So does anyone know whatâ€™s so terrible about me. The friend started this about a week before now.
