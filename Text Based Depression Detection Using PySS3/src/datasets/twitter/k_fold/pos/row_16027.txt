If we were to kill all men I am a man and I am proud to be a man. I know this movement is so fucking old but hear me out. IF women were to kill all men, not only would they be charged with hundreds of counts of murder, and be sent to jail for the rest of their lives (at least the ones that killed multiple men) but they would also die out and destroy our species. 

I've heard so many women say that they would be able to live in a world without men, they wouldn't. Humans, believe it or not, are not a self-reproducing species; women need some kind of way to get their eggs fertilized and that way is male sperm.

Now I know you may think that, "oh, well then we'll just get a bunch of sperm from men and then kill them!", but no. Because a) you are now doubling back on your point that you don't need men, when you do because they are the only member of our species that can create viable sperm. And b) what will you do when the sperm runs out? You won't be able to reproduce anymore, and you'll die out. Simple

What are you thoughts on the subject?
