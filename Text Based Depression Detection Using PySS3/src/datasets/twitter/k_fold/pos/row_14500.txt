I need your guysâ€™ advice please So, thereâ€™s this girl that I know and she is absolutely beautiful and I love her to death, but she doesnâ€™t think of me the same way, idk what to do though, idk why but I wonâ€™t give up. Even with this pandemic, I ask her if she would like to come to my house (there are parents here, so no funny business happens, and I donâ€™t think of her that way) and she says yes, we set up a time then when she comes over, we watch a movie then play some video games. The last couple times we had gone out like to a small ice cream place and played some mini golf. We went to a restaurant once, I donâ€™t remember where though. But, I just donâ€™t know what to do, though, I love her a lot, I care about her, she recently lost a great friend she had (I sadly didnâ€™t know him well, but I do give my condolences) and she also had something else happen earlier in the week, so I asked her if she wanted to come over cause I wanted to let her know that Iâ€™m sorry but I also wanted to make her happy again... I donâ€™t want to sound selfish or anything though, I just, want her to be happy too. Do you guys have any advice on what I can do better?
Thanks
