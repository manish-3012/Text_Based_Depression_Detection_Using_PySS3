Okay I was telling my friends this and all they said was â€œwhy would you say noâ€ or â€œI wish that was meâ€ Context is that - I recently became friends with a girl whoâ€™s 21 who we will call mia and Iâ€™m 17. 

About an hour ago I was at her house and she starts like touching my leg and Idk I felt awkward so I told her to stop and she said â€œstop acting like you donâ€™t like itâ€ then I said seriously stop I donâ€™t want that sorta of thing. Then she started pushing herself on me like really throwing herself on me and rubbing my chest and genital area at this point I was freaked out and threw her off me and left. Also a couple of times prior she kept pushing my hand to her area. 

Then I told my friends this and all they did was make fun of the fact that I didnâ€™t comply in the situation but idk I felt weird. 

Am I dumb for not going along with her?
