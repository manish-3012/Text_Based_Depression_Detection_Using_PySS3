Critical motherfucking hit So I'm doing a pokemon pearl nuzlocke rn. I'm just training up my shinx, get down to like 14 health, think "sure, it's not a half bad idea to keep my shinx in, one more hit kills this dude anyways," and fucking BAM. I get hit first and a crtical hit kills one of my favorite pokemon.





Rip Alecto, you will be missed.
