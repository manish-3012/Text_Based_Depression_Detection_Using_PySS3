So idk where to go with this girl, help? So i guess we been talking for awhile. Maybe like a week or 2? Its been off and on. It started on insta where i slide into her dms, we started talking and she was like give me ur sc, so i gave it to her and we started talking there.

I guess she knows im interested cuz i hit her with a pick up line when i first started taking lol. The thing is that we both take forever to text sometimes but i cant be mad cuz she genuinely seems like she busy most of the time. Or maybe she not interested. But at the same time she seems into the conversations we be having and whenever i get dry or moments where she shouldve left me on read or delivered, she ends up carrying the convo lol. Idk.

Its kinda getting boring now tho. I would ask to meet up or something but its covid. Maybe ask to call? Idk. How do i make a move? Wtf do i do atp?
