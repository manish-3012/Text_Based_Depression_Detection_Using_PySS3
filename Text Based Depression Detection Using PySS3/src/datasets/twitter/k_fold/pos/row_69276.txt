So I went on a date?? With one my my homies He was just feeling sad and not ok so I invited him over 2 hours ago. I made a fancy diner, we played a bunch of video games and finished up all of our homework. He doesnâ€™t romantically like me or anything we are just friends and my mom said he can also sleep over, and he fell asleep on my bed a few minutes ago. (I donâ€™t have school tommorow woot woot) so yea heâ€™s asleep and Iâ€™m just chilling is this weird lol ?
