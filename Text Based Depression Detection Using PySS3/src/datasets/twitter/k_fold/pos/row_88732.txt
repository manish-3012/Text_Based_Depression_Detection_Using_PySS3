The good old days You woke up this morning and realized itâ€™s October 1st. You get excited about what youâ€™re gonna dress up as for Halloween. Your mom comes into your room and tells you that you have to get ready for school. She puts you in an oversized winter jacket and when you step outside the first thing you hear is the crunch of a leaf. You arrive at school and youâ€™re talking with all of your friends before the teacher takes attendance. One your teacher is done you all walk to your first class and it turns out youâ€™re the line leader that week. You lead the class down the hall and take a right and arrive at music class. As you walk in the music teacher is playing Spooky Scary Skeletons on the smart board and youâ€™re all dancing to it. Youâ€™re in 3rd grade. Life is great.
