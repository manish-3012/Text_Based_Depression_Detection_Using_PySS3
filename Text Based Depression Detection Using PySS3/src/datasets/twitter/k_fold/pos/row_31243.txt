how to come out to friends? for the past year iâ€™d been questioning lots of things about myself, including my sexuality. recently i realized that i was bisexual, and i told a couple people who i really trusted. (my girlfriend and one of my best friends.) i donâ€™t know how to tell my friend group about it though. theyâ€™re the kind of friends that are fun to hang out with and do dumb shit with, not the friends you go to for a serious matter that concerns your identity as a person. i know for a fact theyâ€™d joke about it, which would lead to me just feeling like shit. how should i approach this without it feeling too serious, but serious enough for it to not seem like iâ€™m joking around?
