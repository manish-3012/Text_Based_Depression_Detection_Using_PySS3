Let's change the US education system. For over 2 centuries the US school system has barely changed and schools are growing more crowded. The US hardly cares about it's education system and even though the US supposedly has a good education system it is so stressful on students. They lack funding and support for students and this entire thing is simply becoming worse with Covid turning the world into a plague INC sim. Alot of us want change and we won't get it unless we stand against this damn system and revolt because it's our right to a good education. I'm attempting to start something that will have change upon this cracked system but I need your support and help inorder to change this. So anyone have some good ideas?
