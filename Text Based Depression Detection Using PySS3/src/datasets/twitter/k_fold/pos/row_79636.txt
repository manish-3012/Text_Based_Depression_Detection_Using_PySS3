Why is this happening For some reason, me and my friends are being targeted by a user, and he sends us weird dog porn. We blocked him and turned off our dm's, but he just finds a way. He ghost pings us, finds us, and then spams us. We've reported him to discord but heard nothing.  


Why is life like this.
