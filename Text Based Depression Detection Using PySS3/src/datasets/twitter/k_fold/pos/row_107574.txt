My parents are getting divorced My mom is pregnant with her fifth and my dad doesnâ€™t want the baby. Result of this my mom is demanding a divorce. They have been fighting a ton, breaking things and stuff. My parents have never done this but never to this degree. This is all happening so fast and I just donâ€™t know how to handle it. I donâ€™t know how to feel.
