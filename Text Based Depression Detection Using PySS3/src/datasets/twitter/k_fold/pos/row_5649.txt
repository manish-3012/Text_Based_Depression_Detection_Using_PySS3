Is it fucked up that even though Iâ€™m 18 my younger sister finally pissed me off enough to push her and say I wanted to beat the crap out of her? Sheâ€™s 13 but blames her panic disorder on being a jerk despite never taking the initiative to be better no matter how much help she gets and is always yelling at me and my parents all the time,quarantine has just made it worse.

She was bad before but sheâ€™s been even nuttier for half a year now that weâ€™re locked in.

Today I stood up and told her sheâ€™s made my life so miserable and only thinks of herself and makes the rest of the family stick their neck out to make hers perfect even though we all have stuff we go through.

She continued to scream and call me an asshole while saying Iâ€™m only her older brother so I donâ€™t get a say on anything that goes on around me.

I then say â€œgod I want to beat the crap out of youâ€ and push her.

Even though I would love to and I said Iâ€™d be so much happier since at least Iâ€™d get my rage out since sheâ€™s not going to shape up anyway I wasnâ€™t actually going to do more than that.

I just wanted her scared enough to quit being a bitch.

Of course she changed her mind on if things I do matter the second that happened and she tried to pull the â€œbut youâ€™re an adult,act your age!â€ even though sheâ€™s acting like a toddler for not being able to go anywhere and then she claims I hit her in the rib.

Thoughts?
