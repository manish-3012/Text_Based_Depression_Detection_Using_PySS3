am stressed let me vent so basically rn iâ€™m supposed to be taking my math test, but i canâ€™t find it. iâ€™m using canvas so i looked in the modules, not there. looked in the assignments, not there. so now i have to wait till 6TH PERIOD to ask my teacher about it. ANOTHER thing is i have two missing assignments for my ELA class, and i canâ€™t fucking find the assignments. they arenâ€™t due till like tomorrow so idk why tf i canâ€™t find them, but whoop. they not there. i also just started my period so iâ€™m hunched over my computer in pain clutching my sides looking for this godforsaken test, and to top it all off iâ€™m failing history for some reason. not even missing any assignments there.
