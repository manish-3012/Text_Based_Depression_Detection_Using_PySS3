What I did this Valentineâ€™s Day (school wise) School was boring. But after me and like half the class went to the park and chilled, ate snacks and chatted.

Good things that happened:

A girl I like hugged me *yay*

I ate one of the best chocolate bars in my life

I had a great time

Bad things that happened:

That same girl I like said who they like

I sprained my ankle

We live in Canada and now half of us have frostbite because of how long we where there. I have lost all feelings in my toes.
