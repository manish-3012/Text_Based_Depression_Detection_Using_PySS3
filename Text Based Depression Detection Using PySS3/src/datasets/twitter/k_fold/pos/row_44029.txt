I've been getting pretty lonely lately All of my friends from middle school went to different high schools and I failed to make new friends when high school started and now everyone seems to already have a friend group so I find it hard to approach people.
 I'd say I have 2 somewhat close  friends in my school, one of which I don't talk much with at school because he mostly hangs out with some other friends of his but we sometimes go out for walks. I mostly hang out with my other friend and a few other people but I sometimes feel excluded and unwanted there.
When I'm not with them, I usually just sit alone, which is okay, but I feel really awkward and weird to be the only one sitting alone on the small school playground. I've been thinking of buying a book so at least I'll be doing something.
The worst thing about this is that none of the people I hang out with are in my class, expect of someone I used to be good friends with but now rarely talk to(we just drifted apart), so I don't have anyone to ask help from and PE class is sometimes awkward.
My cousin and I are very good friends and have a lot of fun together  but the problem is that I only get to see him on holidays.
Since the start of summer I've been trying to improve myself on various things, and one of my biggest goals is to get more friends and be less awkward. I am hoping to improve on that now that schools are opening soon but it'll probably be hard and I don't know to act on it.

Any advice?
