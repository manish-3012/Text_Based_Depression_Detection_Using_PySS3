i think i figured out life i think that the universe and how it works is one big mystery. i think religion was made up long ago because humans donâ€™t like to not know the answer. i believe religion was created as a way to connect the dots so that things make sense. but i think in reality, thereâ€™s really no way to know the secret to life or the universe no matter how long you spend trying to figure it out. we might figure it out in the next life, we might not. there might not even be an afterlife. thereâ€™s really just no way to know, and iâ€™ve come to terms with the fact that i donâ€™t have to know the answer.
