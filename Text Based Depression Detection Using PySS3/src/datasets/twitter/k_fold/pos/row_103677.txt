How do I stop overthinking and sterssing about this girl? So basically there is this girl that I really like and I think she likes me too. We have seen face to face maybe like 6 times. After first getting to know through snapchat. I spent the new years eve with her and got my first kiss that day. Neither one of us has said anything about our feelings to each other. When I am not with her I canâ€™t stop thinking of what if she doesnâ€™t like me and that kind of stuff and itâ€™s really though. 

I am losing sleep because I keep thinking of her what do I do?
