I need help because I canâ€™t decide on what to do Hey Reddit (Iâ€™m on mobile so ignore grammar and such (: )

I was talking with this girl for a few months (weâ€™ve been talking on Instagram and FaceTime because we live far from each other), now about a month ago our relationship became more romantic than platonic and we flirted a lot talking about how much we want to see each other.

But today she told me two weeks ago she went out with somebody for one day but they didnâ€™t do anything inappropriate, and even though we havenâ€™t said weâ€™re â€œofficiallyâ€ together we had a mutual agreement to remain faithful to one another.

She kept apologizing and she seemed actually sorry for that but I donâ€™t know what to do, Sheâ€™s the first girl I have feeling for in a long time and I enjoy every minute when I talk with her. I really donâ€™t know what I should do.

If you could give me advice on this matter I would appreciate this greatly :)
