Biden won and I am sad Bc he is very bad. Letâ€™s talk about it. There is no meme. I donâ€™t like Biden for many reasons. For one, heâ€™s is only really good at reading off a script and even then, heâ€™s barley ok at it some of the time. When there is no script he rambled incoherent babble. He even introduced a young women as his dead son. 2 throughout his entire career he has been enforcing systemic racism( 1984 crime bill, trying to enforce school separation etc)  and also says and does racist things constantly to this very day. 3 he might pack the courts which IMO would be the complete end to checks and balances for the already too powerful legislative branch of government. 4. We hardly know what Biden is gonna do as president Becouse he constantly contradicts himself. Sometime in consecutive sentences. That all for now. Feel free to ask my questions. (Also Iâ€™m 19 if anyone was wondering so yes I did vote.)
