fuck my life im doing online school and i was taking an assignment for english 10a, and its about some essay from mark twain. now, im not trying to brag, but this is essential to the story: i have a 96% grade. so, one of the answers is supposed to be the word "Pathetic". well, my dumbass put "Pathetic." if you cant tell, i put a period. it was wrong, so i kept trying other answers until i reached the maximum attempts. well, i got a 30% on that assginment and now my grade is 73. fuck me.
