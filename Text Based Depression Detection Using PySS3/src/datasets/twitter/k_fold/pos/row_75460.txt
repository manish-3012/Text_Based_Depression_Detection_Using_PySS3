debating on texting an old friend i was best friends with this girl for like 5 years until about 4 years ago when we stopped talking. we didnâ€™t end on bad terms or anything we just kinda drifted apart, and iâ€™m kinda debating contacting her again. i donâ€™t know if sheâ€™ll even respond or want to talk to me but itâ€™s be nice to talk to her again yknow? i have nothing to lose but at the same time i donâ€™t know if sheâ€™ll be upset or bitter towards me. so yeah iâ€™m on the fence
