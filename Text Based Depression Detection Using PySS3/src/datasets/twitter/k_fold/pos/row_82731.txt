Ima make this quick Iâ€™m going to make this quick and simple, partially because auto mod already banned my first two posts, but also because you are all somewhat busy.
First things first, 1 year ago, I got Reddit, and it was life changing. My whole daily routine has changed because of it. Some wacky stuff has happened in the past year, and Iâ€™m glad I had Reddit to keep me going.

Have a great day/night!
And donâ€™t forget to stay safe.
