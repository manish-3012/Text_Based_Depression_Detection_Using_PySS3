I turned 18 today Itâ€™s weird. I feel like itâ€™s just any other day and all of this new freedom of adulthood is just yeeted at me for what feels like no reason. The portal has opened to whatever the fuck lies beyond my moms basement. My parents seem pretty chill about it though. As far as I know I just donâ€™t have to bug them as much for permission to do stuff. Theyâ€™ve never been like super strict about anything, and other than jokes about paying bills havenâ€™t I have seen no intent of forcing me to pay rent or kicking me out so I guess Iâ€™m kinda lucky. 
Todayâ€™s been dope though. Waking up to my boyfriend wishing me a happy birthday making me feel all warm and fuzzy, playing sims while ignoring my zoom meetings, a little party with my animal crossing besties, and going to an awesome Japanese grill where they cook all the junk right in front of you and play with fire. A little sad the days coming to an end but it was fun while it lasted.
