apparently "im literally underaged and legally cant get a job and i dont have any job qualifications" isnt a good enough reason to not get a job if thats not a good enough reason, then ig my severe anxiety and extremely bad sensitivity to lights, textures, and certain noises that are very common in a workplace wouldnt be a good enough excuse either

guess imma have to get a job :/
