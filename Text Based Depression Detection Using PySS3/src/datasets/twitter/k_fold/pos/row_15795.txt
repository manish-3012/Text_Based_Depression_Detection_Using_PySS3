Can good memories turn into bad memories asking fellow teens I have two different types of PTSD that I experience - one type was actually traumatic which I will not be talking about because it can trigger me, and the second one which I will explain now.

So ever since my cousin contacted me (2 weeks ago) , I've been getting vivid flashback memories of his house, his mum driving me there, the houses nearby, spending time with him, but they feel so scary. Keep in mind, when I use to visit 7 years ago I would love it, and I would have a good time. So I don't know if I'm creating a scary atmosphere for the memories or what. Every time I think of going there again, I get extremely anxious and overall scared, he told me to visit several times but each time I would give him a bullshit excuse. Does anyone have tips or could help me?
