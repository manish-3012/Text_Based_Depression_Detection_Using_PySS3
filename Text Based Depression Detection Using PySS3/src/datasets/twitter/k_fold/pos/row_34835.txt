I found a plothole in The Bee Movie!!!!!!?!??! So there's like a scene where Vanessa is looking at Barry while he's trapped in a glass. Does she not notice his little shoes or the fact that he's basically a tiny, yellow person with wings? Because she becomes sexually attracted to him, and I find it hard to see the sexuality of a normal looking bee. So either bees only look like tiny people after they talk to a human, or they're in a universe where bees just look like little people. Well, it seems I just answered my own question while writing this post. Sorry for wasting your time, The Bee Movie remains a flawless masterpiece only topped by Shrek. Enjoy the rest of your day.
