Need to be part of something I need your help guys. I feel like I need to be part of something bigger than myself, ig to have a sense of meaning. I feel lonely and lost rn, and i think it would help. Can anyone suggest any online communities that maybe work towards something so i can find something to put myself into? Can be anything from a minecraft server to a forum or organization. Thanks
