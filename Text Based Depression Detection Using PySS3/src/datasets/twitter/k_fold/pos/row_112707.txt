idk wtf we were talking about but this is this only text that was left note: this is from one of my ex bfs - at the time I was still a guy, we were both gay males

***"Anyway, don't tell me gays are nice people. They'll rape you as fast as any other man would rape anyone. They're horrible people too."***

Boo you are a gay guy in a guy relationship who takes place in gay activities. What are you on about? Like we see each other all the time, like bro I've seen you with your boyfriend.

I never responded to that text so I don't actually know the context, like why was that the only remaining text? I am so confused.
