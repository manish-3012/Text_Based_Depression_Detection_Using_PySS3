Guess what I'll sing to my non existent GF? I'll be the spark, if you'll be the flame
Start a reaction that can't be contained
Balance your pH by sharing my base
I'll be your star, if you'll be my space

'Cause there is no distance that I wouldn't go
Through spacetime and wormholes my matter would flow
To the edge of the universe

I'll be your G, if you will be C
Or I can be A, if you will be T
If there's a mutation I'll fix every base
Working as your zinc finger nuclease

Just like an atom, don't rip us apart
Unless you want a big BOOM in my heart

We can take it fast or really slow
But we can't know with certainty where we'll go
If at first we don't succeed, we'll try two more times
So our failure's a statistically significant try

Like an equation, it all works out
If we balance the sides there's no need to doubt

CHORUS:
This is your science love song
A place to start our chemical bond
A research endeavour
We can write the conclusion together

Just like the movies I'd steal your heart
But then you'd die...so I won't do that

If we broke up I'd be no more
I'd give up H2O for H2SO4
Take away gravity, I'd still fall for you
Share my last electron in a covalent bond for two

'Cause you're like that angle, A-cute and you're smart
Your labcoat and goggles go straight to my heart
Except that's a lie, cause the heart doesn't feel
When it comes to love the brain seals the deal

REPEAT CHORUS

'Cause you matter to me
