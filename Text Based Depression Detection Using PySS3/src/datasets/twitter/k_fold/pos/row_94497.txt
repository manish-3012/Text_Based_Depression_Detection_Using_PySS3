READ THIS STORY So this story first starts when a I was in 5th grade and I was in a bad time and this one girl named Haley.  She had a mood stone and was talking about how her mother was very bad, that her mom would cheat on her dad a lot. She said that she loves her stepmom more than her mom and that she had called the cops on her.

Two years later while some of my friends that were at that school before came to my new school and they were telling the story on how some dated Haley and that she would cheat on them with others.....

I said, "Just like her mother!"

The entire table erupted, I felt so good.
