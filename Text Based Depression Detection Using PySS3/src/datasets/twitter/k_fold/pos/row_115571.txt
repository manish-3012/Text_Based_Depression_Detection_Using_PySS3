I got a Time Turner I love Harry Potter. I hate JKRowling. But I love HP.


I got a really cool time turner! 
it has words etched into it

On the outside it says 'Nor have I yet outrun the sun' 
' I mark the hours every one'
The inside ring-
'My use and value onto you are'
'gauged by what you have to do'

i have no clue what way the sentences go around.
