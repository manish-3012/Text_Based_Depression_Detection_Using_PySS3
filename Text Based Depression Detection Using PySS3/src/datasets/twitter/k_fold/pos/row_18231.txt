â€˜boys will be boysâ€™ so i have an older brother, and iâ€™m going to use him as an example for this post.

sure, everyone does good and bad things, but my brother just does so many rude things.

first off, heâ€™s violent. i will smile at him and somehow he sees it as a threat? just yesterday i asked him where our mom was and he shoved me into a wall, creating a lovely black and blue mark.

he spends around 10 hours a day on his gaming computer, including during school, and my parents do nothing. meanwhile, if i join the school zoom from my phone because my computer is slow, it gets taken away for two weeks.

heâ€™s really impolite. not once in the past month have i heard him say please, thank you, sorry, or anything similar. earlier today, i offered to make him a mug dessert while i made one for myself. he didnâ€™t say please or thank you and 3 times in the 7 minutes i took, he asked me how much longer.

heâ€™s loud. this is more a problem for me, because iâ€™m rather sensitive to loud noises. but iâ€™ll come into his room while heâ€™s screaming at his monitor and politely ask him to quiet down while iâ€™m in school, and heâ€™ll purposely go louder.

he is a bully. he constantly insults me and my sister and has called me fat (iâ€™m slightly above average weight, and he said this as if it were a bad thing to be so). heâ€™s a jerk to his friends as well so a lot of them have left him. 

heâ€™s racist and sexist and homophobic. he has said the n  and f slurs multiple times, imitates foreign accents saying racist things, makes sexist remarks, and calls his friends gay as an insult. (this especially hurts me, because iâ€™ve been questioning my sexuality for a while and his comment make me feel awful).

heâ€™s constantly praised by my parents and i canâ€™t understand how they overlook all of this. 

â€˜boys will be boys.â€™ the thing is, if we teach kids from a young age to be polite and considerate and accepting, they wouldnâ€™t be like this. instead of teaching girls to accommodate people like my brother, why donâ€™t we teach people like him to be kinder?
