I've been walking through your streets Where all your money's earning Where all your buildings crying And clueless neckties working 
Revolving fake lawn houses
Housing all your fears
Desensitized by TV

Overbearing advertising
God of consumers
And all your crooked pictures looking good
Mirrors filtering information through the public eye
Designed for profiteering
Your neighbor, what a guy
