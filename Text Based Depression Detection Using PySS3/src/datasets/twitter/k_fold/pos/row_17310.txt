Just because I tie my hair up every day doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t like it...AND IT CERTAINLY DOESNT MEAN I WANT YOU TO CUT IT So if you want to see more thereâ€™s a full post on my page explaining the story on AmITheAsshole but basically my mom chopped my waist length hair off to my chin. She said she would cut off two inches. More like two feet, bitch. 

Anyways, one of the reasons she tried to justify herself with was that she always saw I had it tied up and assumed I was annoyed by it. 

Itâ€™s true, I did have my hair in messy buns almost every day. On the odd day I would let it flow free but mostly messy buns. 

I donâ€™t know how weird this sounds but I fucking loved my hair. I liked letting it sway around my face when I played basketball in the driveway. Having it trail behind me as I ran. It was awesome. 

But then it cut chopped off. Please, for the love of god, donâ€™t let your parents do this to you. You. Will. Hate. It.
