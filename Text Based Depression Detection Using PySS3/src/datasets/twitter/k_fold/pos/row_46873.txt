At some point, we all start to question death When I was younger, death was distant. I didnâ€™t not care to think about it. And when I did, it was dismissed as being so far away.

Now that Iâ€™m older, the reality of death is so much closer. Iâ€™m curious about death, and what comes after: is there an afterlife or forever sleep?

I grew up in a family of Christians; therefore, Iâ€™m even more confused now.

Iâ€™m scared, bewildered, and indifferent upon this topic of death. Most of all, I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. Itâ€™s torture. 

Anyone else feel the same?
How do you guys deal with this?
