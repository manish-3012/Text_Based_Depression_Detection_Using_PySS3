I just got married on my minecraft server today and the party was so rad we broke the server. On a few month old whitelist only server, I got Married with somebody to start a military alliance. However after the ceremony we had a mod warp us to the after party location but instead of @a they teleported @e. That is the difference between warping every player on a server to one spot, or moving every single entity. Lets just say that the around 200 mobs that were instantly teleported into the same spot did not end well. It was a massacre and we ended up having to reset the server to a backup. Luckily I still got married on minecraft so thats something I guess.
