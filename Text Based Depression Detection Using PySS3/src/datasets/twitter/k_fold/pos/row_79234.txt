Our old science teacher made a youtube channel! So our old science teacher left a few years ago, we recently discovered his YT channel and heâ€™s trying sooo hard. It would mean the world to him if you could go over and support him! He doesnâ€™t know itâ€™s the people from his old class and we wanted to surprise him! His channel is Felix Sarsah- https://youtu.be/iuLpsSpXyhI
