itâ€™s hard to see your friends ignoring covid guildlines how can people be so stupid...i just want everyone to be safe. i have ocd and one of my things is germs. i know that no one is safe, but they act like iâ€™m stuck up and crazy for telling them to stay safe. i feel helpless. even though i take all precautions i still feel dirty and infected...
