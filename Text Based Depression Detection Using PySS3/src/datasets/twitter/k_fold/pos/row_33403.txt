Iâ€™m coming to realize I may have an allergy to cats. I was petting my cat Sugar last night and she was shedding badly and left a lot of hair behind. I fell asleep and when I woke up I was so congested. Iâ€™ve had her for over a year now and never realized it except when I first got her I suspected it because I would feel a lot better when I would go outside but I forgot about that till now. And no I wonâ€™t be getting rid of her. I donâ€™t mind suffering for my baby.
