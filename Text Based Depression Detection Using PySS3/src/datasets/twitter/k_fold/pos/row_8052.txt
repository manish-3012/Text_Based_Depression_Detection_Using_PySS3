What can I do to improve my life I do not like my position in life, I'm not paying attention in online school, I'm getting bullied, online best friends are making me worried, and I'm addicted to social media and video games. I'm not happy, but this is my life. I need some help on how to improve. Starting tomorrow after online lessons I'll go on an hour run, then come home and do the usual. I want to improve my life. Please help me, this is making me really sad and angry. I also get mad at the slightest things and am very emotional.
