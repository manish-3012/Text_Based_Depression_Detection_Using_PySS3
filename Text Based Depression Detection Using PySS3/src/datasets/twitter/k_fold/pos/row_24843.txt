Am i the only one who doesn't want to have a GF? I'm wondering why many people my age wants to have a GF/BF. I mean, what for? Well me I'm already satisfied with what i have. I can do almost anything i want anytime anywhere lol. The nice thing about being single for me is that you don't need to be a nice/good boy for someone. You can just you know, chill and relax and play with friends. Thats it. I'm off to play Kerbal Space Program. Good Day to you.
