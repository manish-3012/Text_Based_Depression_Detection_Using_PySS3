My new driving instructor today initially wasnâ€™t happy, after knowing I had OCD You see, he just wasnâ€™t very comfortable being in the passenger seat with someone with a mental condition, and was a bit unfriendly.  
   
But when the lesson ended, I could hear the surprise in his voice, because I actually drove decently well according to him. I only messed up at the junction, where I let go of my clutch too early and my steering at times wasnâ€™t too straight.   
  
But besides those, I drove with confidence and even shifted gears smoothly and could come to a stop gently.
