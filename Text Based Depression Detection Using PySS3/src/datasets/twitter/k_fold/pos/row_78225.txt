My moms aunt came into my room when I was cuddling with my bf I am a boy and none of my family members know that I am bi. Me and my bf were supposedly sleeping but we werenâ€™t and we were talking until we heard a noise from the door and then we faked slept and I had a eye open that she didnâ€™t see, he wasnâ€™t freaked out bc his family members know that he was gay. So I was stressing about what my aunt was gonna to say the next morning but she said nothing to me. What do I do bc I donâ€™t like adults that much and they make me uncomfortable but i donâ€™t want to like confess to anyone yet bc I am not ready.
