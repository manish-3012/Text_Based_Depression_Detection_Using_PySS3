People that move to texas 
Ok so basically i am from Texas. I havenâ€™t lived here my whole life because my dad is retired navy but i am texan. And despite what you think we dont dress up like cowboys . But i shit you not, half the people i see move here come to school dressed up in cowboy boots , jeans, cowboy hat, and a dress shirt. And they act so confused why no one else is dressed up like its 1899.
Am i in the right to be annoyed or am i just being a kevin (male karen)
