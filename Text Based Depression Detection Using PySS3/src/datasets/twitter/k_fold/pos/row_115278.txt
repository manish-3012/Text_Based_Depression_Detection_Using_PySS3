what if most of the world's population disappeared, but a small percentage?(2 people from every existing profession that contributes at least something to society, so hypothetically all most of the knowlage would be preserved, if noone dies of course), and also everyone had some sort of gps that shows the locations of everyone? do you think the human race would survive?(oh btw the buildings an all human structures would stay, but obviously will degrade over time)
