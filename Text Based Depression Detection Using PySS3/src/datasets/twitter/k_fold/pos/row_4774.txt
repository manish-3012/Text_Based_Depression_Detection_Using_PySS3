Tfw you get asked to write fanfiction on r/teenagers and you are way too determined. 

u/FluidChonker remembers it all.  
 He remembers the pain, the screaming, the blood and guts - â€‹*his guts*â€‹ - on the floor. He remembers the truck - some sort of off-brand chip truck - and the man inside of it. He remembers the ambulance, people saying thereâ€™s no way heâ€™ll make it to the hospital. u/FluidChonker remembers his heart rate coming to a stop. 

But by some miracle, he wakes up. But not in the hospital, his loved ones by his side, but in an endless white void.  
 â€˜â€‹*This is hell, isnâ€™t it?*â€‹â€™ u/FluidChonker thought. â€˜â€‹*Maybe those horny posts on reddit finally caught up to me*.â€‹ â€™ 

He tried so, so hard to move. Panicked and struggling. But he â€‹*canâ€™t*â€‹ - heâ€™s trapped here. 

â€œYou shall not be trapped here for very long.â€ A feminine, mystical voice says. Her voice reminds him of wedding bells and birds chirping.  
 u/FluidChonkerâ€™s eyes are blinded by a bright blue light, and a woman appears before him. â€œThough, I will admit, you are indeed here for atonement. Though the â€˜horny posts on redditâ€™ are only part of that.â€ The strange woman - god maybe? - twirls her long, silky smooth orange hair. Her hair compliments her face, which is molded into perfect features. Everything about her seems too perfect. 

â€œI am Cathera, goddess of both Earth, Kell, Parsa, and Krea.â€ 

â€œI... only know one of those places.â€ u/FluidChonker admits wearily. So the horny posts on Reddit really did catch up to him. â€œSo... where am I?â€  
 The goddess looks at him, her golden eyes lighting up in an all knowing way. 

â€œu/FluidChonker. Avid enjoyer of video games and manga. You like the isekai genre, correct?â€ The goddess smiles. 

u/FluidChonker eyes widen in shock that the woman knows so much about him, before realizing that yes, that is god and feeling stupid.  
 â€œI do I guess..?â€ u/FluidChonker confirms. 

â€œGood, good! Your atonement shall have something to do with such things. You see, I control four worlds.  
 Two of which are afterlifeâ€™s - Krea and Kell - and the other two are for the living - Earth and Parsa. Sometimes, I enjoy giving people second chances. You have been given such a chance. Otherwise, you would have gone to Kell and suffered for all of eternity. But fear not-â€œ u/FluidChonker interupts Cathera. 

â€œâ€‹*I would have gone to hell?!*â€â€‹  
 â€œ-you are going to Parsa for a second life. Also, itâ€™s Kell. Not Hell.â€ The goddess finishes. 

   

â€œStill! I would like to at least know what I have done wrong-â€œ 

Cathera returns the favour of interrupting when she suddenly explodes with light, her white gown dancing in nonexistent wind. 

â€œâ€‹**u/FluidChonker.**â€‹â€ The goddess says, her voice no longer mystical and cheerful but booming and ear-shattering. â€œâ€‹**You shall be judged this time. Do not fail.**â€‹â€ The void around u/FluidChonker cracks and itâ€™s too â€‹*loud*â€‹ and he cannot â€‹*see anything*â€‹- 

u/FluidChonker wakes up in a grassy field. 

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” 

u/FluidChonkerâ€™s eyes blink open, only to shut once more at the sunâ€™s harsh glare.  
 â€˜â€‹*What the fuck?*â€™â€‹ He thinks, sitting up.  
 His head hurts, his shorts are grass stained and his shirt is torn at the sleeves. His sneakers are untied, but he swore they were tied before. 

He tears his eyes open once more, hissing at his newly-gotten sunburns. Did that goddess really have to put him in a place with no shade?  
 He stumples upwards, before falling with a once unknown amount of exhaustion and slamming his head against a thin, black rectangular screen. 

...Wait, what? 

u/FluidChonker looks up, only to see a video game screen. Well, it wouldâ€™ve been a video game character screen, if not for the fact that he could touch it, could interact with it. 

â€œWhat the fuck...â€ u/FluidChonker repeated, this time aloud. He clicked the STATS button. 

Sometimes, in games, you can choose what stats you have in your character. This was not that situation.  
 A bold LEVEL 1 was at the top right corner. A set of stats were beneath it in four rows. PHYSICAL, MENTAL, MAGIC, and CHARISMA. 

Both mental and charisma were twos, while physical was a one. Magic, however, was a four. 

â€˜â€‹*Thatâ€™s... okay I guess.*â€‹â€™ u/FluidChonker thought, looking at his stats. He doesnâ€™t know the average stats of the world, but hopes heâ€™s not below it.  
 Next, he clicks the INVENTORY button. 

The screen shows many boxes. Many empty boxes, probably to be filled with stuff in his inventory. A pretty boring screen, if not for the fact that one of the boxes had a small icon of a sword on it, with the name â€˜RUSTY HEROâ€™S BROADSWORDâ€™ above the icon. 

   

â€œI mean... what could go wrong?â€ u/FluidChonker says, jinxing himself. 

u/FluidChonker clicks the box with the sword on it, then falls back with an undignified yelp of â€œOh shit-â€ as the sword spawned in front of him, nearly slicing open his chest as it fell onto the soft grass below. 

â€œI am going to die here.â€ u/FluidChonker says with absolute certainty. â€œI am going to die here because I do not know â€‹*how to use a fucking sword*.â€‹ â€ 

Nonetheless, u/FluidChonker picks up the sword, swinging it sloppily at the open air.  
 The sword cut through the air easily, though he knows that if he gets in danger it probably wonâ€™t help. 

But he canâ€™t stand the heat of the sun anymore, he needs to go. u/FluidChonker looks around, tired and aching, and sees a tree about thirty metres from him.  
 Of course, he heads towards the tree.  
 And then promptly passes out, cursing the goddess out for summoning him there. 

He must have slept for an hour - â€‹*two, maybe?*â€‹ - because it was still sunny as hell. 

Only this time, there was a girl staring at him.  
 She had long, dark brown hair, tied into a bun. Her freckles lined her face and made her curious cornflower eyes stand even more.  
 The stranger wore a loose beige shirt, which was covered somewhat by a long ankle-reaching brown skirt. Once the girl noticed u/FluidChonker was awake, she rushed over, her leather boots frantically running towards him. 

â€œAre you okay?!â€ The girl asked. â€œItâ€™s brutal out here, I heard it was cursed by a sun demon. Whatâ€™s with your clothes?â€ 

...u/FluidChonker recalled his normal clothes didnâ€™t fit in a fantasy setting. â€œIâ€™ve never been okay.â€ u/FluidChonker croaks, dehydrated. 

The girl blinked, confused. â€œUm... at least youâ€™re still alive? Here, have some water. My mother has some minor healing potions at our home that can cure sunburns.â€ The girl ran back to where she stood before, grabbing what looked to be a stone container, and then ran back to him, pressing the water bottle against his lips. â€œOh! Iâ€™m Maria by the way.â€ 

u/FluidChonker drinks the water faster than he has ever before. 

   

â€œIâ€™m u/FluidChonker.â€ He introduces himself. â€˜â€‹*Should I tell her that Iâ€™m from another world?*â€™â€‹ u/FluidChonker ponders. â€˜â€‹*Most of the main protagonists in isekai don't, but this isnâ€™t a manga.â€™* â€œWhere am I?â€ He asks instead. 

â€œDeathâ€™s Plain!â€ The girl - â€‹*Maria*,â€‹ u/FluidChonker corrects himself - answers. ...That goddess really just sent him to a place called â€‹*Deathâ€™s Plain*â€‹ huh. 

â€œOh! Here, come with me!â€ Maria suddenly says, pulling at u/FluidChonkerâ€™s arm in a gentle way.  
 Gentle, but it still hurt like a bitch.  
 No longer delirious, u/FluidChonker runs without stumbling at all - though he will admit itâ€™s still painful and uncomfortable to run with sunburns all over his body. The two of them head into a forest on a grassy almost-path. Maria clearly knows where sheâ€™s going. 

u/FluidChonker does not. 

After what seems like forever, u/FluidChonker and Maria arrive at a small house. u/FluidChonker wouldnâ€™t quite consider it a normal house - it kind of looked like a hobbit house, honestly.  
 But Maria, chipper as ever, knocks on the door. 

u/FluidChonker would have expected Mariaâ€™s mother to look like her - brown hair, blue eyes - but they donâ€™t look alike at â€‹*all*â€‹.  
 While Maria had straight, long brown hair, Mariaâ€™s mother had a frizzy mess of a grey hairdo. While Maria has cornflower blue eyes, Mariaâ€™s mother had dark hazel eyes. Mariaâ€™s features are soft, while Mariaâ€™s motherâ€™s are sharp and wrinkled. 

u/FluidChonker thinks Maria may be adopted. 

â€œAh, â€‹*you*.â€‹ â€ Mariaâ€™s mother scowled, much to Mariaâ€™s confusion. â€œNameâ€™s Prissy.â€ Prissy said, holding a cloak covered hand to him in the doorway.  
 â€œAnd we need to â€‹*talk*â€‹.â€
