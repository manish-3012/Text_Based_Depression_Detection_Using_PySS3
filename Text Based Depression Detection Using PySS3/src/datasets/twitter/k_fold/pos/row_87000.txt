Right so I read The Gospel according to Saint John So after finally being inspired by my hero to take more interest in my own beliefs I read the gospel. And I have to say Iâ€™m very happy that I did it, I feel like Iâ€™m a better person because of it and have taken some very good messages from it. I highly recommend that you read it even if youâ€™re not religious, Jesus gave some very great lessons.
