Iâ€™m disappointed So I just woke up and Iâ€™m my dream, I done so much shopping and had lots of cake and sweets. At the end of my dream, I remember walking back up to my room to lay on my bed and thatâ€™s when I woke up. So when I went downstairs to the kitchen, I thought that the cake and sweets part was real, until I actually walked in and saw none... now Iâ€™m just sitting here :/
