She knows I like her and now she isnâ€™t talking to me Made a post earlier about how I thought my friends told the girl I have a crush on that I liked her but today it might have actually happened. One of my friends was making fun of me for liking her and was fucking around and sent a pic of me holding a drum stick, about to beat his ass, and sent it. Later my other friend told me he sent the pic with the caption â€œhe likes youâ€ but when I asked the friend who sent the pic he said he didnâ€™t.  The other guy kept switching between telling me that it didnâ€™t actually happen and he was fucking with me and that he actually did send it with the caption. She hasnâ€™t said anything about it to me and didnâ€™t ask the person who sent it about it so idk whether I should ask her about it or just move on to someone else
