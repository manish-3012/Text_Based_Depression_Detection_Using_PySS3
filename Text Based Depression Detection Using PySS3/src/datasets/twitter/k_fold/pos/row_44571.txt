I have had great ideas in my life and i couldnt submit it anywhere and no one cared I have a notebook which i write my ideas in,

i have had an idea about an analog keyboard for example and even drew a schematic of the linear switch and after around 6 months, the company wooting one made the fiirst analog keyboard with linear switches, that was my idea

ive had ideas about how to make an internal combustion engine more efficient but it was done around 2 years ago

ive had the idea about the AI DLSS and AI framerate generator, ive had these ideas even before nvidia made them, and the way that they work are the exact same that i made and wrote in my notebook

Sometimes i just wonder, is someone reading my mind 

Sometimes i just :(
