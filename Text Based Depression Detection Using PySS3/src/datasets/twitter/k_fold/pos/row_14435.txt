Starting an r/teenagers debate every week until I forget: Week 1 In the movie Megamind, was it selfish of Metro Man to fake his death and start a new life, or was it reasonable? Did he deserve the break, or was he being a dick? And for one last thing, should he have kept the logo when he became Music Man? Iâ€™ll see you again next week with the next debate prompt for you.
