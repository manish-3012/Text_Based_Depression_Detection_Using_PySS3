I FUCKING HATE MEN (part 2) (TW: sexually assault) Another quick disclaimer cause last time a fair few of you were to ignorant to acknowledge this. So yes most men are fine Iâ€™m sure some of you might be lovely but thereâ€™s a certain type of men who just fucking disgusting me. But yeah most of my mates are guys and when they hear some of the shit some men have done to me theyâ€™ve been fucking disgusted but this shit happens to women quite a lot. 

Now adult men Tf is up with some of them. In my Instagram bio I have my age and make it very obvious that I am underage I do not post any sexual content. Yes my acc in public to which is fine (Iâ€™m trying to start modeling which is why). But anyways back to the point, I HAVE FUCKING ADULT MEN APPROACHING ME!!! it happens a lot the other day this 24 year old college student dmed me and said I was pretty. Like yes ik Iâ€™m pretty but ur 24 and you have ur University in ur bio!!! Like yes he could be a cat fish but like how dumb does a catfish have to be to pretend to be a 24 and approach a 14 year old. 

Ok so now thatâ€™s all covered, I can name 4 sex offenders in my grade alone at my school and guess what theyâ€™re all âœ¨menâœ¨ which as worrying as it is (cause weâ€™re fucking 14) after a while it is what it is. Now these men are disgusting and you can tell theyâ€™re troubled quite easy because they have many mates and the people who stick by them get as much hate as the offenders themselves (which they fucking deserve) like Tf is wrong with these guys hanging around an offender like cause Ik my school is shit with dealing with sex offenders because they all still go there. But yeah still hanging out with someone after what they did. Ik two lads I. My grade who started a business off of taking photos up girls skirts, the girls they took photos of still have to see their faces around the school. 

Now I donâ€™t tell many people this like only 3 people in the world know this and the reason why Iâ€™m saying this is cause my identity isnâ€™t on here. But when I was 8 I got molested by an old man. Of course Iâ€™m not gonna go into detail but itâ€™s fucked and I hate myself to this day for letting this happen to me. but I was to much of a â€œgood kidâ€ to say anything and I was just being polite. Which is also why we should teach our kids to speak up and be loud and say no. Iâ€™m also not doing this to also get ur sympathy in the comments but itâ€™s shocking that in my country 6 out of 10 women get sexually assaulted by the age of 16. 

So yeah thatâ€™s some more trash things that have happened also before you comment something obnoxious read the fucking disclaimer.
