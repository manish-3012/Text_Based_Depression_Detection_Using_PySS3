Anyone else fed up with the political situation in England? First of since this sub seems to be obsessed with it I'm M16. I live in Yorkshire and am quite left wing.
After the announcement that the UK will leave the EU I have grown increaseingly more anoyed with the political situation in England. It seams to me that there are a higher number of racists and biggatid people in this country compared to other places. Plus with the government not knowing it's arse from its elbow when It comes to running the country (you know, there job) I've realized that this country is in a state of decline. I truly believe that this country cannot succeed under the conservative rule and shall not improve untill we see them kicked out. I've decided I want to do something about it.


Feel free to call me a snowflake or a dumb kid. Alternatively you could think of something productive to say.

If anyone would like to talk about such issues I'm open to discussion
