I had a wierd asf dream. Basically I was in some scrapyard, and then the eclipse happened and I got blinded, I ran off to a broken car to fix my view. Then a large cat, probably a lion, came to me. It started roaring and I petted it and it went the other way, then I went to go inside some tunnel. And a fucking Tiger 1H is there in the middle of the road, for some god knows why reason I pet it and it drives into a wall and falls through the world. Then I am into some sorta clinic one bit running very fast, and I meet my friend who says there are bandits in the building and they release the zoo. I continued to go out of the building and down a road. When I see a millitary unit running from a bear and a kangaroo. There's also a massive pipe room next to me for no reason. They plant a bomb to kill the bear, and it destroys the street. I climbed onto the pipes when 10 beats start climbing after me. I parkoured my way into a house and I broke in. The bears probably summoned a portal to another universe and the sun was shooting beans into it. The house was collapsing and then one girl just whips out a pocket space battleship. So we fly to the portal and then I wake up :/
