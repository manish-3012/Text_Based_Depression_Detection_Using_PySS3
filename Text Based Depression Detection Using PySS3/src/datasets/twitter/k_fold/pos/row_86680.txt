What do I do I was in a 4 month relationship with my girlfriend Abby. One night I didnâ€™t take my meds and had an episode and ended up cheating on her. The thing is, I only cheated on her because she was ugly - I still love her as a person and her personality and everything. Now she wonâ€™t even take me back. Am I the asshole? Is it not hook-up culture who has totally destroyed these women??
