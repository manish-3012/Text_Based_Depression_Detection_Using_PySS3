How should I make friends tomorrow? I am going to a new school tomorrow and I'm really lonely, So I think this is a good time to make friends. I am a really good Rubik's cube solver. Top 10% I'm the world. I have made some friends this way but I worry that this is the only reason people are friends with me and when the wow factor wares off it isn't cool. Should I try to make friends not using my Rubik's cube?
