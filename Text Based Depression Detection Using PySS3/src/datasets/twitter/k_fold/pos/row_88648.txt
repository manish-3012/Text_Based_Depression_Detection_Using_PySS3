So... I really need some advice please Ok so earlier I was getting laundry together to wash clothes. I then realized that I have no warm weather clothes because they either are old and do not fit or are super worn out. I have a teensy problem in which I am 

1. I am only 15 and I still have to wait a year until I can work 

2. I only have 97 dollars saved up 

3. In about a month its going to start to jump up to 70s/80s so I'm going to be sol soon

So any advice on how to make some cash would really be appreciated! :)
