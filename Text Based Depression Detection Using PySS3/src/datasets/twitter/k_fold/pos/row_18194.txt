Iâ€™m interested in the stock market for 2 years now, Iâ€™ll tell yall what happened. Iâ€™m active in r/WallStreetBets for a year now. We didnâ€™t manipulate the stock market, GameStop got new Company leaders. All of wallstreebets invested and thatâ€™s why itâ€™s rising. But when itâ€™s falling again, GameStop isnâ€™t saved.
