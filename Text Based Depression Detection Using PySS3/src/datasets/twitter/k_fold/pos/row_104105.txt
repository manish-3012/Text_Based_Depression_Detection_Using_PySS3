Do I have to change myself to "live in the outside world" Today my mom told me that shaving the sides of my hair would be a bad idea because I have to live in the outside world. I had a mohawk that grew out into a kind of mullet and have been periodically shaving the sides to keep the hair from looking untidy around my ears. I mentioned doing it today and was met with disapproval, as well as a discussion that left me in tears. I can hear myself arguing with my mom and how stereotypical thinking sounds for a teenager thinking I know better. For context, I've been dressing 'weirdly' and having weird hair since I was about 13 (I'm 18 now.) So I've grown quite attached to this identity and the idea of changing myself to fit a norm is quite upsetting.

I'm hoping to hear back from a job interview soon, and this is a bug reason why my mom thinks I should try and be "a bit more normal" so I can get to another stage of interviews. (When I went for the interview I had bleached roots growing out and hadn't shaved my side so my hair looked as close to regular as my hair gets.) My stance is I wouldnt want to work for a place that wouldn't hire someone based on their hair. (I am happy to change my hair at their request I have done for previous jobs.)

I was informed my my mother that I "have to live in the outside world" which means making other people comfortable, even if it's at the expense of my comfort. I think if I cant do this in my teens when can I do it? I told her that, in my experience, adults are 'surprisingly' accepting of my appearance-which is where I sound like an annoying kid. I dont think I know better than her, I just think her philosophy on it is screwed.

I'm not sure where to go from here in terms of changing or doubling down on being weird, and what repercussions might come from either option. (I'm hyper aware of how annoying and cringey I sound I just dont know how to phrase it otherwise)
