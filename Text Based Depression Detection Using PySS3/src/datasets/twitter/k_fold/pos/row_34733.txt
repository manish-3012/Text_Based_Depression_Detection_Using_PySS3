To the Guy who played Xbox with me So for the past two months I have been playing Xbox with this chill dude who we will call Born. So this is mainly for him but I suppose anyone can read.

How are you? I know you love reddit and you have blocked me everywhere else haha. I just want you to know that even though you have blocked me, I wanted to say thank you. Together we completed Halo legendary and I will always be thank full for that and I won't forget our late nights, even when I had school in 2 hours but we still completed Gravemind, or when we just sat in the Halo 5 socials with a chill game and don't let me forget when we both tried our luck in For Honour just to get our asses kicked. 

Even when I was annoyed with you, you would always seem to find a way to make me smile so I just want to thank you. Even if you don't care, you made happy memories for me and I apologise for the joke, I didnt think it would push you to blocking me but at the same time I know you are used to shit talking others and with how you go on about love interests I didnt think you would care.

(The joke was: True or False? Do your parents know your gay?)

Even if we never speak again, I just want to thank you, these last two months have been an honour. 

From the person you blocked: TGG
