A teen can have a phone in their room. I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem but for some reason, my mom has a fit anytime I bring my phone anywhere near my room. She takes it off me every night. She doesn't look through it but it annoys me that she pretends to trust me to have phone, but she tries to control it as much as she can. 

Does anyone have any way to get her to back off.
