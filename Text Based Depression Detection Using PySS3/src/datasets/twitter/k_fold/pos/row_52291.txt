anyone else watched The Social Dilemma on Netflix? if you dont know, *The Social Dilemma* is a documentary film that exposes and talks about the dangers of social media and how manipulative it is, specifically with regards to fake news and how easily it can be distributed on places like facebook, reddit and twitter. 

if so, comment your thoughts, im interested.

personally, i loved it, but more so because it really 
opened my eyes. i think most of what they said is what most of us know anyway, but the more you think about it, the more you realise how huge of a problem social media really is. i also love how they incorporated a sort of short film into it, it helped keep the documentary more realistic and relatable, and kept my attention. 

and if you havent watched it, please, i urge you to. most of us here are most likely addicted to the internet and social media. believe me, i am too. its an amazing film that really shows how manipulative it is and how harmful it has been, and will be in the near future. 

my favourite part of it was when tristan harris said:
