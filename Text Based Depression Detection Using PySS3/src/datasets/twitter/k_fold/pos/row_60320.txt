anyone else feel like some part of them kinda likes being sad Itâ€™s so weird because obviously I wanna be happy, I mean who wouldnâ€™t want that? For some reason when Iâ€™m sad I kinda just wanna hold on to it a little for some reason. I could literally stop being sad but I just keep thinking the same thing
