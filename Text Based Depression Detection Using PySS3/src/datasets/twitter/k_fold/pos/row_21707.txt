Am i specail I feel like i'm umimportant. I dont struggle with deppression at least i dont think so. I always feels like im unimportannt eventhough people say I do important stuff. If im not doing anything fun with friends i think about how im not special and that I have no redeaming qualities and that im not worth anything. I feel like the standards I set for myself are to slow eventhough my parents are happy and I have a good life. My parents dont have high expectations but I feel like im just never enough. Even when I play video games and think wow im good i realise that i have been the same rank for a shit long time and that im in the biggest majority of all the player and im not special or good at it eventhough i love it. I dont play for rank but it hurts. I play tuba and i think wow thats cool and wow thats uniqe but no im just not good enough eventhough im in a band that I had to try out for. Is there a name for this or am i just stupid for think this and its all in my head or something. Thanks for reading this cuz I needed to vent. Sorry if you wasted your time reading this. I might take it down cuz i still dont know what to think of myself. Also just for clarification this isnt happening cuz im questioning my sexuality.
