bisexuals, how did you know you are bi? im kinda confused on my sexuality :/ so im a girl and i know for sure i like guys. however, i can see a girl and think "dang she's a beautiful homosapien " and kinda have a crush on her? but not want to go on a date with her. i remember last week i went to hobby lobby and i saw a gay girl (she had a "do you listen to girl in red?" tote bag) and for some reason i wanted her to notice me and like me. im also scared i have internalized homophobia in which i am homophobic towards myself where im really scared of being part of the lgbtq+ community even tho i fully support those who already are part of it
