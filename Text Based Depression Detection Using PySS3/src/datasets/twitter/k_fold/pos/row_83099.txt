all I can think about is how pretty i would be if i had the money to get makeup. a little while ago a friend gave me some of her old eyeliner to try out. i literally cried because i loved how i looked so much.

i would call myself above average, but i look at makeup and i can see how it would enhance my features so much i just... UGH. even just highlighter and contour i could do so much with.
