Quality of music is degrading So I have been keeping this to myself for a while now  , but i think that new music isn't just as good as it used to be , dont get me wrong there are still a few good new bangers out there , but stuff from 2010s just hits hard , pop is now mostly about love relationships , rap has become a medium of bragging about money and power , modern rock isn't that iconic anymore , I can listen to the new stuff but it doesnt age well . I ain't saying this because I'm nostalgic or anything , I listened stuff which I never heard before but they still sound good
