I donâ€™t belong here. The silence is deafening. This room isnâ€™t mine but it hasnâ€™t had an owner in months. The decorations arenâ€™t mine. But even when they are, Iâ€™m not comfortable. I donâ€™t belong here. I didnâ€™t belong there either so Iâ€™m out of luck. Too young to go anywhere. Iâ€™m stuck here. I donâ€™t like it here. I donâ€™t like them. Theyâ€™re mean to me. I want to leave.
