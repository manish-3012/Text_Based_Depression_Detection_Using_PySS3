I canâ€™t decide if i should go back to in person class Iâ€™m honestly vibing with online school but I miss the setting, plus itâ€™s my last year of high school. Online school saves me a bunch of time and energy, but it also makes it harder to retain the info cause i get distracted, but it also doesnâ€™t matter cause all our tests are open note. If anything I need to worry about memorizing for AP exams. Also Iâ€™d be lying if i said i didnâ€™t sleep through some of my classes and used it to my advantage. Life is kinda easy right now and I love it especially after junior year, that was rough. Never wouldâ€™ve thought Iâ€™d care about a dilemma like this
