Anybody get really bad stomachaches and pain when youâ€™re AT school specifically? During the school day I feel really bad. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s actually hunger, sitting down all day, etc.. But I feel uncomfortablen, my chest, sternum, and upper torso is in actual pain. Like iâ€™m sore or something. 

I know this isnâ€™t from COVID. Iâ€™ve had this last year also (iâ€™m a junior nowðŸ˜”) And my family just tested negative 2 weeks ago. 

So, ANYBODY feel like this??
