I hate being short my teen years are almost over and yet I'm only a mere 5'4", this is so ridiculous and it absolutely sucks

and seeing those 13/14 yo's getting like 6ft makes me even more angrier at myself

I'm in a disc server and there's three girls in it - one is as old as me, one is in the mid twenties, and the other is in the late twenties, and they're 5'9, 5'6 and 5'7 respectively

I hate myself and thanks for listening to my rant
