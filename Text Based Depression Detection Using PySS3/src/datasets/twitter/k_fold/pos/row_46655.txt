Silver giveaway I have some reddit coins that I'm not doing anything with, and I'd like to gift some amazing person on this sub. If you've never gotten an award before, leave a comment telling me about yourself and try to make it interesting. In one hour from now, I'll give a silver award to the author of my favorite comment. Thank you guys, and I know it isn't much, but I want some people to talk to
