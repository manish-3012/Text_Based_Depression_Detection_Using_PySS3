Yâ€™all I canâ€™t omg So my whole fam is over at my aunties house, and my mum asks everyone except me, my sister and my dad to leave because she has a surprise for us. She then comes out with a massive like 1m by 1m painted portrait of the four of us?! Like I get that this is meant to be cute but wtf?? How am I meant to explain this to people that come over? I also just donâ€™t wanna wake up and look at a portrait of myself everyday?? Ughhh it just makes me so uncomfortable plus I look shit in it too. I donâ€™t even like looking at pictures of myself and now I have this?? Come on dude fuuuuck
