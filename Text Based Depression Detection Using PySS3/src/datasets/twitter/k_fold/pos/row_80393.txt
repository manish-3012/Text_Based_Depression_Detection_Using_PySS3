I spilled coffee on my keyboard and now I can barely type I made dalgona coffee this morning while on a call with my friends. I tried to show them how thick it had gotten but ended up spilling half of it on my keyboard. Now my keys are really sticky and they take a lot of force to push down. I really need to clean them because I can barely type on it in this state. I'd prefer a way to clean them without taking off the keys because they're really hard to put back on and get fucked up every time I do. (laptop keys)

help?
