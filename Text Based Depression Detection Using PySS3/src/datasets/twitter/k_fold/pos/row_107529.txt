School grades vent God I just finished my first semester and oh god. I don't know if I can pass I tried doing all I could do even going into line tests and just trying my best to bump my grade up even a little bit. I have no idea if I pass or not. The main thing is I need it be passing my classes to go to my tech school which I've been looking forward too and I have a zoom meeting with my teacher,mom,dad, and speed teacher which will I think tell us if I passed. But I haven't even told my dad much about it because him and my mom are divorce and I just hope he isn't too mad if I don't pass cause I said I was passing but I don't even know right now. Just ugh. Anyway I hope that's over with.
