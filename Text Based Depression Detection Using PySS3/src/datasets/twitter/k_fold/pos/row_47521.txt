So I have this embarrassing story that I can't forget. So basically when I was in primary we used to have this yearly dance competition where schools would have to pick a song and make a dance around that.

Now I hated dancing and still don't like it very much, so basically I would always put the least amount of effort and barely pay attention, now when the day came instead of just shutting up and dance like everyone else I just purposely fell over and over again until it was finished like a asshole and when it was done I was thinking I was the coolest guy out there for doing that.

Idk what happened next it was a blur, probably got punished by my teachers or something.

My classmates also probably thought I was a dickhead.
