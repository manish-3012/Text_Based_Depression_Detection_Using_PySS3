On the Recording of Zoom Meetings of Class To all students on distance learning:

It is actually illegal for teachers to record zoom meetings without the consent of everyone in the classroom. If you complain to the teacher about you being recorded, the teacher should stop recording immediately.

&gt;Zoom makes it easy for hosts and participants to record class sessions. While it is useful to have a record of the class, each session will contain images of your students, along with identifying information about each of them. Youâ€™ll need permission from each student in order to record a class session. Youâ€™ll also need permission in order to use or share the recording anywhere outside of class. Once the recording has been shared, it, like everything on the internet, is now outside of your control.Â  The safest approach, in terms of student privacy, is to refrain from recording class sessions entirely.Â Â
