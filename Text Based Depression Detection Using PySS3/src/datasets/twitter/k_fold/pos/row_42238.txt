I am fucking done with my life, I want to die Like I hate my parents, I think i am not a bad kid, I get straight As in most classes, I never get in trouble for anything more then not doing my diary, I let my parents have a say in what I wear, I listen to them if they tell me to not be friends with someone I am not really close with. But recently I barely talk with my parents and now I am the worst kid like they fucking side with our maids when this shit happens, They fucking kept knocking while i repeatedly told them i am writing a test on my online class until i couldn't focus on my class, and when I let them in I was pretty damn annoyed and told them to get out after I am done and now my parents are screaming at me cuz I hurt their feelings, while I have a fever and when I asked for some alone time, she started calling me arrogant, telling me I have problems and should go to the therapist, I am ungrateful and shit. And then be like i will kill you, like even if she didn't mean it she literally told me her son i will kill you and then when i stopped talking and avoiding her she was like you say we are hurting you but you are hurting us.and I would have not cared much if my maids interrupted me that one time, they interrupt me on a daily basis like that. I personally don't want maids but because my mom can't manage everything though our apartment is on a medium size I let them be, but they have way too much power, they come in without knocking during online class they keep moving my stuff around and i have missed so many submissions cause of that and during covid my parents scream at me and do shit like that on a daily basis for stupid reasons like me not wanting ice cream and nobody every sides with me, and my fucking brother who went through shit like this only sides with parents and keeps hitting me like he is fucking 6'4-5 and weighs 100 kg, and is a horse rider while I am 5-10 and barely weigh 60, I don't play any muscle demanding sports, imagine that and I am freshman. They keep telling me i have issues cause My mood keeps changing( gee I wonder why a 14 year old gets mood swings) This is taking a serious toll on my mental health while I feel like a spoilt brat, I feel like my parents just pay for some stuff I want and barely give any emotional support for me, and expect to be good parents and then they take away my laptop for online classes because I am a bad kid. I can't even speak with anyone cuz of covid and I am feeling like shit, I legit considered suicide but reminded  myself there are worse situations out there and just went by. They scream at me while I am on the verge of tears about how I am hurting my maids feelings. My maids have just walked in on me having online class multiple times and embarrassed me and get away with it cuz they are illiterate. My parents expect me to be only happy cheerful with them and never show them any anger or shit, if I do they be like do you expects your parents to only give, They don't even bloody let me diet cuz I feel a bit over weight. Just exercising while they make me eat food that cancels it out, like if I exercise they make me eat more so I can have more energy like why. The only reason I want to still be alive cuz I don't want them to cry, like literally they have given me no emotional support and only doted on me while I am happy and threw me aside and hurled abuses while I am in any other mood until I cry, i literally have nothing to live for, and guess what my parents give me the basic necessities which they can easily afford, like a laptop for school , a phone so I can connect with my friends and a good bed so I can sleep, and I have begged for a gaming pc for 2 years and they still wouldn't buy me till November. I had a fever today and didn't want ice cream so my brother wanted to hit me so fucking badly and only didn't because my parents would be angry at him.
