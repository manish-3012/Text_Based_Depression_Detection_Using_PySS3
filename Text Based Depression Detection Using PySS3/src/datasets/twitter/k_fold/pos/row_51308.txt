Just a teen looking for advice. If this would be better in a different sub, let me know.

So this is very long, my apologies in advance, but if you are going to comment I kindly ask you to read the whole thing or move on without commenting. Basically I am just looking for any advice I can get. I also apologize my writing sounds disjointed, messy, sloppy, etc., I am new to this whole thing, these are new feelings and thoughts that I have had bottled up for a few years and only now do I feel the need to share them. Thanks to anyone in advance.

So for starters I'm a 15 yo guy. I've "liked" girls before for several years, but it was purely because of their looks, so I've never really had a real crush per say if having a crush entails that you are friends at least somewhat and don't just like someone for their looks. What I mean is I have never even gone so far as to become friends with any girl. I am an introvert and I already have trouble making friends, let alone of the other gender. I envy other boys who are extraverts and can get along with people, including girls well.

A bit of background: I was born into a practicing Catholic family and go to a small classical Catholic school. I have this feeling that, hypothetically, even if I were to befriend a girl, and even if in the even rarer case that we both thought of each other as "something more than friends," that my parents would not support it, what I mean is I am the oldest child in the family so I honestly don't know when the time comes how they will treat dating/girlfriends so I am very, very hesitant to dabble with that subject. I mean they have (kindly) teased me in years past about it but I don't think they were serious.

I have heard that a good youngest age to date is at the minimum 16, so I'm probably still a bit too young idk maybe, but I wanna look into the future. Speaking of which, if for some reason you haven't already figured it out, I have already decided that I want to get married and have children someday. One fear I have though is that when I look to the juniors and seniors in my school (like I said, we are a small school) none of them really ever talk dating, or tease each other about liking each other, nothing. They're all just friends. So far as I know there are no relationships between students within the school. But like I said it is a Catholic school, where overt displays of affection are prohibited, so I think that it's merely a product of the culture of the school.

But still, from many sources I hear about people dating in high school, but I feel like even in a year or two, since the culture of the school appears to put dating off until after you graduate, I figure that I will be out of luck until college. It appears to me that everywhere else people are dating in high school years, but I feel a little left out/robbed because of the school I go to.

Now don't get me wrong, I am eternally grateful to my parents for sending me to a Catholic school, and I understand that there are those who would love to go to private school but their families can't afford it. But sometimes, just sometimes, I like to wonder what my life would be like if I had just been a normal public school kid.
Now I don't consider myself particularly attractive (okay, my parents call me handsome, and sometimes other adults, but none of that really counts.) and I struggle with acne which doesn't help my self esteem. From what I can think of there's nothing really interesting about me, I'm slightly short and scrawny, not the ideal tall and athletic guy. The only thing I can think of is that I could quite possibly be the smartest, as I graduated 8th grade with the highest grades out of all the boys, (But in a small class, that's pretty easy.) and finished last year with a 3.9 GPA.

Bit of a recapitulation:

I'm only 15, and I don't know if I should have started getting ready for this earlier or if I shouldn't worry about this till later. I've liked girls for their looks before, but I'm an introvert and have trouble making friends and never befriended a girl, so I've never really had a "crush". (if having a crush entails being friends at least somewhat first) I don't want to screw up my chances with any particular girl in the future, so supposing I did have a crush, I don't know if I should wait for a sign or confession from someone that they like me, or if I should confess myself, and if so when and at what age. It doesn't help that I go to a Catholic school that has a culture that doesn't really support relationships with students, but everywhere I look I see and hear of people dating in high school, which only adds to my confusion. Even worse, I am the oldest child of the family, so not only am I new to this, but so are my parents, and I don't think they want me dating just yet. (Like I said, I'm only 15, so I can wait, my fear is just that I am waiting too long, for the reason I stated before.)

Okay so if you read this whole thing, my goodness, thank you for bearing with me. Any advice that anyone has is greatly appreciated. I just feel like a confused human being stumbling blindly through a dark cave. If no one has anything to say I will continue living my life and move on, and let God lead me where he will. My only fear is that I am going to wait too long and miss the opportunity to develop valuable relationships, (And not just romantic ones.)

If anyone wants any clarification on anything I've said, please just ask. ðŸ™‚

Thank you all so much. I am new to this sub but y'all seem like such a loving and supportive community that I am so excited to be a part of. ðŸ˜Š
Cheers and good health to you all! May 2020 become a better year for all of us!
