Is life even worth it tbh So lockdown was hell for me even before I was dealing with issues I hate my brother and dad and lockdown drove me insane two weeks ago I told this girl I liked her and she said she didn't, then proceeded to show everyone the messages it was hellish I've never had a gf I always get rejected. Then this week someone blackmailed me with old messages I sent them that would of got me in a lot of trouble and would of made my life even worse
