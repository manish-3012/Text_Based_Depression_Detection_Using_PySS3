I HATE EVERYTHING OMFG IVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT FOR LITERALLY SIX HOURS IN A ROW THINKING I WAS LATE BUT THE DUE DATE IS NEXT WEEK

IVE DRUNK FOUR FUCKING CUPS OF COFFEE AND THREE OF TEA FOR THAT!!! I HAVE SCHOOL TOMORROW BUT ITS SO LATE NOW THAT THE SUN WOULD BE RISING IN A HOUR

Whyyyy???? Like Iâ€™ve been super sneaking all this time, tip-toeing around my house to prepare coffee without waking up my dad, making sure I wouldnâ€™t sleep and now that Iâ€™m finally completely caffeine-high and not tired at all I learn that this whole thing wasnâ€™t urgent and that I could have gone to bed hours ago! 

Now itâ€™s too late to go to bed and all my stress-induced motivation left me

You know what, Iâ€™ll just scroll reddit for a few hours, got nothing better to do haha

This whole post didnâ€™t have any purpose, just me complaining because I canâ€™t message anyone at this hour, if someone is reading this : hello!
