You guys ever hear a song and at a certain part of the song it sounds like your mom shouting/calling you? I know, sounds super random and weird but in this song

(Nice to meet you by *Forever the Sickest Kids*), there's a certain part where I hear it without fail! Its also not some placebo effect sort of thing. There had been cases where I was randomly listening to it and I still heard (even though I had forgotten about this anomaly by that time)

Now it just happened again lol
