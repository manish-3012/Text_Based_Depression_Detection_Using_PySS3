So my class is having a debate right now- Instead of doing class things right now, my class has decided to talk about the unfairness of a transgender male fighting female fighters in MMA and wrestling and other sports (baseball, track, cross country). What are your thoughts on this topic fellow Redditors? Is it unfair?

Note: This is an anatomical discussion, not a transphobic one. Please don't cancel me XD
