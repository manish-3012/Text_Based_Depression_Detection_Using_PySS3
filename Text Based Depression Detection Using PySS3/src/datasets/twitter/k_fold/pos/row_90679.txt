Girlfriend Applications :D Yup. You heard me correctly. You can comment them or dm me it. Just give me some basic info about yourself and then a little bio showing me a lil bit about your personality and your interests n such.

A little about me: Iâ€™m a 16 year old dude (straight) from the US (Midwest). I love music, movies, talking, sleeping, eating, and video games. Iâ€™m a drummer but Iâ€™m learning guitar and bass and ukulele. I also used to play the trumpet and piano. Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m pretty smart and Iâ€™m lowkey a geek (also kinda edgy too so uh ðŸ‘€). Im not the most attractive thing ever but Iâ€™d say my personality is decent. 

I think thatâ€™s about it so um yeah :D
(This is mostly a joke so)
