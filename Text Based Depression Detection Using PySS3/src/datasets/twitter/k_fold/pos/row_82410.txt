people who say sToP yOu'Re gOnNa tRiGgEr mY oCd are fucking idiots I heard a guy saying stop you're triggering my ocd because something wasn't lined up and I wanted to punch him out of existence. It is an actual anxiety disorder that is filled with compulsions and intrusive thoughts. Please for the love of god just look it up on google it's not that hard. 

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
