Maybe I'm in the wrong but This world is falling into chaos we hate each other when we don't even know each other we have criminal's being looked at as hero's we have hero's being looked at like devil spawn these groups like BLM and Antifa are big parts they are not only filled with idiots with no good argument but they have no respect there is no respect anymore what ever happen to our humanity we hate people because the media tells us too we don't learn things for our self's we are told this is bad this is good our religious beliefs are being frowned upon because of a small group our police and military are being looked at as evil. Statues of great leaders and hero's like winston churchill and Aberham Lincoln are being defaced by ignorant people that don't have respect or listen to the people they are fighting. We live in a society were history and science is seen as a choice it is not you can not think that this man was rasict because he lived in the 1800s this world is all we have left yet we are killing each other ruining each others life's when we could be looking and trying to fix real problems. Now I know what you're think oh this dude hates BLM and Antifa we yes and no the BLM message is good but the people support it by what rioting looting buring cites they are terrorists so is Antifa they are anti fashism right there is no fashism in the world there as only ever been like 3 fashist country's and they are long gone Antifa is a terrorist organization that fight for nothing. Feminists today are like BLM the message is good the message is great but they are mostly idoits do you not realize that women easily have more privlage than men I mean come on a hot lady can ligit rape a a man and it's seen as funny yet a man rapes a women no no that's horrible BOTH ARE EQUALLY HORRIFIC. This world is full of ignorant idiotic self centered people these people have no respect and no manners you can disagree with me all you want but I would rather die on my feet before I live with this stupid society on my knees what ever happened to a calm argument were both sides were looked at and we're the people came up with a good honest descion together gen z and the next gens are what can fix this we all need to learn from these stupid mistakes and actually have respect for one another and listen to one another or else how we so much better or smarter than the animal kingdom maybe im wrong maybe I'm the ignorant one but we all see each other as the enemy no problems were ever fixed with non sense able war or fighting it was fixed with thinkers that took time to look at everything and respect others for what they believe no problems will ever get fixed with the way we treat each other today we need to work together and respect each other like we are family to get these problems fixed we need commen Sense and unity back for the sake of our future and our planet. 

If you cared enough to get this far thank you. You can disagree or agree but you must see it too we are falling apart as a race not a country not a skin tone but as the most advanced beings on this planet we are failing our self's and our future maybe I am the idoit maybe I am the ignorant one but someone tell me am I the only one that sees that's we are failing as a people. Thank you for reading this I just don't understand how people can be so cruel and ignorant when they don't even know who that person is and what caused them to have their own beliefs.
