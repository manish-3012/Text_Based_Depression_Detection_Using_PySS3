These posts are overdone, but as of yesterday Iâ€™m officially 20. My time here on this subreddit has come to an end. I joined here back around 2014 on my old Reddit account and have been subscribed ever since. Never been super active here, but I lurked a lot. Itâ€™s really weird to know Iâ€™m not a teenager anymore.

I donâ€™t have much advice, but I will say this: enjoy these years as much as possible. Try not to sweat about dumb stuff, you only really remember the good times in the end. School blows sometimes but for most it is time with your friends, and (unless you had a terrible experience) you will look back on it positively. 

Also, donâ€™t take from granted all the time you have. It may not seem like it, but in high school you really have a lot of time to do whatever you like without the pressure of responsibilities youâ€™ll have down the line. Donâ€™t worry too much about using this time wisely, just have fun right now.

Thatâ€™s all I have to say I guess. Iâ€™ll change my flair.
