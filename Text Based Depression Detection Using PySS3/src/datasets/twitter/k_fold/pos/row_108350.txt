One of my guilty pleasures... Is improving myself so that the girl who ghosted me regrets it.

Because frick her am I right?

(Back story we were really really close for almost 2 years but then out of no were she just stops texting me for no reason. Itâ€™s been 3 months since we last talked and since then Iâ€™ve moved on and decided to improve myself as a person instead of worry about her.)
