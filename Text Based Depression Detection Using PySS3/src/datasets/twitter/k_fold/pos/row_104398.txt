Why does defending men make me an incel?  Incel in modern media is like how Americans used Communist in the 50s, don't like your next door neighbor? Incel! nHate your boss? Incel! If I either respect women I'm a simp, if I hate a woman, I'm an incel, incel and simp should just be deleted since they don't mean anything anymore
