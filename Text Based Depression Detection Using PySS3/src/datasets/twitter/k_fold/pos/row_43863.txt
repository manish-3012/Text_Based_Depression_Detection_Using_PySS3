What is happening to me Lately I feel like everything is my fault 
Like Iâ€™ve ruined my life , because I have
Lately when I go to my bed I hug my pillow 
And imagine it is someone hugging me back 
I just stare at it ,crying, 
Maybe itâ€™ll be 3 am and Iâ€™ll be sitting there questioning everything
Who am I ,what do I want ,where am I going
I donâ€™t see the ending ,I donâ€™t see the exist
â€œI just want to run away , find somewhere that feels safe
Somewhere I can belong ,I donâ€™t have to run away from my flaws
And I donâ€™t have to be scared of my thoughtsâ€
As nf said in his latest song
But I donâ€™t have anyone by my side who understands me
They donâ€™t see what I see ,
Problems flood my eyes
But I want something good to fill my sight 
I just write a lot of poems/lyrics talking about me , tryna vent that way 
I am passionate about it and I spend hours thinking on the best way to express it
But I keep those to myself,  , I scream and yell into the paper,but I feel speechless
What is happing to me , 
What has happened to me
Where did I lose myself
Where is the me I used to know 
I am afraid my biggest fear of them all may be here
I may be having a breakdown ,or worse ,having a depression
