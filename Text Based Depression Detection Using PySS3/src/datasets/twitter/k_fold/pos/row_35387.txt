Why do some parents blame everything on their kids? Parents POV: Oh, you did something that bothered me? That's your fault

Oh, I did something that bothered you, and I told you that if I ever do something that bothers you to let me know? Well guess what, that's still your fault!

I'm so confused. 

I remember earlier today when my mom called me, and I said "I was about to go shower, what's up?" In the most casual way possible, Thinking nothing is wrong with what I said. Lo and behold, my mom proceeds to get upset at what I said, going off about how she doesn't care what I was about to do, and some other stuff I forgot about.

I'm a teen like most of you here. Is it just me, or do we gen z kids have some of the most unpredictable parents ever?
