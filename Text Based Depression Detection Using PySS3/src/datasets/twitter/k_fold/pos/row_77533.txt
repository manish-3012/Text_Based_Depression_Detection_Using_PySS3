Night 1 of preparing for a surprise test made specially for me to lower my grades Just found out my teacher wants to lower my grades. There's going to be a test only i will take that has all my weak points. Little does she know, I'm the smartest yet dumbest person in the class. It's time to play a mind's game. I already figured out the test will be on the last class of this Friday due to it being the last class of the day
