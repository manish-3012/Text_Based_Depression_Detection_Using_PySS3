My professor is a hypocrite. I'm still in highschool taking dual credit, but I already hate the idea of college professors, especially if they are as problematic as mine.

My teacher pretends to be super liberal, but is an older man and says extremely sexist and racist things that genuinely hurt certain students in the class.  But this isn't even my problem.

My professor just thinks he has so much power over everything, he acts like he is this high and mighty ruler and if we break the most minute rule we literally will not pass the class.

I attend my zoom meetings online every single day, and I never miss a class, but one day I forgot to do the sign in sheet, my teacher refused to count me present despite the fact that I interact with the teacher more than almost any other student. 

My professor constantly mentions plagiarism and how it's wrong (which I do agree with,) but literally every quiz he makes is plagiarized from some quizlet he finds online, I'm fine with it because it makes studying and cheating on the quizzes the easiest thing ever, but that's pretty hypocritical.

I just really hope that not all professors are like this, especially when I can see that he's definitely not even close to the most problematic one.
