Sometimes, I just sit alone and wish I could time travel into the past My first stop would be Singapore in the early 80â€™s.  
  
My main goal? To meet my grandfather, as he passed away before I was born, and my eldest Uncle who passed away when I was only a toddler.    
  
But seriously, if time travel became a reality, thatâ€™s my plan. Iâ€™m taking my phone and a car with me and going back to the decade of the Brick Phone.
