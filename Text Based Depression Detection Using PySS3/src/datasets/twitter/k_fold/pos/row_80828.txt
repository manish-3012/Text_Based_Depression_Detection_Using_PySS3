Have u guys heard of cheese tea I'm drinking milk tea with cheese rn,I didnt make it I ordered it loll

And tbh

Just eating the cheese it tastes like butter so it's kinda weird

But if u mix it up it blends in rlly well and you'll barely taste the cheese,the cheese with the tea kinda tastes like milk tea but rlly strong milk and a little salty idk how to describe lol 

would I recommend this?idk if u like trying out new and kinda weird stuffs sure bcs that's why I tried this out 

It's a little salty kinda,idk,tastes kinda weird too but prob bcs I'm not used to this flavour.

The boba in this makes it much better bcs I can just chew the boba after drinking this loll
