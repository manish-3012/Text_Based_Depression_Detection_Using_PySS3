Tampons or pads? So like I go to sleep and things are fine. Itâ€™s until I stand up is when like Niagara Falls breaks loose. I have never worn a tampon to sleep simply from the fear of TSS if I over sleep. But sometimes my pad moves at night and like I said *gush* So like whatâ€™s the better choice because Iâ€™m tired of ruining underwear :(
