Update 3: my brother is still an idiot So he ignored my mom and went to the park with his girlfriend, who has been exposed to the virus. I canâ€™t believe how utterly stupid and disrespectful he is being. He ignored what my parents told him and went out anyway, and will most likely be effected and spread it here and have no repercussions because my parents canâ€™t discipline the shit out of their oldest children. My grandmother will probably due as well. I canâ€™t deal with the stupidity in this house hold.
