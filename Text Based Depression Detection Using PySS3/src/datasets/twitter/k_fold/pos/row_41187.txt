Don't want to lose who i like with showing my face I met this one girl in VR chat and we started talking, she has a very adorable voice that i absolutely adore, we are both 16 and we're miles and miles apart, sounds normal?
Wrong. She showed me her face alright and we still talk and all but am quite short on friends and also insecure about my looks, I am afraid she'll think of me different or treat me differently if she saw my face, am so nervous on what to do, Help!
