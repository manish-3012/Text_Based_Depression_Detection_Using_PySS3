It feels weird.. Like I have been talking to this girl on snapchat for 110 days. At one point she told me she liked me, I liked her too. But only problem was that we live so long drive from each other. 

Well like 40 mins ago she told me that she doesn't want relationship with me because she said she doesn't know if she could do it. I kind of knew this would come at some point, but before we even met. It just feels weird and it sucks. I thought it would work but yeah, maybe it was meant to be this way.
