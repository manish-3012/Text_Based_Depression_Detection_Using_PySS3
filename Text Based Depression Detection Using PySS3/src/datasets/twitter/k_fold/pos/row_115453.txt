This sub is not relatable enough for european teenagers. I propose that we europeans (Northern Europe) start talking about annoying things that we have to deal with such as when

your mom makes you go to the flurpenflugen for not doing your glurpevork (not a good situation haha)

Or when you finally have your klurpeflurpe van dinkendurker and then realize itâ€™s not as epic as you thought (relatable am I right?)

Those are just two examples but thereâ€™s way more potential for us to joke and make memes about things like the flurpenflugen and skolepoledroole.
