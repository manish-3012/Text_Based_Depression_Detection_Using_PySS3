I hate that Iâ€™ve always been so lonely that I get attached to fictional characters easily I get too attached to fictional characters and itâ€™s hurting any chance I have of making actual friends. My parents wonâ€™t even let me talk to the few friends o have because â€œThey donâ€™t approve of themâ€. I just want a real person I can hang out with.
