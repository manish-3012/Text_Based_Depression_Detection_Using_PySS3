I have 207 assignments. Each with varying amounts of pages. 17 years old, senior year. Iâ€™m tired of high school and want to finish this senior year early so I can finally be free and do what I want. Iâ€™ve stayed up 20 hours, I plan on staying up atleast 48 hours and by then I should be done with my entire senior year in less than 2 weeks. Thank you for reading.
