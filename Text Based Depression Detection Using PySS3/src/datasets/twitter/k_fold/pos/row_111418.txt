Are most of your guys' dads kinda shitty? A lot of ppl I know also have shitty dads, is this very common? I mean I get it they have their traumas that's why they behave way they do and I get it, but that doesn't justify their behavior. Idk what to think of it, I totally get it we're all human but I just wish I had some sort of fucking guidance. 

Raising yourself is exhausting it's like building a LEGO set based only on the box and no instructions. Are most people's dad's shitty?
