Please dont smoke Its a bit hypocritical for me to say this, having just finished a cigarette, but seriously, please donâ€™t start. I realize that a lot of teens do it, and that its easy to be pressured into it, but its really, REALLY not worth it. Ive smoked for about four-five years now, and i can tell you it was a mistake to start. Not only could it kill you, but if you have a history of cancer in your family (like i do) its even more dangerous. 

The only thing ive gotten out of smoking is that its a chance to talk to my friends after work, but i could do that anyways. Thereâ€™s literally no reason for it, so please donâ€™t. 

Thanks for attending my TED talk
