When you dont remeber shit from last night and see that you used social media It's a pain in the ass reading whatever tf you wrote and cringe hard because you dont know how tf this came into your brain nor when you did it. Blackout drinking is fucked, I remeber drinking with my dad for the first time and that's it, I dont even know how I got into my ducking bed.
