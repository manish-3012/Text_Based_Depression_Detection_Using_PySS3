boyfriend advice pls lol last night my boyfriend was over and he asked what the closest I'd been to death was bc he was telling a story abt how he nearly fell off a cliff when he was little. I didn't say anything but all i could think about was my suicide attempt last year. is that something I should tell him or just keep to myself? we've been dating like 3 months and I just dont want to scare him or seem like I'm dumping trauma. any advice would be v appreciated
