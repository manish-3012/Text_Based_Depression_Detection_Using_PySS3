my teacher got offended by me calling jews jews like what the hell we call asains asains and whites whites but I cant call jews jews? What is wrong with that don't they call themselves jews but no its a perjordictive now. She told me to refer to them as jewish people which I will now but jesus christ people are to easily offended now. (the context of the conversations was she asked what are historically opressed groups and I said jews because of the halocaust.)
