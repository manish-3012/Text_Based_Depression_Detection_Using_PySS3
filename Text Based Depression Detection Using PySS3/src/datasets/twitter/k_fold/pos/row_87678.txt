I live in germany and school is... ...full of boomers as you would say. We call them "Almans". It almost has the same meaning but is a little off. Anyway, we can't have online schools normally but in these times we are allowed to do online schools or we must do them. We use the WORST, SLOWEST, ALWAYS CRASHING Microsoft Teams... I know. Even our teacher's struggling to use it. My thought is now, why we don't just use discord? It's easier to use and much better. AND you have MORE CONTROL + EASIER ACCESS for moderation. So why not just use discord? It's free after all and almost never crashes. Only at some times if you run it on some trash like an family laptop. But it works better, sounds better and is just better for everything. EXCEPT... If you wanna upload Files. Some tiny files work fine but big presentations dont work great but we already use something else to communicate with our teachers and get our homework so it doesn't look like a big deal then.

Thx for coming to my ted talk. Forward this post to any teacher and maybe they do a change at your school. :D
