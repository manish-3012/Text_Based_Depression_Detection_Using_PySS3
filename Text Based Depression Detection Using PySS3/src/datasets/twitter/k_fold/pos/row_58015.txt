my fridge is so cool (no pun intended) i just looked at my fridge and realized how nice and modern-looking it is. the handle on the right side is like a rough metal cylinder and it's completely straight and runs from the top to the bottom of the top half door. there is a horizontal equivalent of this for the freezer.

there is only one door and one pull-out drawer under (the freezer) which makes it look super clean and simple. it is metal and has sort of a stainless-steel color. 

my fridge is so cool also it holds my food and stuff so cool x2
