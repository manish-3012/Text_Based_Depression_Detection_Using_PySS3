I feel like a prick Hello Reddit. I know you guys probably donâ€™t care, and are gonna think this is your typical relationship post. I mean your not wrong but still.

So Iâ€™ve been interested in this girl for months. Sheâ€™s the greatest and she revealed her true feelings for me today. I was curious as to why because she has a boyfriend. She told me she was poly. WHICH IS FINE. Itâ€™s just not my cup of tea. I feel like her boyfriend already hates me and that will leave tensions between us sour. I also donâ€™t feel like I have or can give enough trust for that. I feel like a prick because she built up all this courage and effort to tell me only for me to put my nose up to it.
