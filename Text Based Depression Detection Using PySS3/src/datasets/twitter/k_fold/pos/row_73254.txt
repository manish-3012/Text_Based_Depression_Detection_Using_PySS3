The worst part of being as sad as I am The worst part is I want to die but I'm in so much pain that I can't even kill myself. If any of you direct me to a mental health helpline,I will block you. Period. I just need to get this off my chest. I don't cope with sorrow like everyone. I don't cut myself. I'm already in pain I don't want to cause more pain. I just want to die. I don't even have the strength to do so. Fuck everything. Ugh why the fuck was I even born. I don't want to live. Take this shit away from me. Everyone be like "you should be grateful for what you have". I'm not even rich lmao. My mental health has to be in negative digits.
