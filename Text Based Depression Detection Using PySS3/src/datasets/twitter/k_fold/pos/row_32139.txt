Ok well it happened I was in bed last night, wondering if I should tell my crush that I like her, and after like thirty minutes I finally got the balls. I said it, I said I have for a while and I would still want to be friends if she said no. In her words: "sheeeesh buddy I'm finna be yo first kissðŸ˜š" and for some reason I thought she was joking. But the next day we were hanging out and out of no where boom, it happened. Straight up. I mean I thought I had no chance, she seemed so out of my league but wow. I honestly, and sadly, thought I would never feel the touch of a woman ngl. But wow.
I mean how. like what. bruh I need more self confidence.
