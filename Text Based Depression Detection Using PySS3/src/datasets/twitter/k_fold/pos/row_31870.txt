I have recently been posting to r/teenagers with a lot about trying to get with this one girl but my friend who knew her, I asked him to bring me up like casually but instead he said I wanted her to teach me how to draw. We havenâ€™t talked, me and her, i didnâ€™t know she drew, and I donâ€™t want to learn how to draw from her (yet), I was planning on talking first myself, but no. Iâ€™m kinda freaking out but I think itâ€™s a good thing but I donâ€™t know and Iâ€™m mentally dying. I think Iâ€™m alright though because she likes him so it wonâ€™t seem like Iâ€™m trying to get with her and I donâ€™t know how to be a human. Iâ€™ve even been talking more in class to raise my tolerance but even though I hate myself after every comment, even if I make the whole class laugh. I feel like itâ€™s the end of the world when it isnâ€™t but Iâ€™m still freaking out. So, how was your day.
