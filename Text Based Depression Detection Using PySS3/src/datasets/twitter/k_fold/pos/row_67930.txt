First day at a new school highlights 1. I had two panic attacks

2. I have a class with the person who led me towards my suicide attempt

3. Tripped in public while walking up the stairs

4. Almost knocked out with a basketball

5. Sat alone at lunch and had old friends walk by and ignore me

6. Rejected by a good friend when I asked her to homecoming

Life is going hella good ðŸ˜Ž
