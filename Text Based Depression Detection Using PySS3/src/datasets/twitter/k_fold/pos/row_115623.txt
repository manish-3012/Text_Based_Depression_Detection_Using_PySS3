Iâ€™m worried about one of my Idols: Millie Bobby Brown Iâ€™m a really huge fan of Millie Bobby Brown. For those that donâ€™t know, sheâ€™s from Stranger Things and the new Netflix movie Enola Holmes. Sheâ€™s my first celebrity crush and sheâ€™s very famous at 37 million Instagram followers. I even met her last year. I think sheâ€™s a great person as she offers great advice, is very relatable, and is a good person. 

However, some people on r/13or30 who thinks she looks old enough to be a mom, and on Twitter people keep making a homo meme out of her. I know she has more love than haters but she took the Imagine meme on TikTok personally when most people were just having fun with it. She said she has developed anxiety because of hate she gets and I think sheâ€™s starting to think she has more haters than lovers, which is not the case from what I see. She doesnâ€™t get that much hate as someone like Brie Larson.

Some people on reddit really want Drake to have sex with her, and it disgusts me. I think if she saw that she would probably feel disgusted.

Since sheâ€™s probably thinking she has more hate than love, I just donâ€™t want to see one of my biggest idols kill herself because of some incels online. Are people really bullying her or am I over thinking it?
