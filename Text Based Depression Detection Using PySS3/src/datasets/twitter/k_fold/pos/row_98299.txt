Anyone feeling like they havenâ€™t learned shit this school year? I feel like I have learned absolutely nothing with online learning. Iâ€™m not trying in my classes anymore and they are no longer engaging. Iâ€™m just mindlessly logging into my google meet and then looked at a computer screen all day. I am completely unmotivated to do any work and I just with no thought or care just do my assignments day in and day it. Shitâ€™s mind numbing and there no variety in the schedule at all. Itâ€™s just the same shit over and over and over again. Driving me crazy.
