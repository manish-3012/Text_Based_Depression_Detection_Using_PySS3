I'm turning 15 next month. Life is slowly passing before my eyes so that I can watch myself get older and still not know what I'll grow up to be. It's weird cuz I'm currently 14, and 14 is close to 15, which is cool. It's also close to 13 but 13 isn't too cool cuz it's that weird "I'm a teen" and "I act like I'm 12" stage for some ppl.
