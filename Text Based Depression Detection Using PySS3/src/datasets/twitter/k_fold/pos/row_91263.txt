What do you want to do? I'm genuinely curious about what choices that people want to do in the future, like what career choices people like or if people want to go to college after high school. We've been asked what degree we want to pursue for next year (I'm getting an associate's degree out of high school, right now I automatically have it in science) and I think I'm going to pursue a music degree. I want to go to college somewhere obscure in Europe like Czechia or Slovakia and become a puppeteer because I like puppets and how they work, or either a musician because I like playing clarinet and composing. What do you all want to do and why do you feel the need to do it?
