If you think about it.... Tupac is the king of the rap game because he controlled the influence and kept the rappers of the  game connected to each other and while he was still alive he made rap great

Eminem is the god of the rap because ffs itâ€™s Eminem, no one else can put pen to page like him or can even match the wordplay he does
