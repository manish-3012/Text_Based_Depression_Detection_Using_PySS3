Dear saddened teens of reddit. I understand that a lot of you are depressed and I would like to share the information that helped me through. A lot of depression has to do with both mental and physical health. With mental, maybe clear your mind  and lay still for 5 minutes, and then the next week, clear your mind for 10-20 minutes, the next month maybe half an hour. This is called meditation and it helps mental health. You just need to breathe and clear your mind, if you start crying, then start over. Deep breaths and laying still.                                       Meditation can help so so much and having a clear opened mind will help Help is always opened and you need to open up because if you can't open up then you can't get help, it's going to be 5 times harder to get better. With physical, maybe have a walk and exercise for a little bit. I'm not talking about lifting 100 pounds, I'm just talking about a nice walk or jog around the neighborhood, or a bike ride to the library. Instead of having a soda and tacos during lunch, maybe have some tea or coconut water and and a fruit salad. It may not be the best combination but healthy habits and eating will help so much. Don't think that you're going to be all better immediately, because it will take a few months.  I love you all and I hope this helps.
