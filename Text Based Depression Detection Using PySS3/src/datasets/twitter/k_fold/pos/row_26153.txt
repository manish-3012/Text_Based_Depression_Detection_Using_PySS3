Mom is too controlling... Im 18  (soon 19) and I legit can't do anything. I don't even have the right to have feelings. 

I have depression and my mom got really angry when she saw my search history of me looking up "how to stop feeling depressed" And other shit I did. 


She is so hypocritical it's insane. She says "talk to people dont be so quiet" And when I  hang out with a few people on the internet she says "it's getting too much". 

I play a few games at night with my friends, I'm not "allowed to" stay up past 10 pm. But still do because what the fuck. She came to my room today at 12 am. Starts yelling at me like a fucking maniac saying "you are ruining my trust" And shit like that. 


Dude it's my fucking life I can do whatever I want what the fuck. She can't even let me leave her alone I'm just stuck with her what do I do
