Advice needed, I need some conversations point for conversing with a girl. Iâ€™ve noticed that the conversations I have with my crush are rather shallow and short lived. I really want to put in an effort and try to be a more likable person for her, so if yâ€™all got some topics to keep the convo going, Iâ€™d really appreciate it!
