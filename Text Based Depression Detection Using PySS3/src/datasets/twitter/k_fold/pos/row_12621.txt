Iâ€™m tired. My mental state is at a constant decline. Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend, and because of my loneliness, Iâ€™m doing terrible mentally. I have no confidence to ask anyone out, and the quarantine makes everything worse. Recently, Iâ€™ve been thinking some really bad thoughts. I donâ€™t know what to do.
