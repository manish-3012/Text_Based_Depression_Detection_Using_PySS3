"Do girls care about height?" So, I'm a girl, and I feel like this question is really important because guys feel bad about their height? Which I 100% understand, I would rather be like 5'3, but I'm more around the 5'6 range, so I get it. I guess all I really have to say is, as far as women who are actually worth your time goes, we don't care about height. It's not a necessity for you to be over 6 foot. I know it seems like it, but it's not. We just have preferences, that's it. :)
