How I sold my freedom for a phone So, with school right around the corner, my school has decided (so far) that they will open on a hybrid schedule. Group A will go Monday and Tuesdays, Group B will go Thursdays and Fridays. The days you are not in school will be online.

Well, this is going to be my senior year so I'm kinda bummed that I won't have the full experience, but, whatever. At least I still have 2 days. Well, my mom was very against me going back to school, even if it's for 2 days.

Now, I've been wanting a new phone for a while because every phone I've ever owned (2) was a jacked-up used phone. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful at all, in fact, I was still very happy I had a phone. Just, it was very hard to enjoy them. Especially my current phone.

My mom and I were talking about phones and the phone I wanted randomly came up. I really like the new iPhone 11, and the camera quality is looking a little extra bomb, which is important to me because I take pictures of my makeup looks and I like to keep them high quality in case anybody wants to replicate my looks (and because I like to look back on them and feel good).

Then, that's when it happened. My mother had an idea so bright, the sun was jealous.

My mother said if I do 100% online school, until schools become safe, she will buy me a new iPhone 11 Pro Max. 

Now, you guys may be thinking, "why would you call going to school freedom?" and to that I say, well, I don't leave my house at all. Even pre-covid, I wasn't allowed out the house. Couldn't even go to my backyard. So, school was the only time I could actually have a breather and have some freedom.

Anyways, guess who's getting a new iPhone 11 Pro Max in Space Gray with 256 GB.
