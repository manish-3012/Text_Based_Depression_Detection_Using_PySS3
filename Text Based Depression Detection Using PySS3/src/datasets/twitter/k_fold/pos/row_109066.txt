I just woke up from a dream, about a girl. Long story short I have dated this girl 4.3 years ago and I canâ€™t move on I have dated other people time tried to heal never worked and even when I try to forget for example I forgot about her for 3 months now my brain will just randomly have a dream about her, and every time it would be lovely and make me happy and when I wake up I realize how horrible that is, I donâ€™t know what to do, I tried everything to move in but I never found someone more perfect what am I supposed to do?
