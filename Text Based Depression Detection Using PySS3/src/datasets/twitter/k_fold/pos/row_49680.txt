guys I need help texting a girl so this girl i like just posted a new pic in insta, and everyoneâ€™s simping over her in the comments.

i wanna give her a compliment, but also stand out at the same time

i want to say something along the lines of â€œi guess you look okâ€ or â€œyou look ok, i guessâ€ but i donâ€™t know how to convey that iâ€™m just teasing her. 

â€œi guess you look okðŸ˜â€ seems alright but could be misconstrued
â€œyou look ok, i guess ðŸ¤ªâ€ conveys the right message, but i fuckin hate that emoji
â€œi guess you look okðŸ¥±â€ seems a little to harsh
and â€œi guess you look ok ðŸ˜‰â€ seems a little to sexual for two 15 year olds 

iâ€™ve never actually talked to her before, (sheâ€™s liked a few of my insta posts but that isnâ€™t really talking) so i really donâ€™t wanna mess this up. what should i do?
