Idk le fuk happened yesterday. So, in Scotland, schools opened since we have low cases. Yesterday, I was looking at the chart that tells us what 'elective' we were to go to (2 periods of fun so that you could rest, I had them for the last 2 periods of a Friday), the options were: Minecraft in the computing room (I know, lol. Tell me how to put pictures jn text so I can show the paper), craft (the one I got), Drama and some fun learning about Disasters that happened recently.

I turn around after reading my class number for my elective and I see this: My crush is pointing her phone at me, a flash and then she quickly looks away.

I already had suspicions she liked me because she was looking at me once. But Idk. I like her a lot because she is pretty but Bruh.

I was once asked out before the pandemic by a friend I made, but I turned her down with a hard no since I didn't know if my parents were going to approve. I had a crush on another girl but she is a big bitch so I lost interest.

Alright rant done.
