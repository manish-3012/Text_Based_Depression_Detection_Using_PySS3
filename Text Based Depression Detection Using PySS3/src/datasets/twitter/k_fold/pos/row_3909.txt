Girls are a game, and Iâ€™m done playing. 
Wasted months of morning texts, sweet goodnight, envisioning our futures over a FaceTime, staying up all night thinking about how different she is and how she wonâ€™t let me down, to waking up early before she goes to work to send her a morning text and seeing the message not go through. Time to play video games and make myself think that Iâ€™m not fucking crying inside. Have a good day people.
