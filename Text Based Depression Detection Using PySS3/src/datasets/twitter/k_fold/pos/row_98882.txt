Hate how just a few kids have to answer the teacher during online class while the others donâ€™t give a flying fuck Excuse any typos since this is typed on phone.
Being in a high school and typically the last year of it, has been sad overall. So ever since online classes have begun, every single class has had only some students answer or respond to the teacher while the others just take the back seat and canâ€™t seem to care less. This is extremely unfair because the teacher is teaching the whole class and not just the 2 or 3 who actually bother to respond. Like, why care to attend the class then if you arenâ€™t even going to pay attention? Stop wasting your parentsâ€™ hard earned money and time and energy if youâ€™re just going to chill while not contributing shit to the class. Moreover, upon being summoned by the teacher, the audacity to lie about your mic not working but otherwise using it to speak on your private calls is just outrageous. Itâ€™s not like the students who actually answer are paid to do so, or for paying attention or something. So, yeah. Like for fuck sake, grow up and give a damn about your education... else weâ€™ve all seen futures gone wrong. Sorry for the rant but Iâ€™m sure at some point yâ€™all have encountered this annoying situation as well.
