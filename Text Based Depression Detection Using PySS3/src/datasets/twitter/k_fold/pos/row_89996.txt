(Deleting soon) i just found out my mum has been cheating on my dad, my dad doesn't know that I know, what do I do. please excuse my bad typing, I'm super distraught and shaky right now

so about 15 minutes ago, I redownloaded reddit. My phone has an auto login feature so it'll show the option  to log in as any email on my phone as long as that said email has an account. So I'm about to login to my normal reddit account (this one) when I realise there's an option to sign into an account from my dads email. Curiosity takes the best of me and I login and check the post history, the first thing I see is a post on relationship advice about his wife (my mum) cheating on him. I double check its him by logging into his account  using the regular password the family uses. And yep, its his account, I feel like I can't hold this secret forever, my parents haven't broken up which I presume is for me and my brothers sake, what do I do? I feel an urge to tell my dad that I know but im scared to.

That also would explain my dads sudden bursts of anger recently and him not talking to my mum as much. I also had suspected she was cheating for a while. I guess the saying your gut is never wrong is true.
