What Makes Teens So Hungry For Social Popularity In School And On Social Media? Even If All Their Fame Doesnâ€™t Last When They Become Adults? Coming from a teen, I cannot understand why it is that we are so hungry for popularity that it badly hurts our health. For instance, in this generation, most teens are absolutely starving for social media attention, especially on TikTok. And even in real life, we seek to try to fit in with certain â€œcliquesâ€ that are seen to be â€œmore superiorâ€ towards other group of people. In other words, we do our best to hang around those stereotypical â€œpopularâ€ people in school, that are more often than not complete assholes. 

I think you understand what Iâ€™m trying to say. Regardless, I canâ€™t figure out what actually causes for us to seek popularity so much to the point where we have to create our own artificial form of popularity in the forms of social media fame, or even the stereotypical school-wide popularity that means nothing once you get into the real world? And itâ€™s not just our generation, many generations have done these same things before us, except they didnâ€™t have the internet like we do now. What actually makes teens act this way?
