have you been drunk? have you been drunk, if so, when did you start drinking and why? I'm actually so curious about the different drinking cultures for teens. What do you think about drinking and when you should start?

this isn't to influence anyone badly I promise lol, I genuinely am just curious. I feel like there's a big difference between the US and Europe
