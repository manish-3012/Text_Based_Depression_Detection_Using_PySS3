I donâ€™t even know this woman but I hate her with a passion So my aunt had taken in a dog she found on the street, helped it keep warm (it was freezing outside) and feed and watered it. Well about a month later, after she got done with an adoption program the dog (Prince, about 1 year old. Obedient, well trained and listens). 

This woman which was described to me as well dressed and talked in a manner of â€œget away from meâ€ adopted him. Now prince is a high maintenance dog with lots of energy(very active) and the woman lives in a condo. [She was told he was high maintenance]

4 days later she brought the dog back saying he wasnâ€™t her type. What an asshole. Like you **KNEW** he was active and required high maintenance, yet you got a dog like that when you live in a condo??

W.t.f.
