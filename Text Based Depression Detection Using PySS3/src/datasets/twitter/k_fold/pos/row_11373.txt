The difference between America, and Europe In America the greatest danger is a child being shot in a school.

In Sweden everyone in the public is in danger of being killed by a grenade. 

In the most European countries people are very likely to be stabbed by a gang, and children are in danger of grooming gangs.

In Finland, where women are extremely likely to be raped, they respond by posting a tiktok, which wasn't even well made.

Neither places are utopias, but i'm sick of the hive mind.
