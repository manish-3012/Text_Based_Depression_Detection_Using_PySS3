Hereâ€™s a joke to cheer my fellow depressed teenagers up. So a string walks into a bar. The string asks for a drink but the bartender says â€œwe donâ€™t serve drinks here. Sorry.â€ So the string walks out, and starts rubbing on the walls and rolls around on the ground. His ends start getting rough and coming apart. He walks back in the bar. The bartender asks â€œDidnâ€™t I see you here just a minute ago?â€ The string answers â€œNo, Iâ€™m a frayed not.â€
