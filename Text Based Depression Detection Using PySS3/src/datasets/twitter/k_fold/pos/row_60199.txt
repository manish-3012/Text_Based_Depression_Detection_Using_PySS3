I think we all, especially nowadays - Need a tight, warm hug ; " ;. Idk if its good sub to pull sucha thing on but there ain't no better tbh **Hey, 17m here I wasn't sure if I could post it on this sub but I couldn't find a rule agains this and  the "Relationship" flair given to it even more sooo here I am**

So yeah as You might alrdy ve assumed I'm searching for a gf around my age x), someone who i could have a heartwarming relationship with. You know making eachother feel loved n stuff. Tones on tones of care! â™¡  Choosen Reddit mostly because I have a more serious approach to relationships than "yeetnquit" like most o girls in my environment prefer it to be. 

so yeah here are some details about me 6'2/60kg from EU, super chill, from time to time getting clingy but in the adorable way, I'm honestly a type of guy to prefer to hug n movie together over some lewd stuff

Never understood the "Be asshole to attract girls thing" always backed support, care and love as a factor of the relationship, that's why if whatever goes down on Your part id be always here to support you.

Into art(drawing, painting, writing lyrics and poems etc) skating and maybe time to time vid games. Images of me in posting history

So yeah hope I won't get much hate for posting this here and uhhh, hope we get along! x)
