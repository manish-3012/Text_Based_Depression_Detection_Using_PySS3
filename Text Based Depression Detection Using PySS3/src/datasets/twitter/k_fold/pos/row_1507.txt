Can you help me with some inspiration? Iâ€™ve been scared to pick up a pencil and draw for a while now but today I want to change that. Iâ€™m pretty bad at drawing but I want to try drawing something simple and colouring it. I was wondering if anyone could give me some ideas of what to draw? Ideas for doodles are ok too! Thank you and have a nice day! :D
