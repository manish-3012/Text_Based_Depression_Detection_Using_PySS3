So my own girlfriend catfished me. Was having a really awesome conversation with this Reddit random and had gone on for around 100-150 messages when they started guessing really intimate details about my life that no internet stranger should know.

Turns out my girlfriend made an alt account a few months back and decided now was the time to mess with me using it.
