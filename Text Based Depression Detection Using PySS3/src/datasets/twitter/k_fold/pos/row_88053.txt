My parents think I have more money saved than I do cause I pissed a lot of it down the drain during lockdown. What do I do? I lost 2 jobs during the lockdowns and I donâ€™t know how to replace the money without my parents finding out. Iâ€™m not talking like Â£100 either is near the 600-700 mark. Iâ€™m in the shitter, any advice?
