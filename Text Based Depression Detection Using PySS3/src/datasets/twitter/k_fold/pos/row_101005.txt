trauma dumping another word that tik tok learned and ran with. 

ngl trauma dumping is nice to hear when i donâ€™t have to sympathize with you. like when iâ€™m in a mood i would much rather rant to you and not have your input bc everything i say is embarrassing. 

i thinking more about trauma bonding lol 

the three most significant relationships iâ€™ve had were like tied by trauma bonding and two have ended horribly so far lOl

anyway if u have anything to dump go ahead
