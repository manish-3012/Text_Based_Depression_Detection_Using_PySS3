Discussion: What things do you things having as a kid would have benefited your mental health now? My Prompt:

For your final project, you will create a program or organization that addresses one of the main themes, cultural or societal concerns we have discussed this semester.

**Your assignment:**

1. Choose an issue that we have addressed this semester that needs change, support, or attention (bullying, sexual assault, racism, mental health, identity).
2. Design a program (new curriculum, a mentor group, an after-school club, etc.) that addresses this need. It can be aimed at any audience. Is it a group to help parents talk to their kids? Is it a trained support group of peers on peers? Are you creating a new club at the junior high level?
3. Change the world!
