POV you are a girl on omegle and I'm showing you my hot wheels collection I started this collection in 2005 at the age of two. I stole a toy firetruck and a silver sedan from my daycare. Soon enough I collected all the cars I could find. Like this here red sports car from 2004. Now right here isn't hotwheels, it's matchbox but oh well. This here is a SpongeBob food truck and this is a hotrod.
