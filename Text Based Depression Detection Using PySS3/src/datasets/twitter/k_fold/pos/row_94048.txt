See y'all on the other side soon ;) In about 38 min I'll be turning 20 and ik that this is a pretty cliche thing to do by writing a message like this but I just want to say, a massive thank you to this community for making my life a little less shitty and I'm gonna miss the cringey memes the relatable comments, the stories from ppl and the random ppl I met on the discord. TBH I don't feel sad because I foresaw this moment and knew I'd have leave someday. my biggest regret is how late I found this community (when I was 18). I understand the importance of r/teenagers and make sure my younger brother finds out about this 2 days later when he turns 13. It's kinda poetic, I know but it's just a mere coincidence. Just goes to show that this is an eternal sub. Anyway this my last post on this sub reddit as I officially grow out of the "Teenage" and leave this sub... but, I'll always be a teenager by heart.
