Things I hate 1. Rice cookers - I don't get how to use them and making rice in a pan works way better
2. Dishwashers - I've grown up washing dishes by hand, I don't like taking the easy way. I just feel lazy
3. People talk to teachers - I'm fine if a teacher and you greet each other or say a few sentences but people who talk for 10 minutes with the teacher just get annoying and cringey
