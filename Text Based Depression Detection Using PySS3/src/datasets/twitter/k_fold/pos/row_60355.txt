I deleted a virus off my phone I dunno if this is the right sub,but i did it. A few days passed when i got my phone, then it started to open google and throw me to some porn sites. I'm just a 13 year old,what the hell was that. So,i have this phone for i long time, i tried to clear cookies,searching on youtube,etc. And only today could delete that trojan. I was so scared when i gave my phone(turned on) to my parents,i hoped that it won't open google. It didn't open,surprisely. 

So I'm just happy that i could delete that(or just be brave enough, because I'm kinda scared for my phone).

Please excuse my ew English. I cannot change the post,but still &lt;:)
Please be safe everyone.
