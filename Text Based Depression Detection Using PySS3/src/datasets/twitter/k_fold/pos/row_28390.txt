My math teacher knows about photomath. Today in class he said "I've noticed a lot of my students are using a method of work we don't use in class, and I belive you guys are using photomath, So now if any of you guys use a method not used in class I'm going to mark you wrong" idk what im gonna do, without cheating I will fail math. Goodbye B+ :(
