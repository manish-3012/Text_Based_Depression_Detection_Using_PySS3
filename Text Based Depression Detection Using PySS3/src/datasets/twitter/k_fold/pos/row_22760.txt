My mom speaking the hard truth Showed my mom some gen z humor meme and she turned it into a deep subject by saying this:

"I feel bad for you kids growing up in this generation, it's so f'ed up. Basic human kindness is lost and I don't know if there's any going back to normalcy."

Man she ain't wrong ðŸ˜”
