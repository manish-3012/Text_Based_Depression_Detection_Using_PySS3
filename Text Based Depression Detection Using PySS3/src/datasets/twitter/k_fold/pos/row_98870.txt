Something happened in my year recently Hi, not sure how long ago this happened but some kid in my year (I live in NZ) asked a girl for nudes. The girl rejected him and slapped him, then the kid grabbed her in a headlock and punched her 3 times in the face. This isn't huge but I just needed to vent about it.
For clarification, I'm under 18 and so are all the other people in my year so this was a shock to me when I found out. Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk
