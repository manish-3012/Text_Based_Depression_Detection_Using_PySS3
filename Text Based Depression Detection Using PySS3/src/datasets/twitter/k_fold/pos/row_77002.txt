Ooooh boy I sure like venting Yesterday (I mean it was yesterday to me, timezones are weird) I posted two videos in which I was venting about failing in school and believing to be a genius my entire life to then realize I never was, and that I just learnt stuff before my peers, AKA a completely normal thing. They were made in the heat of the moment, while I was crying and feeling shitty about myself. Some people were genuinely concerned about my wellbeing and gave me tips to calm down, because I really was panicking and feeling like I was worthless, but other people thought I was faking it. One even told me to kms (they deleted their comment shortly after tho). And that makes me sad. I just wanted to be able to express my negative emotions and talk about my mental health, and some people think I'm faking it for attention. News flash, I wanted attention because I was talking about my mental health and I wanted support. Not all teenager girls that talk about having anxiety and depression are "fAkInG iT fOr ClOuT". Those videos have since been deleted, because I feel like I got a bit too carried away. Maybe I won't post for a while, maybe I will post in a hour. Who knows.

Shoutout to the redditor that made the amogus joke under one of those videos, I hate you for making me laugh at an amogus joke.
