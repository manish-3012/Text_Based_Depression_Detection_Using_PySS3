This is the vibe for my senior year Keep the abs thats I have now cause I literally grinded all fucking summer for the body I wanted. Only wear baggy jeans and my old vans that are completely worn, get a baggy vintage hoodie and a chain necklace, skate to school. Also iâ€™ll keep a black mask on. Keep in mind I go to a completely southern and conservative school so idk how itâ€™ll go but fuck them at least I have style.
