I need Penis advice My favourite Person is the Boy i like.

Hes facing some rough times right now and he didnt really go into details.

He bascially said that hes fed up with everything but still wants to go through it alone.
Which is fine. 

I really dont want to push him.



But tbh i feel like he just never had real Support and now a hard time accepting it.

Which makes sense since it seems like hes overthinking so much that he even gets scared to tell me about problems.

For example; saying that I would just feel sorry or hurt if he tells me about his problems.



As i mentioned above i dont wanna push him.

How do u Support a guy without him telling me about his problems?

And how do I make him less overthink (which seems to be a hell of s Problem)
