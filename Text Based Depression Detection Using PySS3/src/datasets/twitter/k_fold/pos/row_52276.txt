My cousin has just died yesterday This especially has hit me hard since I have not had the opportunity to see him or even talk to him before his death from a heart attack combined with having the corona at the same time. I remember all the good memories I had with him when I was little and it's so sad thinking I never got to say my last words or have one last memory, the last time I heard his voice was when he wished me a happy birthday two weeks ago and when I wished it to him the same day. May he rest in peace, I'll always miss him with all my heart for he was the most kind and amazing cousin a great person to everyone he was around. For everyone out there who loves their family and has a good relationship with them, please cherish it for could be your last moment all of a sudden. ðŸ˜ž
