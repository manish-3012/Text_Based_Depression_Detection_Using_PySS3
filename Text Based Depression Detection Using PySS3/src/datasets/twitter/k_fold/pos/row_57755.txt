Can I have some advice about highschool? Hellooooo. I am a freshman in highschool. I have been doing virtual learning the entire year, so I have never been inside my highschool. I'm really nervous because we are going back to in person learning by the end of next week, and I have no clue where any of my classes are. I know the room numbers, it's just I dont know how to get to the room.

So can someone give me advice about how to not be nervous about highschool, or just say some nice words of wisdom about getting through the rest highschool?


All of your thoughts and advice are appreciated!
