Hey, my friends found out this is my reddit account.  So I started off this account without any purpose in particular. I just opened it to join [r/PewdiepieSubmissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/).   But then I started doing memes, enjoyed it and kept on going because  of  the dopamine it gave. But after a bit I decided to use photos of my   friends to do memes, it just felt fun because they didn't know. It   worked out for a year, but they found me out and now I'm just deleting   posts back and forth, even though they found them funny and supported   me. Don't go into my accounts' posts. Stop I am warning you!
