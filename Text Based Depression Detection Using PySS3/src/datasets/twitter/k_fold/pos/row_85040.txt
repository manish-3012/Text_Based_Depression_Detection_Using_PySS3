All of my problems explained quickly So Imma keep this short because I'm feeling way too exhausted to write a whole text.

My mom is an alcoholic who kicked me out, my grades suck, I lost a friend (r.i.p marcus), my girlfriend left me and I tried killing myself yesterday but it didn't work out so now I'm wearing a turtle neck thing so people can't see the red line on my neck.

I need advice, please
