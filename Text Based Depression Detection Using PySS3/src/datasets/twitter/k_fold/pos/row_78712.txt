No. Kim Kardashian is hot/sexy/attractive. She is a resemblance, of high standard in beauty. I always find these kinds of posts of bashing Kim Kardashian or any celebrity to be a bit silly. We only say this because we hold celebrities to such absurdly high standards. My coworker was saying the same thing. I told him, look around our office right now, and the vast majority of the people here are pretty ugly and mediocre. Even the hottest person in our office would be considered ugly by celebrity standards. He considers our boss to be hot. Our boss is a chubby, slightly pretty woman who wouldn't survive a day compared to hollywood celebrities.

If this came walking through the door as a new employee, half the office would be freaking out at how beautiful she is.

She is absolutely very, very attractive. You are just holding her to the standards of celebrities.
