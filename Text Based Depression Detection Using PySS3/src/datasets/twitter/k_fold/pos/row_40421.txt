is this normal? okay so pretty much i feel so alone and unloveable. im in highschool and ive never even had a middle school type â€œrelationship.â€ im terrified that if i ever do get in a relationship i wont know what to do or remotely how to act. i also feel like ill never have someone that likes/loves me in a romantic way. i dont understand why people dont like me (not trying to sound stuck up or anything) bc im a pretty confident person and i rlly like being around people and i think i have a fun personality. i feel so sad about it because everyone else gets to be liked romantically and i dont. i dont know whats wrong with me.
