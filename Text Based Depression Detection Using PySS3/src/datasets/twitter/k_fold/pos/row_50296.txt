My daily life #19 Today day was absolutely hillarious

My best friends finally came to school (only for this day) . We enjoyed every second of our meetup. In science lab , we did practicals on ammeter and voltmeter. I and my friends did something else. We created sparks of electricity with it and burn the nichrome wire.  Couldn't stop my laugh for an entire minute. After I came home I went to sleep and ate my dinner . And here I am at 2A.M. writing this.

Hope you have a good day/night
