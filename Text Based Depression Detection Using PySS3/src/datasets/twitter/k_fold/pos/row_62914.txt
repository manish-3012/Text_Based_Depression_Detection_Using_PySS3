Joe Bidens DNC Speech Just a couple days ago I made a post giving my feelings about the US election this year and how worried I am no matter what way it turns out. Of course I would rather have Biden, anybody else but Trump really, doesn't even have to be a Democrat, but I still worried that Biden wouldn't be the best president. I didn't think he had the passion, or the greatest idea on how to take care of the country and stand up for it and protect us. But the speech he gave at the DNC gave me loads of amounts of hope. The speech he gave made me believe that he will be a great president and guide our country out of the terrible spot our current president has put us in. I could go on but I'm not gonna, but all I wanted to say is that I now believe that Biden will be a good president, and I won't worry for the US if he is elected. I encourage you to go watch the speech, there's a few vids on YT of it.
