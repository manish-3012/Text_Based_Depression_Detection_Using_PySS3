Sometimes I tell someone Iâ€™m vegetarian and they try to brag about eating meat like Iâ€™m doing it for punishment There has never been a day in my life that I craved meat it was just something I ate until I completely lost taste for it. Some people even get offended like they created meat or something. Iâ€™m not telling you to not eat it or anything either I literally just donâ€™t like it donâ€™t be weird
