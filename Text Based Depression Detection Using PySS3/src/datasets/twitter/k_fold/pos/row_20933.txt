Big titty goth gf? Not yet. So I (NB, 15) like this girl (F, 16). We go to the same school and we're friends. As it happens, she is lesbian, and I think she probably thinks of me as male (I'm amab). This is kind of an obstacle. She's really cool, and I want to get to know her, I want to see her, I want to be with her. Covid is another obstacle. 

I asked her, and she says she only calls herself lesbian because she is primarily attracted to girls, but has been attracted to many genders. That was at least somewhat reassuring. I don't want to ruin the friendship, and I don't know if I should ask her out or something. *Sighs*
