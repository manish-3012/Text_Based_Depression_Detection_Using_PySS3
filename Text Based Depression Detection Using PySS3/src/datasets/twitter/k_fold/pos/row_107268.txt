I finally played Mario Kart with my father! Long story long, my father was busy with some projects at work, and as such we couldn't have a chance to sit down and play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe since I got it last Christmas. Today, he finally finished his project, and, to celebrate, we finally played the game together! I am honestly so happy!
