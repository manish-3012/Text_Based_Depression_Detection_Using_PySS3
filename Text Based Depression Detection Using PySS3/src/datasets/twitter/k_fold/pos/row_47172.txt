I had a good experience My mom and I are sleeping at her friendâ€™s house in a gated neighborhood, and like, people are so nice and there are dogs and cats everywhere itâ€™s heaven. But anyway we saw 2 adorable lil pups that I absolutely cherish. I was just hanging around with them cause they kept begging for pets and their owner came and my mom decided to start speaking to him so they spoke about the dogs and all. Then the ownerâ€™s son comes and!!! Absolute cutie!!!! I would hug. It was just 2 cute ass dogs and one cute ass small boy. Well I mean small but he is older and taller than me but by not much. Adorable pups and adorable boy. I would cuddle all 3. I donâ€™t need to say more it was amazing. And the best thing I saw tons of other cute dogs (5) and tons of cute cats and another cute boy I am in heaven
