Depressed and kinda heartbroken So I like this girl sheâ€™s really smart and Iâ€™m attracted to that for some reason and today we were playing CTF on the field and my team just made me be the defender and she was on the other team when she came over she asked me â€œwhy are you always the defenderâ€ well idk they just make me it and after that game when we were wrapping up I came into the group and she just moved over to the other side of it away from me. I donâ€™t think she likes me maybe even hates me might just give up.
