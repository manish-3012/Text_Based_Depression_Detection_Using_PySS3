My mom is crazy So I was in the kitchen talking to my mom and dad, when I went into my brothers room to see if his class had started.  He was just about to go into the zoom, and we started goofing around and my brother goes one decibel over my mom's tolerance, and she storms in the room, slaps me in the face, and said that she told me to be quiet.  First off no she didn't, and second why did she assume it was me?  I got upset at her, and asked her why she assumed it was me(she always is sweet on my brother). She got even more upset at me like "How dare he question my all-knowing authority!?", and she took my phone.  What should I do?
