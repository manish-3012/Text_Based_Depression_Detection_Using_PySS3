Do any of you actually like online school? Iâ€™m doing a survey for my psychology work, and Iâ€™m wondering if any of you who are enrolled genuinely enjoy online school. You donâ€™t need to prefer it over in-person school, but if you think that itâ€™s beneficial and/or helpful to the student, feel free to share
