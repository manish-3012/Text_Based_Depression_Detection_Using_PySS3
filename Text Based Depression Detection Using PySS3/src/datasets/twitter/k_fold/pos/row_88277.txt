I donâ€™t know if I should switch schools. I need advice. So I signed up for this early college program which basically means that I go to high school an extra year but I graduate with an associates degree. Sounds awesome right? Well only 50 students are allowed in for each year. Super small school, so itâ€™s very hard to meet new people. I was lucky enough to get in with my girlfriend at the time. Then she recently cheated on me with one of the guys there. She was basically my only motivation to want to stay there. None of my friends go there, and I donâ€™t like any of the other people that go there. But If I switch to normal high school then Iâ€™ll only have my junior and senior year to spend in actual high school. I feel like if I stay at this early college then Iâ€™ll live the rest of my high school days alone and bored. I canâ€™t think of any other reason to stay other than that Iâ€™d be throwing away a massive opportunity. I just want to be with my group of friends and go out and do normal teenage stuff.
