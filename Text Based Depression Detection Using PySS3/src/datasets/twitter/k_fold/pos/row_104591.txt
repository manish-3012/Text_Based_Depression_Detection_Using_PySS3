Iâ€™m annoyed so APPARENTLY I misunderstood my dad when he said "no Fortnite during the school week" and actually means no online games during the school week so now I only have 1 hour a day except on Friday and the weekend. I mean really? Those were his exact words. Feel free to diss me for playing Fortnite but Idc. Iâ€™m just super pissed
