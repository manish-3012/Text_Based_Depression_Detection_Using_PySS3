Idea: We all should post the things that happened to us this year on 31st! I mean, a text post on how are we different from last year, how our looks and personalities have changed. What our last growth sprut did to us. Best and worst things happend this year.

It would be a good way to leave any bad shit out of our mind before entering 2021 and sharing our happiness.
After all, we are a community of people who are constatnly changing year by year to become a better or a worse person.
I think mods should ban picture posts on 31st december and add a flair for these kinds of posts exclusive to that day.

If you like my idea then please make sure it reaches to the mods and other people too.
