IT'S AN EMERGENCY!!! (not really) ok so i shouldnt have done this guys now idk what to do!!!

background story: when i was fourteen 8 met this boy on kik who was also 14. so we started texting and after a week thought we would be a good match so then he was my bf. but of course it didnt last long at all. but from time to time i think of him?? and i dont know how to get it to stop. i don't think of him a lot but when i do it's in a way where i feel like i want to reach out. so i tried when i was 15 or 16 (i forgot tbh). but he kinda hurt my feelings when he said he forgot i existed so i just left it. went this whole time not thinking about him.

but last night i thought of him and really wanted to reach out. i dont want to be his gf just like a friend way. i mean we were 14 and dumb. i dont even remember why we broke up. but yeah. i figured i shouldn't try again bc he forgot me. but it made sense bc we hadnt talked in so long. but anyway i was telling my friend last night i dont know what to do to forget him or feeling like wanting to talk, he said maybe i SHOULD reach out. i was like nah... ok maybe... ok i did. so i texted him "yo?"

I DIDNT THINK HE WOULD REPLY (i texted on kik). and i just started to feel embarrassed so i was like im just gonna delete this idc. but i just woke up to him replying "hello?".

me: "ðŸ˜…"

him: ":S"

i dont know what to do guys. what do i do?? should i just not reply? will i seem stalkerish? i texted him on the same account we texted on but its just been so long. plus my username is the cringy ". ." LOL. omg yall. IDK WHAT TO DO??
