Quick rant and question Ok so like this is out of no where but is it weird to like genuinely think your boyfriend might be the man you wanna marry even if youâ€™re just a teen? Like I know Iâ€™m young but this man is perfect! I could see us working in the future and I mean heâ€™s said the same thing! Weâ€™ve been together about 11 months and things have practically gone completely smooth. A few bumpy road moments but a lot of them were my fault and he forgave me! So like long story short am I to young to be in love???
