I feel like a different person everyday I don't really know why and I don't think anyone notices because I'm mostly alone at home.

But I fell it and it fells weird being a slightly different person everyday.

I really hope it stays like that and doesn't get worse. Idk if I should asks for help but even if I do I probably won't be able to get it.

I'm just scared I'll do something horrible one day.
