Any religion where the only way you can get to heaven is if a believer can convince you that their God exists is morally and conventionally wrong. There are thousands of gods that people believe in with all their heart. If the only way that you can obtain heaven is through the word of others, how can you ever be sure that you're picking the right one?


The truth is, everyone is more likely to pick the God that they were first introduced too. Whether it be Allah, Shiva, Buddha, Brahma, Ganesha, etc... None of them depend on proof. They're all based on a book and the belief of others. If for some reason I created my own Bible and my own God, I have the chance to influence the belief of everyone around me and create my own religion (it's been done - - see Latter-day Saints).


The only God I would ever believe in is one that provides proof on it's own and doesn't depend on other humans to spread his word. 


Theists always say that they have experienced a miracle and that's why they believe, but without that introduction of a God via someone else then it would remain just that - - an unexplained scientific miracle. 


Humans are objectively unreliable. We see things that aren't there. Our brains can trick us into believing ANYTHING by misfiring some neurons. Our thoughts and actions are almost completely dependent on the expirences we had growing up. Why would an all powerful and all-loving God damn us to hell for not trusting the word of others? 


If he wants to be worshipped and the only way to send us to heaven is to worship him, SHOW PROOF. I guarantee every single human on earth would get on their knees. It seems like what these gods really want is for us to be able to be indoctrinated by other humans, and that is morally questionable, and just goes completely against the idea of free will and human's instinct to avoid being held down by chains.


Just my 2 cents.
