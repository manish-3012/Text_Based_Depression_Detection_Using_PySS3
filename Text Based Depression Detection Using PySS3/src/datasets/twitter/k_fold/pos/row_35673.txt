I Like Not Getting Compliments As a guy who doesnâ€™t get compliments from anyone outside of my family, Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that Iâ€™d rather not get any compliments over constantly getting them because if a girl (or guy) gives me a compliment who isnâ€™t related to me that means WAYYY more than just a bunch of people saying it if they donâ€™t mean it.
