i simply CANNOT survive living in this house anymore :))) itâ€™s not like my parents are crazy abusive or anything but basically shits happened in the past and my whole relationship with both of them is fucked. just fucked fr. idk the whole family is kinda fucked up but thatâ€™s not the point. my sister got tired of it and moved across the whole country so now itâ€™s just me and my little brother and my parents. i cant fucking take it. i donâ€™t have friends here so iâ€™m fucking bored all the time and my girlfriend lives 258 miles away and i miss her so much. i cant even get my license bc of my mom so seeing her is so hard. iâ€™m so happy when iâ€™m with her and away from this house and my family but iâ€™m stuck here and i feel like iâ€™m slowly dying. partly cause iâ€™m so mind numbingly bored and also cause iâ€™m not the best at using healthy coping skills lmao

anyway i donâ€™t actually know why the fuck i wrote this but if u actually read this or care at all then idk just thank you. most of the time it really feels like no one does. i donâ€™t want sympathy or whatever iâ€™m just stuck rn
