I need your help Hi, I'm doing a job for math class, it consists of doing a [survey about video games](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXy3ujlXj9oy-fduXaNmYDSmzl6lv7sshODqZoy8NLmxSzqA/viewform?usp=sf_link) in Spanish

It will not ask for personal information like gmail, only age and gender (You can lie) 

I would appreciate if you answered this since I do not have many friends to send them the survey

I do not care if you answer randomly although I would appreciate if you would repeat the survey 2 times or more since I will get a better score.
