I'm so fucking tired So, I had an exam that I had to do by 8 am this morning. So I stayed up late last night binge watching lecture recordings so the info would be fresh in my brain then took the exam at like 1 am. I didnt get to sleep til 3 am. I thought thatd be fine tho cause I thought I'd be able to sleep in this morning. Apparently not. I woke up at 6 am from my sister pounding on the bathroom door. Apparently she was having really bad cramps and she was throwing up so she wanted me to get her water and ibuprofen and stuff. So, I did all that for her. This was literally only 3 hours after I'd initially fallen asleep

So, yeah, im tired af rn. Thank god most of my finals were yesterday
