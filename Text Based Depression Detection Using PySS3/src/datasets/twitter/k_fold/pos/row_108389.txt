What do I do I want antidepressants because I have tried everything else and none of it worked but I don't want to tell my parents I want antidepressants because they will take away my only coping mechanism; my computer, because they think that my computer is bad for me, but it's keeping me alive man. After that my depression would take hold and most likely I would attempt suicide. I need something else. NOTHING I do makes me happy anymore, and if it does my brain tells me to be guilty about being happy because I don't deserve it and then I feel sad and empty again. I would give up pretty much anything other than my family to be dead.
