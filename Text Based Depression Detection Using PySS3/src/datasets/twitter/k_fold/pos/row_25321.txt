I come from the future to share a fond memory of what was essentially a meme from when I was a teenager on the internet. https://youtu.be/RLjBCqeYYas

It was a simpler time, but this was one of the first viral videos around the internet. Back when a video like this would be directly downloaded from a link for the most part, as streaming wasnâ€™t really a thing. 

Iâ€™m making this post because I heard Moskau Moskau was back, or was recently. That song/video falls into the same category as Aicha as seen above, but to watch the video you had to find the link through a search engine, usually on a random website although sometimes on a more popular site like ebaums world.

But yeah! I thought it was crazy interesting and wanted to share how far things have come.
