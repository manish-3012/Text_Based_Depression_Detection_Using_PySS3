You know when you wake up one day and feel super happy out of nowhere? It helped me get my crush to like me. So one day I woke up and was like (damn, I donâ€™t feel like shit today), and texted my crush. Weâ€™ve had this feeling of flirt and itâ€™s kinda upsetting if you flirting with someone and donâ€™t know if they like you too. So I texted her and got into a chill conversation with her and near the end, asked her if she likes me? She said not anymore. This means I was an appealing human male a few months before quarantine. I see this as a win.

I know this story line is all over the place but I think it should be noted that this isnâ€™t English class so Iâ€™m going to rebel against the system and not say shit like â€œher aroma was exquisite and would perambulate processionallyâ€.
