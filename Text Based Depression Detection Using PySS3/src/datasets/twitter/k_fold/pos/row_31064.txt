A little bit of payback:3 Hello guys! So I have this friend of mine who loves streaming a LOTTT. He likes to play games like minecraft, stardew valley, spellbreak and stuff. Sometimes, he's a bit frustrated bc of his views and it seems that the growth is a bit slower than usual so I want to help him out :) He always tells me how badly he want to be a successful streamer and I see how passionate he is about it so I want to show some gratitude how grateful I am to have him. Months back, I am literally thinking of ending things. And then he came to my life and suddenly, he made things a little less lonely for me:D he's been there for me through the lowest part of my life, and I want to thank him so much for making me realize that I am not alone anymore. He saved me. So, this is the least thing I can do for him :3 if you have time you can go check out his twitch and help me show my gratitude for him. It reallyyy means a lot to me :D [twitch here](https://www.twitch.tv/jellyvish404?sr=a)
