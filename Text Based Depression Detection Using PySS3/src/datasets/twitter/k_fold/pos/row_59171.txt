Anyone else find the "14 year old white girl" archetype kind of uncomfortable? No, racial teasing is not a bad thing. I am not here to pretend I am some preacher and y'all are just bigoted assholes. As long as it's not mean spirited in nature, I don't mind it.

However, the memes about white girls being shallow, SJW's, thots, fake deep, and boring rub me the wrong way in ways I'm not sure how to describe. Anyone else feel this way?
