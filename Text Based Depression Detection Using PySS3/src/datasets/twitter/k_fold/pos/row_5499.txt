Is it intimate that when I was in elementary school, me and my friend (both 10 year old boys) used to physically lift and carry each other for fun in each other's arms? Like we would physically pick each other up for fun. Whenever my friend   would lift me, he would tell me "I carried you!". What do you think  about this? Is carrying someone in your arms considered close/intimate?  What would go through your mind if you saw 2 10 year boys carrying each  other?
