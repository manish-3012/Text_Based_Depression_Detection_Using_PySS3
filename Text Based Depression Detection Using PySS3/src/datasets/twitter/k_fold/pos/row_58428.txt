I got into a car crash today. I was driving to help out my cousin and I tried turning left but didnâ€™t notice a lady coming from another street that merges into mine. When I did notice her it was too late and hit her almost head on. Since she had the right of way my insurance wonâ€™t cover my car costs so I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna repair it. The other ladyâ€™s car is totalled but we are both ok, not a single scratch.
