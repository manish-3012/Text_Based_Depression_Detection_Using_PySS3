Roald Dahl books were the best I used to be book obsessed when I was little (mainly 2nd-5th grade, I still read but not nearly as much). I was thinking about roald Dahl books (he wrote the witches, Matilda, James and the giant peach, Charlie and the chocolate factory, and many more) I know I read the witches again last year because why not and it was still so good (I've probably read it at least 5 times). Idk why there was just something magical about those books. Y'all read those too right?
