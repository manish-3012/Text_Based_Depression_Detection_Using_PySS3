I think I might have a brain injury Everytime I'm at the doctor I bring up a fight that I had in 7th grade where I got hit in the head pretty hard my mom always inrupts me and it's been 2 years since it's not been treated I can barely walk now and I have trouble thinking and solving math problems I think I'm going to die if it's serious I feel nausea and and have horrible headaches I guess I'm just going to die young if I do I would want say goodbye to everyone before I go
