How do I sneak out (strict parents) ? Help please!! I just want sneak out and maybe go to a park/bar,  have a walk/drive,  look at stars or something of that sort, nothing crazy but my parents are strict af , I have grills on all the windows of my house and I just want to get fresh breath once in a while... I live in a gated community and security do make rounds around the place(midnight) and it's not that easy to get out cuz security really does check who is going out and in and I could get in serious trouble(the security also kinda know my face) . I want to use the 2 wheeler in my house but I ain't got the guts...and don't really have friends to help me and do shit with so yeah... Help me out please !!
