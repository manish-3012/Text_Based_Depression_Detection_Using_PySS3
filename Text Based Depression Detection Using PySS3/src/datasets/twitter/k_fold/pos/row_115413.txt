I want a pet :( but my parents said no Bruh I am in desperate need of a doggo or a catto (â•¥ï¹â•¥) it's close to day 170 of quarantine and it's been a rollercoaster I don't wanna be on. The stress from school and college is killing me and bringing back the past mental issues. I have started to lose my temper like I used to back in middle school.
