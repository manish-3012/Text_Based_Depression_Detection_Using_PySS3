Do I really owe my parents an apology? My step father, me,(high schooler) and my mother where debating. He thinks people of color are in the situation they are in because they are lazy, and just not good people. He stereotyped the entire race, and proceeded to argue his point, not even showing a glimpse of consideration. 
Now in the car today, I made a joke, and said "what if he's not really a white racist male, and he's secretly a drag queen and that's why my clothes have been going missing", obviously a joke, and he's been pissed. 
My mom told me in person, and on text, that what I called him was 'disrespectful', and I shouldn't call him names because he's a 'parent' figure. 
I shot back saying, if he doesn't want to be called a racist, he shouldn't be racist. 
I'm under fire here guys by my racist parents lmao
Should I apologize just to get it over with, or should I stay strong?
