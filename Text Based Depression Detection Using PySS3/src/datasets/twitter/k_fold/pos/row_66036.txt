I feel like I'm deceiving people online It's not that serious, but I feel kind of guilty/responsible.

&amp;#x200B;

I use twitch regularly - I don't stream but I watch a variety of streamers. Music streams, gaming streams, art streams, the like.

The problem is that I am very anonymous online, and don't reveal my age. Obviously, I'm a minor so I figured that it would be safer to be ambiguous when using social media. I thought it was a good idea until I started being more invested in certain streamer communities.

A lot of the streamers I watch are technically family friendly, but it's members are full of adults. I won't say who the streamer is, but I follow a music streamer on twitch, and their community is full of 30-50 year olds (an estimate). The content is more "boomer" and tailored to older souls but I like the streams because it gives me comfort, and I enjoy the variety of songs.

Since it's a small community, and because I am a regular on the streams, the streamer and it's community recognises my username. I've recently started participating in discord movie nights, where we watch a movie and discuss a bit afterwards. I don't use my voice, I just type in the chat, and the adults make jokes, swear, etc, which is fine by me. Thing is, if I mention I'm a minor, that will cause discomfort in the community. 

I feel like I'm lying and everyone is treating me like I'm an adult. It's a minor issue but it leaves guilt in my gut, and it kinda taints the experience.

I've considered coming clean, or just disappearing, but I don't really want to put myself away from the kind people. I also don't know whether omitting the fact that I'm a minor is unethical or untrustworthy. Honestly I shouldn't care as much as I do, but I can't help myself from stressing about this.

Anyways, I wanted to get that off my chest.
