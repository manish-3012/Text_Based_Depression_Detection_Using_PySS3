Hey guys wanna hate on a piece of literal garbage cuz same On December 3rd, Russian streamer ReeFlay (real name Stanislav Reshetnikov), age 30, directly caused his pregnant girlfriends death because he was given $1000 to do so.

ReeFlay had forced 28 year-old Valentina Grigoryeva outside in nothing but her underwear in Sub-Zero temperatures. She was in early stages of pregnancy at the time. When she was let back in, viewers noted that she looked visibly dead, one even contacting emergency services. ReeFlay continued on with the stream, with Valentina lying on the couch dying behind him.

Even after realizing she was dying, he continued streaming for another two hours. She was pronounced dead on the scene.

Although it was first thought she'd died of hypothermia, it was later discovered she had died to a blow to the head he dealt earlier that day.

ReeFlay is currently facing 15 years in prison
