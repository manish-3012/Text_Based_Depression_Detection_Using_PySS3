My unrealistic Christmas List There's only one thing I want...

A healthy, long lasting relationship. 

I want to have that kind of relationship where I'm like another kid to her parents. One wear we can do everything together; she wants to go to the apple orchard in the fall or the beach in the summer? Whatever. 

Someone I can tell every story, secret and memory to. Someone who will enjoy them and my enthusiasm. I want something where I don't have to even think about her possibly leaving or finding excuses. This is cringy, I know. It's the truth tho. There's so many ways further I could describe what I want but enough said. 

Fuck the PS5 or whatever we kids want these days. It's all I want.
