I hate my life So this week has been very shitty, and Ive had lots of bad weeks.


I donâ€™t even know what to do anymore 


The son of my moms best friend snitched on me for helping him. 

I hurt my moms relationship with her 

My parents found out Iâ€™m vaping

I have nobody to talk to at all 

I have been banned from going out on my bike, to the the basketball courts, anywhere really without parental advisory. 


I have no electronics anymore, besides a TV that doesnâ€™t barely work. 




I feel so fucking alone and honestly if I didnâ€™t have family and friends Iâ€™d kill myself right now. I feel like such a fucking failure, hell I am a failure. 


Everything I do always comes back to kick me in the face. 

My parents are fucking angry at me and I mean very angry.

Even trying to explain that vaping isnâ€™t harmful in moderation, they believe the mediaâ€™s bullshit on how horrible it is. 


(Before you go off on me for vaping, I wanted to cope with stress and I wanted to build up a nicotine tolerance so I wouldnâ€™t be tempted to use cigarettes because a bunch of kids in my group smoke.) 



I just donâ€™t know what to do, help me.

The loneliness is killing me.
