Snapchat My Eyes Only Is anybody elseâ€™s snapchat my eyes only filled with their random rants about weird shit such as: Tv shows, movies, books or music?Cos if anyone went through mine it would just be me fangirling or yelling at myself and itâ€™s kind of embarrassing to look back at. I just apparently have very strong opinions on things that I need to let out in my own private place. Does anybody else do this or am I just a weirdo?
