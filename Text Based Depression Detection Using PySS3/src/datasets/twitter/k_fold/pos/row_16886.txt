Help! Wisdom Teeth problems? So um, I donâ€™t know where to post, I think my wisdom teeth are growing. No tooth has erupted yet. But, the 2nd molar at the right bottom side is looking weird. You know how the back side of that tooth (the side facing the throat) is covered with the gums. Now the gums is separating from that tooth and thereâ€™s a gap... Not much blood. Doesnâ€™t hurt. But holy crap this scared me.
My mom and I donâ€™t want to go to the dentist because of the coronavirus thing.
