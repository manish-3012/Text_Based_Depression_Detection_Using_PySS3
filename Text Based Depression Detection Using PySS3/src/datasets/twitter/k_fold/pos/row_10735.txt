I faked being sick to get out of school early and ended up missing Homecoming. I ended up missing homecoming game today trying to skip school. I faked throwing up and made the mistake telling the school council that I did it. They called my dad who is super serious about the whole disease thing (since he has a immunity condition). I had to go to a hospital to get tested and found out I wont be getting results until the next friday because they need to be tested in a lab in Texas (Mind you I live in Michigan). So now i'll end up missing homecoming, some slob on my knob, and instead be stuck at home for a week waiting for results I might not even get. Free week off of school tho. So, uh.. Do whatever redditors do and give me gold and karma n shit.
