I was expecting a normal day today... I woke up in the morning and got into my daily routine. I got up, had a shower and made myself breakfast.

I then grabbed my iPhone, my r/teenagers wallpaper shining bright under the morning sun. I opened Reddit and instantly went to my favourite subreddit, r/teenagers. It took a while for my internet to load. As I saw Redditâ€™s blue circle spinning round and round, my anticipation for seeing the quality content present in r/teenagers began to rise. And then my internet loaded, which changed my life forever.

#OFFICIAL r/TEENAGERS MERCH DROP!

This was the first thing I saw. I immediately dropped my phone and began hyperventilating. It took a few minutes to calm down, but I still get goosebumps thinking about how many virtual Reddit doors had opened up for me.

I grabbed my credit card. And then with my heartbeat soaring, I ordered everything on the site. I received a receipt in my e-mail shortly after. The feeling that the mod team behind r/teenagers had sent me a RECEIPT for their official r/teenagers merch made me cry tears of joy. I printed it out at a rapid paste and stuck it to my wall.

I am the #1 r/teenagers fan in the world. I have the subâ€™s official logo tattooed on my chest and one time a mod for the subreddit said â€œGood meme!!â€ when referring to my classic 2018 meme, which harshly criticised Instagram Fortnite normies.

I was not expecting the life-changing experience that occurred for me this morning. But here we are and I am feeling truly enlightened by todayâ€™s events.

If thereâ€™s one thing I want you to take out of this post, itâ€™s to never give up and follow your dreams. Thank you so much for reading you reading you so reading me thank thank me you read r/teenagers moderatore rafikebwocnekdbwkidbns
