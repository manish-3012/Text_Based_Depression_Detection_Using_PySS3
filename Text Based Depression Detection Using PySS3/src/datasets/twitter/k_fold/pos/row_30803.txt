My main problem is I NEVER ask help I'm working on that but it's probably my biggest flaw (besides my ass being so lazy): I hate not undestanding thing by myself, probably I'm too prideful so I don't EVER ask for help in ANYTHING even if that means failing a test

And i get so nervous when i can't figure out stuff omg
