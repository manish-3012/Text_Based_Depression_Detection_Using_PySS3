Dear Reddit mods of r/teenagers Dear Reddit mods of r/teenagers 

What is wrong with your bots I almost got ban for no reason but u/Moizsh10 I was unbanned and the post was back up. Incident one I posted a pic of Patrick stars butt and it got deleted, I did not care it was deleted I just wanted to know why so I got in contact with u/Moizsh10 again and he said the reason my post was banned was because it did not relate to â€œteenagers or teenage lifeâ€if thatâ€™s what my post gets blocked for you might as well get rid of the meme flare because half of the memes are sh*t post just like mine that get 1000x more likes and get away with it. Incident 2 This happen just today I posted about my day and get got deleted by the bot and I uploaded it again with nothing to do with Reddit and it still got deleted for the same thing. If you want justice contact u/Moizsh10 because he is the only mod Iâ€™ve talked to. I do not condone harassing and spamming at u/Moizsh10 as that is against the rules. Please respond #justiceforthemanes
