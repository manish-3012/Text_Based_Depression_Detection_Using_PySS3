My (18) girlfriendâ€™s teacher keeps wrongfully accusing her of plagiarism and now she is on probation. HELP My girlfriend and I just recently started college and she had some reservations about college in the first place so I was hoping it would be a good experience but now that everything has been online it has made everything worse.

She took a college level Bio class in our home state and because she changed states the credit didnâ€™t transfer so she had to take the class again. We both came from a college-prep school so we are both used to the level of work expected so itâ€™s confusing hearing that her bio teacher has already accused her of plagiarism three times.

The first instance was over and essay directly explaining the negative effects of plagiarism, ironic right? And her teacher said directly to her â€œthis doesnâ€™t really sound like your writingâ€ even though it was the first writing assignment of the entire semester. 

The other two instances were over small pieces of information that she knew beforehand (having taken Bio the year prior) and so she didnâ€™t see a need to add an in-text citation because she learned it in class. She still had an entire works cited where the rest of the each project referenced, it was just for two small pieces of info. 

Her teacher either doesnâ€™t believe her students are capable of higher level thinking and understanding or has it out for my girlfriend directly, with no motivation. 
As of this morning she received an email saying a hold was placed on her academic record with no explanation as to why and no way to contact the office  before the work week to resolve it. 

What should she do? Itâ€™s so early in the semester that she doesnâ€™t want to deal with this teacher the whole year but itâ€™s already past the time to drop classes.
