How do I get my dad to let me play shooter games Hello, I am a 15 year old who is it allowed to play any kind of violent video games. I really don't understand my dads reasoning. He always says that "it'll make you violent and want to shoot somebody." I have made countless arguments against this and he just won't listen. I just wanna know what I should tell him.
