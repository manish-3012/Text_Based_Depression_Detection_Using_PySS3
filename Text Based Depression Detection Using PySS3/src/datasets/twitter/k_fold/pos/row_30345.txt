Writing something positive about my day , day #393 and #392 Yesterday I cleaned my desk and idk it felt better afterwards 

Today I got the day off school because itâ€™s Taipusam so I got to sleep in and stuff. Did some more crochet today and I would have been able to finish off my current project (itâ€™s an elephant) but I ran out of the right colour of yarn
