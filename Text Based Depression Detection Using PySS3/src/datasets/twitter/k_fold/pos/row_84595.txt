Anyone remember how these rhymes go? Thereâ€™s these rhymes... one that I was so proud of myself for being able to say it so fast was like something somethingâ€” and he landed on a great big marshmallow and bounced all the way to maxi o and he parked on grannyâ€™s toe
Or something like that. Could anyone help?

Also thereâ€™s this hand clap that went tic-tac-toe, gimme a high, gimme a low, gimme a three in a row and I remember thereâ€™s another line but Iâ€™m not sure. Plez anyone?? 

Thank you so much!!! ðŸ™ðŸ»
