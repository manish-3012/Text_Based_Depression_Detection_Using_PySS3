Verbally abusive dad My father is a man who constantly verbally and occasionally physically abuses my younger brother (11). Heâ€™s more of a verbally abusive man (constantly screaming slamming (making noise until my brother cries)) it never stops until my brother accepts heâ€™s wrong and tells my dad he was right. 
For example my brother was told to empty the dishwasher and he exhaled from his nose (how I respond as well) and my father responded by yelling at him for the next 20 minutes and calling him disrespectful
Nothing heâ€™s done is technically a crime (to my knowledge) but I donâ€™t know what to do here
