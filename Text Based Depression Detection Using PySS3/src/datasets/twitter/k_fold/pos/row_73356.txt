I wrote some lyrics , I donâ€™t even know what they are . Its just to write out my feelings I donâ€™t even  know why Iâ€™m here /
Why am I here , what is my purpose/
Is there something beneath the surface /
Of this magnificent plan , that is just falling apart /



Everything just gets worse/
Everything I thought I could trust just breaks down to dust /
I l give everything I have to try make me happy/
But then I look back Iâ€™m just more angry /
I lose myself every single day /
Havenâ€™t found it still but I lose it again /



So why Iâ€™m here , /
Why do I feel like this is a waste /
Why I have everything I want but /
I still feel like I need something else /
I got my cards to build my deck /
Threw them away  so I just fucked up /
Again all by myself /
Why canâ€™t I do I single thing that does /
Push me ahead , instead of just digging my grave /



Is this path really gonna put me in a stage /
But again if I look to the people up there /
They all want to kill themselves /
So what do I do to save myself /
When every path is a dead end /
How do I feel like this is fine /
When everything I do is wasted time /
And itâ€™s ironic that Iâ€™m wasting time/
To write this rhymes /
about precisely wasting time/
