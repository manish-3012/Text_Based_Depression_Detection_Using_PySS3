does anyone else want a bf but are rlly awkward and guys in your school only wanna hookup but i want more than that i want an actual fucking relationship like i dont think im ugly i mean my weight is ok and im not really really insecure (well i am but im not that bitch who constanly reminds everyone that she thinks shes ugly and fat) but guys only see my looks and completly disregard my personality. like whenever i start talking to a guy i like and i tell him i like him all of a sudden he gets rlly sexual and starts trying to kiss me and shit LIKE WTF ! and when i pull away he gets mad and ignores so yeah if u didnt already realise my life is great. btw i dont have anything against guys just the guys who are assholes :)
