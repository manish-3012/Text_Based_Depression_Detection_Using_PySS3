really sad interaction at work a man and his teenage son were leaving the store. the man says â€œFUCK DEMOCRATS. *to me* are you a democrat? *no response* well if you are, FUCK YOUâ€ then he storms out of the store. his son looks down at his feet and waits for a second until his dad leaves and then he says â€œ...im sorry...â€ and then walks out. i feel so horrible for this kid, he clearly hates his dad :((((((((((

btw i didnâ€™t respond to the guy cuz i am a democrat and if i said yes: might get assaulted on the spot. if i said no: iâ€™d be lying and i didnâ€™t want his appraisal. if i said nothing: its a safe bet
