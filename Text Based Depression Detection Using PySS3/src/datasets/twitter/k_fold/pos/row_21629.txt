Whatâ€™s the point? So recently I have been thinking probably a bit to hard and I thought, if we are being honest why do we go on in life just to live most of us under the control of other people in our jobs and some are free to live under their own rule but is that really being free because you still have set things and stuff you are required to do. Another topic is like why do we even try what do we accomplish if we do well the opportunity to do better, to accomplish more? I personally donâ€™t believe in it but I feel like the people that are going to be best off is the people that believe in some sort of god and after life and praise it because if you think about it if there is some kind of afterlife that lasts forever what does this life matter why not spend this one trying to secure a better afterlife if it even exists and if it doesnâ€™t why bother trying. This next part may make me seem suicidal and I donâ€™t really know if I am or not but why do we live so we can what, Iâ€™m sorry if this hasent crossed anyone elseâ€™s mind but I feel like literally not existing would be better then this place and I personally know people that have it way worse than me and I would like to apologies to those people and congratulate you guys on keeping going but I just donâ€™t know how you guys find motivation and keep going when there are things like suicide which will always be in the back of my mind and sometimes front and I feel like many others as well. Thanks for reading idk anymore sorry if this brought your moods down a bit or confused you or anything and if so just keep scrolling and ignore this.
I will probably be editing this if there is a common answer to one of the things I said or replying to individual comments for other things.
