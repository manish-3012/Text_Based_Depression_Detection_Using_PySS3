bye asf i dont wanna go back to school soooo school's tomorrow (in 10 hours) and i have a double period of IT and electronics and those classes are really scary for me bc im the only girl in them. OH AND PERIOD ONE GEOGRAPHY FUCK U MISS MARLEY. Also ive been falling over a lot and like swaying everywhere recently cuz im so dizzy and last week i fell over after trying to pick up a pen i dropped and thats shits embarrassing.

literally the only class i can enjoy is maths because its easy, its small, its quiet and the view is really pretty. It's just filling in questions passively while listening to music or thinking of random stuff and its weirdly peaceful.

thanks for attending my meaningless rant : )
