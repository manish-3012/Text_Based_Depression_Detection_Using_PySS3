Soo I probably know the answer already but I would like some thoughts Backstory:

I am 17m and havenâ€™t done ANYTHING romantic/sexual beforehand.

I asked out a girl, she said yes. We had an amazing date, drinking coffee and walking around town afterwards. That was a whole evening

Second date: same drinking some coffee in town and afterwards some Netflix at my place and my first kiss! She left at like 2:30 in the evening.

So I guess sheâ€™s pretty much into me, but who knows?


Question:

Iâ€™ve always taken the initiative so far, as I should, I wanted to date her. (By initiative I mean starting conversations and such) Now weâ€™ve agreed on watching the ending of ATLA together, I recommended it to her and sheâ€™s watched two seasons in one week. We havenâ€™t picked out a date yet.

So, should I wait for her to say sheâ€™s ready and wait for her to ask us to hang out again? Or should I still take initiative by asking if sheâ€™s ready? I mean sheâ€™s probably gone through most of the third season already.


Hopefully you can make sense of this and share your opinion!
