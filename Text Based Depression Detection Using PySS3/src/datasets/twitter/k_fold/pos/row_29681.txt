Imma delete this after, but I need advice This girl, me and her, we are basically identical, we love the same stuff talk the same way play the same games and we chat basically every day, and sheâ€™s just amazing, and I felt she had feelings for me, her friends would always say we would be a great couple and so would mine, so I thought I should shoot my shot and it was a *no* and I genuinely have no idea why, she could tell I was upset and did her best to make sure I was okay, but she literally said â€œIâ€™m sorry, but I donâ€™t have feelings for you.â€ Like, what?? I hate to sound cocky but Iâ€™m just so confused. The advice Iâ€™m looking for is, what should I do? I 1000% cannot get over her, but I will also struggle to hide my feelings Around her.
