I have a problem with my nose. So I am a 14 year old boy and I kind of have a small nose upturned nose. What's even weirder is that my parents and literally everyone else in my family has a normal big "nose". I read online that noses usually grow so it true that when I am 20 or something , my nose will grow to a normal size!

Please tell me if you have experience with this.
