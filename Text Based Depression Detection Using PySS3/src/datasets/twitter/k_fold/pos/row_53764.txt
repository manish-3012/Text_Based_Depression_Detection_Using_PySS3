First relationship ended I'm 15 and I'm an introvert who's moved 3 times and can't talk to people at all. Corona happened and I was stuck at home doing nothing. I started playing Minecraft on a server playing bedwars. Met this person who I played with for 2 weeks when I leave to go eat, I come back to find they found more people to play with and wanted me to meet them. The people were 2 girls, (one was 18 and one was 16). I met them both and we got to know each other. I joined a discord server who my ex owned (16 year old) and got into a voice chat. We agreed to pull and all nighter because we could and we wanted to. And in that night people on her server joined the voice chat and they started to talk about birthdays. Then she says "if anyone can guess my birthday, I'll share a lewd photo of me" That was supposed to be a red flag but my hormones got the best of me and didn't realize it. I found out that she lives in Chicago and I live in Cali.



Fast forward some time and I start to mention how beautiful she looks and we start to flirt and tells me how nice it would be to meet and kiss, cuddle and cute stuff like that. I really liked her at this point and I didn't want to mention her as a friend so I didn't mess anything up with her in the process. 


Some days later we're all playing like normal and then she just leaves out of the blue. I didn't think much and the 18 year old says not to worry she's just upset. Later on instagram she sends me "I'm not coming back, It's just not working out" I'm confused and hurt that she left. She unfriends me on discord too. I reply with that I'm confused on why she left and if she leaves that's on her, can't stop her, I let her know she's hurting more than she knows. 


I can follow up with more it's just turning way too long and I want to hear people's opinions first. Sorry for the long text and if parts were confusing!
