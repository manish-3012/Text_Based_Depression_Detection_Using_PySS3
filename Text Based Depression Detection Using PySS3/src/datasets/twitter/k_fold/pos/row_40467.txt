I need advice on a relationship I (16M) have liked this girl for a while. I gathered the courage to text her and it went well, over the course of weeks we texted daily. She confessed later that she liked me and I told her that I liked her for a while. The problem is that I don't think I can be in a relationship with her. My parents have a strict no-dating policy. As much as I like her, I don't want to make my parents mad because I have earned their trust over the years. I wanna tell her this but idk how to even begin.
