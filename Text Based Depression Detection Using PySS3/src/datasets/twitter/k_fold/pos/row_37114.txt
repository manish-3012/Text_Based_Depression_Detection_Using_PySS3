People out there be catching COVID while Iâ€™m over here catching feelings La di da di da, let me make a poem about my feelings.


Water flows about,

No hesitation at all, 

Like my love for you.

And hereâ€™s another:

The sun rises, so blissful and golden
Such as the beauty of yourself
To shin in the awakening sunlight
Much like the awakening of my love for you...
It comes off as lovely and beautiful 
But deep down, it is flaming and uncontrollable.

Thank you for reading, this is my first time writing poetry, I love you no homo. unlessðŸ˜??
