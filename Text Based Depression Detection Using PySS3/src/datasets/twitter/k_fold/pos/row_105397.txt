Hello fellow teens, I want to tell you something. The world needs to understand this, help the message spread. Iâ€™m autistic, I need to share some good things to know about the condition.

Many special ed classes try to make autistic people fake being a neurotypical, thatâ€™s not good. **(Donâ€™t blame the special ed teachers, blame it on the school system.)**

#Autistic people are not good at tone of voice/text, sometimes they say nice/neutral things but they come off as â€œrudeâ€

I hate being told to learn to make eye contact or to use more body language.

Autistic people donâ€™t have a unique â€œLookâ€, itâ€™s neurological.

Please donâ€™t be offended on my behalf.

MOST IMPORTANTLY: 

#^Autism ^acceptance &gt; ^Autism ^awareness
