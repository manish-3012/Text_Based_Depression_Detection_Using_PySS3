I'm uninstalling Reddit. Honestly, reddit, for all the interesting stuff it has on it, has not done any favors for my productivity or my mental health. It seems that everywhere I look on reddit is another reminder about how the whole world is fucked up, and honestly, I'm sick of it. I'm still probably going to be on the r/teenagers discord server occasionally, but as for reddit, I'm done. See y'all later, stay safe, and remember to vibe.
