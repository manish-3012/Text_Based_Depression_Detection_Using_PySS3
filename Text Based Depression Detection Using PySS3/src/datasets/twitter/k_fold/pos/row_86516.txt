Am i overreacting so my friend had an epilepic seziure yesterday at school.I was with her till ambulance came to take her to the hospital. It was so horrifing. I was texting my other friend today and she asked if i was with this girl while she was having a seziure i said yes  and she literally replied NICE. i'm just disgusted. I had a nightmare about yesterday and started crying in the middle of the night. I told her about the nightmare bc i trust ger but she once again rrplied NICE.I know seizure isn't that bad but it was just so horrifing seeing her there (sorry for any mistakes ,english isn't my first language)
