Ello everyone Do you need more explaining im just saying hi. What? You don't know what hi means. Hi is a shortened version of the word hello . Hello is a word you use to greet people like that dead corpse on the floor say hi to it. What? Your scared... Just because its a corpse doesn't mean it will haunt you forever if you say something to it
