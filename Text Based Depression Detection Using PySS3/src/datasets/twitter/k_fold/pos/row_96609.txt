I hate to be like this It was senior skip day and my best friend ignored my calls all day. Apparently she had blocked me the night before. (We were fighting but we had made up and then she blocked me?) I felt alone the whole day. She hung out with people all day. I stayed home because everyone made plans and no one felt like cluing me in after asking almost everyone in my contacts. My best friend and I fought about it after she finally unblocked me. She â€œneeded a day without meâ€ and hung out with people who are also my friends. I have extreme fomo and itâ€™s happened twice now that Iâ€™ve been excluded from things that literally everyone I know is going to. She fessed up and said that she felt the need to hide things from me because I have negative reactions like this. Then she fessed up even more and told me that before she went to hang out with people that literally our whole group showed up at her house in the morning. She didnâ€™t need to tell me this she couldâ€™ve kept her mouth shut, sheâ€™s the one who blabbed to me about the last thing too? Why does she keep telling me about shit she didnâ€™t invite me to and then not expect a bad reaction. So I told her not to talk to me until after spring break. If she needed a break from me so bad here it is. Was that a bad thing to do? Iâ€™m so depressed now.
