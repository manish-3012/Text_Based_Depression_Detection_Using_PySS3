Its been raining for a good while now, and it kinda popped up a thought in my mind Yknow how rain has that drippy sound as its starting to rain, the periodically same and same sound until the rain gets more heavy and fast, hitting everything with the drip sound so fast it just abrutply stops...  

That kinda is like real life - repetitive, slow but gets faster and faster as you go on, and then it slows down and ends within a very short amount of time  

Like you are born into a family, you do esy things like learning to speak or walk or other things, and it goes faster and faster in kindergarten, school (primary, middle and high [depends where you live) and college.  

By that time youre already heavily into the rain of thought, opinions, knowledge, expirience but also pain, be it mild or even dreadfully hard, overworking and everything.  

 It then gets a new pace once youre in "the real world", where everyone is practically the same, but others are sameer than you or anyone you know...  

As you finally get a job you most likely didnt want or couldnt get to, you have to follow the gravity and its force, or the economy and trying to get money to pay nessecities like food or electricity;  

And it can just end like that, you hit a rooftop or a car, making all you did insignificant since no one will remember you ast maybe your children, and grandchildren if they got to meet you, or if you had kids.  

Life is meaningless, devoid of all worthness - we arent discovering agriculture, or settling the new world, and nowhere close to full new frontiers like other planets or even systems, all due to politicians and capitalists filling their greasy dusty stockpile of millions upon millions, while the rest live in realtivly libeavble conditions, to even poverty levels of an entire continent  

And all that human knowledge and innovativism, explorative mind and eager to fight till the very last spill of blood, for nothing.  

Were all doomed, there is no way back, the Earth is dying, we are killing other species and ourselves, trapping us here forever.  

Why should I still live on considering my life will very likely just be some rich mans profit point, being spent on basically nothing  

I dont care if I were to end up as some factory worker if it meant advancement of humanity to above and beyond, but we arent doing anything...  

Yeah idk where I was going with this Im just basically rambling about nonsence no one will read anyways..
