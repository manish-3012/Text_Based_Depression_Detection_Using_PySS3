Not sure if this is allowed here, but I'm selling a very new starter Genshin Impact account with Diluc and Barbara for a google play code of at least $5 ($5 is okay, I don't know how much it's worth), need asap. There's a limited banner on another game I really really want to pull on, and this GI account I started back when the game first came out, had some luck with pulls, but never really played much, so figured I might as well try. Would be great if you guys could help. Thank u.
