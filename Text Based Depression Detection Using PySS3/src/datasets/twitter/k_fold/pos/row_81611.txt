I'm finally starting to do well in chemistry! Okay I know it may not seem like that big of a deal but, this whole year I've been failing chemistry and not understanding anything the teacher has been saying. I failed all of my previous tests, but yesterday while the teacher was doing her lecture lesson thing, I was actually starting to understand what she was teaching us. I've always been taking plenty of notes but now I'm actually getting it! I did a worksheet today and when it got graded I got 8/10 and I'm so proud of myself. Things are getting better :)
