Merit, experience, and qualifications should be the ONLY things to be considered when aiming to fill a job position. There is nothing worse than being denied a job based on who you are. Minorities are denied jobs in certain workplaces, with positions being given to majorities with lesser qualifications and no more redeeming qualities. The same can be said the other way round, being that workplaces should not aim to hire minorities just for the sake of them being a minority so it looks good for the company. I was denied a summer job at a fast food place in December because they already had enough guys and were looking to hire some girls. No matter what, employers should just look at qualifications, and that is that.
