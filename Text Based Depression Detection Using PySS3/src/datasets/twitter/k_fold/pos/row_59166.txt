Iâ€™m so pissed right now. It all started this morning, I was going for a jog before it got too hot outside. Everything was fine until I saw a dog, he had no leash and no collar so I went into my house got some water, a makeshift leash, and some lunch meat. I gave him the food and water and then put the makeshift leash around him. I asked a few people in the neighborhood if they knew whoâ€™s he was, they all said no. I then heard someone yelling a name, the dog responded and I assumed It was his owners. I took him over they thanked me and I thought that was the end of it. 

As I was sitting down to eat dinner I saw through the window the same dog. Now Iâ€™m pissed because my mom and grandma say that they also the dog yesterday with a leash on wondering the neighborhood. So I go out put the makeshift leash on him and take him to his owners house. I ring the doorbell and knock at least 5 times. No one answers. I walk around the whole neighborhood with this dog and still canâ€™t find his owners. So here I am sitting out side with a dog thatâ€™s not mine waiting for this poor dogâ€™s incompetent owners to get home. 

If you canâ€™t keep your dog safe you shouldnâ€™t have one. When I first returned him the owners said heâ€™s escaped MULTIPLE times! In my grandmaâ€™s neighborhood the cars go pretty fast this dog couldâ€™ve easily been killed. I have lots of pets which I care for and love so much. It pisses me off that the owners incompetence couldâ€™ve gotten their dog killed multiple times. 

For context Iâ€™m at my grandmas house that why I  didnâ€™t know whoâ€™s dog it was, Iâ€™m not familiar with The area.
