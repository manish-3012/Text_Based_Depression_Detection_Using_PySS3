Seeking advice First of all: I know that I don't really count as a teenager anymore and I love on my own. Yes, I'm drunk right now.

I don't really know what is going on with me. I just cut my arm for the first time ever. I know that it is wrong but I don't know what to do. I am seeking help from my best friend right now. After that I want to talk to my mother. For the last year I am feeling something wrong with me and I kinda want to end it all. There is nothing in my life that is worth living for. I know that it is wrong to harm your own body and I don't really like to do it but I don't know what to do. Do you guys have any tips for me?
