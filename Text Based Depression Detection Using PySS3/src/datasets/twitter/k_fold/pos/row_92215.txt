So my friend figured out I like her on Friday: how long before I can ask her about it? Cause she just sorta kept quiet about it and didnt talk. So she figured it out on Friday and we haven't actually talked about it together at all except her saying that she was really uncomfortable and didn't want to talk about it a few days ago. Though yesterday at school it was totally fine without anything awkward. And I sort of want to ask about it to her and get her thoughts but I don't know when or if she will ever even let me.
