I love school I really love the challenge that my classes give me and I enjoy working out problems until I get them right. I am really proud of myself for the results that it gives me.

I have a 92% in english, a 94% in AP world history, a 103% in algebra 2, a 97% in biology, and 100s in my two career focus classes.

And now, I am going to be earning a crispy $10/hour tutoring my peers in math!!!! :D

I don't mean to brag but I just am really pleased with myself right now. I don't have friends to tell any of this to so thanks for being my friends :))
