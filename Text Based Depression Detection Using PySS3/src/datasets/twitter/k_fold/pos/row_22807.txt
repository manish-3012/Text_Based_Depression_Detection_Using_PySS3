i thought I was getting better I have been trying my hardest to stay positive for the past few days and I've been getting happy and I managed to draw something everyday (yeah that's productive for me)

but now I just can't be bothered , I realise my friends just don't care about me at all , I cant even hold a conversation with the only person being nice to me, and I just don't see the point in trying anymore 

earlier I thought I was over everthing and I was having Soo much fun playing smash bros but now I don't even how to describe my emotions :/ it's negative but feels like nothing 

thanks and sorry for listening
