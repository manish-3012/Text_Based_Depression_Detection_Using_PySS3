My teacher is effing evil man So we have to submit an assignment due sunday okay ( today is saturday midnight). Last tuesday I felt an incredible pain in my abdomen which lead me to skip school on Wednesday. I went to the doctor and had to do an ultrasound cuz they thought i had a problem with my appendix. They weren't sure what happened but something had definitely ruptured in my abdomen . I called my teacher on zoom and told her what happened, and i shit u not i was really scared and worried something was wrong and i had to do a surgery or not and that i was gonna a miss school for a long time. I explained to her the whole effing story with all the details and the first thing she asks  "are u gonna submit ur assignment on sunday?" What do i fucking do guys. I'm so done with life rn. I'm in PAIN and she asks about an ASSIGNMENT rather than reduce my stress and give me an extension or something. And when i asked for a two day extension she was like " what's 2 days gonna do" I LITERALLY ONLY HAD A SMALL PART LEFT , TWO DAYS WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH. so yeah that's how I'm submitting half an assignment which is worth 20% of my grade. 

TL;DR: had a medical and painful reason to need to rest and get an extension on an assignment, teacher insists on it getting submitted even tho i was at the hospital and im in pain. Fml.
