Minecraft Base Ideas I'm playing on a realm with my friends and the time is coming when people start constructing their actual large scale bases and honestly I don't know what to do. I really want to do an ocean base and my first thought was to build a large navy boat but after multiple creative attempts I learned that I can't build a boat to save my life. I can't think of anything else and I may just be freakishly uncreative but I'm looking for some help. If you have any suggestions whatsoever they would be greatly appreciated.
Welp thanks ily Reddit imma head to bed now gn.
