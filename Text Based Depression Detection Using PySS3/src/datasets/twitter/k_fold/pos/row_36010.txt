Fellas donâ€™t text a girl that you talk to 1st today, and see if yâ€™all ever talk again. If youâ€™re always texting her first she has low interest in you. So today donâ€™t text her first and just wait to see if sheâ€™ll text you first. 

If she texts you first today then she has medium to high interest in you. If she doesnâ€™t text you then youâ€™ll  know that she donâ€™t like you and youâ€™re wasting your time.

Sheâ€™s probably just using you for compliments and attention.
