Iâ€™m so done with my school system So I am in tenth grade, and my school board has a super crap was of dealing with COVID-19 learning. How my school usually works is that I would have 2 semesters with 4 classes in each one. And have an hour and 15 minutes of each class per day.

But with COVID-19, they did something very stupid. Instead of 2 semesters with 4 classes each. I now have 4 semesters with 2 classes each. Not only that. But during a semester, I will go to school one day for a four hour class on one subject. Then go home and have to work on that same subject. Then the next day, I have the same subject attending the class online for four hours, then have to work on that same class after the class is done. 

I genuinely canâ€™t remember anything from my classes. Especially online ones. For example, this week I have 20 hours of science class, and maybe 5 hours of working on science assignments outside of class. Next week I will have the same numbers, but for history, then the week after will be science again, And so on. Iâ€™m so tired and canâ€™t remember shit.
