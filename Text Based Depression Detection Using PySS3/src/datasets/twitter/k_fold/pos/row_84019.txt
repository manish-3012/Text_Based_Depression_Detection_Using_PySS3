The modern gaming industry isnâ€™t dead and Iâ€™m sick of YouTube recommending videos saying it is For some reason Iâ€™ve been getting YouTube recommendations of people saying it is. Just because companies like EA and Activision are being grEAdy doesnâ€™t mean the gaming industry is dead or dying. AAA studios have still been making great games (Titanfall 2, Doom 2016, the Pillars Of Eternity games). And even if they arenâ€™t the indie scene has some of the best games of all time (Return Of The Obra Dinn, Papers Please, This War Of Mine, Darkest Dungeon, Maximum Action, Dusk), but I keep seeing practically the same videos (particularly from these same two channels Downward Thrust and CleanPrinceGaning) despite the fact that Iâ€™ve told YouTube Iâ€™m not interested in these fucking videos.
