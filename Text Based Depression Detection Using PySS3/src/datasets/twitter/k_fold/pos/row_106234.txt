Anyone else remember the classic Disney Channel shows? The first one that comes to mind for me is Jessie. Me and my sister would always watch it after school when it was running. 

These shows were so bad yet so good at the same time. The plotlines were very clichÃ©d and the writing wasnâ€™t that good, but somehow it just worked.

And of course they all ended with the main characters going their own ways.

Iâ€™m thinking of going on Disney+ and rewatching some episodes. Did anyone else watch these or am I just weird?
