aight so basically i might have been asked out?? A friend invited me [16M] to the city with her because she needed to do some schoolwork stuff there, but it was just the 2 of us and we organised it at 2am

now, after that we just explored the city and talked. but neither of us did anything romantic (i donâ€™t think) except for racing each other down the slide at the playground

and then i was i messaging one of her other friends, and she tells me apparently that was a date?

what is going on? someone pls help?
