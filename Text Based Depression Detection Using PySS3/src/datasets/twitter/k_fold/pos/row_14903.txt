Well my best friend tested positive to Covid. Heâ€™s asymptomatic, tho. We both had our tests done on the same day. We both had practice with a same guy who tested positive prior to this and we both were close to this guy. I hope to god everything goes well, Iâ€™m trying not to get a panic attack rn. How is everyone doing?
