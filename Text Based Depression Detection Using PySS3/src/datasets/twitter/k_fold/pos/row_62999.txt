What does it feel like going through High School or College in the US? Well since my asian ass is living there after 1 or 2 years from now,

I at least wanna be educated on how it's like to have school in America since I am, just, really scared since I probably do know how hard the lessons and the lectures are there than it is here in Asia, "probably".

My dead ass haven't even memorized the multiplication table and I'm already graduating 10th Grade and I only survived Math with a calculator.

I need, well at least want, but I know I'll thank y'all guys for this, I need sincere help here, but jokes are welcome.

Thanks guys
