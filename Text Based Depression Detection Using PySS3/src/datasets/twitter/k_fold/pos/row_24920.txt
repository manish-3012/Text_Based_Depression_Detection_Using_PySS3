Are you awkward, shy and quiet? Iâ€™ve got the a best advice for you! I was always known as a â€œthe nice shy kidâ€, I was so self conscious and afraid what people thought and said about me, only my close friends knew the real me. 

But one day I decided to change my whole mindset: Stop worrying about what other people are going to say and think about you. They should be the ones impressing you, cause your already a baddie. You being in the same room as them is a blessing in itself. [Even though at the time I didnâ€™t think this, I would keep repeating â€œyour a baddie, your a baddie, your a baddieâ€ and then it just became second nature]. But always remember to be humble and kind no one likes the pick-me-boy/girl. A confident kind person is the best type of person, treat people how you would like to be treated.
