I hate my life So, once i had a girlfriend, which sounds weird on reddit, but then I found out that my GIRL BEST FRIEND hated her and she fucking obligated me to break up with her, so I did (IK this sounds stupid). Now I found out that they are best friends. What a fucking lie I have been living.

EDIT: I already went over it, donâ€™t worry this was like 2 years ago
