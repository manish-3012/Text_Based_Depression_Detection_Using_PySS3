Kinda need to vent I guess. Feeling like a lonely trans girl today. Iâ€™m a trans girl and Iâ€™m starting hormone therapy in March. The only downside are the mood swings that happen (among other things)

I just want a boy/girl/enby to cuddle me when I have my mood swings.

My emotions are already fucked so Iâ€™m gonna be crying 24/7 on estrogen.

Idk why Iâ€™m posting this I just feel a bit touch starved and worried I guess.
