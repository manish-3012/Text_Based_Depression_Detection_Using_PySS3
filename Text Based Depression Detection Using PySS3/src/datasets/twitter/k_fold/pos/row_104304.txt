Just shat myself trying to rescue a spider from the bathtub. I was using a towel to get it out (for distance, in case it was a speedy boi) and I guess in the second it was sitting on the towel it shot some silk onto it, probably because I scared it. This meant that when I tried to whip the towel out after it walked off i suddenly watched it fly into air with the towel towards me, and then it fucking disappeared from my vision and I couldnâ€™t see it. This was made worse since I had black shorts on and it was black too.

Honestly thought I had just thrown an angry spider onto my leg and was about to get bitten in the most embarrassing way possible.

Turns out it mustâ€™ve dropped off instead of flying onto me, and was sitting next to the toilet when I saw it again.

Why do I do this to myself?
