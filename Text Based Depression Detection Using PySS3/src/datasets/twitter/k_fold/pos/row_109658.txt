Is this insane parenting? I just uploaded a yt video on my channel for the first time in FOREVER, and my grandma called my mom and told her to tell me to take down the video.... because it had a gun in it. for context, it was a skit about someone mugging some one else, and them using a reverse card to switch places and start mugging the other guy. i used an airsoft pistol with an orange tip... I was livestreaming on twitch, too, when my mom bursted in and started telling me to stop streaming and to IMMEDIATELY take down the video. I just want to know if I am doing something wrong or if i am correct in assuming that this is an overreaction. She also grounded me for a day.

I also am on really good terms with both my mom and my grandma, and I don't dislike either of them. this seems so out of the blue

Also, In the past, I made another video where it showed me actually pretend SHOOTING someone with the fake gun, and they made me take that down too, but I thought that it was because of the shooting instead of the presence of a prop gun
