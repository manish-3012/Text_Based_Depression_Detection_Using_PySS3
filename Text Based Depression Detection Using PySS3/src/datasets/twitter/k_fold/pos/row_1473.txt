I became well known So this ainâ€™t that big of an accomplishment because itâ€™s on one pixelmon server (Minecraft + PokÃ©mon) but nevertheless people actually sorta know me there. As in me as a player not irl at all. Since a command was added to check your playtime (few days ago) Iâ€™m in 14th place (Iâ€™m just saying how much effort I put into it). There was a tournament and I had a bunch of people rooting for me. Itâ€™s odd that it felt so nice but I guess itâ€™s because Iâ€™m really part of a community. I also think Iâ€™m one of the best know people who doesnâ€™t have a rank or is part of the staff team. I know this ainâ€™t special but I find it touching.
