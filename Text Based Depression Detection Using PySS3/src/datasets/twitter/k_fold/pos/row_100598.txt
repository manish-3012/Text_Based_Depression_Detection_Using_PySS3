Imagine being so racist that you believe there's only one ethnic group of the white race that should be alive. If you're not aware of who i'm referring to, it's the Nazis. Looking back at what happened to Europe in the 20th century, I am so glad that I was born in the era that I am, because there's a good chance that the Nazis would've killed me for being 1/4 Jewish if I lived in Germany, France or Eastern europe instead of the US at that time.

I seriously cannot understand how someone can hate other ethnic groups of people to the point in which they think that they deserve to be wiped out. My mind simply cannot comprehend this evil, and I refuse to enter the viewpoint of a Nazi. I wish that people would try understanding us instead of hating us and wanting us dead for no reason.
