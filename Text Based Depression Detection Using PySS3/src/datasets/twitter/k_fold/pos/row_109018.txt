Everything I Knew Is a Lie Well, not really. But kinda. I finally got a toxic ex out of my life recently. Cheater who constantly used me and left me and so I finally accepted he wasn't coming back anymore and even if he did I can't be with him despite wanting him. He's trans and in a moment of weakness I go and check his insta profile just to get a vague idea of if he's ok. The only goddamned thing I notice is the pronouns she/her and I just about threw a hissy fit and wanted to literally bomb Syrian refugees. Like, my anger and confusion? Maximum. My hatred? Unparalleled. My sexuality? Utterly broken. My trust? What the fuck even is that??? My heart? It's been sorta gone for a whiles now but that's utterly ridiculous. What the fuck did I waste a year of my life for? I've been so goddamned sad and hurt all the time, my sexuality transformed into what it is now, all my kinks and fetishes and desires for a partner, and my mental state fully shattered for someone who I NEVER knew? Someone who I comforted and reaffirmed constantly with all my heart and still want lied about their whole life and personality? Every single aspect about themself? Led me on, pretended to be sad, probably actually was a victim of rape but used that as an excuse to hurt me and blame me, and I'm just goddamned losing my mind. I will die with so much time wasted on an actual lie. A lie that sounds utterly intoxicating still but now I know 100% was utterly a lie. What the fuck???
