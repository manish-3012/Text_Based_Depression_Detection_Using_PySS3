I started driving and it's terrifying For as long as I can remember I've been super excited to drive, but when I was old enough to start learning, my parents wouldn't let me. I've been bugging them about it a lot, and finally my mom got tired of carting me around to all my stuff and put me in driver's ed at 16 years and 8 months, which is much later than anyone should have to wait.

I started the class and was doing fine in the book work portion, but when the driving came, the teachers would either not tell me enough, or practically yell the whole time, adding much more stress to already stressful situations. I feel like I am behind, even though my total time comes out to only an hour and a half of actual driving. I probably need to go back to the basics, but I can't since I wouldn't be able to pass the class if I went any slower than the pace they force me into.

This crap sucks and all I wanted was a licence, not to be told that I am below "below basic"
