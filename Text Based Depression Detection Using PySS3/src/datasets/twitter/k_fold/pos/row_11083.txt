What a save I was talking to my crush (she doesnt know i like her) about anime on discord by text and i got excited cause i saw a character who i loved was actually alive (i thought he was dead) and told her goodbye because i didnt want spoilers (she already watched it all) and as i said goodbye i typed in "love you" i was a half second away from sending that. Jesus christ.
