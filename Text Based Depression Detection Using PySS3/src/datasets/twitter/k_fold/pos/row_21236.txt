Hey wth is up with 4chan? I'm just browsing 4chan, minding my own business, and I've seen at least 4 people making fun of Reddit. Like ok, fine. What really bothers me though, is that they just openly called gay people the "f" word, are actually racist, and just all round gross. Now this is just /b/ mind you. There's so much porn, it takes the horni AWAY. Anyway imma go make myself coffee, I suggest you do too.

Love,
