Guys, I was born, raised, and live in Chicago. Even though I was born at Lake Forest Hospital in 2003, the next day I went home to my parents house. The house was located in a neighborhood right here in the city, ~Lake Villa, 44 fuckinâ€™ miles away from downtown~. In 2013 my family moved into a high rise right near the loop, where I reside now ~I moved to the Cook County part of Buffalo Grove where it should just be considered Arlington Heights because the time boarders intertwine like 8 times~.



Donâ€™t believe me? My parents are natural born Chicagoans! ~Theyâ€™re both from Mississippi, my dad from Jackson, and my mom from Flowood/Pearl (the town line changes like every other decade for some reason). They met in 1993. My dad got a internship up here in â€˜99, got an apartment in Waukegan, my mom followed him in â€˜99, they married in 2000, and bought the Lake Villa house in 2002.~


**Seriously tho, why do people from northeastern counties of Illinois do this shit?**
