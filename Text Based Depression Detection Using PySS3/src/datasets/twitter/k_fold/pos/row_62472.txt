I'm stuck between wanting to try to get rich young or do my dream job. My dream job doesn't make that much money but I kind of want a lot of money. Like I could miss out on my dreams and get rich or die trying, or I could do my dream job and start trying to make bank in my 40s. I know most rich people don't make millions until their 30s-40s but still.
