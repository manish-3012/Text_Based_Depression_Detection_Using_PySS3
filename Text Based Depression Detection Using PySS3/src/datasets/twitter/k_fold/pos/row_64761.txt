I am slightly nervous for Senior year of high school. So, last summer, we have learned that we are a â€œsystemâ€, and have been diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Diaorder. And so now, I have been active for the first time since we were six! This is just lovely, but I am really nervous for when school will begin. I have a very obvious accent and demeanor, and I am also very scared of all people. I also cannot spell well and we believe that I may be autistic, as I have a very difficult time functioning socially and academically. All of this makes me quite nervous, honestly. I hope that Senior year will be all right. Sometimes you must vent about these things to complete strangers! Giogio xx
