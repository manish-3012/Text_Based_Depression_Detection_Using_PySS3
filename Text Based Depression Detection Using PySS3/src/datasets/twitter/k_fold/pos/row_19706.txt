Another cringey cheesey relationship post My girlfriend is the first person to make me, with my deep voice and full fucking bearded up face, giggle like a fucking grade schooler with basically everything she says to me. I seriously love her so fucking much and now I have to tell other people about it because IM SO FUCKING HAPPY.

Anyways here's the same comment of I hope all of you reading this find exactly what you are looking for, it may not be a relationship, I just hope more people feel the same happiness I am feeling.
