Only 9 more months until I ghost a majority of the people from my school and never have to speak to them again :) 2 years ago, after a shitty sophomore year, I came to the realization that I never have to talk to these people again, so I made the decision to do a massive contact purge and create new social media accounts on July 14th, 2021. It gives me enough time to have a final goodbye with them (without them knowing) at my grad party or, if they can't make it, just in general, and it lines up with [this meme](https://imgur.com/gallery/jNU4ZTJ). I eagerly await July 14th and I'll probably post more about it as it gets closer :)
