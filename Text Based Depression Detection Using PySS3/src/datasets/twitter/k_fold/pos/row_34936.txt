Please help Ok i'm posting this here because I think most of you guys aren't done with your studies quite yet.

I'm in my final months of school and years ago I promised to myself and Wikipedia that I'd donate when I'm done with school. Wikipedia probably saved half of my presentations and upcoming exams throughout my entire life and even though teachers hate it as a source, you kinda end up on Wikipedia anyways. 
And like, I feel like I kinda owe them a little thank you. 
Maybe you think the same. 
I want to see more memes about it, more anything.

Maybe some of you like my idea of donating after you're done with School/Uni 
Wikipedia would probably really appreciate it.
