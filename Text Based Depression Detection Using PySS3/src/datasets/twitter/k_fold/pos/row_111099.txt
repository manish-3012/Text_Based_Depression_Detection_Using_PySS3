Our teacher for acting and speech is making us write 2-3 minute speeches about civil rights and I have no clue what to do Iâ€™m doing my speech on pet abuse and stuff like that cause pets deserve rights and shit, but thereâ€™s not many good resources, and thereâ€™s no way in hell the block of text a wrote could be stretched out to have a run time of 2-3 minutes. The hell do I do, this is due in about 3 hours
