I think my online friend might have a crush on me. So I've known this person for almost a year now. We met post quarantine on a Discord server, and I think since then we've talked almost every day. I've gotten to know a few of their friends, and we have a pretty good circle now.

I get word from one of her cousins one day (part of the circle ye) saying that "hey, i got this info from the black market that you know someone who has a crush on you."

At this point, me and the girl had exchanged 'i love you' and 'ily' a lot, but as far as I knew they had been platonic and we were just considering each other as best friends. But now I don't even know.

*i dont even know what to do at this point bc i've literally never had this happen to me before so i am now in a phase of happiness but also extreme confusion*
