My crush went for my best friend So this was before quarantine, in november. Basically, I really really liked this girl called sophia, only problem was I wasn't sure if she liked me. I also had a nerdy friend from france called Hugo. Hugo never really cracked jokes. I'm not saying I was a simp, but I would always support sophia, help her, compliment her, give her tips on stuff, but she was so smart it generally didn't help. Through a year and a half, I could never bring myself to ask her out, until one day Hugo becomes the class clown completely out of the blue and went from a nerd to a punk, and now sophia likes him, and she asked him out 3 days later. He said yes.

TL;DR: When you get the chance, shoot your shots
