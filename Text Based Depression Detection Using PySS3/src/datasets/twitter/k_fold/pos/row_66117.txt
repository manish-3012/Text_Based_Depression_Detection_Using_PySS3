What to say and not to say to a suicidal person **What to avoid:**

-"Things get better, you'll be all right" 

-"Suicide is selfish, think about your family, friends, etc."

-"Only cowards commit suicide" 

-"There's much more to live" 

-"There are people who have worse problems" 

-"Come on, I'm sure you don't really wanna die" 

-"Suicide is not a solution" / "Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem" 

-"You don't seem depressed"

-"Just cheer up, smile"

-"It's just a phase"

-"Your life isn't bad as you think"

-"You're just seeking for attention"

-"Focus on the positives in your life" 

-"I know how you feel" (unless you were suicidal too and you explicitly told him) 

-"You're going to hell for that" 


**What neither helps or make things worse:**

-"You need help, go to a professional" (you can say it in a second time only, phrasing it like: "I'm worried for you, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you but in the meantime you could go to a doctor, a professional or somebody more competent than me. What do you think about it?") 

-"Stay strong"


**What to say (must be an every day thing or almost):**

-"How are you doing today?" (keep them busy and make them not to think of their depression and suicidal thoughts) 

-"Is there anything I can do for you?" 

-"I'm here if you wanna talk" 

-"Can I ask you why are you depressed?" - "Wanna talk about it?" 

-"Are you thinking about ending your life?" if they say yes, ask "Do you have a plan for how you would do it?" if they say yes again, ask "Have you thought about when you would end your life?" 

This makes you understand what type and how inmediate support the person you're talking to needs. Don't forget to focus on the "why" more than the "how" though. 

A few words can save a life.
