hi iâ€™m in need of an online best friend warning: iâ€™m awkward and sound like a complete dumbass irl because i constantly get distracted so i never know wtf is going on but i like talking about geopolitics, philosophical ideologies, and gay nerdy shit. 

i like playing minecraft and among us. will be getting a monitor soon so eventually iâ€™ll open my horizons a bit more 

oh and i would like to hear about how your day has been and a heart to heart from time to time, but this doesnâ€™t mean im interested in becoming a long term therapist. also iâ€™m interested in having a long term friendship so i expect you to hit me up from time to time and not have myself constantly chasing your ass everyday just to have an empty short conversation. 

au revoir bÃ©bÃ©
