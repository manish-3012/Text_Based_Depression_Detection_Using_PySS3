Iâ€™m not allowed to go to college I work my ass of in school to get into a good college. My goal in life is to get a good paying job. But when i told my father he got mad and told me Iâ€™m not allowed to go to college. I have to find a job after school and give him part of my money. I fucking hate that man. He doesnâ€™t want me to get away from him because he canâ€™t control me when Iâ€™m gone. Guess Iâ€™ll have a minimum wage job and stay in poverty for the rest of my life. Itâ€™s quite a shame since my grades are getting better. I couldâ€™ve gotten into a good school and get a good job after.
