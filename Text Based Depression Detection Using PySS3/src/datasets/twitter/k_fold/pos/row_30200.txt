Iâ€™m so fucking sick and tired of being lied to My therapist said that just my mom and I only should spend more time together so I would be able to open up more, and all she said was that we take some time out of our week, just one day, where we do something together. So yesterday I had a whole ass day off, and I tried to plan something but my kept saying no, and then she said we could go to Dave and busters today and now we canâ€™t go. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of being lied to. All Iâ€™m asking is to just spend some alone time with my mom and she canâ€™t even do that.
