Tomorrow, I make history Well not serious history history but still. Tomorrow, is teachers day. And as a student council member I'll be making a video for the event. An event every single person in my school will be watching. Haven't guessed it yet? I'm gonna be the first south East Asian person to rickroll an entire fucking school. I'm excited.
