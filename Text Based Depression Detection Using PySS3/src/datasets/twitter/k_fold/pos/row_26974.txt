I just realized life is going super fucking fast It's like a train that just passed me by. Feels like everything was yesterday. It's like suddenly I was 7 years old excited for a little brother to now in college with friends who are pregnant and getting married. Feels like the world is just leaving me behind kinda. Feels like I'll be dead tomorrow and have nothing to show for it. Anyway, how is your day going?
