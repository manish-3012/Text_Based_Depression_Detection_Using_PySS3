ERPed for the first time, here's what happened (we're both over 18): i joined an rp server and some of the people were in relationships, so i started talking about being alone and shit to try and get someone to start going at me, which worked to an alarming degree when  the server owner made me a private chatroom (not special treatment, it's small so everyone has their own channel) and started flirting with me in character, so i started doing it back a little, this, again, worked far to well, and we "fucked" for a while, it was weird at first but i was kind of into it, so after a while we stopped, it was kind of nice, i guess? i mean, i didn't really do anything much, but i just wanted to tell someone and don't trust my friends enough to not make fun of me for it, so this is my experience, good night guys.
