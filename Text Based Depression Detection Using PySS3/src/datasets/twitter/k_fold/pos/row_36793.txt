Am I too clingy? I've always felt insecure in most relationships. I question whether the other person would ever miss me if I disappear, and sometimes it gets to the point of making me feel useless, even when the person has openly told me they care about me and done a lot to prove it, so I tend to overcompensate by sending messages all the time or putting in too much.

So today I was talking to my SO and they said they didn't want to talk to me right now. They were tired and didn't really have the capacity for a conversation, so I said okay, I'll leave you be. Perfectly normal, right?

But my brain immediately starts thinking about how I must have messed something up because why would they not want to talk to me? Did I do something wrong?? We talk every day- but that logic's stupid. Not everyone can keep talking nonstop all the time like I do. People need mental health days sometimes. I feel bad that I can't let them be. I always worry that I'm not enough for them, no matter what they say.

I don't know what to do about this. Any advice from you guys?
