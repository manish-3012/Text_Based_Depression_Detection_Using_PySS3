I feel like an asshole So me and my friends startung to play dnd recently and we have had about 3 sessions the first one i dont remeber what happened to end it but on the second one i ended it because i needed to do something and today we were playing and it got to about 6:00 so i suggested we take a break for dinner and rejoin about half our later but they just said to end the session and i feel like an asshole becuase i dont want them to think im not enjoying and trying to quit im actually really enjoying it
