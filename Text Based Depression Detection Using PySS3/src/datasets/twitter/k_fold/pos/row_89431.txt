Give us a funny story? I have two

So...

One time I went for an eye exam and they had to use this device to keep my eyes open and brush dye on my eyes. I'm extremely uncomfortable with eyes so I freaked out and had a panic attack and then the optician freaked out and had a panic attack because he didn't know how to handle my panic attack so we were both in the room vibing off each others panic attack making each other worse. Then he was shaking like he had parkinsons and handed me a glass of water, spilling half of it on his sleeve.


One time when my ex's cat was 2 months old, I was playing a game with him. I was mimicking his movements. He looked away from me knowing I would do the same. **It was a trap**. He took the opportunity to slap me across the eyes. Scratched my upper and lower eyelids.

What about you? Give us stories.
