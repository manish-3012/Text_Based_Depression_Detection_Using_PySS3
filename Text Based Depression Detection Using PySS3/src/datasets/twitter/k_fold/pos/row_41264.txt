I got someone's number today. So basically, I started taking pictures of everyone's feet to go along with a joke on this attractive guy Jacob's phone, and he ended up opening it for me. So I was gonna send the feet pics to Angel (the dude everyone makes fun of), but then Jacob was like "nah, I dont want his number". So Angel said "but you want her number" and I guess he said it was fine. So i got the didgets, and was feeling pretty good about it. Angel kept saying to everyone that I got his number. Hopefully Jacob and I can be good friends.

TLDR: I got cute guy's phone because I was taking pictures on it, and put my number in. He was ok with it too.
