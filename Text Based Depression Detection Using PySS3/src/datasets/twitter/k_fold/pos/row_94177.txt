Help please I can't take this anymore. My parents are divorced and my mom had 2 jobs and now she was fired from 1 of them and now she's arguing with my dad for money and he says he doesn't have either and I am very stressed, I go to school thinking that in some days we may no longer have money and I think I just entered in a deeper depression an I am very frustrated and there's no one to speak to. Please help.
