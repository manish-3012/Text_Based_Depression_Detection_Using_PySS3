Y'all my GF gave me one of her scrunchies, a bar of chocolate, and a green day t shirt and this makes me extremely happy I got her a fall out boy hoodie, but USPS's 2-3 day shipping isn't true, it's been 4 days and no sing of it coming yet, and it's the weekend so probably not till Monday. As well as a ton of chocolate

Turns out we both got eachother stuff from hot topic lol.

Also her scrunchie smells like her, and it makes me happy
