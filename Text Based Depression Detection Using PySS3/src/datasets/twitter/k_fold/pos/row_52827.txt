Guys, my parents are breaking me and I don't know what to do. They are taking EVERYTHING.  
They say they are doing this because they are trying to fix my attitude.  
They first took away youtube. I could live with this because I could easily sneak it.  
Then anime, which made me sad but I grew to live with.  
Then my laptop, cutting off all my communication with my online friends. I would've broken here, but once again, I have my ways, as you can see that I'm posting this.  
Then they made me switch schools, away from my friends,  
NOW, THEY HAVE TAKEN MY DOOR!  
ALL MY PRIVACY!  
I HAVE 4 BROTHERS AND THEY KEEP RUNNING IN HERE!  
I am currently hiding in my closet. My brothers are screaming outside in the hallway, which I can hear perfectly thanks to no door. I can't stop moving completely, I have to move some limb to keep calm. Anything is going to make me break into tears and scream. I feel like I'm broken.   
I'm an ambivert so this force of contact with people is kinda breaking me.  
I really really really need help right now.  
Oh great, I have a headache from stress.
