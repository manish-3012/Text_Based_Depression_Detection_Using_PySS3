Ideas for a short "film"? Hello!  
I'm making the final part of "**\*redacted\*** in space!", part 4.  
It's supposed to be a funny video of my friend **\*redacted\*** as he flies through different scenarios while shooting stars plays in the background.

But this time, my IT teacher caught wind of it and wants to see my editing skills...

so I need an epic short film idea about a kid who for some reason gets launched into space, and has to live/fly through many different situations.

I have 5 years of animatin and editing experience so I need to show off as much as possible in front of my teacher!

Please give me some ideas reddit!
