18 and never kissed anyone Hi everyone, Iâ€™m 18F and iâ€™ve never kissed anyone/been in a relationship. Iâ€™m in college and I know itâ€™d be easy to kiss anyone, but Iâ€™m just not into having hookups. I feel like my suitemates think Iâ€™m strange for never having been kissed, and I feel like a complete outlier. The opportunity has presented itself a few times, but I never cared enough to take them seriously. It doesnâ€™t bother me that much that I havenâ€™t been intimate with anyone, but at the same time, Iâ€™m SO nervous about kissing anyone. I feel like a kiss might lead to things iâ€™m not ready for and I mean upset the other person.
