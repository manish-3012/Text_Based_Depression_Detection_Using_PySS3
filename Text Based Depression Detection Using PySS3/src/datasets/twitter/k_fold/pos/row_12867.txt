How I know Iâ€™ve grown as a person Iâ€™m really proud of myself! I just cut off a toxic friend, and it made me feel better about myself.

Last night, I made a tier list of my favourite games, and one of my â€œfriendsâ€ said he â€œknew for a factâ€ that I had only played some of them. I had to aimlessly tell him to stop bothering me because he was just trying to start something that wasnâ€™t there. Which is actually progress 

Before, with my abusive ex -BF, thatâ€™s not how I would have played it. I was emotionally unstable, and it would have taken all my strength to stand up for myself. Instead, I might have just submitted and apologised.

But it gets far worse. He somehow decides to accuse me of faking my depression fog the last couple of years. He said that when he saw me he didnâ€™t see my scars of cutting myself. The reason was, as a depressed 15 year old, I used push pins, because I knew they wouldnâ€™t leave scars. I only ever used a knife once. Then, he started demanding pictures of my scars, threatening to tell all my friends about this â€œhuge scandalâ€. I panicked, but held myself together and blocked him.


I know it doesnâ€™t seem like much, but I know that this means Iâ€™ve grown, and while it still hurt me that he said what he did, I canâ€™t help but feel a bit better on realising he was planning on betraying my trust like that.


So, if itâ€™s okay, I wanted feedback as to wether I did the right thing or not, and if I somehow did something wrong here, please let me know. Iâ€™m trying to evolve as a person and Iâ€™m only recently beating depression, so Iâ€™d appreciate any and all help
