My friend is completely burnt out Iâ€™ve never seen him this sad and tired. School is getting to be too much for him, and his home life is terrible. Heâ€™s running on 2 hours of sleep and pain pills because he sprained his wrist. Heâ€™s usually full of energy but today he was depressed. And then at lunch he said that he usually feels like this, but he has the energy to hide it. He says he doesnâ€™t want to talk about it, and I donâ€™t want to push him. Iâ€™m just really lost here. Does anyone know what I should do? Iâ€™ve already asked my mom to talk to the counsellor (sheâ€™s a counsellor too and theyâ€™re good friends)   Iâ€™m not sure what I should do next
