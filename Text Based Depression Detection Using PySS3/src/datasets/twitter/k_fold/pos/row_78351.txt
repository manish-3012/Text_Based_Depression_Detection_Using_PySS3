I'm turning 20 today I have so much to say, yet don't know what to say.

Many things matter less than you think, I'm not popular in school and only have a few friends and that's fine, I'm a virgin and never been in a relationship and that's fine.

Being a teenager is hard, but stay positive and you'll make it through. 

Please take good care of yourself and stay healthy.

Try your best and enjoy the ride.
