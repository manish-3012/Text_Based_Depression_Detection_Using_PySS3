My teeth hurt like hell cuz my dentist is an idiot So, last week I went to the dentist to have a nerve removed.Basicaly he somehow fucked up and after four days of pain, yesterday I had to go again. He remove what was left of the nerve witout giving me any anesthesy so it hurt like hell.After that he cut a big portion of my teeth, so it would not Hurt when I bite but now the edge is very sharp and I'm scratching my tongue with it. I barely got to sleep last night because of the pain Ã®n my teeth and gum and he said the pain will be gone in a day or two. Also, I have to go again Ã®i two weeks so wish my mental sanity good luck.
