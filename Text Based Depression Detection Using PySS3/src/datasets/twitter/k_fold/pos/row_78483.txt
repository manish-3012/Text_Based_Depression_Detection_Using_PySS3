I need help because idk what the hell i am Im a 15 y/o girl and last few months i thought i am trans. I was sure because i was always into boy's stuff. When i was younger i wore boys clothes (now i dont). I always had male friends, played video games with them etc. A week ago i got new short haircut and im really happy with it! But im sad because i think none of the boys will like me (i never had crush on a girl, only boys). 

So, i've been questioning myself. And i still dont know what am i. I always wanted to be a boy, do boy's stuff but everyone will make fun of me. 

Just to add, i would talk about this with my family or friends if they all werent homophobic :( 

Am i really trans or this is just a phase? or i am just a straight girl that likes gay men ughh help idkkkk
