Whats up with "men's rights activists"??? Literally all they do is bash and criticize any feminist or regular woman they meet, even though they say their "goal" is to defend their "rights". Like...the rights...you already have...as a male? Whoever considers themselves a mens rights activist is totally a mysogynist as they will try their hardest to stop feminism.

And quick reminder: The only man who feels threatened by feminism, is the man who benefits from the oppression of women. Aka. theyre sexist.

Oh boy, cant wait for the downvotes! Bring your worst, incels!
