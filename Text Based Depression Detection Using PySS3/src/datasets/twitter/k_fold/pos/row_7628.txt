Iâ€™m so impatient, I want to start hormone therapy sooo bad. I told my mom I want to start gender therapy and create a roadmap for transitioning but so much is happening in our lives right now that it kinda got swept under the rug :/

Iâ€™m just sitting here listening to girl in red fantasizing about when I will actually feel like a girl and be myself.

I was even stupid enough to research vaginoplasty surgery and now I want that as soon as possible as well... though that will have to wait a while longer :(
