Ugh I went to 2 doctors today First one was physiotherapy where they tortured me for an hour and second was an eye test which basically told me I am as blind as a bat and need glasses. I look even more of a troglodyte than I already do when I wear glasses. They barely had any kids frame options so they look like shit.
