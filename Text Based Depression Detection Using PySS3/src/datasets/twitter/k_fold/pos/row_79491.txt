Bad Poems Day 7 Roses are red

I hope you're aware

It's now Christmas Eve

Have a great day out there!

&amp;#x200B;

Wherever you are,

If you're reading this,

I hope that the next week

Is nothing but bliss.

&amp;#x200B;

You all deserve happiness

Whether you like it or not.

And on this next Christmas day

You'll all get quite a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Now before I go away,

To cut a piece of dead skin,

Merry Christmas to you all!

*Now let the celebration begin!*
