When everyone starts thinking you and your friend like each other This year we changed classes and there was this boy who I've spoken to a couple of times before. We became friends really fast, and when we could we would sit together (in my school the tables are set two and two together, idk if it makes sense) and we did some group projects together. After some weeks my teacher switched our seats and I asked to sit at the back with him because I work better there and with him (which wasn't an excuse, it's true) and the teacher agreed.

Then my school organized a really long walk in a mountain, it took like three hours to get to the top and one to get down; and I spent the whole time with him, talking about everything and anything. 

The thing is my other friends started teasing me saying that we had crushes on each other, which isn't true (he had a girlfriend and after that had crushes on my friends) and yada yada ya. They said that at the end of the year we'd be together since a lot of things can happen from November to June (they were sort of right, nobody expected Covid). 

It happens to me a lot when I befriend a boy. We aren't interested in each other, we just enjoy the company. He's really nice, funny and very kind. There are some things that we both like such as anime, memes, movies and video games. He's that kind of friend that's always there for you, and I even helped him when he had crushes on my friends.

It's not the first time that I'm so close with a boy that everyone starts thinking I like him, I just enjoy being with boys, and boys enjoy my company because "I'm not like the rest of my class" in some way, I guess. 

Summary: My friend and I are close and everybody thinks we like each other but we don't.
