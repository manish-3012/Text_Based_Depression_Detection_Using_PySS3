Wildest dreams in a while I just woke up from the craziest fucking dream I had in a while. I decided to write it all down, as I am journaling my thoughts, dreams, mood, and etc due to my recently diagnosed depression. I hope you guys enjoy:

I was on a mission to save Obama from a deranged "cereal" killer who was actually teaming up with Lucky Charms so that they could take over the USA. The only reason why I was so special was because I could slide on my fucking body like a motherfucking penguin. When the deranged "cereal" killer attacked, all of us army crawled on the ground so that he couldn't smell us. I went to go confront the deranged "cereal" killer who revealed that he was Michael Jackson and we fought a world threatening battle. After that, Obama shook my hand and I slid my way to Shrek's swamp which was my home and took a bath in milk and maple syrup. Then I slowly took a look at my body and took out a bunch of needles that were impaled in various parts of my body.

I don't believe dreams have any meaning...
