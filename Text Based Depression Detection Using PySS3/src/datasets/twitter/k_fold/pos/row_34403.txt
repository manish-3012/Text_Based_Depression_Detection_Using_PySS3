iâ€™m just not doing great and i kind of need some advice or some hope to put it simply every day feels the exact same over and over again. i feel a sinking feeling every day when i wake up knowing i have to go through another day like that. my parents drive my crazy because all they can do is talk about what i should be doing differently and how terrible i am. they have made me go on an hour long walk with them every single day for almost a year and it is so draining but they donâ€™t care. sometimes i literally cry on the walks because i canâ€™t take it and they donâ€™t care. iâ€™m not the good student i used to be. i cheat on tests and quizzes and assignments and i feel guilty and like a disgusting person. iâ€™m lonely, i love my friends but i have like 3 and no one else. i literally do nothing, i have no hobbies. i just stay at home, do school, go on walk, struggle through my parents yelling at me. every single goddamn day for so long and i canâ€™t handle it anymore and i donâ€™t know what to do. the last few weeks have been especially bad i donâ€™t even feel like myself. i disassociate and tend to forget who i am or what iâ€™m doing for like a half second and snap back to reality. nothing that usually is comforting to me is making me happy or feel better anymore. i donâ€™t understand it and i donâ€™t know what to do. i just want to feel alive again, do things that make me feel alive, i want to fall in love, i want to be happy and i want to feel real and worthy. but i donâ€™t know how to do that and especially not with feeling huge guilt for it.  

please help anything is fine i just need to hear soemthing from random strangers
