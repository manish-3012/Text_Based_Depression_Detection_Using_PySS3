You can buy a complex mini computer in your pocket for $300 these days and it works great, but a fucking chair for that price is still absolute shit I've gone thru so many chairs the one I'm using now is $600 but it's a wobbly piece of shit. And I'm not alone in thinking that there's reddit subs dedicated to chairs and they've all spent like $1000+ to get a decent chair.
