I left a paper trail. Heads up, I couldnâ€™t find an NSFW flair so this is gonna be probably 15+ maybe 16?

Anyways, my girlfriend (16) and I (17) of 9 months had sex like 3 and a half weeks ago and we did it safe, condom, pulled out, and she was still super paranoid (not annoyed by that, kinda glad she was) but anyways I got a pregnancy test for her just to help eliminate any worries (which it did). I got said pregnancy test from Dollar General, and they donâ€™t ask you if you want the receipt, so when I got in the car, I put the receipt in my pocket so that I could throw it away, and it wouldnâ€™t just be sitting somewhere at my house or in my car.
Yesterday I did my laundry and apparently set the receipt on top of the washer. My grandma found it and  Iâ€™m in trouble, and my grandparents immediately told my girlfriends mom. My point, I remember one time saying â€œwho would be dumb enough to leave a literal paper trailâ€ and apparently that would be me.

Just figured anyone who was having a bad day might find happiness in the fact that they werenâ€™t the ones who fucked up this bad.
