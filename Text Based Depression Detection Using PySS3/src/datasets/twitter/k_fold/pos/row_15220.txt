Man, "Did I ask?" is so stupid Half the time people say it when they **did** ask, just because they didn't like the answer. And its not like the government asks for critique, but people still stand up for reforms and shit. If you say "Did I ask?" as a response to an argument, I will completely disregard your opinion.
