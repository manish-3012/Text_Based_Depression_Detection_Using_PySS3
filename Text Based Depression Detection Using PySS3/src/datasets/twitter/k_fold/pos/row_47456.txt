Fellow dudes who are 15-16, is it normal if my neck doesn't match with my chest or should I get this checked? I'm 15, 5'9 and male. Im not underweight but I'm nowhere near overweight. Just crossed past the underweight range and I'm kinda proud of myself except my neck is too "wide" for my body. I literally have bones showing on my chest and then my neck and face seem to be way too chubby to match them. Is this normal? Could this be because of posture? I've been studying with my head tilted down low since August for around 7 hours a day. I also eat junk food like once or twice a week and not too much in quantity. My jaw is also widening up? I don't know if this is just puberty or something else. It's not too bad to the point where my friends point it out or notice it exclusively but I don't like how it's making me look.
I should mention though I drink coffee every 3 days with around 3 tablespoons sugar. This look doesn't suit my physique at all and it also doesn't seem healthy. Is this something that deserves a visit to the doctor? Its making me look real bad in photos too because my face and neck look almost joined. Is this reversible or should I just give it time and push it off as puberty.
