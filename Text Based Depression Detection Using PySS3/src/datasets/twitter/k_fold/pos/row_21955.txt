I need help with my life Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide and I just need some advice on what to do, should I do it or not? Itâ€™s just been a rough few weeks and I feel like giving up, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m good enough for anyone, and I donâ€™t fit in. So like I said I would appreciate some advice
