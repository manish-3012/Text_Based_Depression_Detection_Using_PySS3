My mom and dad are getting a divorce and I don't feel sad You read the title, I won't repeat it for you. This divorce has been floating around for quite some time now, since 2017 in fact. They're getting a divorce because my dad is an alcoholic and is disrupting the peace with his drunken ramblings and my mom didn't want us to hear him or her yell ar him. And for about 2 weeks we spent our days at our grandparent's house while our dad got his shit together. For a time, he actually did too! Until around 3 hours ago when he came home with a suspicious looking paper bag and a suspicious looking black plastic bag. I instantly knew what it was and that he hadn't been sober for a long time. 1 hour later my mom came down stairs and said only this "are you kidding me". The tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife. When I was told of the divorce I wasn't surprised or scared like younger me thought I would feel, I wasn't surprised or scared, for a moment I was actually glad... now my father is looking for an apartment so he can live by himself. I'm more scared for my mom and my brother who actually feel they are affected. Sometimes my dad can be fun to be around when he's sober, but I absolutely hate his guts when he's had even a few drinks. Now that i know he'll be gone soon we can go back to better times when he was in rehab and we didn't have to deal with him. The best way to describe this is probably that scene from spongebob where he has to move away and squidward says 'boo hoo' but we see coming from his window confetti and we also sometimes hear him say 'woo hoo'. Anyway that's the place I'm in rn so say what you will.
