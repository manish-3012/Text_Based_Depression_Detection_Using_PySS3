Yo i just had a wierd dream I was at my moms boyfriends house which go go to often which i don't mind, and my eyes start feeling weird so i get some eyedrops and was about to use them outside. All of a sudden i see what looks like a fast moving yellow star and then all of a sudden it is a huge meteor/asteroid like the size of a house i guess. It hits a few miles away, and i see a beautiful shock wave and immediately run inside before i die. Then i talk to family and mom how its not a nuke and that we shouldn't wait for the Shockwave because what just happened was the shock wave. Then i woke up :(.
