Wait 13 year olds still believe in "santa"? So I have Pinterest, and I keep seeing these 13 year girls olds do "hauls" of the piles of presents they got, using a feature called story pins. One of them kept saying oh this (insert expensive item such as airpods) I got from santa. I know this sounds mean but if you had access to the internet how could they still believe, the internet is cruel ngl. I mean I just assumed most kids found out when they were 5-8 ish but I'm probably wrong ðŸ˜‚
