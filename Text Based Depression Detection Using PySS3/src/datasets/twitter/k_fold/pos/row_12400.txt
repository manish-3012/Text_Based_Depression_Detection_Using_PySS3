Life or death situation Imagine a villain put a bomb on you with two wires on it. A red one and a blue one. You finish the task youâ€™ve been given and can finally be set free. The bomber tells you to pull the blue wire to deactivate the bomb. Would you believe him? Or would you second guess and trust your instincts to pull the red one instead in hopes that what he said was a lie?
