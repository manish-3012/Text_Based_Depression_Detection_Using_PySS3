u/SnooChipmunks1276 is a liar. Really? The posts are such [r/thathappened](https://www.reddit.com/r/thathappened/) content to an unreal extent.

1. "He poured his piss into his brother's drink." That is such bs. Of course, we cannot prove anything, but the chance of someone doing this are very slim. "He thought it was the fridge." This is a lame fix for not having the basic imagination to come up with a valid explanation. How does a fridge (supposedly the same they had for years) suddenly change the flavor of one's favorite drink? That is total lack of imagination. If you're going to lie, then at least do it well.
2. "Brother shaves his head" He just had to come up with a reason to write an another bs post to get more rewards (he received 20+ rewards in the last month).
3. [u/SnooChipmunks1276](https://www.reddit.com/u/SnooChipmunks1276/) \- account has been created less than a month ago. This is probably an alt account with the sole purpose to not face any backlash if people call him out on his bullshit. Same stuff with the kid that faked cancer with an alt account.
