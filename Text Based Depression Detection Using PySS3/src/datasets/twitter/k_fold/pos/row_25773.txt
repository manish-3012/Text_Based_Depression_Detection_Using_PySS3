I think everyone, including me needs to stop being so passive and letting people walk over us I know alot of people in this sub are very shy and usually let people walk all over them. 

I think we need to stop that shit, even if it's a close friend, if they something to us we need to stick up for ourselves. At the end of the day, if they end the friendship because you wanna be treated better than they weren't worth it in the first place 

I use to be extremely passive and kneecap my sentences by being polite and apologising even  when I'm not in the wrong, and it was fucking bs
