Pixar needs to be stopped Every single movie. At the beginning. The lamp (Luxo Jr.) hops on over, hovering over the letter â€œIâ€. Then, without mercy, he jumps and repeatedly stomps the â€œIâ€ until he is crushed. The â€œIâ€ has been abused for many years, or it is a different â€œIâ€ every time, replacing the dead one from the last movie. This is something we have been witnessing and have done nothing about over the past few decades. 

This lamp has commuted assault and possibly even murder right in front of children and nobody has done anything. Every day we stray further away from god.
