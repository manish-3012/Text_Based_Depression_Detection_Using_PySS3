Apparently, being 3 months self harm free is an accomplishment. I just sulk the days away cause im bored cause my friends left me and my parents check me every 5 hours for self harm, and then one of my only friends left congratulated me for being self harm free for 3 months. I don't get it. I never got close to killing myself, its just a way for me to cope, so why do my parents give such a shit about it?
