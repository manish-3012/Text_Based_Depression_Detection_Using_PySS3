I just did research on homework Turns out that homework was invented as a punishment and to help students understand the assignment they're given. Since we now get homework pretty much every day, with or without punishments, that means that homework no longer serves it's original purpose. MEANING WE SHOULDN'T BE GETTING HOMEWORK AT ALL. Admit the students have a valid point or jump out a building.
