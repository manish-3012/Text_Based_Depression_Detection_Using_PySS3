Geometry is stupid, and Iâ€™m venting here Iâ€™m over here in geometry and itâ€™s fucking stupid. Weâ€™re doing centroids and orthocenters and whatever the fuck else and for some goddamn reason the homework is confusing as fuck. Normally I am able to get the work done pretty quick and easy, but my teacher always said â€œoh if you have no proof of this then it ainâ€™t realâ€ and Iâ€™m sitting here looking at some goddamn stupidity that has no markings or whatever, and he expects us to figure it out. Just a vent donâ€™t take this seriously but fuck the American education system tho.
