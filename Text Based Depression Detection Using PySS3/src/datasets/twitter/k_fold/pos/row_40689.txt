Am I the asshole for getting mad? I got angry at my mom's friend (woman). Moms friend toom the night train and said that she was terrified because she thought that she would have to sleep in the same "room" as 3 other males. I just got angry at that because not every man is bad or a rapist. I get why she could get scared but I still find this unfair to us men. ( sorry for bad grammar)
