This is not cool. Stop this. *Warning: This post contains shitty human behaviour.*

Every single time I post something on this subreddit, some random porn bot starts following my account. 

Targeting teens and trying to scam them using porn, also im pretty sure thats illegal.

I posted something about chemo therapy, you sick fck. Have some respect.


Like how shitty can you get?

1. Targeting underage people and trying to scam them or whatever.

2. Not looking at what the post is, so some suicidal guy with emotional problems could be ranting about something and you try to scam them. Imagine if they actually get tricked by your garbage and then they feel even worse for falling for your shitty tactics.

If this post helps someone avoid a porn bot somehow, thats good enough for me.

I have like 6 followers and 3 of them are porn bots, and need I remind you Im fucking 13. This isnt cool.
