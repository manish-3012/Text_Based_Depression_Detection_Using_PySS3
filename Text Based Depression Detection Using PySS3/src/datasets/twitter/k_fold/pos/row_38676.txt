Anyone else's friend group just meme about Among Us rather than play it Seriously my squad used to play Amongus all the time at the start of the pandemic, now the group chat is filled with amogus memes BUT WE DON'T EVEN PLAY IT

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if this is a common thing now with other people
