Felt like spreading awareness a bit Hello Iâ€™m 14 and I have chronic depression many people say that depression is temporary and in most cases it is but if someone has chronic depression it is not temporary it is chronic cannot he cured I will live with this for the rest of my life because it is not just a a mental illness it is physical too my body just does not produce enough serotonin (a hormone that makes you feel happy) for me to ever be truly happy I will never be happy and that sucks.
