This is how to know you've become successful. I commented on a pornhub video a month ago and it suddenly blew up with 180 some spam replies and 1296 likes. I reported a bunch of them and got the number down to 85 before I was bored of it, but still, I call this an absolute win.

(Also there were like, 4 new actual replies.)
