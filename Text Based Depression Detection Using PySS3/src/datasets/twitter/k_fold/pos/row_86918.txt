need advice A few weeks ago my history teacher had my class do a project where we all went into groups of 4 and filmed a dinner party between various people in history. My group had some issues filming as we all kept laughing at some parts, so they gave me the task of editing those parts out.   This was pretty easy as Iâ€™ve done the exact same thing in the past under different circumstances, so I didnâ€™t pay too much attention while doing it. After I finished I sent the edited video to the other people in my project for them to look over and turn in. A few weeks go by to today and my teacher tells my group to stay after class. She then proceeds to tell us that in the video file that was turned in there was an â€œinappropriate songâ€ that played in the middle of the whole thing. The song in question?  [Playboi Cartiâ€™s Pissy Pamper (more widely known as Kid Cudi.)](https://genius.com/Young-nudy-and-pierre-bourne-pissy-pamper-lyrics) She then proceeds to tell us that we are going to get a 50/100 for our grade and we have to re shoot the entire thing, we canâ€™t just turn in the original video. This would be fine, but grades close on Friday so we have to re do the entire thing (it took us more than a week to do) and the other people in my group are busy with jobs, sports, etc. pretty much every day, so to re shoot the video someone has to miss work or a sport which really sucks.

what do I do
