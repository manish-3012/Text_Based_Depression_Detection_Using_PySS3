So caught in a weird position So lemme cut it quick. Found a woman who loves me, and I love her, and both of us know it (and all of this is online, we're in different countries btw). But both of us have a problem od not being confident enough to be in a relationship (someone is bound to be hurt if the other person left). But we cannot deescalate to be friends anymore since we just spilt the beans (well, I did, and she did in response, but she did genuinely like me).

And now we came to the conclusion is that we stay this way and never explain this stuff to the world ever (nobody will understand me and her and the stuff we have in between and we like it being exclusive). 

Random post I wanted to make. Thanks for reading
