I'm so happy right now! :)) My mom started dating this guy a few weeks ago, and I think he's the one! They have been friends for 17 years and have helped each other through almost everything. I haven't seen my mom light up so much with anyone else and she's just so much happier now that she's with him!! Today me and my siblings played Among Us with him and his kids and we had so much fun!! The past few years have been really hard and I know that things might not work out, but I just feel like I finally have a family! :))
