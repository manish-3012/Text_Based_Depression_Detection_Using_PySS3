Any advice on how to get off once my genitals are surgically removed? Disclaimer: please don't be mean to me ^_^

Hey, I'm an 18yo AFAB enby. Due to server genital dysphoria I'm making arrangements to get my vagina, labia, uterus and possibly my clit removed. This surgery is called nullification and will leave me with a smooth crotch like a doll. (Note, this is as healthy and normal as a binary surgery)

Does anyone have any advice on how I can masturbate once everything is gone. I really need this surgery to live a normal life, but I'm really afraid I won't be able to cum. (I'm not worried about sex with a partner, because I mostly like to give pleasure rather then receive.)

Any advice? Please don't be mean.
