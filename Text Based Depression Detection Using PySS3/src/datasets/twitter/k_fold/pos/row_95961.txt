Stop focusing so much on getting a girlfriend/boyfriend and instead focus on how awesome you are. I see so many posts on here say stuff like "i'm so horny", or "i'm so lonely. if only i had a gf/bf"  
Dating won't solve all of your problems. you must fix yourself before going out and looking for someone to date. after all, if you can't even love yourself, then it's gonna be damn hard to love another. you guys all have talents, there's more to life than just being in a relationship. you guys envy  the couples you see... but their chemistry won't match the awesomeness we all have in store. funny memes, good technical insight, great artistic skills, an amazing musical ear, tremendous literary skills, etc. besides, developing your talents further will get people to notice you more. not only that, but it will bring inspiration. if you reach your full potential, you have the chance of influencing other people's entire lives. that's way better than dating, imo. besides, most teen relationships don't last.   


another important thing to remember: you will know when you find the person who is right for you. trying to take in anyone who you can get is like setting a curse upon yourself. often times, you barely know these people. you don't even know whether or not you genuinely enjoy being with them. it takes a while to find someone, but it's worth the wait. in the meantime, you do you.
