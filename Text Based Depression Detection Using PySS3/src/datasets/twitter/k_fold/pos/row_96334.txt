I just stayed up late at night chatting with a girl for the first time Not even my ex was able to do that. Is that a special indicator? We were chatting all night about all the things possible and it felt like a cakewalk and Iâ€™m happy as hell. It has never happened to me and this girl made everything so special or so nice to keep and keep going,
