I just remembered the dumbest funny joke I've ever heard. Back when I was about 10, I discovered Annoying Orange, back in 2012, I'm pretty sure everyone did. Anyways  I just remembered a skit where Slenderman gets hit by a truck  and Orange says "WOAH! I guess that's what you call a Slender Bender!"
