Nothing I do makes me happy anymore I'm not in the mood to play video games, everything on YouTube I get bored of after 1-2 mins, I dont even have the motivation to finish a drawing. Life just seems so bland now and idk why. I wanna listen to music, I have ~3k songs in my playlist and I'm sick of every single one of them. I dont have the energy to talk to any of my friends.

I just feel numb and empty.
