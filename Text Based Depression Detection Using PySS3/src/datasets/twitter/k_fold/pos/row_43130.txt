You know what grinds my gears? You know how sometimes you just suck? And you already know you suck at this one thing, but you feel kinda proud this once in a blue moon time? Then some jerk runs over and says "This looks like dogshit" in the most serious face ever. Kinda annoying to me, like I know I'm not exactly the best at this but could you have put it more bluntly man?
