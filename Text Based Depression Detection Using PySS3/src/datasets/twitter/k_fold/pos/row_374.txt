Why do some people do this? Like, I'll be like "Ma I'm so tired. Can I just rest today?" And she'll be like "Huh you're only 17. I've been through so much worse. You can't get tired."

Like??????

Ok yeah maybe you've been through much worse and maybe I am only 17 but that sill doesn't make me feel any less tired and still want to just die so you disregarding my tiredness still did fuck all.
