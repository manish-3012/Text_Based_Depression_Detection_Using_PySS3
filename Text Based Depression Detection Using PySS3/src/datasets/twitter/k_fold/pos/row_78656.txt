My fucking English teacher So we had to do an essay. Nothing too hard, just a couple of paragraphs. So colour is a big part of the subject. I get a c. I was hoping for at least a b-. When I ask her why, she says itâ€™s because i spelled grey/colour wrong. Well Iâ€™m sorry that I spell it the alternative way (which by the fucking way is verified by the Merriam Webster American English dictionary) anyways guys donâ€™t try to spell stuff alternative ways i tried and my essay got tanked.
