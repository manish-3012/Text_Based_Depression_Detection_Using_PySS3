This is weird Lately i have been acting really weird in social situations, especially in schools. Every time i talk to someone I am not that comfortable talking to i fumble and get out of breath easly while talking, this happens when i am talking  with a teacher or just with someone I don't talk to that much. Simular thing happens when I am doing stuff in front of other people, i i get called to read something i just get out of breath easly reading that, and if i get called to do a math/physics problem on the board i just completely forget everything and everything about that subject. The biggest problem is that i don't know if it is noticable to other people, because to me it is REALLY obvious. What could this be, is there some kind of problem with me, what should i do
