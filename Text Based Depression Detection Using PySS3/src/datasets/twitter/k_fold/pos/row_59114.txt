I think I'm starting to gain more confidence Nowadays I look in the mirror and y'know what, I don't automatically make a disgusted face anymore. I'm actually quite content with how I look now and how I am and I somehow made some more peace with myself and I think that's pretty cool B)

Any tips to boost this a little more? Or alternatively, is anyone going through anything similar right now?
