I failed to flirt with a girl today I was at a restaurant with my friends and I saw a pretty waitress you was probably a year or two older than me, hell she mightâ€™ve been 18 (not that I would have had a problem with that). I wanted to say something like, â€œmy friends bet me I couldnâ€™t talk to the pretty waitress, what should I order with their moneyâ€. But I wasnâ€™t sure how she would react, in fact if it was bad enough I couldâ€™ve gotten us kicked out of the restaurant. So in the end I never said anything, and now I feel bad about it.
