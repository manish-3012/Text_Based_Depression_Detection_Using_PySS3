What clothing brand is the "expensive casual" option for teens right now? Older brother, no longer a teen here. When I was in school supreme was the overly expensive streetwear brand, and before that I remember volcom was less expensive but still a pay for the brand streetwear. What brand hoodie do I buy for my teen siblings nowadays for the same effect? I see a lot of champion hoodies on amazon with a similar look to the old supreme style, but they're really not all that pricey.
