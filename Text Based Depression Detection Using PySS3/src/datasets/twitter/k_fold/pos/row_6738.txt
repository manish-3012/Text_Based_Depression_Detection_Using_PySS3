anyone else hate every single one of their classes? My classes are Government, English, Leadership, Algebra 2, Cybersecurity, Economics, and German. Leadership is the only class I can at least somewhat tolerate, but I despise every other class and my grades reflect that. I'm not able to drop any of my classes if I want to graduate and it's too late to switch classes, so I have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm worried I won't graduate this year because I'm failing a couple of classes and this is my second time taking algebra 2.

Is anyone else in a similar boat and if so, what should I do?
