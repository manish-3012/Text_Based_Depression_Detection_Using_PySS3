My dad stole $800 from me So today I was filling out the federal student aid form (my fellow seniors, you know.) And it got the my financials. I had a savings account that had around $800 (from Christmases, Birthdays, etc.) In it, so I was asking my dad about if it should go in there. Turns out he used ALL OF IT to pay the mortgage on our house. Now if he had told me, I wouldn't be upset. But now I have virtually nothing in savings and I have to move away next year for college. There's no goddamn way my dad will give me back that money. My dad talks way too much about how "we don't have much money right now" but I know that's a lie. He constantly makes my brother and I feel guilty about him having to pay for things we need, as if we WANTED to make him pay for my brother's braces when my brother DOESN'T HAVE A JOB. At first him using my savings money didn't bother me that much, but now it's really pissing me off. You could have at least told me. I've been asking for a while to transfer that into my account (because it's under his name).He never did. I now know he was just full of shit. I'm not asking for advice, just ranting.
