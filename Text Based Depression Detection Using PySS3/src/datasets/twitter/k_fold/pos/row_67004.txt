Little rant and need some advice (idk which flair to use ;-;) Okay so I like girls but I havenâ€™t told anyone (except those reading this). 

Last year one of my friends confessed that he liked me and I panicked and said that I liked him too, so then we were in a relationship that went way too fast in many ways and became very toxic very quickly. Earlier this year I ended things because my mental health was getting worse every day I was with him. Ya think Iâ€™d learn from my past mistakes and avoid relationships with my friends who confess but nope. Last week another friend said he liked me and I did the same thing they I did last year. I know for sure I donâ€™t feel the same way but I donâ€™t wanna end things because heâ€™s happy with me... I donâ€™t know what I should do...
