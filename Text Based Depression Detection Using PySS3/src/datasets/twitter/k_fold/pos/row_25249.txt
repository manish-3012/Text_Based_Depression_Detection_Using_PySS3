What's a good job that you can actually enjoy having as a teenager? I'm 16 right now so I don't have many options, I've only had 3 jobs since I was 14 and although I do enjoy the money there's nothing else I really enjoy about them. I worked as a silverware roller for a year then a hostess at a breakfast restaurant for a year and now I'm a hostess at a bar and grill.  Are there any enjoyable, good paying jobs I can get at my age? (btw I live in Texas, USA so it might be different for different places)
