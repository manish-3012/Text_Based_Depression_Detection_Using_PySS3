what do i do when someone compliments me in public? ok so basically i was at urban outfitters today and these people were like "i like ur pants" and i wasnâ€™t sure if they were talking to me so i just said "thanks" and then ran away cus i got embarrassed and then someone else said "ur so cool" and iâ€™m pretty sure they were talking to me so i just said "thanks" again and it was so awkward help like they probably werenâ€™t even talking to me but they were near me so idek lol
