Not sure what to do Iâ€™m having a really hard time breathing. Cause itâ€™s winter I canâ€™t breathe through my nose, and I feel like Iâ€™m having an asthma attack( I do have asthma) . My inhaler isnâ€™t helping. My hearts beating fast and Iâ€™m shaking. What do I do? Is there any breathing methods?
