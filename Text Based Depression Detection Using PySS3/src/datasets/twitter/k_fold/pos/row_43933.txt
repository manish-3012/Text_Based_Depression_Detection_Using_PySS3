I absolutely hate it so incredibly much. Since this is a public forum full of people I don't know, let me express my complete hate for my parents.  
Now, don't get me wrong, they hate me back.  
It's currently 8:30 AM, and already, they've:  
\- Made me late for class (they forced me to clean THEIR room at about 8:20)  
\- Screamed at me for being late to class  
\- Threatened to pull me out of school  
\- Blamed ME for my 8-YEAR-OLD SISTER being tired when she woke up (SOMEHOW I "kept her up")  
\- And screamed at me for how worthless I am  
I genuinely feel like they don't care about me. They constantly show favoritism towards my sister, trying to justify it by saying she is still a baby (she's 8) and she needs more attention.  
Let's not forget how much they like sparking rumors about me in the family.  
Watch them be surprised when I turn 18, leave, and never come back.  
Rant over.
