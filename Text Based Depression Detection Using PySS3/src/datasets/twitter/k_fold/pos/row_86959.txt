I dont know what to do Last March. Beginning of lockdown. My parents forced me to give cie exams early. Me knowing damn well I cant do it, I still tried. In the end I gave up. I cant do it. I decided to live life till the results come. I knew I would fail. And bcz im asian I will be hated by society and my parents. Thats why I hate society and expectations so much. In the end I thought of ending it all days before the result. But this December I found hope I found my passion, I found programming. I realized I could have whatever I want. Without the help of school. I grew to hate school more and more. But my parents just wont get this. They never understand me. The generation gap is too big. Today was the result day, and I failed as I expected. But my parents are too dissapointed. This is the reason why I thought of ending it all. Now I have conflicting feeling. I dont know what to do. Im so full of life.
My parents never really understand me. They just keep comparing them to my cousins. And they always get the wrong idea of what im saying.
