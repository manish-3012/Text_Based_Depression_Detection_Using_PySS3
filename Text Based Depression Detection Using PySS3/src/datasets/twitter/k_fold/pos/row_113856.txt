I just realized my room has shit decor Iâ€™ve got:
- two small mismatching ikea tables in size and color next to each other for my cat
- an ugly wire shelf to put plants and other shiz on
- a lamp on one of the ikea tables with two biscuit cookie boxes under it to make it taller
- a folding table as a bedside table 
- my cat has two litter boxes in my room=ugly and stink
- the random things I put up on my wall
- a crate and a cardboard box for my cat

And then rest is ok, my cat obviously has taken over ðŸ™„ But in the end itâ€™s my room and Iâ€™m comfy with it :)
