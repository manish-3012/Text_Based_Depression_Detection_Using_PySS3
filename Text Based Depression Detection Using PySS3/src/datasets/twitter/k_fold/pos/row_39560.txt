On behalf of most American teenagers, we don't give a shit about the millions of people yelling "SaVe ThE cHiLdReN!!!!1!1!!" American politics has politicized child abuse. In an attempt to "own the libs" or something, right wing groups like QAnon have been accusing everyone on the left of being pedophiles and screaming "SaVe ThE cHiLdReN!!!!1!!". They don't give a shit about anybody's damn kids. They only care about owning the libs. Child abuse has been used for political advantage to such an extent that it doesn't mean anything anymore. On YouTube, I get ads for Perdue (dude running for Georgia senator) that plainly use children as marketing. Its just disgusting, and on behalf of many teenagers, I say that we don't give a damn about your baseless claims of "saving the children". Your platform is based on child abuse and you really couldn't give less of a shit.
