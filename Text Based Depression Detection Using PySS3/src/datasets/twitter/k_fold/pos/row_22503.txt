Day 31+ until Iâ€™m ungrounded for getting a fucking 89 in one class of posting lines from the Bee Movie every day until I get a s/o I wonder where they were.

I don't know
  
Their day's not planned.

Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.

You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.

Right.
  
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.

It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.

Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
  
Those ladies?

Aren't they our cousins too?
  
Distant. Distant.
  
Look at these two.
  
Couple of Hive Harrys.

Let's have fun with them.
  
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!

He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!

  Oh, my!

I never thought I'd knock him out.
  
What were you doing during this?

Trying to alert the authorities.
  
I can autograph that.
  
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
  
Yeah. Gusty.
  
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.

Six miles, huh?

Barry!

A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.

  Maybe I am.

You are not
  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
