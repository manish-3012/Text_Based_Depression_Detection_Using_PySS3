Met an old crush of mine that i still have feelings for and now im sad It all happened a few days ago when i was waiting for the subway and when i wanted to step in a girl began talking to me asking if its me i begin to recognise her and realize that she was a girl from my middle school that i had feelings for but was too big of a coward to confess to her. She was really intelligent pretty and stuff but mostly intelligent and that made her special. We sat down and talked about how your lifes are going on how school is going and all that it didnt last very long because i had to get out a few subway stations later. I immediatly felt sad when i went out because she probably knew that i liked her and that we didnt adress this or anything like that i miss her seeing her go gave me a feeling of lonelyness
