a friend of mine made a account here and his post on aita got removed so he asked me to post it on a sub where it could not get removed AITA for making a joke on how cats are better at "breeding" than dogs?

So my wife's friend, who we'll call Lucy, has a dog, who we'll call Mojo. I don't hate dogs, but I don't like the little rascals either. Lucy though, is super passionate about dogs. She loves em. I don't get why, but I go with it. Now, Lucy got her dog in 2011. Fast forward 10 years later, blah blah blah, she has a bunch of other dogs, Mojo being the original and stuff. So, I was chillin with Lucy, you know, popping the corn. And the dog, Mojo, just walks up to me and bites me. Now I'm tearing up, but I hold in my tears while Lucy pets the little scalawag. The little furball looks at me, and I look at Lucy. I say "Ya know, cats are better at 'breeding' and makin things work, ya know." Lucy just calmly walks out, I could hear her mumble something like "I'm calling my husband". So Reddit, AITA?
