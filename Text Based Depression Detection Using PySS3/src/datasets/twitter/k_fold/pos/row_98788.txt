Quick question, do you guys get breaks in-between zoom classes? I don't, and have to spend 8 hours in front of my laptop.

I have to hold my urges to go to the bathroom until school is over, because my teachers want to see my face in the meeting, and if I am off-screen or with my camera off, I'll end up getting kicked out and marked absent.

So, do you? Or are your teachers more understanding?
