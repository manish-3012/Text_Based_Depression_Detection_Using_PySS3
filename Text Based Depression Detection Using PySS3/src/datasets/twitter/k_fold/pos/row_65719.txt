Stood up for a girl today. Pretty proud of myself. Sheâ€™s a little on the bigger side. So what? No excuse to put her down for it right? Exactly. Glad you agree. 

She mentioned she wanted to go into the marines. Which is a very respectable profession I think. That should be admired. But no. This kid on the bus was laughing at it. A bunch of kids made sour faces at him, but Iâ€™ve watched him relentlessly make comments against her. Itâ€™s disgusting to listen to, and since Iâ€™m on the bigger side too, I relate with her. I get the pain. I look at the kid and say â€œsize does matter. You can be bigger,â€ and look at her, â€œor be really really really smallâ€ looking at the jackass, â€œand still be just fineâ€. 

He throws the 2nd grader response â€œwhat? Are you looking through my window or something?â€

And I just said â€œno youâ€™re over compensatingâ€ and left it at that. 

He hasnâ€™t said anything in 2 days and I made a friend :). 

I hate confrontation since Iâ€™m bitch sometimes but it felt necessary to me ig
