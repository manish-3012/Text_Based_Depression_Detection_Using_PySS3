How does your horniness manifest itself? This must seem like a wtf question on a first sight, but I'm asking because I think that I am less horny than I should be; but I'm not sure, because I don't know what's the norm, so I want to ask y'all.

I, for example, masterbate only when I intentionally decide to, never because I'd be feelin' like it, and seeing something sexual (nude women, porn) doesn't arouse me as much.
