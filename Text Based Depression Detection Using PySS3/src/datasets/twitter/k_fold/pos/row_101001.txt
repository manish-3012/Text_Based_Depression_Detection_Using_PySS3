my best friend died in the car accident a few days ago... I lost my only best friend. Now I don't have him, my friend, and the mood for a long time. 
there's no one else I can talk to. 
My friend's father called him to his father's native village in nature to go fishing and relax with him. my friend had already written to me about it and was very pleased. Both me and him. Before leaving, he wrote to me that he would rarely get in touch. He went and arrived successfully. He was resting with my father, from time to time wrote to me and threw off photos of what he was doing. And then came the day when he had to go home. We agreed to meet him at our favorite place, where we often walked. I went to bed waiting for the next day and meeting a friend. I woke up and saw that my mother was in a state of shock. I asked her what happened. And she told me that a friend of mine died in an accident. My father's car skidded and they flew into the trees. died on the spot. I had a helpless feeling, a sense of confusion. From morning till night, I just cried. This went on for several days. Right now I'm just in a deep depression. Now I sit all the time and remember all the best moments, and I watch our photos and videos, remember how we played all days in cs:go, fortnite and other games. he was a best friend, and now I do not know what to do, because this scar in my soul for a long time ...
