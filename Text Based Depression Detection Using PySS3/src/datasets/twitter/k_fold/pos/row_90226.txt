I need hobbies pls assist My parents are on my case and want me to get a hobby besides video games. I read a lot but I don't consider it a hobby. I used to build legos a lot and am still a big lego fan but I can't really take it up as a hobby because legos are expensive as heck. I'm looking forward to suggestions
