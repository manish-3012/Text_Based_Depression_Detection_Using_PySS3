Dad:â€Why do I need to buy a snowblower, I have three strong sons who can shovel snow?â€ Well, since my brothers got â€œtiredâ€ and I had to shovel 18â€ of heavy wet snow mostly by myself, I think your argument against snowblowers sucks. Now, excuse me while I go try to find my testicles, they seem to have disappeared from the cold.
