I miss my Christmas Past Yesterday I had a session with my therapist through video phone, and she spotted my fully decorated Christmas tree in the background. She loved it, and I got excited to show her Christmas cards I wrote for my friends as well as art crafts. I told her about Christmas movies I've been watching the past week and my plans for this month. She was very impressed at how much festive I am and I inspired her to do the same thing. She then had to ask a question in particular.

Am I depressed? No, but I told her I'm sad instead. I grew up in Germany with my mother and we got to experience several things such as Weihnachtsmarkt, Saint Nicholas Day, warmth and love from everyone, hanging out with friends, etc. When we were little kids, local restaurant owners used to give us a basket of free desserts after school on the way to home. We absolutely loved Christmas.

8 years ago, we had to move to the US just to live with my dad and older sister before my mother's death shortly afterwards. Everything was new to me and I was lost. My Christmas wasn't the same anymore and my dad doesn't know German traditions. He was fine for the first few years before he became obsessed with fake women online and drink a lot. My sister used to do hard drugs and she drinks a lot just like our dad. I lost more relatives and friends in between 2012 and today. They wallow in darkness for a long time, and my dad got an absolute crap tree. I couldn't stand the sight of it for a few years, so I ended up buying my own Christmas tree for my bedroom last month.

I wanted to do something about it to keep up with my Christmas spirit even if it isn't the same as my days back in Germany. We always loved it, and I would like to keep up with traditions even if she's gone. This is probably stupid, but I don't feel like I want to speak English in person anymore for this month. I want to speak German like I'm back at home, but guess it's impossible now. I miss Germany and everything.
