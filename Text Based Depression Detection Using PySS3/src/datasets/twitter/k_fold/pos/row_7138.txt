10/10 would recommend It's kinda fun story
I have that one tall friend, he's like 1,87m tall. Around Wednesday we met with a couple of friends, like, just to spend some time together. 
It was quite cold tho. 
I was dressed in a shirt, hoodie and a jacket. The tall friend had only shirt and jacket and he told us he's warm. Then he took off his jacket and handed it to me just for a moment. Well what could I do? I put it on and it was so loose, but also very warm. 

Thank you my fren ^^

Update:
He's sick now (hmm I wonder why)
