TIL Jeffrey Dahmer (one of Americaâ€™s most famous murderers) was almost caught by not a police officer, but by a normal woman For context, Jeffrey Dahmer murdered 17 boys and men from 1978 to 1991 and also did a lot more horrible things to the victims I will not go into.

Anyway, one of his victims was out in the open injured for the time being when a few women came up to the boy to help him. They called the police just as Dahmer arrived and tried to convince the women his victim was his boyfriend and that he was only drunk. However, one of the women was observant and noticed there was blood on the victim and tried to hold up Dahmer so the police could arrive before he got away. The two other women helped her keep him around until the police arrived.

So the police arrived and approached Dahmer to confront him what was going on. He gave a bunch of excuses and the officers didnâ€™t seem to bat an eye at his reasons. However, the woman knew something was up and pulled one of the officers to the side to inform him something wasnâ€™t right and the victim was injured. But the officer told her off and even called her horrible names in the process, saying she had no idea what she was talking about. And so in the end, Dahmer got away unscaved and later finished the victim off.
