I hate my damn pre algebra teacher so fucking much!!!! So I finish doing 2.5 hours worth of math homework and the next day in class â€œso did you finish the two homework assignmentsâ€ â€œI thought it was just the oneâ€ â€œwell thatâ€™s why you check (name of website we use)â€ â€œokay I guess Iâ€™ll just use my delay dayâ€ â€œoh well those are worth 10 points by the end of the trimester if you donâ€™t use them and I think you have a homework pass here at school(Iâ€™m full virtual and she never told me I got this itâ€™s for getting a good grade on a test)â€ anyway long story short I wasted 2.5 hours of my life because of incompetence. Iâ€™m in 7th grade, canâ€™t wait til high school!
