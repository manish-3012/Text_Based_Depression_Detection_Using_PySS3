Curious if this is ok So, I'm more just wondering about the subreddits reaction to me being here. 

I'm a 25 y/o studying to be psychiatrist (a psychologist who goes to med school too), in order to specialize in adolescent psych.

I'm half using the subreddit to get an idea of the, albeit low sample size, feel for the current humor/affect of current adolescents, as this age group will be who I primarily want to help when I'm fully licensed. 

But obviously i'm not a teen, and I don't want to intrude on here, even though anyone can just walk in, I, personally, don't want to infringe upon this alcove of the internet where teens can get together themselves. 

The other half of me being here is it's one of the only subreddit with high quality memes and not non stop politics, lol. 

Basically just curious if this sub is cool with me being here, despite my age, considering the reasoning. 

Tl;dr: 25 year old me studying adolescent psychiatry likes to use this sub to keep somewhat up to date on adolescent humor and trends. While i'd love to stay here in the sub, I wanted to make sure it wasn't creepy / invasion of this "teenager only" space that some might feel. 

Disclaimer: I'm not licensed yet, and the most I can do, legally, if anyone were to DM me about mental health advice, is to direct you to a more capable person that can help. 

Thanks :)
