A donkey kick to the teeth (Just a small rant)

When someone makes plans with me, and then they flunk, every now and again I don't bother, but repeat offenders piss me off to hell. Since we're going and having plans made by them, they flunk out. Since a certain person has done it repeatedly (going on 15 times) really makes me want to punch myself in the face repeatedly from frustration.

Thank you this has been my rant.
