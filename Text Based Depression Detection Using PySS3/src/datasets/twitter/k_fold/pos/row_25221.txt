I just got terrible news from my orthodontist &amp;#x200B;

So I have an underbite. I had an expander for a year when I was in 4th grade and braces for a 5th/6th. I'm really insecure about my smile. I have a fucking underbite. 

I assumed that after another year of braces and stuff, it would go away. I thought that by 15/16, I would be done. But no. I have to get braces for another year which is fine. But then I have to wait until my jaw stops growing for the next step. The next step is jaw surgery. The orthodontist said that in the best-case scenario, I get the surgery the summer before college. Worst case scenario, I get it when I'm 20. I hate my smile so much. It's one of my biggest insecurities, and it isn't going to be fixed until I'm 18 at best. Also, I'm a circus performer/aerialist, and I'm worried about the 6-8 weeks off that ill be forced to take after the surgery. 

I spent yesterday afternoon processing. I don't know what to say/do.
