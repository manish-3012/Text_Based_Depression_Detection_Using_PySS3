Shut up, do this, donâ€™t avoid it. 25 push-ups
25 sit-ups
25 squats
Per hour
Every day

In proper form for 12 hours of your day. Also cold showers. Small amounts of exercise for a decent total daily workout, this amount of working out and cold showers will help with mental clarity and depression, wonâ€™t fix anything but it will improve you. The physical gains after a couple months a noticeable. If you canâ€™t do an hour then makeup that hour into another hour, it will be hard early on but after a few weeks your tolerance will be much higher. Good luck.
