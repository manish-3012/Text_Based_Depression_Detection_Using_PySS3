I need a favor from an Andrew So on this discord, the admin was meaning to say â€œAnd emojisâ€ but it autocorrected to â€œAndrew emojisâ€. So I need an Andrew to display the basic emotions like happy, sad, laughing, disgust, anger, and content. I canâ€™t really pay you anything, but it would be funny. I might also get you on the Minecraft server...

Send me the images over my discord @ Trainboy#7154 

Thank you
