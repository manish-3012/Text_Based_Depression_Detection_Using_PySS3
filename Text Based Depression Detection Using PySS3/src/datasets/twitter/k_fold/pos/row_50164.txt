I had my first kiss with a male (M 16) So this is quite strange 

It wasn't my first kiss.
It was my first kiss with a male.

Yes, i just discovered i am gay as a friend of mine tried to kiss me.
It was fucking awkward since i liked it but without thinking about it i bumped him away.

I feel awful for him and don't know what to do.
Should i go to him and tell him the truth? But fuck i mean, I suspected it, but i just realized what being gay af means and i am not ready to just do coming out/have a relationship.
