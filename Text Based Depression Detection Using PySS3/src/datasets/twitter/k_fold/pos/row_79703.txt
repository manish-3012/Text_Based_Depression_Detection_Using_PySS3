Cleaning the living room while my parents are asleep. I know I ordered a little more than I usually do, so I figured Iâ€™d clean the whole living room. I figured my Mom would really appreciate it, since sheâ€™s the only person that ever cleans :/ my bad, mom.

I know itâ€™s 10:00pm, but its not too late to do something for your parents while theyâ€™re asleep. They went out of their way for you, so Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™d really appreciate it if you did something for them. ðŸ˜€ðŸ‘
