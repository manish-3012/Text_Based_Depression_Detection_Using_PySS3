My sister and her class were watching something called dante's peak (I think) and then you'll probably laugh at what happened 1. There was a swear word in the movie and then the teacher was marking things and everyone was like shocked pikachu.

2. A grandma had a dog and the class were more worried about the dog than the grandma , they were worried when the dog went away from one scene and they didn't care the grandma died in one.
