I feel so sad now :((( I just saw a dream where I was hanging out with a cute girl from my class. She was talking about how she didn't have a boyfriend, so then I said "How about me?" Then she looked at me with the greatest smile and said: "Oh my god, yes!" Then we held hands and shit... I haven't felt a feeling like this in a long time...  Should I try getting this girl? 

Actually, I'm going to confess something. In the 7th grade, when this girl was together with some guy, we had a sleepover with some other friends too (Her boyfriend wasn't there), and the girl slept really close to me. Like, hands-touching- kind of close. She tried to shush the two friends from telling anyone... Then in the morning she put the blanket over us, hugged me and said: "There is nothing wrong with this.." And then she also said: "If we break up, I'm taking you next" Did she like me back then? I'm really insecure about my looks and I think I may be too ugly for her. Or anyone.
