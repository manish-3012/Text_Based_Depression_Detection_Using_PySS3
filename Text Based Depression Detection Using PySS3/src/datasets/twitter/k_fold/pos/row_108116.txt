Unban huawei, dont ban them just because they're chinese. huawei is a formerly quick rising cell phone brand that makes good quality and affordable phones but the us banned them due to them being chinese. well why not ban things made in china altogether to fuck your suplies up because many of the factories are in china due to cheap labor force so many things will be affected why not ban airpods cuz they're assembled in china if you didnt ban them just because they're chinese well the goverment might on a payroll maybe paid by samsung or apple or how much is it but you shouldnt ban an app just because of their race and thats racist
