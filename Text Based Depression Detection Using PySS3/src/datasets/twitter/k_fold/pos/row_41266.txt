Looking for gamer friends Hello, Iâ€™ve getting annoyed of always getting in games with toxic people so I was looking for people around my age to play with me! Iâ€™m 13 so as long as your near my age we can play together. I play on PS4 (username: snappy_bc). I play Minecraft, Dead by Daylight, Fall Guys, Rainbow six Siege, Hyperscape, and Apex. Feel free to dm me if u wanna play!
