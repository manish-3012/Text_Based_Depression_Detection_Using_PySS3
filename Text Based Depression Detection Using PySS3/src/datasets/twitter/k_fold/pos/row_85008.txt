I am so evil I am so fucking evil that I'm probably the evilest person in this world.  here's the story: for computer science we had to get a few certificates from [code.org](https://code.org) and when you do the "hour of code" puzzle you have the "I finished" button next to the steps and I clicked it and in 10 min I got 12 certificates and when I brought it to school I got an A. and for those wondering our school doesn't have a [code.org](https://code.org) classroom so they can't know if I cheated. I am so evil that I scare myself
