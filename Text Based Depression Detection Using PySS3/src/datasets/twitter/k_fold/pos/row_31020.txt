A girl in my school is prostituting herself I'm not fucking joking. A friend gives me a screenshot of snap she took with the info of her *"services"*.

So I think to myself. *"No, this can't be true. This is just an attempt to to ruin her life with her -ahem- history."* So I ask her directly.

*"Are you selling your body?"*

She replies *"Yes, are you interested?"* I decline. Mama raised a good boi.

So get this, she's giving out physical copies of nudes ($5), handjobs ($10), blowjobs ($15), and literal sex with a minor for $20. She's 16.

Now I have two problems with this.

1. She's a minor selling herself. This is disgusting on a new level. Now while minors getting it on with each other ain't so bad. It's the fact that she's putting a price tag on this.

2. This is a really stupid marketing design. A constant $20? I'll tell you the Art of the Deal. What she could **AT LEAST** be doing, is charging $20 per ejaculation (for the guy) and offer 50% off when she climaxes. I don't need to tell you why this strategy works.

But yeah, there it is. What the fuck is wrong with this generation.
