I truly donâ€™t know what I want to be, Iâ€™m scared of leaving high school Iâ€™m a senior in high school and Iâ€™m having constant  thought about soon choosing a career but in truth I donâ€™t know what I want to be. I have passions but I guess Iâ€™m afraid to chase them. Iâ€™m scared of being stuck at a repetitive job doing the same thing over and over, until I retire and drop dead. Iâ€™ve being looking on what I might be interested but I donâ€™t find anything. Iâ€™m really confused, maybe itâ€™s because of the quarantine and maybe my mental health isnâ€™t where it use to be, I just donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m stuck and just looking at these words in a dark background makes me feel anxious like thereâ€™s nothing else in the world. Iâ€™m not sure what to do.
