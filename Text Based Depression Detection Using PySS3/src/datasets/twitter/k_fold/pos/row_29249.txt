I found out I have a fan club and I donâ€™t know what to do with this information TLDR: I have a fan club of girls in grade 7-9

Context: I (14m) go to a private school that has kids from grades 7-12. I am a grade 9 student.

The other day I was talking to this new girl in my French class and I was telling her who my friends are when she randomly mention I have a fan club. I was like okaaay, what do you want me to do with this info? She was like I donâ€™t know, I just think itâ€™s the weirdest thing ever. I asked her why do I have a fan club and she said she didnâ€™t know, but that theyâ€™re all girls in my grade down to grade 7. I think it might have something to do with my extremely handsome face (/s). 

If Iâ€™m being serious, I can infer that I have a fan club for two reasons:

1. I am a very good student (all grades over 93) and these impressionable girls admire some number that I receive on a piece of paper, or

2. These girlsâ€™ mothers think I am a good example of someone who is a hard working student and should look up to me.

But yeah, just thought Iâ€™d share this weird thing I came to know of.
