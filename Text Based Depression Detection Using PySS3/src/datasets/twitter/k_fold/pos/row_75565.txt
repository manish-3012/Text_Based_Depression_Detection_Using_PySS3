Iâ€™ve been feeling lonely lately Iâ€™ve been feeling lonely lately. This isnâ€™t really the best sub to talk about it, but I just feel like I have to say something about it and keep my thoughts somewhere.

Iâ€™ve been finding myself looking for people to do things with more often. Usually, this means Iâ€™m trying to find people to play video games with me. And usually, my efforts are fruitless.

Itâ€™s hard for me to make friends, and trying to maintain online friendships is just difficult for me. So, more often than not, I spend my free time at home in front of my computer watching YouTube videos or browsing reddit.

I also have a group of good friends IRL which I keep in touch often every day with on discord (because you know, something happening right now makes it hard for people to meet outside). The problem is, Iâ€™ve just started school this year and Iâ€™m quickly realizing how we just wonâ€™t have time for each other anymore. Homework and studying is going to be super important, especially since weâ€™re a year away from having to be accepted into university. 90% of the time nowadays, Iâ€™m not hanging out with my friends on Discord anymore. 

Iâ€™m a rather introverted person, so this social distancing stuff has been doing okay for me. Or at least, so I thought. Now I kinda realize how empty I feel spending time alone. Itâ€™s not crippling or anything, just something that I notice a bit after sitting for hours in front of my PC. 

I wish I could see my friends again, or make new ones, and share fun times together. 

I also find myself wanting a significant other. Doesnâ€™t seem like Iâ€™ll be finding anyone soon... 

Iâ€™m kind of jealous of the two couples in my friend group. Theyâ€™re all very nice people which I respect, but every now and then I just go, â€œWhat about me?â€

I hate this situation Iâ€™m in. I was supposed to make new friends this year. Iâ€™m in a new program with tons of new faces, but none which I will ever get to know. I want to talk to people I know, have fun together. I want someone to love me that I can love back, and maybe get some of that human contact I crave every night I sleep in my lonely bed. 

If you want to maybe be friends with me, go ahead. But itâ€™s probably not gonna work out. Iâ€™ve been there and done that. But Iâ€™m not gonna lie, I would be god damn glad if it did.

I think Iâ€™ll join extracurricular activities, clubs at my school. If you people have any other advice for me, or at least some kind words, I would be very thankful. 

To all you who are feeling a little bit down, donâ€™t ever give up in the fight. Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll feel better than I am right now, and Iâ€™m sure you will too. Get some help if you need to. Never be afraid to reach out to people. Love you, bye.
