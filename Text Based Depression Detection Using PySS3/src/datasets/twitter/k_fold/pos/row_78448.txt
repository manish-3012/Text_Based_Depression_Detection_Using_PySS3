I just suddenly remembered the school shooting that happened near me in 2018 and now I'm sad Like bro wtf why's this shit gotta happen

I live in a safe area but just 15 minutes from me a guy was shot and killed by a classmate, that's so fucking sad. If there's one bright side to online learning, it's that school shootings won't happen (if everyone is virtual anyhow)
