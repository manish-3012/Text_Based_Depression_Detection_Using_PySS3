Just a vent Iâ€™m sorry if this doesnâ€™t belong here Iâ€™m just really anxious

I donâ€™t know if I should NSFW this so just tell me if I shouldnâ€™t 

Ok so uhh my dog was growling at my brother cause he was trying to take his bone away and he got really aggressive so my dad stopped him. 
And uhh basically he got really mad (btw he was drunk Iâ€™m pretty sure). 
He told us to go to bed and after that he ranted to us that if we were to make the dogs mad that we should just kill the dogs. 
He went really ham on that part like â€œyou should go to the end of the dock (we live on a lake) and put a bullet through his head and let him float awayâ€ as well as â€œstab him in the chest and watch him bleed outâ€. 
I am very emotional and Iâ€™m on my period so that doesnâ€™t help at all. 
Iâ€™m crying In my bed right now and I donâ€™t know what to do. 
Iâ€™m thinking if calling my mom in the morning (my parents are divorced) and telling her everything. 
I donâ€™t know if she can do anything but I hope she can.
