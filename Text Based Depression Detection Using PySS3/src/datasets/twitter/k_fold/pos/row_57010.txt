My opinion on why tik tok is trash Now this is my opinion of you like it go ahead but Iâ€™ll list my reasons as to why I think tik tok is bad.

1. 70% of tik tok content is just people doing cringe dances to copyrighted songs. Thatâ€™s objectively not entertaining on its own but it is hilarious seeing how people think their videos are so good.
Now these people probably couldnâ€™t do what like 100 people have done before and be a pro tik toker but they probably could easily land a job as a clown in a circus. (Sorry if that sounds harsh)

2. I used to have tik tok for a month and I can safely say that only like 5% of people on that app have any real talent at what their trying to do. No dancing your ass of to dogshit music is not talent.

3. Tik Tok has strange and dangerous trends like
the â€œcorona challengeâ€ where people lick toilet bowls (yes I know, disgusting) or that trend where people would dress like Holocaust victims and make videos in their perspective is also just tone deaf and not appropriate 

Now if you think this is just hive mind stuff itâ€™s not.
I downloaded Tik tok before reddit and then deleted it after 1 month. This is genuinely my opinion and the reason this is a hive mind opinion is because a lot of people feel the same way about this app.

Now Iâ€™m sorry if this sounded harsh but I just needed to get it off my chest.
