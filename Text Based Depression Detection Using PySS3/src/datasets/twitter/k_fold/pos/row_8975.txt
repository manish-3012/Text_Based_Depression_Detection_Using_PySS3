So instead of doing school today Theyâ€™re making us walk in a forest so thatâ€™s annoying. But then theyâ€™re gonna give us cookies and hot chocolate. Cookies are pretty cool but Iâ€™m lactose intolerant so I donâ€™t think I should drink the hot chocolate but I donâ€™t wanna be impolite and say no.
