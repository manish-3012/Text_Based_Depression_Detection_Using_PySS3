To my bros out there: remember that it's MOB (money over B******) Focus on the bag and yourself. I'm rly in love with this one girl and I'm tryna make her mine and I really been stressing about it. I have to remind myself of this and I have faith that God will put us together when the time is right. In the meantime I'm tryna run up these checks and improve myself so I work hard everyday and stay on my grind. My heart is real fragile but I pray everyday and keep my energy positive. Keep chasing the bay y'all
