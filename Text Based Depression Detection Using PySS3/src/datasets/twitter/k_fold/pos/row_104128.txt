This is fucking bullshit It's been 2 days and my bank still hasn't deposited my mobile deposit, they said it was approved but it wont fucking go through 

My mom isn't responding to my texts so I have to walk for 3 hours to get to my house 

I haven't had breakfast since I didn't have time to eat at my house and I cant afford lunch

I've only had coffee and a bang energy drink
