am i a bad person for being uncomfortable around one of my close friends? hi I normally donâ€™t turn to Reddit for advice but right now I have literally nobody to talk to about this because all of my friends are associated with the close friend I mentioned earlier 
 
weâ€™ll call my close friend â€œ A â€œ. friend a has been one of my close friends for a good year now, and weâ€™ve been thru a lot together. 
 
let me preface this with: I broke up with a girl who immediately got onto dating someone the week afterward, and me and friend a mutually agreed that was kind of a :/ thing to do. 
 
then, about a couple of weeks later after me and friend A agreed that was a pretty shit thing my ex did, friend A breaks up with her partner and then two days later starts talking about her new crush on some dude from her school 
 
and this .. is making me uncomfortable. because it feels almost hypocritical? because friend A was very adamant on saying how bad of a thing my ex was doing for moving on in under a week, but then sheâ€™s doing that too??
 
am I a bad person for feeling this way? please help :(
