Teenagers of Reddit, what is the best way to motivate you to do chores? I am home right now....doing most of the household chores.... and I parent two teenagers, 14 and almost 16. The older one, male, will do chores when asked but never remembers to do assigned chores. He usually does not complain.

The younger one, female, mouths off, says that any arrangement I think up is not fair, and is just generally a pill.  

I would like these two to do the very small amount of chores I have for them, and keep their rooms fairly clean. I am a pretty laid back parent, but I can lay down more laws.

What advice can you give me to motivate these kids? All my parent friends are saying to ground them or heap more chores on them.
