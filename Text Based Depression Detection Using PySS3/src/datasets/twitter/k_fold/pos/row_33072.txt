So I had my first match with adults in football Iâ€˜m fifteen (nearly 16) years old and was able to play with my local football club. Every other player was 20-28 years old and at first, I was very concerned that I wouldnâ€˜t get a single pass but everyone was very kind to me. Unfortunately, we lost by one goal, but nevertheless, I was very happy with my performance.
