A poem about my 1st year on reddit 1 year,
365
Oh it was, a jolly time.
I found some subs, that gave me fear
Oh it was, a jolly year.
I found weird shit,
like among us porn
Oh my sanity, which I must mourn
Reddit is, a really deep pit
Oh the memes, I like to binge.
And pokimane's sub, that makes me cringe.
Thank you all, for one great year (on reddit)
I must admit, I shed a tear



Thank you all
