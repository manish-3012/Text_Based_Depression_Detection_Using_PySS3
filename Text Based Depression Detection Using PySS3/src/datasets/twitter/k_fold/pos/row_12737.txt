Dino Shaped Bruh Nuggets In my school, we have to do these agendas before we leave for like homework and stuff, and the teachers always check that they're done. But yesterday I wrote "No tide pods before dinner" and today I wrote a haiku about a shark eating my leg and they blew right past them. Like bruh why do they even check them if they don't READ them? :/
