I GOT A B IN MATHS Ive been struggling with a combination of high functioning autism and adhd and thus find it difficult to pay attention to things im not invested in, this works in conjunction with the fact that i know how fucked the system is, this has led me to procrastinate a lot and have a very narcissistic world view. When my results for my college course and maths exam were due, i expected to bearly pass my course and fail my maths, but instead, i not only got a merit, but a B! previously i only got ds and cs due to my distain for the out of date education system that constantly threw me into a furnace and swept my remains under the rug, so this is a huuuge step forward for me, i am due to change courses which was my hope and will not have to resit my maths exam! lifes lookin pretty goid for me atm. and to those who arent doing very well, people may say its your fault, but the education system hasnt had a substantial changed in around 150 years.
