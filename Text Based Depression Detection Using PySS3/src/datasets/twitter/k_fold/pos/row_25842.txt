How do you report an adult that keeps messaging you after you've told them to stop? I spent ages trying to work out how to report this guy who kept messaging me after I told him to stop, I don't know how old he was all I know is he said he was old and he said he wasn't a teenager. All I could find was the ability to report someone who sends child porn but he thankfully didn't do that. I want to do as much as I can to make sure he doesn't go messaging other underage girls. :( The whole time I was so scared and felt helpless, even though it probably sounds stupid because I was in the safety of my home, but I've never felt so vulnerable before. I didn't even know how to block him until the wonderful mods here helped me out, that gave me a sigh of relief but I'm still worried about other people he can target. Is there anything I can do?
