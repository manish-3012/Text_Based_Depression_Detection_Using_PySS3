I'm probably mad to post this and I regret you reading it I'm not over emotional. Or at least, I'm not the kind who cries in movies or songs. And I hate to cry.

So why in the hell could I not go through one night this week without crying??

I could never relate to all you guys saying "I feel so alone" or "I'm depressed" and I always felt like an outsider in this sense. I mean, I have a great life and I don't like people complaining when they have a great life too!

I won't go into details here (simply because it's boring) but I consider the life I'm leading extremely lucky.

And suddenly it was like a "welcome to the club" moment. 

And I always ask myself, *what changed?* Is this a teenager phase that will pass soon? Or is this more... real?

I have no friends other than two guys I met online and never actually met. I can't find myself. I have a beautiful family: but it just feels like they don't know me. I'm constantly bored. And I go on walks everyday just to get out of this life - even if it's just for an hour. And seriously, why? As I said, I have a great life. So what changed?

I don't know why I'm writing this and I don't know why you are reading this, but it feels good somehow to do this. So thanks I guess.
