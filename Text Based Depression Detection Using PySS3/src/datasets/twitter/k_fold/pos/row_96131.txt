Why can't you post polls on here? Thats boring as fuck See title. I wanna collect your data and sell it to big corporations for money, but this dumbfuck mod team disabled polls. :'(((

In all seriousness being able to do polls on this sub would be kinda cool as i feel like most people can't be assed to leave comments.
