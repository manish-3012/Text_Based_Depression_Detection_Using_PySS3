Dear A, _x000D_
_x000D_
I love you. _x000D_
_x000D_
I always have. _x000D_
_x000D_
I knew when I first laid my eyes on you. _x000D_
 _x000D_
There hasnâ€™t been a glimmer of doubt about it. _x000D_
_x000D_
Youâ€™ve occupied my mind since we meet in the sixth grade. _x000D_
_x000D_
We cross paths daily in the halls, you are my shining light in a dull corridor. do I ever cross your mind? _x000D_
_x000D_
I see your laughs and smiles, are they genuine? _x000D_
_x000D_
Why has it taken me four years to get to this point? Time wonâ€™t allow another four. _x000D_
_x000D_
I see you right in front of me, donâ€™t you see me? _x000D_
_x000D_
We have so much in common, we have such a solid connection, but I just canâ€™t bring myself to make this confession. _x000D_
_x000D_
So for now Iâ€™ll stay in the corner, longing at you from across C104.
