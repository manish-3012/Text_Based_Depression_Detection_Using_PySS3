Hey whatâ€™s up! Iâ€™ve asked you guys for support before, and I need advice again.. Ok so my best friend has been just completely ignoring me and have been just flaking on me for no reason. They just say sorry and expect to move on everytime. Theyâ€™ve told me they would show up at the fall play rehearsal with me, and then not show up. Theyâ€™ve told me they will call me to practice our monologues (we are both in theater) but they never do. They do this shit all the time. Like I wouldnâ€™t be mad if they just told me they were busy or even didnâ€™t want to but they just tell me they will and flake on me without a reason. What makes it worse is that when I check Instagram she will be posting to her story all the time even when she says shes busy. She even posted on her story once about her best friend that wont answer her (which isnâ€™t me obviously) which just makes me mad. I end up confronting her and telling her about it leaving out the part where she updates her Instagram because I dont want to seem like a creep. I typed out this whole long ass paragraph pretty much explaining my feelings and she writes like 2 sentences saying shes sorry and she gets randomly busy. I donâ€™t want to enter asshole territory but part of me wants to scream at her for thinking I dont know that she updates her insta talks about all the friends she talks to on her stories, and that she thinks she can always get away with a sorry. I wrote out that whole paragraph and the most she can type is two sentences. Iâ€™m always the one that says hi first and I even said its cool when she apologized and then she just ghosts. It sucks. She was so cool and fun to talk to before quarantine and I want to still be her friend. 


I guess the advice Iâ€™m trying to ask for is: how do I convey this???
