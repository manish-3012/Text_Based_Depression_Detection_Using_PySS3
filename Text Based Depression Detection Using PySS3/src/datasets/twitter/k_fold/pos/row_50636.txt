If you've played the game you should possibly know this No one can see me and
I've lost all feeling and
I know I won't die alone
I'll stop you from breathing and

All your deceiving and
This house is not my home

(No)
More forgiveness
(No)
And the reason is
I know I wont die alone
I have returned

And everyone dies
And everyone lies
They're waiting for the second coming again
Everyone tries to hold onto their lives
When no one's alive
(Bring me 115)

You stand for nothing and
Overlooked something
I'll bring you down all on my own

I'm the end, I can taste it
I'll justify hatred
I am the chosen one
Left hand of all that's sacred

(No)
More forgiveness
(No)
I'll bring you death and pestilence
I'll bring you down on my own
I have returned

And everything dies
Look to the skies
To see the end of all creation again
See with your eyes
My army of flies
When no one's alive
(Bring me 115)

I've lost all form and unity
Where has my life gone?
I'll bring you doom that you can see
And bring you down to see you bleed

And everyone dies
And everyone lies
They're waiting for the second coming again
Everyone tries to hold onto their lives
When no one's alive
(Bring me 115)

And everything dies
Look to the skies
To see the end of all creation again
See with your eyes
My army of flies
When no one's alive
(Bring me 115)

And nobody cries
When everyone dies
And no one's alive
(Bring me 115)
