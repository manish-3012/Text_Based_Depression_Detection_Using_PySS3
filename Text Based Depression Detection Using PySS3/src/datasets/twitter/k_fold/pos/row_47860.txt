i don't have a good title for this my mom: you kids can tell us *anything* if you're having problems with mental health or anything like that

me: hey can i go to therapy or something because i'm pretty sure i have severe anxiety and depression or something and i literally can barely function

my mom: no you just need to get your grades up and sleep more at night and spend less time off your phoneâœ¨


like please make up your fucking mind. are you this super caring facade you put on for my step siblings or are you like whatever the hell this is. i am pretty sure i could be begging on my hands and knees and it'd always circle back to me just having to "work harder in school" or some shit
