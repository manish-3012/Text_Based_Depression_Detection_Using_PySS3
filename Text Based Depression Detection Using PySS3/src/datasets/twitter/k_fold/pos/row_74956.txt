My horrible grandpa is having open heart surgery on tuesday Basically the title. My mumâ€™s dad is having heart surgery next Tuesday. None of us are shocked, he smokes 2 packs a day, has no fibre or vitamins in his diet, and never goes further from his office than his back garden. The problem is, I kinda hate him. He mentally and physically abused my grandma and he is the reason that I have eating problems today, because whenever I would see him when I was a kid, He would only ever feed me chocolate, which was what gave me my dependency on junk food. He is really a horrible person, but now that he is having one of the riskiest surgeries out there, I donâ€™t know what to hope. I am by no means saying that I hope that he dies, but I still feel like Our family doesnâ€™t owe him any sympathy, after what heâ€™s done. I feel like a horrible person for thinking this. 

This is the only place I could think to vent. What do yâ€™all think?
