Dad (65m) may have started smoking again and I don't know how to help him Hey y'all, I know this sub is mostly memes but I was hoping maybe someone would have some advice. My dad smoked for many years, before quitting about twenty years ago. Since then, we think he has continued smoking weed occasionally which he has done all his life, but no cigarettes.
He has had a really rough time recently, with worrying about the election and himself getting older and covid and me (15m) being diagnosed with autism and adhd really took a toll on his mental health. He stays up very late drinking (not to the extreme, but quite a bit), but my sister (18f) and I have recently started smelling tobacco on him, leading us to think he started smoking again.

Let's be real, he has a lot of issues. He yells a lot and has never apologized, calls us fat, and never talks about anything. But I love him dearly, and I really want to help him. He and I have a very strained relationship, but things have gotten a little better. He is getting old, and he is older than his mom was when she died. My grandfather died of smoking, and I want to make sure he doesn't suffer the same fate. I don't think that my mom knows that he might be smoking again, and I don't want to split up their marriage. Does anyone have any ideas how I can help him? Anything is appreciated, seriously.
