Random thought #13 I wonder if infinate alternate dimensions exist. I think they don't, like if they did then there would be a dimension where while I was typing this I'd suddenly be teleported to a giant mansion made of gold  on another planet where I am treated like a king as long as I ride a dildo infront of 100 people for five minutes a day. Weird and inappropriate example but if infinate alternate dimensions are a thing then that does happen to an alternate dimension me. Really it's kind of impossible infinate  alternate dimensions do exist. Because then there is a dimension where someone creates an elixir of immortality and a machine where they can visit EVERY SINGLE alternate dimension at once, but nothing like that has happened so it's not possible really.
