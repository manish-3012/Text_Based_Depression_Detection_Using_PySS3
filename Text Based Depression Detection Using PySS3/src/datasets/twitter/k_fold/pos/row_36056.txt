Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 31: Julius Caesar Julius Caesar was one of the greatest commanders of all time and one of the most influential men in Rome. However, you can't get that title without slashing a ~~few~~ ~~few hundred~~ ~~few thousand~~ few hundred thousand throats.

Lots of his influence came from the fact that he conquered Gaul (France) and some if Albanion (Britian). Thise 2 places needed to become "Romanized" so the Romans would enslave and kill the people there. Caesar himself said that he had killed 20% of them.

When Caesar was Consul of Rome, he once had the other Consul of Rome, Bilbulus, assaulted by an angry mob. He specifically ordered then to pour shit on his head. He also arrested a Senator because he was being annoying.

He packed the Roman Senate of 300 people to 900 people, the extra 600 were all his supporters.

He then put normal citizens with no experience into power so he could go to Eygpt and smack some pharaoh pussy.
