I'm bi and I'm afraid of talking about it Let's start with biggest problem â€” we don't talk about such things in my country, we don't have any news about it, any lessons at school and we don't know any LGBT member. And here comes me! I don't know if it is only for some time, but I identify myself as bisexual now. I feel that I need to tell somebody about this and get support.
And here comes second problem â€” I don't have great relationship with my parents. It's not like I hate them, I just don't feel anything. Yeah, they love me, they can be cool sometimes and they care about me, but that's all. 
I'm still pupil, so I'm afraid that I will get kicked out of school if somebody will know about this. They ready to kick you even if you have hair painted in unusual colors. 
I begin to feel that it is accumulating inside me and I can have breakdown soon.


I understand that you can don't care, but I hope for help. Thanks for spending your time.
