The ultimate guide to NNN This is a guide to winning NNN, you might need this.

1. Stay occupied. Staying occupied can keep you from being in 'the mood'. Do things like exercise, cook, draw, play video games with the bois, and even catching up on homework. You can also read the bible.
2. Whenever you are in 'the mood', go somewhere else. If you are in bed, get out of bed and do some pushups, or go drink some warm milk. Or go talk to a family member or friend and ask about their day.
3. Stay off the computer or device for more than normal. Take breaks every now and then, 10 minutes will be fine. This will help you distance from the temptation of nutting.
4. Do something that helps you get less stressed. Things like Yoga, Meditation, or a heart to heart conversation with a buddy of yours. Stress can be very negative on someone's overall mood, you want to be in a good one.
5. Be persistent. You CAN DO THIS, stay positive, have a good mindset, and try to look at the bright  side of a situation you are in.
6. Try or learn something new. This could be a new hobby, new sport, or new game. I would recommend idle games, as idle games hook you into the gameplay, and you end up pretty much babysitting the game. You could also watch youtube about something educational, the channel I would recommend is Kurzgesagt, they have good material, and they pose interesting questions about life.
7. Don't think about the meme 'benefits' of nutting. Things like you get more dopamine, everyone does it and all those assumptions. This does not matter, it is NNN, don't try to justify it anymore.

This guide will help, (at least somewhat) if you don't win but get through 2 weeks of NNN, and you weren't able to last year, be proud of yourself. NNN may be harder for some people and easy for others. All that matters is that you try.

I encourage you to keep this healthy habit, I see many benifits of it.
