So there must be a time for great things to end One week for now my school holidays will be over, I will be in year 12 my last year of high school and this is also the year where everyone try harder to get a good atar. 

Next week I will be deleting my reddit account, reddit app I been on this app for 2 years on my previous account, this app is really addictive and I must destroy this addiction before entering in year 12 because I need to focus on studying, not procrastinating in order to get into university. 

Peace my brothers I will be back after high school but for now may we meet again.
