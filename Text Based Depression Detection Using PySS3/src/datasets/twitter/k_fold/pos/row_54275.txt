Sexualizing fictional children is not wrong. P.S. In most cases with popular anime, they usually aren't children, but teenagers. People call them children to strengthen their argument by making them seem younger then they actually are. 

There are two main reasons for this.

1. They are fictional.  
Let me as you this: If I play Call of Duty, am I a veteran? If I play Fortnite, am I a war criminal? No. I don't see why this should be any different. Sexualizing fictional (as in cartoons, anime, etc.) will never be wrong, because they aren't real. Also, they aren't actual children. They are depictions of children. We call them children because it's easier to just call them what it's depicting.
2. No one is being hurt. If I sexualize a fictional child, I am not manipulating anyone into doing it. I am not grooming, or raping, or molesting, or abducting, or beating, or even killing anyone, in some cases. There is no grooming a folder in procreate. Why? Because they aren't real.
