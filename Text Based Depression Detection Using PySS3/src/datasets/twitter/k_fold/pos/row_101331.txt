I FUCKING HATE MY STEP-DAD He's the most overbearing, annoying and stupid piece of shit I have ever met in my entire goddamn fucking life. I just want him to die in a fucking car crash, and I'd dance on his piece of shit grave. I wish my mom never met him. He's a fucking piece of shit that likes to annoy me for days on end, I just wanna run him over with a fucking truck. Even if he bought me a PS4 that ain't changing my respect for him, because respect is what I refuse to give him. He doesn't deserve my respect.
