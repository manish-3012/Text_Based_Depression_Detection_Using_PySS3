So people often ask me why I don't wanna come out. (no one does, but idgaf) Literally the only reason I don't wanna come out is cause I think I'm too young so people aren't gonna take me seriously. I've been planning on coming out when I'm 16 since I was  12. WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY. Besides, I like guys anyway so I can talk about HALF my crushes. Better than being fully gay and closeted.
