I love my friends so so much!!!! (Appreciation post) I was doing this group project (refer to my last post)and I was having difficulty and I didn't help them so I apologize to my group mates. Unexpectedly, one of them started being really mean to me(like really hurtful) for not knowing how to do the project, I was super upset and was about to cry.

 I told one of my friends that I was really upset and she told me not to worry and comforted me right away and tried to help.

My bestfriend(who is in the same group with me) saw that I was being bullied and super confused, and asked me if I'm ok, I said that I still didn't know how to do the project. She took out a piece of paper and wrote down what I had to do and step by step instructions then send it to me. 

I just finished my part. I'm still thinking about how amazing my friends are. They're THE BEST friends I could ever ask for. I don't deserve them! THEY'RE THE BEST PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET!!!!!
