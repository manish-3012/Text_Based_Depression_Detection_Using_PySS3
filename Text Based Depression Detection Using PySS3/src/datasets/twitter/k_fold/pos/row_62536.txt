I figured out how to *not cheat* on a canvas question, with a blank text box so basically just upload any image into your canvas account, then whenever you have a question with a blank text box (the one where you type whatever you want) you can go to import, then I think it says user media. Aaaaand bam, now you can \*not cheat\* on your test.
