I canâ€™t upload an image so I canâ€™t explain how much I hate YouTubeâ€™s new like, dislike and reply symbols on the comments with a meme so Iâ€™ll use a rant. Seriously, the old ones were incredibly iconic and pleasing to look at, as well as the nice blue differing much from the white and the black so you could easily see which comments youâ€™ve liked (and disliked but nobody does that). But now they look super sharp and cramped and generally unpleasant for the eyes. As well as that, they also turn white, black if you use light mode,Iâ€™m guessing. You now have to look at them for a second to see if youâ€™ve already liked or disliked the comment. How does nobody else know about this?!
