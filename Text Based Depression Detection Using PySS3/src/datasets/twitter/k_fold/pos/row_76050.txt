This is probably too much to ask for but all i want is someone to discuss the deepest depths of the universe, and the morality of men with, but still laugh at chicken on board memes.

all i want is someone who i can analyze films and movies with, but we can still run around the streets screaming and laughing and being chaotic for no reason

all i want is someone who i can talk about poetry with, but we still crack up when one of us burps or farts.

all i want is someone who looks at the world like me, the world like art, and sees the beauty and potential in everything. yet we're still so silly, and find humor in everything. we're not afraid to criticize each other, we make fun of each other, and make fun of others, together.

maybe sometimes we can pretend life is movie? as though we're the main characters?

oh to be young and in love!

and these are the struggles of being an INFP :((
