Accusing someone of theft is dumb, especially when the wallet they â€œstoleâ€ has little things of value I mean, my classmates accused me after I took the wrong wallet, because my partner and I both have black wallets and we leave them on our table all the time, and only grab them when we want to go out and buy food.  
  
I accidentally took my partnerâ€™s wallet, because they look so similar. I mean, why accuse the kid using a high end iPhone and running all across Singapore to do jobs for stealing something with money I can make in about 2 hours of work?
