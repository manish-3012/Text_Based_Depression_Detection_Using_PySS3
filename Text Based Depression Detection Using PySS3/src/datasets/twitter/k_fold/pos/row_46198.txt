Fuck zoom I just got kicked out of a really important class due to a connection Timeout. Iâ€™ve tried everything to contact my teacher and yet I was marked absent. Still 30 minutes past and no word from my teacher. What am I supposed to do? Contact the head office? Iâ€™ve tried contacting my teacher via everything and still no response. Please help.
