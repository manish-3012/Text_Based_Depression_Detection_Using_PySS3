Some random thoughts about time travel I am not too sure how to put my thought into words but I'll try my best. If time travel gets invented in ANY point in the future, then it has already happened. Since we haven't met any time travelers, there are 3 possibilities
A) time travel never gets invented,EVER, because if it did, we would already know. That's kinda sad. 
B) people have time travel to our past and potentially changed how some events but didn't leave any evidence which is scary to think about. 
C) They simply haven't visited 2020 or before, which makes me think, why not? 
Now here's something else
Let's say I invent a time machine and go back in time, just before I get born. Does that mean that there are 2 of me now? What happens when I interact with myself? Let's say myself from the past grows up a little and I go visit him. Since I am myself from the future will I have memories of me, visiting myself from the past?
Also, what happens if I kill my mother? If she never gave birth to me, then I wouldn't have invented a time machine and went to the past to prevent my mother from having me, which means she does give birth to me, I invent a time machine, go back to the past to prevent her from having me but that can't have happened. This throws me into a constant loop.

Lastly, i read something really interesting once, what if the lottery is just a way to catch time travelers?
