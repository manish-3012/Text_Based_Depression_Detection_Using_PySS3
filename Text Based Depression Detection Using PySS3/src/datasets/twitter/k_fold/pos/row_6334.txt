Am I...happy?? Am I? 
I broke up with my ex today. 
The relationship was really bad, when it started it was good but I was hanging onto unrealistic expectations, not who she was anymore, I donâ€™t love her and I havenâ€™t for a long time, I just didnâ€™t realise it. She broke up with me and got back together a few times, because she knew she could. Yeah, well not anymore. Iâ€™m free from the pain, she wonâ€™t hurt me again.

Then, potential new boyfriend messaged me, we talked, then we called, he seems really nice :D and itâ€™s not a long distance thing, like my last. Moving on too quickly is bad, apparently, but I feel kinda free rn. 

Am I happy? Or will tomorrow come and Iâ€™ll find myself feeling hollow / sad?? 

Anyway, just wanted to share that good feeling I feel once every few months
