A poem a day until I get my SAT scores back-update I think I'm done with this series for now. If you read yesterday's poem you'd know I got my scores back from sep but not oct yet. But our creative writing class has moved on from poetry and personally I'm just feeling stressed out and unable to focus on writing poems. Anyways maybe in the near future I'll do something similar but for college apps but I don't think I'll limit myself to just poetry. Maybe some proses or drawings too. Anyways I hope I didn't let my readers down too much, it's just that doing so much poetry gets really repetitive since I'm stuck at home all the time and I honestly can't think of anything to write about other than whining about school or the shitty weather. If you guys want to read more stuff from me feel free to comment what genre u want next. Anyways, until my next post, cya.
