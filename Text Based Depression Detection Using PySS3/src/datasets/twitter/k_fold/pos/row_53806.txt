Itâ€™s hard having huge boobs I hate when I go anywhere and people I know tell me I have huge boobs. Every time I meet my friends they keep telling me I have huge boobs. Every time I meet my family they tell me I have huge boobs. Itâ€™s getting way too fucking old and itâ€™s not funny anymore. I donâ€™t get to decide to have huge boobs. Itâ€™s so fucking hard having big boobs especially when youâ€™re a male in this society ugh
