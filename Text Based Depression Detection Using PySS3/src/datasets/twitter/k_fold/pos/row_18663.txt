iâ€™m so happy- i spent over an hour in a book store in a mall and got the first two mha mangas and an astronomy book. i also went to hot topic and got a mha necklace. and also boxlunch and gamestop and got a mha game for switch. and now we get to go to a dumpling place called red ginger and walk downtown for 6 hours :D. i actually want to cry with happiness bc i never get to do stuff like this
