You know what I hated when I was little Girl Scouts When my brother was 10 he joined the Boy Scouts and every time I saw him they were carving stuff with knives and tying knots and learning how to camp in the woods and so I thought it would be fun to join the Girl Scouts because I thought it would be same thing but for girls, but no I joined with my friend and we were so disappointed when we got there with our group and the scout leader lady gave us a book about flowers being friends and we sold cookies and that was it I hated it and so did everyone else in my group
