A girl told me this I donâ€™t know if I should feel embarrassed or not, I kinda do... I was on FaceTime with this girl I have a crush on last night, and we were just talking ab aspirations, college, the normal shit. And then I ask her how she felt about sensitive guys. She kinda paused for a moment... and says â€œI donâ€™t really know, but you look like you cry every night.â€ I reply with, â€œbut youâ€™ve never seen me cry.â€ And then with a final blow, she tells me, â€œbut it just seems like you turn on a freezing shower, curl up in the fetal position and listen to cold play.â€ I gave her a chuckle, but deep down it highkey hurt.
