past four days (vent about hospitalization/psych ward) 72 hour psych hold  (led into psych stay) - basically sucked, I didn't even want to be there. But no, they had to question my everything to make sure I wasn't a danger to myself or anyone else. Like I get it evaluation but can't you do that in like less time? Sitting and doing a bunch of tests is not exactly helping.

4 days in psych ward (just released other day) - This was the shortest I have ever been there. Usually I was there for anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks. But this time was even more horrible, maybe it was the lack of interaction due to the virus or maybe it was the pure isolation. Usually I make friends quickly but we were always too far apart to have a normal conversation. Also we could only have one person per room so that felt empty and a lot more depressing.

ED "recovery" - Why my doctors can't make up their mind between anorexia and bulimia is a mystery to me but I spent 3 days (first day in main, next 2 in psych) stuck in bed with a feeding tube. Not delightful at all, it felt horrible. And I still can't stand the thought of gaining weight, no matter how underweight people think I am.

It's not like doing any of those things or being there helped me at all, all it did was make me miss my boyfriend and video games. It's not like I feel any better, it's all just a pain in the ass.
