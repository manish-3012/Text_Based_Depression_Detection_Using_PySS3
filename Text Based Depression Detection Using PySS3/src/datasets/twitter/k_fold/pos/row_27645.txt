Damn I.. Iâ€™m lost here Long story short, I lost contact with my best friend and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever get him back. Iâ€™m trying to make an effort to â€œmove onâ€, but somethings just arenâ€™t the same anymore.

One thing in particular is the fact that I donâ€™t have anyone to send goodnight messages to. Iâ€™ve just been awkwardly putting them in my discord server.

I really just realized I lost the closest friend Iâ€™ve ever had, and Iâ€™m a bit uncomfortable trying to make some of my other friends the â€œreplacement.â€
Im lost.

Goodnight Reddit..
