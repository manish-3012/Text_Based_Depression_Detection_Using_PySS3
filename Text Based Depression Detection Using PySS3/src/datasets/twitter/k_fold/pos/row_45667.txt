I've never been more happy with someone So I think I found the perfect girl. I've gone to school with this girl for around 2 years now and I've always liked her, but we didn't start talking until the beginning of quarantine. We have talked every night for roughly 8 months and she is the most amazing person on the planet. She literally makes me so happy, she asks if I've eaten every day and always helps me through literally everything. she is so perfect and I would literally do anything for her, words cannot describe how much I love her. My only wish is that she would see how amazing and beautiful she really is, she's constantly beating herself up and it's really really sad. I just want her to be happy and it kills me to know she doesn't see herself the way I see her. We both have a crush on each other but we aren't in an official relationship. but God she is so perfect I can't even describe it. I would literally do anything for her she's just the best. I honestly don't even know where I would be without her rn, she's literally the only reason I eat, the only reason I'm remembering to take my meds and take care of myself. I'm honestly terrified I'm gonna mess this up but as long as she's happy, I'm happy.
