"This subreddit has become" is just people farming karma now So many people now have made posts about people complaining about this subreddit it's not even fun. I'm probably not the only one tired from this cookie cutter bs but this is a new low. The same posts wih different things to complain about is just boring now and I hope things get back to normal. And if i say that is an unpopular opinion would be wrong as everyone is saying the thing.
