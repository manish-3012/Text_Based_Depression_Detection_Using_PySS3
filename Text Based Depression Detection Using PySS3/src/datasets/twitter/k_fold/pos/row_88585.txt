Rly wasn't gonna post this but fuck it Here's my trauma

&amp;#x200B;

all my teen years i was an idiot, got in the habit of sending/receiving inappropriate stuff yk, all that. long story short, the police took my devices, social media, basically my whole life back in August, and to this day I still have no clue whats gonna happen to me. i hate all police unconditionally now. on top of that, corona obviously has sucked the whole last year. my grandpa died in september. my grades have been shit. i have no motivation. the thing that i feel luckiest about is that i dont wanna kill myself yet. but if anything comes of that whole situation then why should i bother living anymore. now im up at 2 am and i have to get up at 7 and i have 2 stupid in person classes, one is math, and i have a quiz im not ready for so thats not good. then i have to sit through an online class, till 1, go to a dentist appointment at 3, go to work at 5, and not be home till 10:30, then i have to go to a stupid useless fucking study hall the next morning because of my stupid grades. but whatever, the school can fucking put me in a study hall all they want, just the right kinda dick move to end up on my suicide note if my life doesnt take a big fucking turn around. i wish they would at least stop pretending to care about kids' mental health
