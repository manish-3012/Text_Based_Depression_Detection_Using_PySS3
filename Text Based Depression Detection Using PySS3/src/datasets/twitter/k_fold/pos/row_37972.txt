My class secret santa turned to crap So today my class did a secret santa thing and how they do it was calling out people's names and people who was that person's santa give them the thing now while we were calling names a guy gave someone who I'm supposed to gift a gift....what now they have figured it out that he got it wrong and is supposed to give it to the teacher but to add to it...before we had to re-randomize whos gifting who 3 FRICKING TIMES so yeah...
