Listen up you anti-mask motherfuckers in America. Can you wear your fucking mask? Iâ€™ve been in social distant learning (online school) since March. We found out that weâ€™re gonna stay online until April. This is hard for me and other people with learning disabilities cause itâ€™s hard to pay attention and get our work done. Itâ€™s 10x harder online, so wear your mask so I can get back to in-person learning and get good grades so I can get a solid job and I donâ€™t starve to death
