I need some serious advice I currently have a really close friend, and right now Iâ€™m stuck between loving him as a friend and hating his fucking guts. I was gone from him for a while, and when I came back, he admitted to me that he smoked weed while I was gone. I left him for a little bit because I was extremely pissed, and also because he doesnâ€™t seem like the type of person who would do some stupid shit like that. I know that weed isnâ€™t that harmful, but itâ€™s still stupid illegal, and it started making me question if he was really a trustworthy person. I went back to hanging out with him about two weeks ago because I really missed being around him. Iâ€™m still pissed at him, but Iâ€™ve been trying my best to hide it. Heâ€™s not going to be at school for the best few weeks, so I have a little time to decide how to handle this whole situation. Iâ€™m probably always going to be pissed at him, but I can deal with it. The problem is, I donâ€™t know if heâ€™s still doing it, and I have no way of knowing. I have a couple of family members who have been caught with weed in the past, and Iâ€™m thinking of telling about what happened to them, but if he doesnâ€™t do it anymore, I donâ€™t want to look like an asshole if I try to talk to him about it. Iâ€™m probably going to have to schedule an appointment with my therapist and ask for advice with this, but until then I was wondering if anybody on this sub could help me decide what to do. (I donâ€™t really want to just leave him entirely again, so please donâ€™t recommend that)
