Here are some of the hardest classes Iâ€™m finishing a degree in applied mathematics which requires you take a lot of credits hours from a wide range of stem fields. 

Here is my ranking list on difficulty of each field:

1. Computer science [quite difficult and very competitive. High attrition. Requires creativity and the ability to visualize abstract data structures]
2. Engineering [similar to computer science but less abstract]
3. pure Mathematics [very abstract. Many paths to the right conclusion]
4.physics [ grounded. Problems are hard but it is my favorite field for the computational practicality]
5. Economics [you need to be apt at arithmetic and manipulating graphs]
Chemistry: [there are a lot of concepts and equations here but not much creativity, at least at the lower level]
7. Biology [ mostly concepts which can be tricky but nothing practice canâ€™t overcome]

If we were considering including the humanities, philosophy would be near the top. It is very abstract, similar to pure maths.

So there it is.
