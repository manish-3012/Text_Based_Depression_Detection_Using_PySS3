why tf do girls respond to texts so quickly bro i swear whenever i text a girl for any reason (for homework, to chat, etc.) they always respond in like a minute. and every single time i send a text during the conversation theyâ€™ll respond like instantly

like bruh how tf are you always on ur phone and in the app ready to respond instantly. dont you do other shit on ur phone?? dont you do other shit in real life?? i swear man idk how they do that shit lmao

^(PS. obviously not all girls are like this but in my experience a lot are)
