Valapin Lesson No. 2. If you haven't seen m first lesson, go check it out- [https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/m5k25j/valapin\_lesson\_no\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/m5k25j/valapin_lesson_no_1/)

Today, we learn the definite articles (last lesson, we learnt the indefinite article).

There are two definite articles in Valapin.

**TÃ©** and **TÃ©z**.

&amp;#x200B;

**TÃ©** is used when whatever in question is in singular form.

**TÃ©z** is when whatever in question is in the plural form.

Valapin tends to be gender-neutral.

&amp;#x200B;

If you remember the first lesson, then you must already know that verbs aren't conjugated when put after pronouns.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are six verbs to learn along with their English meanings:-

&amp;#x200B;

em - has/have

snir - see(s)

spenir - speak(s)

levir - read(s)

scrir - write(s)

vlanir - think(s)

&amp;#x200B;

That's it for today, folks. Next lesson, we will learn how to change words into their plural forms.

Thank you.
