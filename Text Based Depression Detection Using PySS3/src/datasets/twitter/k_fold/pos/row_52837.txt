My dad made me transfer some data to another computer at 1:30 am Because I never used that computer, I ended up finishing at 3:30.

And his reason to make me do this is just a blatant, "you're playing on your phone and they're the same anyway."

No, I was searching something for mum. And even if I was playing (which he would've been right most of the time), the degree of exhaustion is vastly different. Most importantly, who tf makes their son do important things at 1:30 anyways? 

FML.
