My friends have moved away now Iâ€™m sad. So when I was in my freshman year of high school I met new friends who were juniors at the time, they got me through and helped me pave a way through high school. Now Iâ€™m junior and they moved to go to college, now I lost some of my closest friends. And Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™m gonna eventually stop talking to them.
