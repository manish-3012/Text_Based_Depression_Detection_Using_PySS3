Wondering if the mods will let me explain this, â€œI hate menâ€ comes from a place of â€œI fear for my life daily because of them, I recognise that I am not safe and I take daily precautions to protect myself and itâ€™s still never enoughâ€ but â€œI hate womenâ€ comes from â€œcanâ€™t get gfâ€

Yes this is from a twitter post but for some reason I canâ€™t post it.
