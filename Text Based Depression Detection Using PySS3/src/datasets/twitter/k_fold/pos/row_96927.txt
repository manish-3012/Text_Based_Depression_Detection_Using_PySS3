I'm maybe about to do something stupid but I don't care about. I'm in 10th grade now and my teacher originally wanted me to look for  apprenticeships in our work&amp;life lessons after holiday. But i'm a musician and I don't give a fuck about this shit. I told him that the topic sucks and that I want to do something that has a little more sense to me. So now I have to write an essay about a musician of my choice, but have to light up the person's school career. I tricked my teacher to not have to write about nonsense and picked [Niklas Kvarforth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Kvarforth?wprov=sfla1), a musician who I appreciate very much and can partly identify with, nevertheless he's a cocaine-addict, ex-heroine-addict, human hating psychopath.(My teacher doesn't know yet). The point is, this guy founded a band when he was 12 years old and made great music in this band. Damn I might not hit my teacher's will but I nailed to come around the work and just have to do the fun part hehehe...
