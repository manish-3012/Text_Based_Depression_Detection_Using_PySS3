There is this girl I like and I dont know what I should do There is this girl I like. I am 16 she is 15 . I havent confessed to her yet and I have a problem with it. She is a bit mentally ill. She had a very bad past and has some traumatic experiences, with men also. We have been talking for a week and I think we both enjoy our conversations and she sends emojis like pleased emoji with hearts e.t.c .  If I confess to her now would I seem like I am forcing myself on her and taking advantage of her insecurities? if so how long should I wait till I confess ?
