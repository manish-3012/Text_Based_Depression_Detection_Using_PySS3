i think i might be relapsing IF YOU HAVE OR HAVE HAD AN ED AND YOU KNOW READING AB IT MIGHT TRIGGER YOU THEN PLEASE STOP READING THIS


so i started school again last week and i already have a bunch of projects to do and meanwhile i do have enough time for them, i definitely donâ€™t have enough motivation to actually do them. so obviously iâ€™m getting very stressed. the issue is that the only two things my brain knows how to do when i get stressed is 1. emotional eating 2. restricting. i used to struggle with disordered eating but finally felt like i was getting back a healthy relationship with food during summer. since iâ€™ve also gained weight lately, a big part of my brain is telling me that number 2 is the best option and even tho ik itâ€™s unhealthy idk what else to do to handle stress. i donâ€™t rlly wanna tell anyone so i just decided to vent here but if you cared enough to read thru all that, thanks :)
