I need some opinions Never wanted to post relationship stuff on this sub but here I am now. Long story short, it's breakup time and I need to figure how to go about it well.

So If you were getting broken up with, how would you prefer for it to happen? Lots of people say that it's best to do that kind of thing in person, or at least voice-to-voice, and to avoid doing it over texts. But if the breakup-ee is a super anxious type, who'd get stressed out having to talk on the spot, wouldn't it be better to give her time to reason and consider things? Since actual talking obviously goes much quicker.

That's all for tonight folks
