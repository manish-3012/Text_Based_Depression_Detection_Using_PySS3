just,, growing up is weird. life is wack its so weird to actually remember that im gonna be seventeen in less than three fucking months. i havent been really conscious of my age?? like i have but its never been something i feel connected to if that makes sense. like, its honestly fuckin scary to realize iâ€™ve done nothing with my life and repressed my emotions and just been living a sad little life and im gonna have to be an adult soon like damn. 

i guess on a sad level i never thought i would make it this far in life; ive never been able to see or envision my life even just a week in the future, which sucks as someone who needs a plan or iâ€™ll dip. 
i know im letting shit pass me by but i cant be motivated to *try*, ive never been able to and it sucks because i cant bring myself to do it even when i know i need to or even want to. i mean, if you surprised me and asked me my age my first thought would immediately be 14 because i havent really felt like life is real since around that age. 
bruh maybe i did die at that time and thats why ive felt detached these past three-ish years 

anyways back to repressing my emotions through humor and disassociating from my actual physical body ðŸ˜Œâœ¨
