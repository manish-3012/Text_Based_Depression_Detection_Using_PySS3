anyone here ever been in a mass shooting/spree killing? Heres my story it was maybe December 2014 and i was a 6th grader at the time. Theres a house not far by that had bullet holes in the wall. Some people were dead and someone else went missing. It wasnt long until more killings appeared. It was realized that there was this man named bradley who was killing people all around my neighborhood and at the time nobody knew why. Everybodies school was closed except mine and there were police at my school. More sightings and shootings would be reported threoughout that day and nobody knew who was next. I got home and everybody was on the floor and we turned out all the lights and basically crawled everywhere. 

Well at some point good ol bradley showed his face just outside his house and was spotted by someone who drew a pistol and fired gunshots at him and he escaped. He was later found dead. I can't remember if he shot himself or took a drug cocktail.

It was later found out he was targeting his ex wife's family. Scary day to me.
