im literally still in love with my ex and he canâ€™t know i got so giddy when i pissed him off by pretending i didnâ€™t know an alt of his when he commented under a post of mine and we dmed on instagram he was so angry that i pretended not to know him

and he has a new gf but he talked to me for like 2 hours before going to sleep like last week when he did the same thing

i kept asking him why it hurt that i didnâ€™t seem to like him and he couldnâ€™t really answer me that much past vague answers and he wants to be friendly but i keep asking why. and heâ€™s like itâ€™s bc i donâ€™t wanna live around you or something like that but weâ€™re exes so idk why that was such a problem for him

i asked him for boy advice to mess with his head and he accepted it

i spoke to my therapist and he said weâ€™re not done with each other completely. he said my ex still cares and likes me and itâ€™s just so annoying he has a new gf so i canâ€™t disrespect that and i find it annoying we are both pretending to have moved on
