What does love feel like? I have been trying to find out for the past year. I dont feel love. If my entire family did the most i would feel would be the sense of loss do to no money. The only emotions i ever remember feeling are brief joy and brief anger. i once faked crying for about an hour to see if it would actually emit an emotional response, all it did was get me a hug, which i hate. What does emotion *feel* like?
