What the fuck is wrong with this world I was in the park with my crush. We were talking, joking. You know, regular 14 yo stuff. We decided to sit under a tree as it was really hot outside and we finnally found some shade. We were talking and shit, and out of nowhere she notices a guy, in a bush, looking at us and fucking masturbating. We left the other second and holy shit. It was disgusting. You can't get bored in romania, can't you.
