Had the best day of my life on a Monday I woke up at 3a.m and check My post and woke up to 100 notations and my post was at 10k likes I had some water then managed to
Pull a all nighter kind of. Then I had some really good pancakes then I got to eat Popeyes and went back home and I saw a Mazda Rx-7 (my dream car) and freaked out then it show of its Beautiful engine noise I have never seen Rx-7 but seeing it and hearing it was cool. Then got a package I ordered a vinyl of one my favorite albums then went In my back yard and found a free football that cost 20-50 bucks then my sister gives me money for helping her house keeping its. Canâ€™t believe Monday is a good day
