How Do I Get Over the Past? 
I keep reminiscing about the good old days. 

Itâ€™s not that I am worrying, but I keep finding myself in a state where I cannot stop thinking about the past, and era where I enjoyed my life more. 

How do I stop this? What can I do? This year has been shit. Since 2017, life keeps getting worse, or it seems. Iâ€™m doing more with my life than ever. 

Itâ€™s insane.
