I was really lucky it wasnt me I knew a man, who was in his 50s and was a Chaplin at out school. He was an all round, nice supportive guy. A few months back, end of 2019, he was fired from the school, something to do with another member of staff recently fired. (nothing relationship related, just some drama of some sort). 

It was around this time I became depressed and self harmed, and he was a long time family friend, so my family asked him to talk to me, as we felt comfortable being around him. 

We talked and he kept doing weekly checkups up until the start of lockdown. It was at this time he went to the police and was arrested. He had told them he was a pedophile, and had acted on it on multiple occasions. Only the victims parents and the police know who they are now. He was tried the other week and found guilty, sentenced to 14 years 9 months in jail, but last weekend he was found dead, Cause Of Death: Suicide. 

I found out of his suicide yesterday, and i want to cry, but i can't. Like my mind is stopping me after the knowledge of what he has done. 

TL;DR - Long time family friend was a pedo and killed himself, i have mixed emotions
