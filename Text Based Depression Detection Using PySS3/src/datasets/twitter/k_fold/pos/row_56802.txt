I hate After but I like to hate watch it. Ok, as I said i like to hate watch After and the people in it do things that just seem unrealistic but if we are going to talk about it can we talk about how Trevor (from after we collide aka after 2) is actually a super nice guy. Like, he has some unrealistic parts and kinda cringe parts too but he is so much better than Hardin. Like, I'd rather watch a movie about Trevor finding a girl, and not Tessa cuz I kinda hate her too.
