Motorcycles are raddd So, I just wanted to say something Iâ€™m excited about; My Dad is gonna be getting his motorcycle license this year or try too, and since I expressed my excitement and interest in it. He said heâ€™ll teach me and that his Dad used to take him on his motorcycle to rallyâ€™s and stuff where you can get patches for your jackets. Which I think is really coooool!! So yeah Iâ€™m excited, although I gotta learn how to drive a car first.
