My dad beats my autistic brother and I am tired of it Yep, the title says it all. I heard my dad beat him with a belt for 2 minutes straight because my brother went to someone's house without permission. We are in lockdown for 7 days, so the rules are tighter. My mother tries to tell my dad to stop beating my brother with a belt, and it worked, until now. Now, my brother is not allowed to go to people's houses, and, apparently, my brother also goes to her ex's house and a ex teacher of his. He doesn't use common sense very often after our first major lockdown, so he got himself into this situation.

What should I do? Should I intervene, or should I stay out? Currently, my brother feels lonely, so I talk to him.
