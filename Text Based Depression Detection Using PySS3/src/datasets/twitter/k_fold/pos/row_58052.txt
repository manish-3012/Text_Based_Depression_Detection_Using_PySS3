I'm so done with Americans. Holy shit. People are so stupid. If you don't want to wear a mask, stay at home. If you need to go somewhere, wear a mask PROPERLY. I see hundrends of people daily who wear their masks under their noses and mouths. Even adults.
Other countries are completely back to normal.

Stop trying to make things "Normal" and do what your species does best. ADAPT. THEN things will be normal again.

This pandemic has spiraled me into the worst depression I've had of my life. It's the exact same with hundrends of thousands of others. Don't be the bad apple. Stop. Jesus.

For God's sake, quit worrying about your freedom. You're protecting other people from DEATH, and spreading that death to other people.

Every day I get a notification that one or two people at my school have gotten COVID, because our restrictions are completely and utterly useless.

Everyone please. For America's sake. To get us out of this, just stop trying to "protect your freedom". 


It's not that bad to wear a mask. It's not. that. bad.

I'm so done.
