I can't seem to find any motivation. I've been contemplating suicide and not because I'm sad. In fact it's because of the lack of sadness or emotion. I'm not motivated to do anything to talk to anyone or to try and fix my life. I just sit here in an endless cycle asking myself if I should do it or not. I'm happy for the most part, so what's wrong?
