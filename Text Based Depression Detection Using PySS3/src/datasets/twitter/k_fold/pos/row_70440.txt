If you think about it, it kind of makes logical sense to c o m m i t s u i c i d e. If the majority of your days are spent in pain, and there is actually no real reasons to live long term. I know this is going to be controversial and if you disagree with me I really don't care.

Personally in my opinion some people  aren't very good at life. Life isn't fair.

 in fact some people are just going to suffer more than others. In fact objectively some people are going to have very fucking miserable  unfulfilling pointless lives.

Death on the other hand is a bit more of a... Peace

Living can definitely be harder than one moment of death. 

I personally think it's a bit selfish of people with good lives. No pain

To dare judge or criticise someone who wants to die

That "it'll get better, silver lineings" fucking horseshit

 is not applicable to everybody.

Therefore, in some circumstances. I would rather let someone be free from the pain, rather than try and save a sinking ship.
