Weird kid in my church youth group chat told everyone my friend committed suicide and then compared it to his Roblox friend logging off in an attempt to relate to me. So iâ€™ve talked to this guy a little bit. The experiences iâ€™ve had with him are weird. He had a crush on this one girl and once she tried to talk to him he immediately opened up about his hentai addiction to her. You can see what type of person he is.

So my best friend recently passed on January 20th. He was one of the greatest people iâ€™ve ever met. I didnâ€™t want my church youth group to know about this because I really hate any kind of external attention, plus a lot of them are just shitty people. No one in my entire church knew him because my church is far away from the town where I live. I wanted to keep it that way to keep my mind off of things.

Somehow today this weird kid found out and went into full detail about how my friend died. Spilling almost everything. Idk who told him. Itâ€™s very sensitive information. He then said â€œ_____ (me) was good friends with him. Heâ€™s probably sad, although I know what thatâ€™s like because I have depression because my Roblox friend logged off a month agoâ€

I left the group chat.
