im honestly scared for college. i don't know if i'll make it. why do i have to live every day the exact same? im stuck in a rut and i keep going on the little bit of hope i have left that's constantly dripping away and i don't think i'll have any left by the time im an adult. im scared of the future because most of my friends aren't staying with me and im going to be stuck in my childhood* for the rest of my life if i don't fix this. i'm far from college but not that far. what do i do?

*that might sound like a good thing but my family hates me and my childhood has been awful (:
