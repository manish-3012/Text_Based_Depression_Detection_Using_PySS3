Wholesome Award on a dark post are not funny You have reached peak comedy when putting a wholesome award on a dark post. I hope you become a world famous comedian and make everyone laugh like I am right now. 

Ok but for real. Honestly. It's so annoying and not even funny, even if its a dark meme it's annoying but I see where some find it funny. But when you Wholesome Award a post about something 100% serious like someone who lost their friend to suicide (Yes it did happen.) then that's where you've crossed the line because it's EXTREMELY disrespectful and jistt a dick move. Thank you. Here's a random pic of mad Tanjiro.
