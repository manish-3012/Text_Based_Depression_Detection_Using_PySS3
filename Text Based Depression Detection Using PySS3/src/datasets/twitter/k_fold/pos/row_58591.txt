My grandma, I love her but please just donâ€™t Like she talks for so longggg, to everyone, not just me.

In the store and she strikes up a conversation with the clearly uninterested cashier and tries to keep it going for as long as she can, and itâ€™s completely one sided.

She bought a plant and she asked me if it was a bush or a tree, so I told her, a tree, because it was a blue spruce. Then she kept saying â€œyea but Iâ€™m not sureâ€ so I pulled up a google page and showed her pictures of blue spruces, then she went on a 10 minute rant about how she wasnâ€™t sure and I just had to sit there like â€œuh-huhâ€ and just saying â€œitâ€™s a treeâ€.

I love her but this shit can get really annoying after a while, I just want to have a normal conversation with her instead of a completely one sided convo that I donâ€™t even have the chance to talk in because she doesnâ€™t take a breath, and stuff that I have no idea how she fits that many words into talking about that one thing

Itâ€™s just, so annoying after a while, I love her, but itâ€™s annoying cause these are the only types of conversations she has
