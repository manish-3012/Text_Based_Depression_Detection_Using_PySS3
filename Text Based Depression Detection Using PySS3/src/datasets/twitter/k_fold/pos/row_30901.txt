worst night of my life one time we were on vacation and my brothers girlfriend came with us, and i made a nest in between the wall and the bed with pillows and blankets. I was sitting in it on my phone my my brother and his girlfriend come into the room but didn't see me, so they start making out. I didn't want to interfere but i also didn't want to get up cause my brother would like punch me or something, so i crawled under the bed, and eventually they had sex on the bed right on top of me. LOUD sex. lots of sounds that i didn't want to hear, and a lot of dirty talk/moaning. probably the worst moment of my life. I sat there for like 30 minutes until they left the room and I cried for like 15 minutes afterwards. moral of the story, check the room before you do it, and
