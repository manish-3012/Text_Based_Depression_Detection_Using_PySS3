Canâ€™t make any mistakes without having to pay money So basically my parents like everyone to be perfectionists in the house which means making mistakes means youâ€™re a dead man. If I donâ€™t do my bed it usually results in having my phone taken away (not the biggest issue though) but if I donâ€™t bring in the newspaper and put it in a specific bin, or forget to take out the trash I have to basically pay a few bucks each time. Not gonna lie Iâ€™ll probably be broke by the end of the year. Plus what sucks is that I worked for the money and now itâ€™s slowly getting taken :(
