I have crush on this girl So Iâ€™ve been having a crush on her for a year I wasnâ€™t like close to her and my friend had to tell her and she said  â€œI donâ€™t know how to likeâ€ thatâ€™s all I remember that was since i didnâ€™t even know her for that long. I first wanted to get closer to her(which is what Iâ€™m doing atm). So now I feel like Iâ€™m getting closer to her should I keep getting closer giving her like good vibes and wait more and then ask her again once I feel that we are close?
