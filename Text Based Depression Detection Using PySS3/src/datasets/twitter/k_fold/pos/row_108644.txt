I like Biden but Iâ€™m not happy with his new legislation Today he signed an order allowing trans women to play in womenâ€™s sports and go to womenâ€™s prisons. Feminists have fought so hard and this seems like a big blow to the movement. 

Thatâ€™s just my opinion though. How do you guys feel about the new legislation?
