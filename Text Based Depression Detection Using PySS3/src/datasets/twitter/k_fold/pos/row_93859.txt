It might be the alcohol but I think I like the best friend of a really good friend of mine Okay so basically about 4 months ago I was invited to a party st a really good friend of mine's house. Her best friend was ther too, but around the time that I came all my friend who were there were drunk, including that one girl. So she was flirting with me all night, since she was drunk and i wasnt I just didnt do anything with her. We just became friends, but we hadnt really talked in like 2 months or something and that one friend invited us again tonight. And we were flirting again, atleast I was flirting idk about her. And now I'm not sure if I actually like her or not. I just came home and I'm laying in bed, what should I do?
