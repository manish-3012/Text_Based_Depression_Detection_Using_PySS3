I wanna talk about Bojack Horseman. I finally decided to watch Bojack Horseman because of all the youtube videos praising it for it's depiction of mental health issues. It is really good but now that i have finished it idk what to do with my life.  Anyone else here watched it? Also would u recommend it to others?
