Does anyone experience this too? Sometimes when my day was extremely exhausting and a lot of noice was going on and I finally go to bed and close my eyes, there seem to be these voices/noises screaming literally so loud inside my head but as soon as I'm concentrating on them they'll become almost silent. It's really awful and somewhat scary, like in a horror movie.
