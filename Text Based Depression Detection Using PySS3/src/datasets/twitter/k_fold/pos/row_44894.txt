I never felt like a teenager I like how everyone in this sub is happy. So if you're feeling depressed, i hope this post boosts your mood 

Actually I live in a non-English speaking third world country, I've never been out of my country, neither can I. When i had my first period I was told that I am a woman now, I didn't even know a term called "teenager" (I first heard about it in Katy Perry's song)

My parents don't like me much as I'm getting education instead of getting married and giving them grandchildren. However, I don't even have a successful education life. I'm just studying at a normal school, I don't know if I'll be able to get a job in the future

And don't mind me saying my parents wants me to get married, cuz no one even wants to date me. I'm not a beautiful girl so I'll get surgeries so that i might also find someone who would love me. For so many times i had crushes but none loved me back, so I've never been on any dates but had one of my crush fighting me because I'm ugly and telling people i have a crush on that guy so that I'd give that guy a bad reputation.

Today I'm turning 18, I wanted to post something normal but when i came inti this sub i saw everyone posting happy things about their relationships, their families, their social lives. I think I don't even deserve saying "Happy birthday to me" cuz I'll never have any happy birthdays

Have a great day y'all
