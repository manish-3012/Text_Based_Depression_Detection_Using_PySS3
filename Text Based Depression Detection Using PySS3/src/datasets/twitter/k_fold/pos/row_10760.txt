My girlfriend asked me to read her a bedtime story over the phone. I tried reading her a few childrenâ€™s books but it wasnâ€™t enough so I read her a short story I wrote about a young noble boy going into the outside world for the first time and she fell fast asleep. Iâ€™m adding this to the list of most adorable things she has ever done. And no sheâ€™s not a small child sheâ€™s just the cutest damn 17 year old in the world. Goodnight sweetheart. Sweet dreams!
