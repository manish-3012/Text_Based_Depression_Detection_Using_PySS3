All my friends are getting closer and I feel like Iâ€™m just getting left behind (16M) Thereâ€™s this group of friends Iâ€™m in, with 4 other people. 2 of them are in a relationship, and the other two arenâ€™t, but it feels like they are. They did have a little thing that lasted like a month but the girl wasnâ€™t ready for a relationship so she ended it. 

I just, I feel like everyone is getting closer together, cause I also know they have group chats together with all of them in that Iâ€™m not. Like they send screenshots of random things and I can see the gcâ€™s sometimes. Idk if theyâ€™re active and Iâ€™m just overthinking it all but, the feeling is still there and itâ€™s just, itâ€™s torture man.

Like, the girl that broke up with the other person, I just, I feel this sorta like, attraction to her, and idk why but I just, I wanna be liked by her yk, like I wanna be close. So Iâ€™m just stuck in thsi loop of like, I donâ€™t wanna follow er everywhere and do everything she does, and I donâ€™t wanna smother her ig, but Iâ€™m also just scared of losing what Iâ€™ve gained and her just leaving me behind.

I feel like an asshole cause, Iâ€™m like, picking and choosing, ig. Like idfk why I want the girl to like me, I dotn wanna go out with her or anything, Ik it would never work, but I still just, I wanna be friends but, idfk. Weâ€™ve had a Rocky relationship in the past, which was pretty much me just fucking up and her not liking me, but I think Iâ€™ve fixed that and improved. Iâ€™ve asked someone else in the group multiple times if she does actually like me, and Iâ€™m told she does but, idi just, wanna be good friends with her, and when I see her fuckin, doing shit with other people and being close to them, leaving me out, I just feel like shit.

But then I also hate myself cause of it cause it just I feel like im being an asshole about it, like an overprotective bf or soemthing. I like, ok Iâ€™ll give an example. We were all on a mc server a couple days, and it was me, her, the guy she was going out with but is now just good friends with, and a guy we all met a couple days ago. She said she only hugs her besties in game, to whcih she proceeded to hug everyone but me. We do bully each other and take the piss all the time, so idk if she was just doing it for fun, like leaving me out I mean, or if she actually meant it, cause sheâ€™s done similar things to that in the past.

I just dk if Iâ€™m overthinking things, or if itâ€™s actually bad, but I just dk what to do
