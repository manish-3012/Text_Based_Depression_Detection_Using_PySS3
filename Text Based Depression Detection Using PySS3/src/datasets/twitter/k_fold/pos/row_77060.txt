Posting every day until I donâ€™t want to die day three ...hA

To everybody telling me not to pull the trigger, Iâ€™m not actually going to do it. I just want to. Thereâ€™s a difference between wanting to do something and being dumb enough to do it.

Itâ€™s a limbo of â€œthat sounds really good to do but itâ€™s also extremely stupidâ€ where each side balances itself out enough to where I wonâ€™t actually do anything about my problem, but itâ€™s still there yk?

Kinda like â€œI wanna start a band and not go to college so we can be famousâ€ it sounds like an awesome idea that has a very small chance of working out so you donâ€™t do it. Itâ€™s stupid and you know it is. But you still *want* to.
