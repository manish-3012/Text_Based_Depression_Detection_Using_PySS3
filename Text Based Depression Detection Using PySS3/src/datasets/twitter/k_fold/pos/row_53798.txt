I want to cut someone out of my life This probably isnâ€™t the place to say this but I donâ€™t really know where to go and want to get this off my chest and hopefully get some good advice.

A friend Iâ€™ve known for years (female, 15) called me (male, 15) the other day and she confessed that she loved me. It was really, really wack because we hadnâ€™t even seen each otherâ€™s faces in over a year and a half. 

I didnâ€™t like her back so I turned her down, but then she starts crying and goes into this long storyâ€”she liked me when we first met but thought I was gay, then realized I wasnâ€™t and she blames me, says I was pretending to be gay to push her away. Then she says Iâ€™ve purposefully made her life miserable by giving â€œsignsâ€ like hugging her (I hug all my friends indiscriminately) and finishes her whole spiel by saying sheâ€™ll cut herself if I donâ€™t get with her (how would I even enter a relationship when quarantine prevents plus from seeing each other in person?).

So, I care about her so I sent her the various hotlines regarding self harm and suicide... but she wonâ€™t stop texting me and sending discord messages. This whole situation is causing me tons of stress and is not good for my mental health, but at the same time Iâ€™m afraid if I just block her sheâ€™ll go and do something stupid. 

This definitely isnâ€™t the place to ask for advice... but seriously, what do I do?
