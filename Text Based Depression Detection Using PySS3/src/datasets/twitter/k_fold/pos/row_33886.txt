right fuck it I'm done I just fucking can't with eating

I'm going to be honest I fucking hate it

why can't anything ever work, I'm not putting any weight on and I hate doing it anyways so why bother, not like anything I ever eat is going to actually make me a normal weight

I'm so fucking tired of it all I want to do is get it over with
