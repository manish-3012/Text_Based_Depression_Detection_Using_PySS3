Are any of yâ€™all experiencing â€œjunioritisâ€ or is it just me ? All of my junior year friends are very motivated this year. Iâ€™m not though. Learning through zoom an entire semester made me lazy and even though Iâ€™m taking school in person this semester I canâ€™t get my shit together. My class rank was 11 (out of 800) in freshman year, 26 in sophomore year, and now 56 in junior year. Has anybody else also been extremely lazy their junior year ?
