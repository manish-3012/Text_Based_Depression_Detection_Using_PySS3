I fucking hate my parents I dont remember the last time my mom and  dad talked to me like a dad.  My dad has been highly physically abusive since the day I was born. You wont believe it but my dad has never kissed me, hugged me, in short, I never got to experience the bond which sons have with their father. My mom, she watched when my dad beat the shit out of me, doing nothing. They declined me from any mental help. They told I was seeking attention. They have never bought me anything which I wanted and yeah, I am not talking about uxiroes like iPhones and all. On my birthday, I had just asked them to give me a rubik's cube and a chess set, they blatantly declined. I am sure if here was any other parent, they would have been happy that their child was learning something new.  They wont give me a wifi, no separate room, nothing. Do I not have the rights to want as little as these?

My exams are next year, and fucking fuck this pandemic. If this was not there, then my exams wouldn't have  been postponed and I could have gone to college asap.

This was just a vent, I dont have anyone to open upto so I thought of just putting it out here.
