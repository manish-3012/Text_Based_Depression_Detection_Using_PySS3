Telling lame ass jokes until i run out of them #Day 4 A robber breaks into someone's house at night, but the house owner wakes up and confronts the robber. "Who are you? What are you doing here?"

The robber take out his gun and points at the owner saying, "Ok mister, thanks for waking up, give me your money now!"

The owner says, "You can't do that, I am a politician"

Robbers thinks for a sec and then says, "In that case, give me MY money!"
