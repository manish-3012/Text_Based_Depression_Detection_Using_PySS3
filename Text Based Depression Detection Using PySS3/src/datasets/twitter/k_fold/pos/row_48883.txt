My acne is affecting me to the point i dont like leaving the house Like the title says i have acne but its not like a few tiny blackheads its pretty notacable like when my skin looks "clear" someone says something about it.its not like i dont try any skin products to help or that i don't clean enough its just constantly there. Every time someone looks at me  it feels like there judging me. I used to get bullied constantly and that probably hasn't helped with my self esteem school uniform makes me feel worse because i already look like a dying mutant rat with the plague and I can't even wear something decent to distract from my ugly face. Knowone else at my school has acne either so i stick out alot. It probably doesn't help me that im ugly without the acne so im basically just ugly gross and i hate myself
