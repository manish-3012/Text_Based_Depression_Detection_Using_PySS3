Guys, we won this election. Countless times they tried to sabotage my campaign. The Democrats and Republicans tried and failed! But we won! 

Hail to the Chief we have chosen for the nation,
Hail to the Chief! We salute him, one and all.
Hail to the Chief, as we pledge cooperation
In proud fulfillment of a great, noble call.
