Idk y, but my mum can be such a bitch sometimes For example, recently, my history essay didnâ€™t save 2.5 hrs of work and I was pressed for time. So I wanted an extension, thatâ€™s a reasonable excuse, right? It is, to me, to my history teacher and probably to u. But not to my mum. She went on a whole rant on how she was â€œdrillingâ€ the idea of backing my work up every 30 minutes into my head and that this is why she was doing that. 

The problem with that is she stopped that half a year ago, + holidays just finished so it was reasonable to forget. When I calmly asked her (and clarified I didnâ€™t mean to offend her or anything) thatâ€™s when she went on that rant on how that is â€œnot good enoughâ€.

Me, not good enough? Is consecutive honour listing for years not good enough? Is getting an A on average not good enough? Is getting 100% in music as a whole not good enough?!?

This I just one of many instances of her pettiness/rudeness

P.S just needed somewhere to post this, for closure, ya know?
