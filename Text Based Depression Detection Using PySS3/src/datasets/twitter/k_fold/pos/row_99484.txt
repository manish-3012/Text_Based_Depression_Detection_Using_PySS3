Life as an older brother So I am the oldest of my 4 siblings and I dislike being the oldest although it means your parent treat you a bit better but a 14 year old explaining what he did and why he did and why the other person is wrong isn't better than crying and eating half the words it is annoying that adults prefer to listen to cry babys instead of a teen explaining he POV also I never get to watch TV a lot what I watch is nothing to inappropriate for children just funny things like shows LIKE RIDICULOUSNESS or IDIOT TV or World Dumbest just some cursing here and there but the problem my sister that comes right after me likes for some reason to watch the repeation of shows she literally watched all the repeating episodes for a week.

Ahh it is rant but I feel better after texting it and i hate the most is crying for no REASON like I hit my sister slightly by accident and then 

Mom he hit me mwwaaaaaaa and worst case she is conscious and isnt a baby and know what action lead to 

That for for my siblings my cousin are weirdos there the oldest once inserted a knife through a crack in the door of my room and what frustrates me my 2 year old brother was there and he could have been hit and 2nd oldest likes just to stop talking to you for know reason laughs when he loses a toy (football or frisbee) and the youngest is the most weirdo when someone is in bathroom he looks under the door like wtf now I check before going to toilet and the 3rd youngest is a girl who like to defend the youngest he punched a 1 and half baby for no reason when the baby hit him back he wanted to hit but I stopped him cuz you cant just attack someone you are older than by 3 times it is a long rant but finally I got it out


After looking at the post it is long and and probably filled with grammatical errors but I just finished my eng math and science test so no need 

Bye
