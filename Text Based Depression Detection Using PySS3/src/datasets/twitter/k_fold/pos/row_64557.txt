This Pandemic has made me extremely terrified of people Back in March, my school closed and the internet became my only source of the outside world for several months.  I didn't leave my house again until June.  After hearing of everything going on around me about riots and looters, plus the virus, I guess I just kinda became scared of everyone that I didn't trust.  I was going to apply for a job back in June, but I was too scared to. Any time someone walks anywhere near me, I just freeze.  I can tell this fear is going to last much longer than the pandemic unless I figure out a way to get around it.  I don't want to be like this.
