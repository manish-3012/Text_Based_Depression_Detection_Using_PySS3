Covid Tests suck Just got tested for covid yesterday and turns out I'm positive. Doesn't make sense because I've taken every precaution in the book and was sick with a completely different sickness (sinus infection). Idk if they even test at this point. Feeling fine and sorry to bother you with this post.
