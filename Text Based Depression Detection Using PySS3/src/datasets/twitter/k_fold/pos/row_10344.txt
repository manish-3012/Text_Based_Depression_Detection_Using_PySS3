Bruh how TF do people not get that I hate sex and sexual shit like wtf lol Like believe it or not I don't want to fuck a girl 24/7 it's boring and a eh feeling

I'd much rather hang out and have fun with the person 


And before I get a "ur just not doing it right. Lmao" or "I bet ur a virgin"

I've had sex more than once with different people even with a guy to find out and I came to the conclusion I'm asexual and regret even smashing at all :/
