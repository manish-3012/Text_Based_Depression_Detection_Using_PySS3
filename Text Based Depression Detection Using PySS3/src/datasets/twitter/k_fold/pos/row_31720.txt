AYO HOP IN THE COMMENTS iâ€™m 18 now so i must actively find women to have a relationship, but it has come to my attention that my current wardrobe gives of the first impression of a man who dips, beats his wife, then yells slurs. iâ€™m not good with fashion or hair cuts or shoes(i have boots tho). iâ€™ve got some good advice last night but yâ€™all help me figure this shit out. drop a comment and iâ€™ll chat with you and answer questions or dm me or if your going crazy into detail dm me for my snap and i can actually show you the clothes. as always have a good day homieâœ¨
