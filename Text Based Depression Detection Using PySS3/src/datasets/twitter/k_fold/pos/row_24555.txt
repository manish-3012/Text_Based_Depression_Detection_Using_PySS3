Yâ€™all ever simp for someone that objectively isnâ€™t that great? Like not to be a dick or anything but objectively the girl Iâ€™m simping for rn is objectively not that greats looks wise or personality wise. Okay, above average, but not great. But like I canâ€™t stop simping for her regardless for who knows what reason. Anybody else feel this way?
