My mother just makes life less enjoyable sometimes I know my motherâ€™s love and attention is something conditional when it come to me but Iâ€™m actually upset now. 

So my mother got into an accident with my car like two weeks ago, sheâ€™s fine by the way but my car is not fine. I have exams right now so I have to drive my car to get to them and it looks bad, it sounds bad, it feels bad. She got into this accident the day before my first exam and I understand she didnâ€™t mean to but she didnâ€™t even say sorry. Sheâ€™s not making an effort to get it fix and I have to deal with all the negative consequences and the dirty looks. Iâ€™m not surprised that sheâ€™s not making an effort because she didnâ€™t even do anything for me for my 18th birthday. She just said â€œis 18 even special,â€ like 3 weeks before she didnâ€™t throw her best friend a party for her 44th birthday, like she 2 weeks later she didnâ€™t throw my sister a party for her 7th birthday and like she didnâ€™t throw my brother a party when he turned 18. 

Also the fact that sheâ€™d rather die than give me a compliment but thatâ€™s not important.

Itâ€™s whatever but best you believe Iâ€™m gonna drive her car on Friday for my next exam because I canâ€™t with this life anymore. Before anyone says anything about me walking Iâ€™m not allowed to and also thereâ€™s no one to drop me off at school. 

Thanks for reading, have a wonderful day
