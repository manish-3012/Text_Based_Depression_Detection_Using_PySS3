I need advice on this girl I'm talking to who's from my previous school So I've been talking to this girl who used to be from my previous school. We didn't talk much and I'm pretty sure she thought I was *that* weird guy, but she is kinda nerdy and had joined our school's robot club with me.

So I decided to start talking to her and she responded, which is new compared to the previous guys from my school who mostly left my greeting on read. The thing is sometimes she will take like a day or even more to respond to one message, so 4-5 exchanges could take up a whole week. I'm not sure if it means she's really interested in chatting with me or not. I need help!
