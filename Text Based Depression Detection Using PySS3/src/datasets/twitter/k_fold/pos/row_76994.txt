There should be a rule on reddit where if you get banned a certain amount of times, you can never make an account again from the same device. Thereâ€™s this guy who always messages me things calling me slurs and telling me to kms because iâ€™m bi. He also says horrible things about black people and brags about being a nazi. Even saying to kill all gays, transgenders, and n words.   

Of course, i always report all his messages and block him. Then a day or so later I get a message telling me his account was permanently banned.   

But he just makes another account. Iâ€™ve talked to other people who have talked to the same guy, and he just goes through this subreddit waiting for someone to say anything about being lgbt or of color so he can send them hateful messages.  

Itâ€™s not really about this specific guy, thereâ€™s people who have been stalked on here, there are pedos who harass kids then get banned an just make another account.   

The banning system is basically useless if you can just make another account. I donâ€™t know the exact amount of bans it should be, but i think if someoneâ€™s been banned enough times they should just never be able to make another account on that device.
