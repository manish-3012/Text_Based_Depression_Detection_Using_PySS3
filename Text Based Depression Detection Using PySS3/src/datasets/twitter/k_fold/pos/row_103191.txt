I can't have my own money I'm tired of my parents taking my money.Whenever I get money for my birthday ,on holidays or christmas my parents take it away from me.If I want to buy a video game my mom just wouldn't let me,if I want to buy clothes my mom won't let me buy the clothes I like Because they are ,,ugly" but they pick clothes for me and force me to wear them (btw my family is a middle to higher class family).Even if I don't buy anything with them when I ask for them my mom thinks of every little thing they bought me and says ,,well I bought you x I bought you y "and all of that shit
