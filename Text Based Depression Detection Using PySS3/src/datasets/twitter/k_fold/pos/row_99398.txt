A good thing for me comes to an end My girlfriend broke up with me last night. I was extremely happy with her and thought everythimg was going perfectly for the first time in months. She said it wasn't my fault, that she didn't really understand her own feelings, but knew that she just felt extremely wrong being im a relationship with me or anyone for that matter. It hurts to know I was the only one happy, that i wasn't enough to make her happy too. I still love her so much, idk how im gonna get over this one.

Funny that I posted on here about when I started dating her
