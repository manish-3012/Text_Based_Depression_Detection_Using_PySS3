Got feelings for someone, should I spill the beans... I've got feelings for someone and I don't know whether to tell them or not because I enjoy being friends with them. 

I went outside with them for a walk through town a few times during lunchbreaks and I genuinely had a feeling of great joy in me, as if I'm with my best friend. I never really had the courage to tell her anything and given that I'm quite introverted as well, I doubt she thought much of it then as well. I felt like in general (before lockdown) she didn't really see me as anything more than a friend. Now she's moved to Japan and I doubt I will ever see her face to face again. 

But without much live human interaction in the last few months and other things going on in my life, I feel a bit broken at times as a person even though I think lockdown overall has been a positive thing for me. I've been thinking about doing this for a while now, but I've never been certain because I always fear she won't like me/like me as much as before if I did tell her. 

I know I will meet many more memorable women in my life when I go to uni (or college, whatever you want to call it) next year, but I doubt I will ever meet someone as kind, nice and characterful in my life.
