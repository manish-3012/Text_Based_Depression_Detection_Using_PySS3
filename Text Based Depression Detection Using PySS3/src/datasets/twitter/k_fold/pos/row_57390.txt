People need to realize that calling people "incel" to belittle them isn't effective on actual incels. Us incels already know our status so you don't have to remind us.  Like on my previous posts I've seen people say "your such an incel" Do these people realize that me and my fellow brocels know that better than anybody else.  Anyways, this is just me telling you guys to stop using incel as an offensive term, because we already hate ourselves.
