WHY DO MEN SO THE OTHER NIGHT I WAS TALKING TO AN OLD FRIEND AND WE WERE JOKING ABOUT HOOKING UP BC WE ALWAYS DO (MIND YOU IM ALMOST POSITIVE IM ASEXUAL AND HE KNOWS THAT) LATER ON HE WAS LIKE "ARE U BEING SERIOUS THOUGH" AND OBVIOUSLY I SAID NO

HAHAHA AND HE SENT STREAKS TONIGHT AND SO I SENT THEM BACK OFC and he responds to my streaks with "(my name), did you mean it" and i thought he was talking about the streaks bc i said "streaks dont come to school tomorrow" so i was really confused and i asked what he meant and all he said was "last night" IM CRYING WTF WHY ARE MEN LIKE THISSS
