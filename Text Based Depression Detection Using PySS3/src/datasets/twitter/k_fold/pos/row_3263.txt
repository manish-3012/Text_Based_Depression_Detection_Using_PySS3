My parents think I'm gay. Okay, so this is my first "story post" so plz go ez on me. 

I was just eating a sandwich minding my own business when my dad came into my room and straight away asked me, "Do u have a girlfriend?"

I thought he was just joking, so I pointed at my forearm and said. "Of course I do, look her names tattooed right here!" (yea I stole the joke from that one post in this sub from a few months ago)

He wasn't impressed, at all. "Your mom tells me that you aren't interested in girls."

Context: Honestly I did think this might happen, but actually having it happen was defenetly a surprise. A few weeks ago, when me and my parents went out for dinner, I very passionately argued with them  when they said that the LGBT+ community is a joke and it shouldn't exist. Also I may have been lurking in r/SapphoAndHerFriend, and since I don't really have anyone to talk to near my home, all the facts I learnt there went to my mom. So I assume my mom thought that I'm gay due to those things. 

Back to story, I just chuckled nervously and said, "No, no, I'm interested in girls." 

He was clearly uncomfortable too, so he just took that as the truth and left. Idk if he actually believes it tho lol, so yea that's the story of how my parents started to believe I'm gay.
