Almost scammed woo I should post this so I can MAYBE warn u guys about ordering things online

So like last week it was my little brother's birthday and I decided to buy him Super Mario Bros Wii since he played it a lot as a kid and loves Nintendo. So I go on Amazon and buy a *used* version of the game for about $40.

&amp;#x200B;

Now in my defense, the reviews were from 1000 people and were at a solid 4.5 stars so you know I felt pretty confident in the purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

I make the purchase wait a week get the disc....

&amp;#x200B;

It was horrible

&amp;#x200B;

It's like if your 7-year-old cousin who you can't even remember their fucking name came to your room without permission and with Dorito dust all over his fucking fat fingers asked if he could see the video game disc then when you say no cried to your mom so then she's yelling at you to let him see the $40 game then after a whole ass hour he gives it back.  That bad

Fucking hell now I had to get my mom to help me refund it and now she's mad at me and now I feel like an idiot...with that being said fellow teens remember...actually look at the fucking reviews
