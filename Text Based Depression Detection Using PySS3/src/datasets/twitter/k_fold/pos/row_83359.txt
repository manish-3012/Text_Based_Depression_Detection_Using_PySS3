Idk why Iâ€™m posting this Iâ€™m tired of my friends not understanding how much homework I have. They go to a part time school that gives out not that much homework while Iâ€™m doing running start which is college. I keep getting asked to hang out and do other things and get upset when I tell them I canâ€™t because Iâ€™m too busy. Iâ€™m now freaking out because Iâ€™m a little behind since I had to go to a small gathering with them. Itâ€™s annoying, but also partly my fault because I took a couple days off since I wasnâ€™t feeling well (not covid or a cold, my chronic gut issues where flaring up) I did some work but not much and now I might have to pull an all mightier to get my 5 essay history midterm in. I hate college ngl.
