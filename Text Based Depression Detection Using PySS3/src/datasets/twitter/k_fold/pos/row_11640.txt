I (M18) am getting drafted in October and my gf (F18) acts like Iâ€™m going into WW2 even though I can still meet her every weekend and sometimes during the week. Any tips on how to make her feel better as sheâ€™s really sad and upset about not getting to see me every day like for the past one and a half years? Weâ€™re not going to break up or anything itâ€™s just taking its toll on her and sheâ€™s already missing me while Iâ€™m still here.
