My alt account is still banned here because it is an "unapproved bot" The account is u/AutoModeratqr, I submitted my ban appeal which simple says "if you check my comment history I think it's clear I'm a comedy account and not a bot"

The mods of this sub seriously thought that account was  a legit real bot, I have lost faith in this subreddits moderation team
