I have a large poster of a GlaDOS potato in my bedroom. Anybody else have large posters they think would be weird to guests? I just thought of this a few seconds ago.

I was looking at my aforementioned poster, and was thinking "Man, this would seem weird to guests who haven't played Portal 2." I then though to myself "I wonder if anybody else has this situation going on, where they have a poster that would seem weird to houseguests."

And now I posted this.
