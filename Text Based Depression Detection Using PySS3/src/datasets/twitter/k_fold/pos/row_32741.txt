18F feeling behind on life I'm going to uni in a few weeks and I've never done any of the typical teenager things like drinking or partying etc. I went to a girls school so I had minimal contact with boys (although others in my year didnt because of where they lived or clubs they went to) and my friendship group wasn't really like that.

I'd always kind of reassured myself that it was a family thing as to why I'd never done it before but today I found out my older sister did more even before my age, which has made me feel even worse. I feel so bad about myself and how I'm behind everyone else and I'm worried im going to be so awkward at uni and will have to force myself out of my comfort zone to get by.

it's not that I don't want to go to parties at all but because it would be my first time trying it seems even more pitiful. any advice on how I can stop feeling so insecure about this?
