I have a question or two So, my first question is how many of you â€œguysâ€ sleep shirtless? Last time I did was when I was cuddling with someone whom left, and having sleep with out a shirt since. My second question is I need an honest opinion on how shitty I look. There is a few pics of me on my profile. Might want to post another for reference tbh. Thank you all and I love this community.
