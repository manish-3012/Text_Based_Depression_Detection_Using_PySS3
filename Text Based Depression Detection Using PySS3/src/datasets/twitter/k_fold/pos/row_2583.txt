My mom might be a Karen ðŸ˜¬ So I was talking about how the existence of Facebook groups helped spread misinformation about vaccines, and how that may/will cause some trouble with the COVID-19. Then I called them a bunch of Karens (because they mostly are). Then my mom started talking about how calling them â€œKarenâ€ is racist against Karens/people with the actual name Karen. This isn't the first instance of her acting this way. She has yelled at poor employees over the phone before (though it was less yelling more stern talking, and the store did mess up maybe idk). 
Sorry for the rant. I want to yell at my mom but like having a phone ðŸ˜‘
