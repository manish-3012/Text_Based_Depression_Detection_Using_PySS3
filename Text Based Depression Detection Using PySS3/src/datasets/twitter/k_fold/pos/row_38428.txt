Is he trying to secretly reject me? My crush once told me I looked like a drug addict or something along the lines of that as a joke. In the way he said it at the time was kindaaa okay with me since he said my name â€œâ€”â€”â€” looks like a ***whatever he said***â€ I just remember making a face and whispering â€œohhhh kay?â€? To myself (we were in a group setting and he was next to me) 

He has a very sarcastic voice so I donâ€™t know.. he says things like that to a lot of people? I donâ€™t â€”â€” ???

Another time I was briefly sitting with some mutuals and I heard him say something about â€œI donâ€™t like embarrassing peopleâ€  I feel like was probably directed at me? I could just be paranoid. But Iâ€™m an extremely shy and self conscious person. Which may often be interpreted as awkward? Or werid? 

Speaking of which he called me weird once... or twice? (It hurt at the time)

He also called me kind once? 

I donâ€™t know..


Oh shit wait, he called me crusty since everyone kept giving me that nickname

Yeah nvm I need to give up
