My story. I have had a rough time throughout my life and I wanted to discuss it with people like me. I like a lot of you suffer from depression and other mental health issues. I am a bright person and I normally talk to adults because it is so hard to find friends who are like me. Part of the reason why it's so hard to find friends is how much I want to learn and (I am not trying to brag or anything) my intelligence. I want to learn and normally when I talk to an adult they say â€œyour going places kidâ€ or something like that. So I canâ€™t stand kids who donâ€™t want to learn and who don't mess around constantly in class. But I also want to be happy and have friends. I was bullied at my first school ,but the pace of things was right for me, sort of. The issue was I have a condition called dysgraphia. Dysgraphia is a motoring issue where your motor skills arenâ€™t very good and you canâ€™t write fast or actually . Combined with ADHD (which I also have) you get a nasty combo. You have someone who has ideas. And they want to write to them and draw them etc. But they canâ€™t because of their motoring issues. One solution we came up with was to use and iPad to type my work. That combined with a lot of hard work to catch up and get on track. I was excelling. But then everyone bullied be for being different and complained that I got to use the iPad. They also got mad because they saw I was succeeding when using it. I worked extremely hard to get back on track, and I am proud that, but I was bullied for it. The next school I went to was meant to be for kids like me. Not necessarily kids who wanted to learn but kids with â€œlearning differencesâ€. This school was slow but the administration cared and I was doing great for about a year. Then it hit the fan and the school changed. It basically started excepting kids for the money to pay off its debt (it was a private school). The kids they admitted were terrible and extremely hard to learn with. I couldnâ€™t focus and I wanted to learn but couldnâ€™t. Every time I came to the head of the school they just didnâ€™t care about me. I powered through and going into freshman year (this year) I was back at square one for the second time. No friends and a new school. So far this year has been a very mixed bag. I have met kids like me who want to learn, and I was ecstatic about that. But a new issue came up like always. The issue now is that the school isnâ€™t challenging, and again I want to learn and other people are stopping me. I feel powerless because I have been working so hard throughout the years working on my depression and mental health. My ADHD and dysgraphia, but people arenâ€™t allowing me to succeed. I also want to say that just because someone is wealthy and have parents who care about them doesnâ€™t mean they donâ€™t have problems too.
