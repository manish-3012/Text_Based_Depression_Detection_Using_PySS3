I really wish I was well spoken, thatâ€™s what I want the most and I feel like people will have difficulty understanding what Iâ€™m trying to say for the rest of my life I have no clue why Iâ€™m not able to talk about something and people canâ€™t have key takeaways after listening to me. I hate and admire people who are so good at their words, it just comes so naturally to them. I hate them because I want to be them and itâ€™s just so annoying how hard
It is to put my thoughts into words.
