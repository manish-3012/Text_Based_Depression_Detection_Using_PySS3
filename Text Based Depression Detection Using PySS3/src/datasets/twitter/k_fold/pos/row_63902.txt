I like a girl, but I really donâ€™t want to. About a year ago I asked a girl out. She said no. She made it very clear she didnâ€™t feel the same way. I respect that, Iâ€™m not exactly any girlâ€™s dream guy. Looking back I realize she is WAY out of my league. Not prissy or anything like that, sheâ€™s just... her. Problem is, I still like her. And as I said before, sheâ€™s made it clear she doesnâ€™t feel the same way. Itâ€™s just mental gymnastics and a whole bunch of awkwardness whenever Iâ€™m around her. I say this not exactly for solutions, but Iâ€™ll take â€˜em if you got them.Iâ€™m ready to move on, but my heart isnâ€™t. 

P.S. If you really wanna get close with someone, donâ€™t tell them you like them, Eve not if itâ€™s pretty obvious. It just makes it easier to talk to them.
