im officialy 100% into a girl ive hung out with once sheâ€™s honestly the most attractive person Iâ€™ve ever met and sheâ€˜s interested but shy and I donâ€™t wanna show too much interest but ive also been looking forward to the next time we hang out for the past like 5 fucking days. she said sheâ€™s busy all week but also used :( and texted me saying â€œsoon thoâ€ after I fell asleep probably bc she didnâ€™t want me to see it until the morning idk. fuck dude Iâ€™ve been stressing about this so much bc I know that the next time we hang out itâ€™ll be so much fucking fun because I have it planned out perfectly. Now idk if I should literally just wait till the weeks over to hit her up or just wait for her to say something which might never happen because sheâ€™s deadass that shy. like she left me on opened for a month when I first started snapping her because she thought i was cute and didnâ€™t know how to respond to a simply â€œheyâ€ text
