Do non-binary peeps prefer being called handsome or beautiful? Im just genuinely curious. Im a bit if a conservative and most of my life always thought there was 2 genders. After a bit of conversations its obvious that there's people that don't tend to fit into the 2 main genders. Thus it brings up a bit of a question, do non-binary people prefer being called handsome or beautiful? Like cause ladies tend to enjoy being called beautiful and guys tend to be called handsome, so what do the people that don't fit into either gender like being complimented with?
