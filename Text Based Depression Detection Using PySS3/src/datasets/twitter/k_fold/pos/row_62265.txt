My moms pissing me off My mom called me a cry baby, an attention seeker, a liar, and a drama queen my whole life and now she's doing those things and I call her out for it and she said that no body loves her (even though my dad and brother worship her) and "would I get your attention if I killed myself" even though she knows i'm depressed and suicidal (i'm taking meds) and she gaslights me all the time. And then after that she was just casually laughing as if she didn't just say she was going to kill her self for attention and that no body loves her and basically called me the worst daughter. She won't listen to my opinions even if I tried to talk her out of being a controlling hypocrite. What should I do?
