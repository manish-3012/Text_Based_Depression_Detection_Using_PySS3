Help. My post got taken down because of an misunderstanding of a bot. u/MAGIC_EYE_BOT Had mistaken my post to be a repost. This is my post https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/kq2z8b/f_to_pay_respects/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share and it has the same template that the bot linked to me. Can anyone help me make sure I can upload it again without it getting removed?
