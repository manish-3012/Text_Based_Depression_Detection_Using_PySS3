Getting left on read? Just answer that question. What does. Getting left on read mean to yâ€™all?

Bc when I asked this girl why she was. She just said â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with doing that?â€ To which my response is â€œitâ€™s confusing because silent via text can mean so many thingsâ€

She just gets defensive and proceeded to block me. Very confused.
