Ight so like idrk but thereâ€™s this girl in my geography class There is an outlet behind me and sheâ€™ll sometimes charge her phone or earbuds, she seems fairly nice, but Iâ€™ve not even known her for barely a week and sheâ€™s trusted me with her phone on my desk

Nothing important, just wanted to share
