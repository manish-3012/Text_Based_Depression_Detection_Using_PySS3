Who thought communism memes are funny? Omg shutup ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ‘ŠðŸ‘ŠðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡Russia communist funny meme ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
NO
My grandfather for example fought in World War 2 as an Austrian soldier. He wasn't captured but he lived in the Soviet Occupation Zone which didn't like the population. Communism is one of the worst ideologies, the people suffer and the government profits. It's basically the same as saying "omg fascism good guys heil Hitler guys ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£". It was never funny it's just kinda disrespectful. 

I guess I'm actually getting downvoted for this since it's an actual unpopular opinion. The hivemind will beat me up ðŸ‘ŠðŸ˜¤ðŸ™„.
