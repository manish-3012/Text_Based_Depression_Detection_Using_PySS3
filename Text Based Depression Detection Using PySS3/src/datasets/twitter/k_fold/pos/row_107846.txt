Good (female) friend kinda friendzoned me - How should I react? Since that whole pandemic happened, I am in homeschooling.
The girl(17) I am talking about is in the same class as me, we phone every day for ~2,5h daily. That all is going on since 5-6 weeks. We are on one wavelength. I am 16, in 2 weeks I will be 17.

Now on the call today, we talked about relations. (idk how we got onto that topic) Then she told me that she is kinda in love. [Me was very happy, as I got feelings for her].

However, the person she is in love with is the friend of her sister. According to her, she is scared that by sharing her feelings she would hurt the relationship between her sister and him.

Now we phone again tomorrow (video call) and I am lost on how I could help her out of her situation - without ruining any chances I could have.

I know it is a very difficult, but I do not see any solution.
How should I react? What can I do?
