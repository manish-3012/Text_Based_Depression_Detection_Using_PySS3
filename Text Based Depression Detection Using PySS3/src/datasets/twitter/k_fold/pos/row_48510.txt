Hey guys I'm talking about my mental state with a friend. I'm so proud of myself I'm doing what I thought was impossible. I'm talking about my experiences with my (sudo-verbally abusive) family and mental state with a fellow redditor. Idk if he wants me to say his name, but he's really sweet. I feel so much better after speaking with him and he gives me advice on how to improve myself and feel less empty. I would say I didn't deserve him but he probably would say I deserve the best.
