Bruh my teacher is dumb Weâ€™re taking a geography quiz and I asked for clarification on the spelling of Australia. She said â€œyou just said that to everyone. Thank himâ€ She had us name every continent. Everyone knew it was an answer. And I was the last one done so everyone had already finished. I would have messaged her privately to ask but she turned the chat off. Bruh.
