My oneitis was constantly trying to run away from me on our date "I gotta go home, gotta wake up early for work" it was pretty obvious how it was going to end. She was uncomfortable the whole time. But you know, she just felt obliged to go out with me because i had told her to go out again at the end of the previous date. Thats just how life is if you are sub chad. They wont just see you as a man, more like as an annoyance.
