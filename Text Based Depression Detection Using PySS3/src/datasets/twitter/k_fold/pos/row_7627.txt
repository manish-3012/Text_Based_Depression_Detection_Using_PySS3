I still miss him. My best friend and I were really cool with each other. He was nice, gave me compliments, and was funny. Have a lot of good memories with him, but one day, when i asked my mom if I could visit him, she casually told me that he moved. It made my heart sink, because he didn't even say anything. Now, the only friends I have are online.
