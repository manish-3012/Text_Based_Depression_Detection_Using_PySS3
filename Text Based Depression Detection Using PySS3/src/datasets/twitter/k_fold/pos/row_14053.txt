A shoutout to my son I'm not normally a sharer but this is just one of those times.

Last year my son was in high school in Australia, completing year 10. During the year he had 54 entries into the system for behavioural concerns.These were mainly for disobedience, verbal assault toward teachers etc. I don't doubt he would have been a handful. During meetings with the principle of the school, it was suggested that he does not move on to his final two years of school that it would be better for him to focus on finding a career path.

Long story.short., he left school and on Monday he begins his first day of Univeristy studying Business.

 That's a year and a half earlier than if he would have stayed at school.

Big effort and a proud dad.
