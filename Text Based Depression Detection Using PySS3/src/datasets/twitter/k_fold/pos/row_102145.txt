Iâ€™m just ranting about relation ship stuff I saw a post and thatâ€™s why I got this idea btw...

I really only want to be in a relationship because I just want to talk to someone about my problems all night and have a hug when Iâ€™m feeling down and feel wanted and cared... someone who will make me laugh no matter what and will stick by my side threw it all... itâ€™s hard to find ppl who want the same like that but I hope I will find someone one day... idk im mainly just doing this because I see a lot of ppl saying stuff like â€œI GOT A GIRLFRIENDâ€ and it makes me a bit depressed... also yes ik thag this sounds quite pathetic...

Anyways thatâ€™s it have a good day
