my dog is being a bitch and I don't know why hes sad so usally we put the dogs in the laundry room where it's nice and cool/hot for them when they sleep, but lately one of our older dogs keeps winning which I can hear through the walls.

So tonight I brought him into my room and he's still winning and now I can't sleep.

No, I can't move him back or I'll wake my dad up and he'll be mad
