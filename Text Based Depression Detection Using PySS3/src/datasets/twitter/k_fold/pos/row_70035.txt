Ok, so I'm mad now. . . (This is about the anime So I'm a spider so what?) I have seen the most recent episode of the anime and I've also read 4 of the light novels (I'm not spoiling anything.) and the anime is much more different than the light novels. for example, The light novel involves a lot more action, the protagonist is a lot smarter, uses strategy along with always being careful, and the light novel is mainly about the whole survival of the fittest which involves her doing things such as, eating, grinding all the time, and trying to think outside the box. But in the anime the protagonist is clumsy, dramatic, never really pays much attention unless it's important, and usually fools around until they're in danger. overall the anime isn't nearly as good as the light novels but it's still a good anime, If you have any criticism please tell me and I will correct this post please keep anything about the anime or light novels please keep it as vague as possible to prevent spoiling anything.
