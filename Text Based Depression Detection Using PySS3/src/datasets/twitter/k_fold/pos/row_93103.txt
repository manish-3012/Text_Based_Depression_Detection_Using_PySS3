I was forced to be in a relationship with my friend/crush itâ€™s just as weird as it sounds...

so i have this friend letâ€™s call him M. when we started school my absolute CHAD-SIZED BRAIN thought it was a good idea to be friends with someone who i thought was cute, someone being M.

So, me and M became pretty close friends, turns out we like a lot of the same stuff. for however long me and M have been friends people have been â€œshippingâ€ us, and like half the school already thinks weâ€™re dating. 

at this point, i still think heâ€™s cute and all that shit, but I doubt weâ€™ll ever be together.

so one day my â€œfriendâ€ decided to run up to M and SOMEHOW managed to convince him to date me for a day for cheese (he likes cheese, i dont know how to explain this) 

anyway he said yes (i didnâ€™t get a day in the matter), and since me nor M had ever been in a real relationship, everyone made fake â€œrulesâ€ to try and keep us together. so we ended up going out for a weekend. 

he never got his cheese btw.

TL;DR: my â€œfriendâ€ forced me to date an actual friend he said yes (i couldnâ€™t) people made fake rules and we ended up dating for a weekend.
