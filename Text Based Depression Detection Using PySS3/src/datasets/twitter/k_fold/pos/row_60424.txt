Yâ€™all ever feel detached? Probably on a daily basis I look in the mirror and see a person but itâ€™s not me. Iâ€™ll just stare at the mirror for what seems like eternity and not really know the person Iâ€™m looking at. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not the only one. Itâ€™s a very weird feeling. Can anybody relate?
