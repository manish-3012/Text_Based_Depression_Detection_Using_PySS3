In person school is a lot better than online school In online school, there is not social interaction, so when the school opened in my country, I was extremely excited. During the quarantine I was feeling trash. Also I couldnâ€™t learn anything, cause I had the option of just muting the tab and playing video games and thatâ€™s what I did. Additionally I like paper a lot more than things on the pc. I like writing on paper more, I like reading on paper texts and I donâ€™t like reading online. Lastly my eyes and head were hurting every fucking day because I was using me pc 12 hours a day and I was feeling like I was dying.
