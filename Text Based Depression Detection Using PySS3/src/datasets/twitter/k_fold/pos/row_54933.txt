The scar is healing yesterday at 8 AM, i did self harm for the first time, i realized my mistake and I promised myself not to do it again. Today, the scar is already almost healed, just needs a little bit more time. Thought I should update you guys, I'll do a final update when the scar is fully healed, and I;ll also give some advice :)
