This is gonna sound so stupid... but i need someone right now. Im so emotionally drained, iâ€™ve been crying for the past 6 days, ive lost my appetite, my motivation, everything. I genuinely donâ€™t know what to do and i wanna die. 

I just got out of a heavy, toxic relationship. But i miss her so much- she was my world, my motivation to do better. Obviously i want to be on that â€˜king shitâ€™ but in reality... i miss her. I miss our convos, her laugh, her smile. 
I genuinely dont think iâ€™ll ever find anyone like her again, we were soulmates. 

Even my best friend of near enough 5 years is turning on me now.. because he coincidentally dated her best friend. They were on shit terms, he got broken but now theyâ€™re starting up again. And heâ€™s making me feel shit about everything that had happened to me- because its always so much negative talk, i cant even talk to someone without them corrupting the convo with pain. 

I dont know what to do.
