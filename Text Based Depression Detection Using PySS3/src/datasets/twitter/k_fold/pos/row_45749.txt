I got hit by a car on my way to work So I got a job at Panda Express like a month ago and I love to walk, so I make my mom let me walk as itâ€™s only a mile from my house. Today I got hit by a car and broke my skull. There was nothing I couldâ€™ve done to prevent it. Please be careful and always be aware of youâ€™re surroundings. It sucks, even if you like being the center of attention you will not like being hit, itâ€™s horrible. Be careful at all times and call emergency services immediately. God bless
