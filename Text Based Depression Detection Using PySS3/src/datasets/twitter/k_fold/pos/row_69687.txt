Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 100 Space.

Some of you may know it as the final frontier.

Some of you may know it as the only place that hasn't been corrupted by capitalism.

Some of you may know it as the place where Space Core and Wheatley will spend the rest of their days together.

But most official definitions of space define it as the ever-expanding area in which everything that has ever existed - and everything that ever will exist - has existed, and will exist. You are in space right now. So am I. We all are. We are all sitting on a rock traveling around a giant ball of plasma at about 107,000 kilometers per hour (66,487 mph), which itself is moving at about 720,000 kilometers per hour (447,387 mph) inside an unbelievably huge galaxy moving at around 2,160,000 kilometers per hour (1,342,200 mph).

"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived **there**\--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam."

\-Carl Sagan, 1994

I think it was appropriate for the first fact in this entire series to be about the two probes we have shot into interstellar space. The final photo the *Voyager 1* probe ever took - known as the "Pale Blue Dot" photo - is perhaps the single most humbling, most important image ever taken. If every human being saw our little planet as it really is in the context of the Universe, I personally think it would make that planet a better place. There is arguably nothing out there right now that does a better job at demonstrating just how ignorant and tiny we are as a species. To the Universe, we and our problems mean absolutely **nothing**. Our complex lives and history are nothing but a tiny trillionth of a trillionth of a speck in a miniscule corner of the grand cosmos that lies beyond us. We haven't even begun to scratch the very top of the surface of everything out there that is waiting to be discovered, and we will likely never know the answer to every question. This may put one very simple, yet very important word in a lot of your minds. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why?**

&amp;#x200B;

Why explore? Why ask all of these questions that we may never know the answer to? Why continue to think that what we do is important? If everything humans have ever done means so little to the Universe, what is the point of even doing it? Why would we scream out into a void that is inevitably going to swallow our screams whole, rendering them completely meaningless to the rest of the expanse of literally EVERYTHING?

"There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? **We choose to go to the Moon!** We choose to go to the Moon...We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, **not** because they are easy, but because they are hard; because **that goa**l will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too."

\-President John F. Kennedy, 1962

There are two futures that may exist for humanity. As you read, I want you to imagine each of these, and I want you to imagine the people that would live in each of them. How would they go about their everyday lives? How would children grow up in this future? How would parents and grandparents tell these children what the past was like?

&amp;#x200B;

The first future is a future in which we give up on exploring space. Humanity decides that - for the reasons I just mentioned above - the journey into the stars is not a worthwhile one. The money, time, and hard work put into the exploration of the Solar System and the Universe beyond is money, time, and hard work not spent well. As a result, no humans ever step foot on another planet or moon. Humanity is forever confined to Earth, and is never again freed from the shackles of the rock it rose from. Eventually, the last human dies, and the entire species ends up going extinct without ever knowing what life outside the pale blue dot was like.

&amp;#x200B;

The second future is one in which the opposite happens. Humanity decides that they *do* want to walk on other worlds. They explore, and set out onto new journeys, to the Moon, Mars, Venus, the asteroid belt, Titan, Europa, Mercury, Ganymede, Io, Enceladus, Triton, Pluto, and *everything* that lies within our Solar System. We choose to **go**. Eventually, it is possible - and even likely - that we grow tired of simply wandering around through one corner of the Milky Way, and instead visit another corner. And another. And a few more. Our reach into the stars goes from interplanetary to interstellar to intergalactic. We unlock the secrets. We answer the questions, many of which we don't even know how to ask. We become a space-faring species, and possibly even discover and cooperate with other space-faring species. We find peace. We unite, not as a specific nation, ethnic group, political party, or anything else, but as a **human race.** We may not become eternal, but we most certainly become prosperous.

&amp;#x200B;

Which of these futures sounds better to you? Would you prefer the one where we do explore, or the one where we do not?  


This may seem far-fetched, but I believe that second future is a real possibility. In 1903, when the Wright Brothers took flight for the very first time, it was widely thought that a human being would never enter space and make it back alive. In April of 1961, Yuri Gagarin did exactly that. A month later, U.S. President John F. Kennedy challenged NASA to land an astronaut on the surface of the Moon and bring them back by the end of the decade. People thought this was a ridiculous idea. Nothing that existed in May 1961 could put a human on the Moon. How can you expect there to be people on the Lunar surface by 1970? Well, thanks to the dedicated work of over 400,000 people, on July 20th, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin each took one small step, and planted their boots on the Moon. Even though he unfortunately never got to see it, JFK's "impossible" dream became a reality. And since then, we have put nearly 600 people in space, visited every planet in our Solar System, landed some of the most advanced machines ever made on a planet tens - sometimes hundreds - of millions of kilometers away, and done enough beneficial research in an orbital lab to ***literally fill over 200 pages on a PDF.***

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the very beginning of our history, we have had a desire to explore. One of the most human traits is to want to be curious, to expand our knowledge, to push the boundaries of what we see as possible. We **want** to be told something is impossible, and then make it possible. Thousands of years ago, when we first entered Europe and Asia, we did it because we **wanted** to explore, and extend our reach. That same desire was present in the tribes who sailed through and settled Oceania with nothing but small canoes. That desire was there when the Vikings became the first people to visit the New World across the Atlantic. It was there when the expedition of Lewis and Clark set out on a dangerous voyage to reach the other shining sea on the West Coast. It was there when people like Yuri Gagarin, Alexei Leonov, Valentina Tereshkova, Boris Volynov, Alan Shepard, John Glenn, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins, John Young, Gene Cernan, Dave Scott, Al Worden, Sally Ride, Valeri Polyakov, Scott Kelly, Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley, Rakesh Sharma, Sultan bin Salman Al-Saud, Guion Bluford, Mae Jamison, and so, so many more chose to be a part of the single greatest adventure in human history.

And finally, it is in you. It is in me. It is in all of us. The exploration of space has taught us that - with enough perseverance, hard work, dedication, and desire to *go* \- humans can accomplish anything. There will be hardships along the way. There already have been many. But we are not a species that gets knocked down and never gets back up. We will only do that when there are none of us left to get up. So, to all of you reading this, no matter who you are, or where you come from, I want you to know that you have that fire in you. **We are humans.** And though that does not mean we are perfect, it does mean that we are resilient. We will never give up. We will expand our knowledge. We will be curious. We will push the boundaries of what is possible. We will persevere. We will dare mighty things. And no matter what stands in our way, **we will explore.**
