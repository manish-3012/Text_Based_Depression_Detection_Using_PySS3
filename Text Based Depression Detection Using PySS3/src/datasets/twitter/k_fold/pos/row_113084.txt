It's valentines day, and I was thinking about something So, they say you should always be honest with your significant other, don't lie, which I would agree with.

But at the same time, if you don't have the confidence to ask someone out with no issue, which is very common, you're expected to fake your confidence, almost like a job interview, which is pretty fake.

So, if I somehow fake my way through to ask someone out, but that's not really me, am I really being truthful? Because, no matter what, that's not who I am. I'm faking it, it's a facade.

Or, maybe when we fake something for long enough, that fake part of ourselves becomes part of our real personality, so part of our real personality actually becomes fake?

I don't know, I'm listening to sad music right now...
