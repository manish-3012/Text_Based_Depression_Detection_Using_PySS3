I don't know why, but I'm always really sad I really don't know why I've been feeling so sad. I should be happy, I have supportive friends, I can finally be openly gay, and I'm improving myself. But for some reason I feel really sad. I want to be happy, but I can't. I'm losing motivation, and I want to do things, but I just can't. If anyone has any advice, that would be amazing.
