Since gay rights and marriage are a somewhat recent thing, is it possible for this to solve over population? I've had this question for a while, and it hurts not knowing the answer. I don't want to seem like a bad person, because sometimes discussing things like this offends people, idk, but I've looked, and have wanted to see people's thoughts.
