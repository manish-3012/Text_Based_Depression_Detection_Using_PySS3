Why is â€œhe/sheâ€ such a common language thing Just use they, like literally even English teachers use he/she. Itâ€™s just stupid, they/them being able to have singular use is hardly a crazy new thing. Not only does it not include everyone, itâ€™s just really fucking clunky. Ughhh language frustrates me so much. Like donâ€™t even get me started on Spanish.
