does playing minecraft increase your memory? I have noticed this a couple of times actually..when ever i play minecraft while doing something i seem to remember what  was going on around me, for instance, my family and i were watching a movie(this happened about six months ago) but i still remember the dialogue that was said and i can remember where i was in the game(I was exploring a cave) the second time i noticed this was during an online class, It was english, so i decided to play minecraft, i missed the whole class but i could hear what was being said.. i still remember the names of all the characters in the story and the whole story.. i don't understand how this is possible, since i was paying no attention to what was being said in the class but i can still remember each word that was said and the block i placed while it was being said. can anyone else relate to this or is it just me?
