Pain only pain ðŸ¤  Well I pretty much never admit feelings to my crushes since Iâ€™m shy but I decided to finally just confess and see how it goes. Me and my crush have been friends for a while and Iâ€™ve had feelings for several months, this is how the convo goes. 

Me:  â€œI have to tell you somethingâ€
Him:  â€œyeah whatâ€™s upâ€ 
Me: â€œI really like you and I have for a while.I know weâ€™re great friends but I want to be something more.â€ 
Him: â€œI mean youâ€™re hot and all but Iâ€™m not looking for a relationship, FWB?â€
Me: *stares at my phone screen for legit 5 minutes in pain* â€œnah thatâ€™s not something Iâ€™m interested in weâ€™re cool though right?â€
Him: â€œyeah weâ€™re coolâ€ 

Anyways probably never doing this type of thing  again 0/5 â­ï¸ I do not recommend ðŸ¤ ðŸ‘
