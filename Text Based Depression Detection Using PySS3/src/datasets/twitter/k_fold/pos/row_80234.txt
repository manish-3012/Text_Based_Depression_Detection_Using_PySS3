I pulled a Joe Mama joke on my history teacher I'm in a french speaking school but the "immersion" option gives you History, Geography and English course all in English (for those who wanna be better at it)

So basically, the teacher asked the following question : Who's absent ?

I couldn't hold back any longer, i had to say it

Joe's absent ! i said

Who's Joe ? he asked

J o e  M a m a

he didn't get it at first so i had to be like

Your Mama
Yo Mama
Joe Mama

still was pretty funny and fortunately i didn't get anything bad

(this happened in september i thought i'd tell abt it here now becos why not)
