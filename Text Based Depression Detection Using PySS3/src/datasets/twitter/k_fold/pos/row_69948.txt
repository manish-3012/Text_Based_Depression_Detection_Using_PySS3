I once won first second and third place on kahoot I was in science and we did a kahoot and just for shits and giggles I used my phone and two laptops playing with all of them I got gold silver and bronze. But the crazy part is that then my class accused me of cheating even though having multiple accounts was actually caveat that made it harder and I still crushed their pathetic asses.
