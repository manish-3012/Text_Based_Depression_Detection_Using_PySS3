Thereâ€™s this girl I work with that I think I might really like, and I donâ€™t know if she likes me back. Context: weâ€™re both 16 and work at a grocery store. Iâ€™ve kinda been showing off a little in random things that I do. For example, I vaulted on top of a line of carts to get them unstuck. I didnâ€™t need to, I just did it. She made a comment about how strong I must be if I can do that, and I said itâ€™s not all that hard. Itâ€™s in the abs, not the arms. She said, jokingly, I probably had an eighteen-pack or something. I laughed with her, then I said if I had an eighteen-pack, Iâ€™d have no problem getting a girlfriend. She went silent for a few seconds, then changed the subject. Thatâ€™s what tipped me off that she might like me. Weâ€™ve had a few text conversations that I can add in the comments, as well as other IRL things that have happened, if you need to know that. I just really want to know if she likes me or not.
