Iâ€™m going on a date later today and having my first kiss Iâ€™m so excited, and the best part is its with someone i would never guess. Me and my old best friend/crush regained contact recently, and they felt the exact same way! Weâ€™re going on a date to a cemetery thatâ€™s huge, and we have a whole bucket list of stuff to do! Iâ€™m so excited that my first kiss will be with them :))))))))) i never thought i would even see them again. Also they said theyâ€™d make up for everyday i didnâ€™t get a hug so Iâ€™m also getting a lot of hugs :))) Iâ€™m just so happy and excited and a bit nervous :)
