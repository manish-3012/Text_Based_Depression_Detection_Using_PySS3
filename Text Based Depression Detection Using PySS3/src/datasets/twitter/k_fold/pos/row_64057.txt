I know that this will die, but I would like anyone's help. As you know Christmas is coming up, and due to covid my family has been struggling. My four siblings and I are going to do a secret santa, The ideal limit is $20. This is where the problem comes in, we have a xbox one. If we were to get a new game it would be for everyone, but we don't have gold or gamepass. We are also not allowed to play any fps games. I've done research and I have lowered It down to 

Subnautica 

Astroneer (I am willing to pay $10 and more if it comes to it)

and KSP(basic). 

I just want to be sure that we are getting the most out of this. In short this probably sounds like I'm being weird worrying over "just some game" but I would still like anyone's input . thank you.
