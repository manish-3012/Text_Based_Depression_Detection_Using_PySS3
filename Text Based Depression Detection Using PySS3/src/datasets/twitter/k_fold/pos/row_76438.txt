I got exams 2 weeks later and I almost know nothing. My exams start 2 weeks later and I know nothing. Some of them are very important classes, others are a bit easier.

I want to study and get good grades, but I just can't get myself do that. Even when I do, I study for 10-20 minutes, I get extremely bored and start browsing on youtube, reddit in bed. -I don't enjoy doing these but I just do-

I'm in a huge rut -I'm not a native speaker, I might've used this wrong but you get what I mean- and I can't get out. Any advice, reply would be appreciated.
