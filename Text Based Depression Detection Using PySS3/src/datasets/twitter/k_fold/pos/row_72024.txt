[Mod] Mod AMA &amp; Teenserv 5 Year Anniversary! Have you heard? The official r/teenagers discord server, otherwise known as Teenserv, is celebrating it's 5th birthday today!!

**You can join via discord.gg/teenagers !**


While it isn't quite old enough to be a member here, we've lined up a number of events to celebrate!


â€¢ **Mod AMA!** This time, the AMA will start on the subreddit. Ask any questions for any moderator to answer. All three branches (Reddit, Discord, and TG) will be participating, and answering any sort of questions you can think of for the next week!

We will also be having a live VC AMA in the discord server. A time will be announced later this week!



We also have a few discord specific events lined up. You can read about them here, or in the #events channel in the discord server.

â€¢ **New Emote Contest!** Submit up to 2 normal and 2 animated emotes in #emote-submission , where the Event Team will vote on it. If your emote gets accepted, you'll receive a special role with a very nice color! @Emote Contest Winner 2021 ! You can find some more information and guidelines in #emote-submission pinned. 

â€¢ **#5-year-anniversary  !** Share your favorite memories, moments, or even friends you've made during your time here. (Or even just why you like the server!) Attendees will receive the shiny @5 Year Attendee role!


Thank you!
