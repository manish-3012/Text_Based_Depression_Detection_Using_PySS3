My family thinks I'm a god at dealing with technology So my family thinks that if there's something that has anything to do with technology of any sorts then I will know how to fix it.  It's hella anoying and think I'm being lazy when I cant fix it. 
For example last week my sistes space bar on her keyboard stopped working and instead of searching it up or something she asks me to fix it even tho I've never owned a keyboard and when I couldn't she got mad at me and thought I was being lazy.
Ex2: I learned how to hookup a console between 5 and 7 years old and how to switch the hdmi of a tv but apparently that's too complicated for anyone else to do and they don't know and don't want to learn how to do it.  
Ex3:. My sister is 11 and didn't know how to connect to the internet on her ps4 and would as me to do for her every single time she got disconnected and got pissed when I tried to show her how so she could do it by herself
Ex4:My dad turned on his hotspot from his phone for my sister and brothers ipad's and it wasn't working for some reason and they expected me to know the reason and solution to it, then after I obviously couldn't my sister was begging me to try again because she thought that it was because her bluetooth was on
Ex5: my mom wanted me to set up the wifi because she "didn't know how to" even though she had the instructions and could've done it herself, and when ever the wifi goes out everyonen asks me what's wrong with it and expects me to know the solution and when I tell them to go reset the wifi they look at me puzzled and just tell me to do it

There's more examples but I'ma just leave it at this
