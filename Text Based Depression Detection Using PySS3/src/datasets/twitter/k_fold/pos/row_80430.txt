I've grown an emotionally attached to bouncing this balloon Ok so I was fooling around with a balloon 30 minutes ago and like any normal person I started to play that game where you keep the balloon in the air for as long as you can. Like I said in the first sentence I've been doing this for half an hour now. I have become emotionally attached to this game and if I stop now, I'll feel like I've failed myself. I don't know how long I can keep this up. And before you ask, yes, I did write this paragraph while bouncing the balloon around the house. Help.
