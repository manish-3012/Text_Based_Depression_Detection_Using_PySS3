I need more friends I realized today that I donâ€™t actually have that many friends. I used to feel guilty for never texting anyone asking to hang out, but then I realized they never texted me either. Someone I considered a friend texted me for the first time since April 2020, asking if I was going to join the spring softball team. I said yes, asked her if she was going to, and never got a response. 

How do you know when people are fake friends until you need them and they arenâ€™t there? Iâ€™ve been on the side of trying to hold a friendship together and being the only one to give advice or start a conversation. I have a boyfriend, and itâ€™s a healthy relationship. We talk to each other, and I look forward to seeing him. I donâ€™t really have that with any other friends. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a mean person, or Iâ€™m not a good friend, but whereâ€™s the line between people just not being compatible, and someone just being a bad person? I used to feel sad because I convinced myself I was the common denominator in all my failed friendships, so it must be me. Any insight?
