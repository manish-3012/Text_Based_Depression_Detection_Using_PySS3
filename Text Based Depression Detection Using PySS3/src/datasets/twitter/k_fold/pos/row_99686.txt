I just started listing to Dua Lipa The first time I heard one of her songs was like a year ago but tbh I kinda felt and still feel a little bit ashamed listening to such music but I enjoy it when I am alone or when I am just wearing earphones.

Tbh the reason I started listening to her now is because the girl I am interested in also likes Dua Lipa and since I have quite similar music tastes with her I thought that I should check it out.

Her music is pretty cool tbh. Anyways, imma go back to working out while listening to this. Thank you for reading.
