I found out my real bra size - and you should, too. Hello, this is to all the girls on here. We are young and probably insecure as well - I am too.

So I went to a lingerie store with my boyfriend mainly to buy some hot underwear and left the store with my first actually fitting bras. An employee asked us if we needed help, and soon we found out, that I don't need B or C bras but E's. Before I have been too insecure to get myself some help on buying bras, but I should have asked for it earlier. 

So here's some advice to you fellow girls - get help if you're unsure about buying bras. It's not as big as a deal as you think and bras don't need to be uncomfortable - at least not as much. I heard that many women wear the wrong bra size, and I can see why. 

Sorry if this isn't quite the right place to put this, but I didn't know where else to put this.
