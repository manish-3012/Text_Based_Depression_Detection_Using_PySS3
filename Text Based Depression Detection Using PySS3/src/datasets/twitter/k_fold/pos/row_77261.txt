Merry Christmas from Straya Dashing through the bush,
in a rusty Holden Ute,
Kicking up the dust,
esky in the boot,
Kelpie by my side, 
singing Christmas songs,
It's Summer time and I am in 
my singlet, shorts and thongs


Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
Christmas in Australia 
on a scorching summers day, Hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Christmas time is beaut!,
Oh what fun it is to ride in a rusty Holden Ute.


Engine's getting hot; 
we dodge the kangaroos,
The swaggie climbs aboard, 
he is welcome too.
All the family's there, 
sitting by the pool,
Christmas Day the Aussie way, 
by the barbecue.


Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
Christmas in Australia 
on a scorching summers day, Hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Christmas time is beaut!,
Oh what fun it is to ride in a rusty Holden Ute.


Come the afternoon, 
Grandpa has a doze,
The kids and Uncle Bruce, 
are swimming in their clothes. 
The time comes 'round to go, 
we take the family snap,
Pack the car and all shoot through, 
before the washing up.


Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
Christmas in Australia 
on a scorching summers day, Hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Christmas time is beaut!,
Oh what fun it is to ride in a rusty Holden Ute.
