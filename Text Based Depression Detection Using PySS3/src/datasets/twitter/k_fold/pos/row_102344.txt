How do I convince my parents that I should be able to play for more than 1 hour a day? They said it was not healthy, so I took to the sites which said that around 2 hours is fine but they also had the usual bs of "Play minecraft creative rather than minecraft survival because minecraft survival makes your kids more aggressive"., so I can't show them that. Are there any solid facts that I can show them that can make them think that 1 hour is pretty little?
