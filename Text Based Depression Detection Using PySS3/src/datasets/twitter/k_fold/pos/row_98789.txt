There once lived a sheep, that sheep had a mother and a father. the father was a chinese government member, the mother was a hitman. ever once in a while, the father would tell the sheep a story:

listen son, no matter what, I'm never gonna let you down, never gonna give you up, never gonna roll around and desert you.

okay, the story is over, give us 10 seconds to get you out. if you are not not by then, I'm truly sorry, we did all we could...
