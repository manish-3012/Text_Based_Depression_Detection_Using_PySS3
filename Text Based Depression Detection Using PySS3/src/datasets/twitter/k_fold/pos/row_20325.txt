Iâ€™m extremely fucking paranoid I could get in serious trouble So it all started when I downloaded tiktok.  


I didnâ€™t bother make an account and just scrolled.

but the I saw straight up cp (it had filters but I could tell what it was) so I reported the video and closed it.

i thought. One thing canâ€™t get me in trouble because it was an accident and went to report the video

&amp;#x200B;

but then assholes kept reposting that video. Aswell as some others. And every now and then it would appear. i also got airdropped and illegal video during school lunch. And despite my best efforts of reporting and closing everything and deleting my cache Iâ€™m still extremely paranoid. Itâ€™s my worst fear to be registered as an offender and be trapped in this shit town.
