MY ENGLISH TEACHER WATCHES ANIME YOYOYOYOYO HOLY FUCKING S H I T

My English teacher, a 60 something year old Korean man, got into a discussion with my class about anime. This isn't just a "Hahahaha, anime's so weird!" discussion. This guy knows his s h i t . We talked about Haikyuu, Food Wars, Hunter x Hunter, JoJo, and even fucking Hentai. I even recommended Gurren Lagann to him! Holy fucking hell!
