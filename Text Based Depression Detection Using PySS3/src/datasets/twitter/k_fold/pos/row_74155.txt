Minecraft server Hi guys gals and non-binary pals wanna play  on a Minecraft server we are  
A small server looking for more active players!

Whitelisted 1.16.1 Java server looking to add age 16+ mature members to our server- must pass a very simple on call interview on discord to be considered. 

Hello hello!

PeekieCraft is a Java server with about 8 active players and we're looking to add more active players. We're looking to get about 20-35 in total from different places so that there will be active members most hours of the day. We are hosting though a reliable server so there should be little to no lag and if there is thereâ€™s likely an admin online to assist any issues. We have a discord server set up as well to make communication easy. 

There is data and resource packs added (Vanilla Tweaks). Making the server mostly Vanilla. The server runs on the basic rules of humanity (similar rules to actual hermitcraft), honors system and human decency. Spawn is right next to the shopping district (mushroom biome) and we have a nether hub on the roof. We have been open since June 25th so we are a little ahead but that doesnâ€™t stop anything. We will make you a set of iron, give food, and set you up to be on your way to a good start in the server. 

We would love to see people come together and to see different building styles and to work together when needed. Small builds and mega builds are all welcome! 

If you are interested, feel free to comment below or message my discord Gray#4020 with this as your subject, from there was can do the interview and youâ€™ll likely get pushed through to the discord and then to PeekieCraft. 

We are all friendly and look forward to meeting new players and working together! 

TLDR: a server ran on honors system full of cool people. Just looking to create a community :)
