I am a teenager who supports Trump. No, this isnâ€™t a meme. Iâ€™m serious. With everything going on in America, right now is the best time to have a civil discussion. Itâ€™s honestly ridiculous all these BLM riots (yes, riots, burning down businesses is not a peaceful protest) have only further divided this country. In 2016, there was no way I would ever support Trump. But after seeing whatâ€™s going on right now in America, itâ€™s time for change. Change we are not getting or going to get from Biden, who has openly lied to America. Iâ€™m tired of living in a world where people lose jobs and careers over pro-Trump statements. Iâ€™m tired of being scared to share my views. We need a discussion. We need to stop censorship of #ALL kinds, left or right. Sit down, and talk. At the end of the day, we all bleed red.  No one is perfect, weâ€™re all human. Go ahead, downvote me. I donâ€™t care, but itâ€™ll be a cold day in hell before I stop urging everyone to just stop and have a conversation. 

Thank You.
