I dont fit in with this sub and here's why So I came to the realization that even though I'm a teenager I don't fit in with this sub one bit:

1. Everyone here is so sensitive. If I don't find a meme funny and I say my opinion on it, people's feelings get hurt and I get called an asshole. 

2. Everyone here fakes depression. If I call someone out for faking depression, I get called an asshole and told that "they might be telling the truth and I might be driving them to suicide with my comment" even though their meme is obvious they're faking it. 

3. So much repetitive posts such as "I asked my crush out" and "school system bad". I hate seeing these so yea this sub isn't for me.
