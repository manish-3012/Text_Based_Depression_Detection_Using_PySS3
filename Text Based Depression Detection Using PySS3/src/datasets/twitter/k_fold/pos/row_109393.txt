hereâ€™s a rant iâ€™ll delete in a few minutes fuck Bull of Heaven.

bull of heaven is a â€˜bandâ€™ that, in essence, is anti-music, for me at least. look them up on youtube and see any of their â€˜songs.â€™ your first reaction, if your a normal human being, will be: â€˜this is shit and sounds bad.â€™ sadly, though, one of you may say â€˜oh this is beautiful symbolic art, satire on songs, and i think some parts of it sound good.â€™ to anyone who even dares to think that, i hope you get skewered like a marshmallow.

ive been filled with hatred for this â€˜bandâ€™ and its followers for a few weeks by now. never have i hated something more. every argument they have to uphold their shitty little sound is absolutely fucking insane and shite. â€˜oh, itâ€™s, uh, just experimental music, and it has a deeper meaning!!!â€™ a follower of them may ask. to that i say â€˜fuck off, neckbeard scum.â€™

complete utter shite, they make. they make ridiculously long songs, one being two months longâ€”you heard that right, two whole months long. oh, and it must be somehow artistic, right? no. god, no. god, why. it isnt art when it hurts to hear. it isnt art when it is rubbish. it isnt art when people only like it because itâ€™s â€˜symbolicâ€™ or some bullshit. 

iâ€™m not kidding when i say hate, by the way. the full definition of the world, multiplied three times and exponent-ed three times each of those three times. i hate it. and in the unimaginable idea that bull of heaven itself sees thisâ€”i hate you.

tl;dr to all who are unlucky enough to see this: bull of heaven doesnâ€™t make music, they make discordant sound, and everyone who likes them i personally want to smash an unabridged, hard cover version of War and Peace against their head.

i would say more but i donâ€™t want to be banned.
