The last 2 years I had a really poor social interaction because of studies and those are going bad even I'm really on them Basically I had chased studies that by itself are hard, and in my case, are even harder. I usually don't have any day at a month that I can just go with friends or something. And seeing the other people having fun just makes me more sad. And I am not of that people who have so many friends to talk with.  I guess this is normal, but these 2 years are being too hard for me and some teachers treat me like I'm of that people who never do anything because my grades even if I really make an effort are just bad. So I'm feeling I'm not doing anything great.
