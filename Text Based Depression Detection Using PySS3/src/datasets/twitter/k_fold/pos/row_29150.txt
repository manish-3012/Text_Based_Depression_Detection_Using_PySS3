Find a YouTube video that has only a couple of hundred comments and comment "first" Someone will argue with you, they can't resist. Simply reply to their arguement with "first". They'll argue even more. Just keep replying "first" under every one of their arguments. 

It's amazing watching people waste their time.

Works best if you find a recent upload of a popular YouTuber.
