Please donâ€™t worry about me Ms. Delgado, just a little tired

Nah, Iâ€™m ok you go ahead sis, Iâ€™m a bit tired

Yeah, Dani, Iâ€™ll get on later

Iâ€™m sorry for making you worry, Mr. Suscena

Please dad, leave me alone for a bit, Iâ€™m just tired

Sorry, mate Iâ€™m really tired, I wonâ€™t be able to make it today, have fun
