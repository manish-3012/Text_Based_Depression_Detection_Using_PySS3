Episode 15.5/36 of my 13 hour anime binge Turns out that there was actually another 7 minutes in ep 15 that I didn't see cause they for some reason played the end song in the middle of the episode but the episode got dark as hell cause they just killed 5 kids and made the dude taking care of them go off the fucking rails so this shit got a lot darker a lot fucking quicker than I expected
