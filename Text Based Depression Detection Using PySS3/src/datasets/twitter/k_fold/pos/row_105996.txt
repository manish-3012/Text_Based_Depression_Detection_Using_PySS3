whenever i think of her my breath feels heavy as if she has taken a place near my heart! MY LOVE Story keeps getting lost but no one cares. I am feeling a little depressed...........  

FIRST OF ALL, I must tell u that i am an INDIAN.

. SO nowadays the season of weddings is on. I went to my NANA's(maternal grandpa) house and attended some weddings there. SO everything was going well and then.....I noticed a girl......... She looked too perfect. She wasnt a great pick as a love but she was great. I just wanted to see her always with me. I developed a liking towards her very soon. Unfortunately I was able to meet her only 3 days. Day before tomorrow i just spoke to her that in which class u are(DESPITE OF KNOWING THAT FROM MY FRIEND) and she is my age mate. I was happy . But today was my last day there. I had to go back my home by 2:00 PM. I prayed to GOD a lot that just make me meet her one time. It didnt work out. I became very sad. The next moment i was motivated. I decided to be so successful that i could meet her again.I WILL DEFINITELY MEET HER AGAIN
