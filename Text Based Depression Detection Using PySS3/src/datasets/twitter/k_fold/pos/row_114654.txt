Life tips from an old ballsack English is not my first language yada yada...

\- Be realistic. That goes for all aspects of your life (relationships, jobs, college, beauty ...): Most people don't have the money / time / emotional conditions to buy a mansion, have an Olympic-size swimming pool, have sex worthy of a porn movie every day, do plastic surgery, travel every year ... What I mean is, keep dreaming, but learn to appreciate simpler and more realistic things. Nowadays teenagers receive encouragement from all sides about how successful, wealthy, beautiful and hot all people are, and how you should be so as not to be a complete failure. Just don't believe the hype.

\- Nobody cares about your popularity in high school. With rare exceptions, you probably won't be in touch with almost anyone you went to school with, so don't be too stressed by their opinion.

\- No, life is not boring. Life seems boring to you because you feel so much more than adults (thanks, hormones), and it is for that same reason that you may think that people don't love you. But take the opportunity to cry a lot when you end a relationship, and fall in love like you're in a movie, and have fun like you're going to be a teenager forever.

\- Learn to put yourself more in the shoes of others (especially your parents). And yes, I am aware that some of you have parents who are complete imbeciles, but most of you do not. I know that carrying out tasks at home is a pain, and that following orders that you consider useless is also a pain, but believe me, you would also be without much patience if you worked all day, were responsible for creating someone else, made food, wash clothes, and have to beg someone to wash a dish or take out the trash.

\- You will probably never have as much free time as you do now, so invest at least a little of that time to learn things that will be useful in the future: taxes, work, extracurricular activities, learning a new language ... It's more worth going fewer parties now and have a better job in the future (to have money to spend on parties lol)

\- Eventually you are going to have a relationship, and have sex, so relax.
