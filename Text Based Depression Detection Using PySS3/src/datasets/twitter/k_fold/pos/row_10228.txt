I'm sad today I went to go to my local store and get my daily dose of bread. When I realised that I went to the wrong store, so I said " I'll just get bread from here". This shop in fact doesn't sell bread. So I left to go to my local store (the one that does do bread btw) but it was closed. So I took the bus home. It came to my stop but the bus didn't stop, so I ran quickly to get downstairs but I just fell down the stairs (I basically jumped down them cause I skipped a few of the steps on the fall). I went home to find out that my favourite youtuber didn't post today. Anyways I am in my bedroom crying AND I STILL DON'T HAVE BREAD.
