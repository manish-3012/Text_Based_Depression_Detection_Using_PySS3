The kindness of humanity I just went to my local corner store to grab a 2 liter of code red so I could do some gaming right? Now Iâ€™ve been going there for years, and itâ€™s extremely close to my house. And from going there for many years I have come to learn that a 2 liter of soda is $2.00 so thatâ€™s all I brought. When I went to the cashier he told me it was $2.43 now, as you may recall I only had $2 so I patted my jean pockets and just said â€œFuckâ€ and the absolute chad that is the cashier that Iâ€™ve seen for years said â€œI got bro you can goâ€ and never before have I been so touched by the kindness of humanity.
