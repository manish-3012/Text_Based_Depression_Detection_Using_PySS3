How to make girls laugh like I can make guys laugh ? Like man I was always a funny kid all my male friends agreed with me on this point but why the hell does girls get weirded out when I make a joke about anything that is slightly masculine or straight up anything anyone can relate? What am I going to joke about ? From my point of  view our female classmates only laugh at the poor kid in our class getting bullied or something I really can't understand.
