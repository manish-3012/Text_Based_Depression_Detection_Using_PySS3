how the Simpsons s2:e1 called out the school system the Simpsons wasn't exactly a childhood show I started watching when I was 10 and finished it when I was 12 because I had a life and it had 32 fucking seasons, and when I originally watched it I didn't catch onto a lot of the social commentaries but recently I sat down and watched the first 4 seasons, and S2:E1 was Bart get's an F where essentially Bart is failing and before his final his teacher told him that if he failed the exam he would have to redo the fourth grade, and Bart not wanting to be stuck in school for another year tries his best studying but ultimately ends up getting a 59% and his teacher was not surprised but was surprised with his reaction of "now I know how George Washington felt when he surrendered the fort of necessity to the French in 1754" causing his teacher to give him an extra mark giving him a d-

now rewatching this I realized that what this symbolizes is how school isn't about  learning, it's about training your brain to care about grades. your grades don't mean a fucking thing in elementary school, but they make it seem like it does to force you to care, you're not learning what you want you're learning useless, shitty little tidbits which, quite literally, 98% of which you won't use after school so it's not about learning useful things it's about fucking up your brain into studying for these things, and it's not just teachers, during the parent teacher conference where the teacher says if he fails he would have to restart the year his parents don't give shit, but you know damn well 95% of parents are not like that at all even in elementary school where your grades don't mean shit.

the letter A doesn't mean a damn thing

the letter f doesn't mean a damn thing

it's just that they trick your brain into associating pleasure or discouragement and what we really need is for that to stop

also considering that episode was from 1990 shows how little things have changed

but the other point I want to make is that when Bart gets a d- his family celebrates, even his straight A sister. it wasn't an A it wasn't a good grade in any sense but they celebrate, cheer, hang the test on the fridge, and this shows that you shouldn't only celebrate huge victories, you should celebrate progress, something that nobody does, even if it's a little progress, your average grade goes up by 2 or 3 points, it's still progress you might be getting better slowly, but the point is that you're getting better, it shouldn't matter if you're getting better slower than the rest of the class fuck them, if they didn't exist then you would be celebrated for achieving something but since they get better faster than you you're being compared to them not celebrated
