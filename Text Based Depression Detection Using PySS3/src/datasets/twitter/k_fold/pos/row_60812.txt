I need some advice I used to "date"/talk to this girl a few months ago (like 7 months ago). I recently got myself a PC and totally forgot we were friends on spotify (its been 6 months since we last talked) and she popped up on the side of my screen. I check out her profile real quick. And this layed-back, goody two shoes girl I used to know apparently turned into a mad woman. I'm just basing this off of spotify but her playlist names are "Watsed" "Feeling Lost" "Sneaking Out" "My Broken Heart" and whatever a "Deadly Sin" playlist is. Now I wanna go check in on her and see if she is doing alright. She never drunk, smoked, snuck out while we were "dating" and she never did prior either. But I feel like it will be weird and it's almost like I don't want to reopen some wounds (I broke up with her). What do yall think I should do?
