My great grandmother died My great grandma was in her 90s and was in the hospital with heart problems. She had started to come up with Alzheimerâ€™s as well. I hadnâ€™t been able to see her because of COVID precautions my parents just got the news that she had died at the hospital very recently (and no she did not have corona). It was her time I had just hoped she would have lasted a few more years but if she did it would have been devastating for everyone as she slowly forgot them. May she Rest In Peace.
