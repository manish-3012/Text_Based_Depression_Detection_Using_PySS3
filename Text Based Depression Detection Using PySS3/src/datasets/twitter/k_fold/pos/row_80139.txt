My girlfriend broke up with me And in the process she revealed to me that she cheated on me with the guy she told me not to worry about, and she's the first girl I've ever loved, and on the way out the door she kept telling me she liked me and loved me and even tried kissing me, I talked to my mom immediately afterwards after crying on the way to meet her and I explained to her what happened and she told me not to let her back in my life, and she's still sending me texts trying to be friends. 

I need a friend :(
