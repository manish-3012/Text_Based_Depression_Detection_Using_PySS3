I need help/advice/something So as for long as I can remember, I loved sugar and carbs. I literally will just eat sugar and more sugar and more sugar. Iâ€™m pretty skinny because not only do I naturally donâ€™t really gain weight, but I perform circus/aerial so i work out a lot. 

My parents are relatively healthy so we usually donâ€™t have a ton of sugar in the house. Sometimes, we will have a bag of chocolate chips or marshmallows or something like that. When we do, I a can never resist grabbing a bunch and consuming them. Last year, I would use my own cash to buy candy that i wasnâ€™t allowed to have. This year, after Halloween, there was a huge bag of candy in my house. I got into a bad habit of not eating breakfast and â€œforgettingâ€ my lunch at school only to walk home and binge eat candy. 

If I was put in a candy store, I donâ€™t think I would be able to stop eating until everything was gone. 

I donâ€™t know. Because of my family, Iâ€™m not really exposed to that much sugar and that has definitely been a good thing. Iâ€™m just worried that as I get older, I wonâ€™t be able to cut off the weight and Iâ€™ll just keep eating. 

I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s something wrong with me, or what. Please just say something lol
