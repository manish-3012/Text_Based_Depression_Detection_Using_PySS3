I got banned from /lgbt because somehow Iâ€™m transphobic I got banned from r/lgbt cause Iâ€™m apparently Iâ€™m transphobic

I made a post about superstraight. Basically what it said was that you donâ€™t have to date a trans person but making a whole sexuality out of it is disrespectful. It got removed and banned. I messaged the mods explaining what I posted and they responded. Apparently I was supporting SuperStraight which makes me transphobic. 

Iâ€™m not supporting Superstraight???? Iâ€™m transphobic????? What
