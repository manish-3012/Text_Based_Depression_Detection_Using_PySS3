The main issue issue I have with Netflix's Fastest Car is... Is that it feels it has fast and furious syndrome, were it was written for car people by non-car people, and this is the main thing as well, they swapped  dragster with sleeper. How da fuck do you mess up those two? One is a nice example with hidden power at all times, the ones they call "sleepers" are frankestined together with junk yard parts, they look like they would be better at lemons instead of a drag racing facing, nd also the people they pick are clearly drag racers. It just pisses my off that they don't know the simple definition of a sleeper car.
