Ya boi just got tested for covid Lol, I have rashes in my throat that were bleeding yesterday. I have no pain, but my pediatrician said I might have covid, or some form of hand foot and mouth. They just shoved this thing up both my nostrils and it stung, like wtf, lol. 

In all seriousness I donâ€™t mean to hash on any covid victims, and I am extremely sorry for how it has affected yâ€™all and yâ€™allâ€™s families. 

I just wanted to rant this to someone, so good luck on your endless quest of scrolling. 

Iâ€™ll update in 15 minutes when the test gets in.
