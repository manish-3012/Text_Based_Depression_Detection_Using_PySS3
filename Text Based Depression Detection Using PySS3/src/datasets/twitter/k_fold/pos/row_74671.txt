I'm currently in 8th grade and we have a math teacher that's not great...advice? TLDR:

my teacher never grades anything and isn't very good at explaining math concepts, I'm worried we're not really learning anything this year in math. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be rude about him because he means well, and is a nice person, but not really the best teacher. He doesn't even do the bare minimum. He hardly ever has tests, never grades, barely gives out homework. Now, I enjoy the idea of freedom from grades on its own, but he also isn't great at explaining the concepts. Sometimes he doesn't even teach some of them, (this isn't really his fault, we're very time-constricted), just hands out a bunch of papers to us and lets us go. 

Since he rarely grades,  I have no idea if I'm getting any of these answers right. We've literally had ONE piece of work graded this entire year, a quiz in the first trimester. I got a B and thought, "It's ok, they'll be more tests to make up for it! It's just a quiz." Little did I know.....

So, yeah. For those in my class who got a D on that tiny quiz, they get a D for the entire trimester. For our 2nd trimester, we just don't have a grade, since he doesn't look at a single thing we do anymore. I've talked to other students in the class, and they're also struggling with getting the concepts he teaches in class. I try my best to take lots of notes and ask as many questions as possible in class, but I just feel like we're all doomed at this point and will never be able to catch up next year.
