I want to fucking die Not that i will commit suicide, it's just what happened, is not something so serious, but i want to get it from my chest, i sent a shitpost to my dad, it was just a tf2 jojo meme, he became angry and told me being like that is the reason no-one wants to spend time with me, i'm not the kind of person who blast the USSR anthem or spam bass boosted stuff, i just wanted to share it with my dad, my problem is that is not the first time that my parents tell me something like that, over my entire life they've been always like that, making me think everyone hates me for who i am, telling everyone they met how they always expected me to become a bad person, reproaching every mistake i made ,criticize me for being a "close minded" just for not believing in pseudo-science, forcing me to socialize and then yell at me because i felt emotionally drained, forget every bad think that they've done and say i'm lying, it's just i'm tired of all this shit, i just want to escape from all of this.

My plan it's to wait until i graduate, use my grades and saved projects to go study abroad and cut all connections with them.
