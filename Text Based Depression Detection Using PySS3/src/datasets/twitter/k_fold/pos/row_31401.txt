I fricked up and need some help... Please... So I'm in pep band, so is my best friend lawrence, I call him Lary for short, and so is Jessica (my ex and his girlfriend), she got pissed off at him during band and I was trying to calm her down, I've never stopped liking her and she's never stopped liking me, but family issues made us break up. We were sitting in the car after band and she put her head on my lap, so I let her stay there. I couldn't resist, and I ended up kissing her, and she didn't stop me. So we sat for a few hours talking to each other, and kissed multiple times. Her brother was in her car while we were in mine, and he said he wouldn't tell if she let him drive. She let him drive and stayed with me while I followed. Before we got to her house, her mom pulls up beside the car as we're stopping so they can switch, I get my ass chewed, she gets grounded, so I head back to the school because my friend is still there and needs a ride, on the way out I almost miss a turn and have to slam on the breaks, making the dirt kick up and look like a drift, so we go a little ways down the road and turn around because she left her phone, as I pull into the sschool parking lot, a cop is behind me and yells to stop, so my friend a her brother jump out of the car the other way from the cop, they never got caught, I had my ass chewed again because chews thought I drifted the turn. 

Worst night for me yet, the thing that worries me the most I how t explain it to lary, he's fragile, he's soft, I don't want to ruin their relationship and our friendship. 
Please help me...
