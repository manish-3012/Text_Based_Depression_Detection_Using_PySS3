The bad side of having good parents This is both a mix of my personal personality and my situation and I just need to let it go somewhere 

I have amazing loving parents but the problem is that because of my personality and their style of parenting I feel individualistically trapped desperately wanting to rebel and but having no casus belli. I feel like im playing off a script that is only a fraction of who i am.
