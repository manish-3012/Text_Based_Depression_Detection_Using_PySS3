My mom is so mean I had to do online tests a few weeks ago and we just got them back and i did badly in a few of them and failed one after months of home learning . So my mom took away my pc for a bit and when she gave it back she started turning off the internet so i cant use it and when i have to do online school she shuts off the internet at lunch and before and after school. She says she doesnt owe me anything and that i should earn internet by doing work that i need the internet to access
