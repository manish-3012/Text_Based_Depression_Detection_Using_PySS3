Why do y'all wanna be in a relationship so bad? I get it y'all don't wanna be lonely, but why a relationship so fast? Why do you even want a partner? You know you can spend time with your family instead of crying about not having a relationship, why don't you text your parents and make them happy or call them sometimes, why can't you ever just spent time with your relatives, why don't you make friends, why don't you ever have a talk with the waiters or cashiers at your local store or restaurant? Please explain! Go get a social life, do art, get a therapist, get a pet, go to parks, or just read books, or play a game! Stop asking for a relationship, it won't help you at all!
