Just ignore this, also I had to repost cause mods I donâ€™t know what to say but Iâ€™ll start with Iâ€™m sorry I started crying mama and Iâ€™m sorry that I messed up. First I accidentally dropped some glass, and then she got mad at me. She said she knows it was on accident and she wasnâ€™t mad but I could tell from the look in her eyes she was mad. Then she asked me to screw the gate back together and I didnâ€™t know how so I tried but I did it wrong and I got in trouble again. So I started crying because when people raise their voice at me even a little it makes me cry because I feel like Iâ€™m in trouble and then she said I wasnâ€™t allowed to go to Roseâ€™s house and that just made me mad and when Iâ€™m mad I lash out on myself and say to myself that if I was dead then nobody would ever need to waste time on me and then I get really sad and wish I was never born and wish that I could just go to sleep and never wake up. I feel like everybody hates me and I just donâ€™t know. All I want is to go to Roseâ€™s house. I donâ€™t care if mama takes away my phone or anything I just want to go to rosâ€™shouse Iâ€™ll do anything! But nobody ever listens to me and it makes me feel worthless like I donâ€™t matter . I just wanna go to roses house. Mama says that I threw a fit but I didnâ€™t Iâ€™m just sensitive. I hate it when people raise their voices and talk to me as if Iâ€™m just nothing important. It makes me cry and once I start crying I canâ€™t stop. And getting ready for inline school is also really frustrating because none of my passwords are working and I donâ€™t know what to do. I just want to apologize to mama for crying but she never listens to me
