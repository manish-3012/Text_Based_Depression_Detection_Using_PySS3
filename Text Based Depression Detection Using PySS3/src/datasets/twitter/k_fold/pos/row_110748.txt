I need help Ok so thereâ€™s this girl that Iâ€™ve known since 2nd grade and weâ€™ve been friends ever since but from 2 years ago we started to be closer, she would tell me everything I would do the same and we would be there for each other. Recently Iâ€™ve started to find her more attractive and Iâ€™ve been simping hard and I really want to tell her but Iâ€™m scared about our friendship being ruined and becoming awkward. Also I think that she is wayy out of my league so please tell me what I should do, thanks! Ya
