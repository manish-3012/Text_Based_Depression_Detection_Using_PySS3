I'm 17 and I still look like I'm 13. :( Don't have a deep voice, barely any facial hair. I'm still quite short. Of course I've hit puberty, but I'm not really growing the way everyone else around me is.

Tbh I've seen 13 year olds that look older than me. Adults still treat me like a kid cause I look like one. And I'm just pissed off generally at myself.

Posted this cause I just want to know that I'm not alone in this. Please tell me someone else has the same problem.
