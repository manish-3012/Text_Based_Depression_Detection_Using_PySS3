Enjoy the good moments while you can I was coming home from a band trip when school was cancelled due to the coronavirus. There was a band rehearsal the next day. I found out that day that the girl I liked blocked me on Snapchat. I was pissed, which carried on to the next day. This caused an argument and I was late to rehearsal that day. I didn't think too much of it, assuming that things would return to normal 2 weeks later.

Little did I know that this would be the last band rehearsal that I would ever have ever. School ended up being closed for the rest of the year and all classes were being moved online.

Enjoy the good moments while you can. Live every day as if you only have 24 hours to live. Because you never know when the things you take for granted might be taken away.
