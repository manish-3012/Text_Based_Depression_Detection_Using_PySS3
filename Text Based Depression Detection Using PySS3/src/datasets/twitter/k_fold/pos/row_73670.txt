18m looking for friends to talk to  

Hey, just a regular guy from the US. New jersey, to be precise. Usually not that lucky at gaining friends from this sub, but hey its always good to try again.

Some of the stuff im into is video games (pc), music (punk rock, the undertale ost, alternative, pop, etc), drawing, writing, playing the ukulele, and more

Itd be nice to find someone to vc with maybe, to game with, or just regular conversation. Texting is also fine, its what I do mostly anyways. Either works. Im not that great at vc, but I do try. Also looking for more guy friends, but any one is welcome to msg :)

If this is something that interests you, hit me up. Looking for people around my age. Iâ€™ll answer pretty quick too, so no worries about that part. Happy searching!

ps. not looking to join servers.
