A girl talked to me today Today at school I was in my english class and the girl that sits near me dropped her pencil. She asked if I could pick it up for her, as much as I wanted to I declined. I told her that she should get it herself because I am not allowed to touch her stuff because of covid restrictions. She gave me a funny look but I think she was just joking. Could she have dropped it on purpose to try and get me to like her? I think this is what happened. Should I ask her out?
