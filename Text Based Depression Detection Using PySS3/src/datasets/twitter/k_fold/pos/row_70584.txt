I need some help with a friendship/relationship issue. To give some context an old friend of mine who is also an ex of my best friend decided she wanted to come back and start talking with him again. I'm cool with it and me and her have gotten along really well so everything is good on my end, my friend however at first didn't know how to feel. When they ended things it wasn't very good and she also started dating someone she knew he didn't like. Now that she's back she seems to be really really into him but they don't have an emotional connection as far as I can tell. Normally I wouldn't say this because I'm on the outside of the relationship and some people like to keep it really private. The exception here is that both of them come to me to talk about it, from him it's how she says stuff that gets on his nerves and how dumb some of it is. From her it's how the things he says hurt her and how much she likes him. So basically she has a lot of feelings for him but can't connect with him emotionally because every time she tries to he shuts it down. I want to tell her how he really feels and stuff but I don't wanna be that guy. I'm tired of seeing her get hurt and lead on and I'm tired of seeing him treat her like shit, she's a great person and deserves so much better. How should I go about things? Where do I start if I want to tell her about all of it? Am I wrong to go behind my friends back and tell her about how he really feels?
