Existence is pain I have felt suicidal since Kindergarten for Americans here. Ive been on every anti depressant there is and been in useless counseling since I was 8. I have always been looking for ways to disappear and die so nobody finds me and gets trauma. I want to die because ive lost faith in humanity and in America. I want to die because im ignored so whats the difference. I hope I get covid so I can die without it making it look like I wanted to. I have no goals and no pleasure in anything anymore because ive been coerced or bullied out of it. I just want to be happy.
