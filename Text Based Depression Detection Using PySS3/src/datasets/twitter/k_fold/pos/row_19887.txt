How do I tell my crush I like her? (Iâ€™m a guy) Iâ€™ve known her for about 4 years and Iâ€™ve liked her for about 2 years. Iâ€™m really confident that she likes me back as sheâ€™s hinted this to me before. Weâ€™re enrolled at the same school together, but Iâ€™ve been taking fully online classes because of COVID-19, so I havenâ€™t seen her in person for over a year. Iâ€™ve had many opportunities to tell her how I feel but Iâ€™ve never had the confidence. I want to tell her soon because Iâ€™m worried that sheâ€™ll either lose interest, (if she ever liked me in the first place) or Iâ€™ll never get the chance to tell her again (example: she moves away) and end up regretting it for years to come. Telling her in person is out of the question for now, and we both have each otherâ€™s phone numbers, Iâ€™m fine if she doesnâ€™t even like me back, but I just want to get it off of my chest, and I donâ€™t know how to tell her.
