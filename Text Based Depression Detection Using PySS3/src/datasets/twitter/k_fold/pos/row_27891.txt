I lost. So my best friend got a gf that was something that Bo one expected but yeah good. But he changed, he was always silent and never gave you a chance after you f***ed something up one chance that all you get.
But after he got a gf he wasn't like that. From war machine to hipi and that's no good.
Tho we're 15 we like to play fight. We often go to woods and fight with sticks till someone starts to bleed that the other wins(cool game we like it). But after he got a gf he basically got so bad it's boring. We could exchange attack and block them for like 10-20 mins, but now he is just standing ther wanting to lose cos his gf is against this game. 
Today I lost my favourite game and my friend. I said to him that he changed, He doesn't believe. 

So now I'm just hanging out with him like this: 
Wanna fight 
No 
Why 
Cos 
Cos why 
Cos my gf doesn't approve 
And 
I like her 
So what do you want to do...
*20 mins in silence* 
Wanna grab something to dring and go to the *** (name of our favourite spot to sit and watch the city but it has the name in different language).
We go ther and that's it.
