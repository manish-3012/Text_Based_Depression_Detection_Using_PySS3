Opinion on people stealing/destroying trump signs? Iâ€™m no trump fan, shit Iâ€™m not even American but it disgusts me to see that people steal trump signs and then get a ton of support from it

If you have tik tok, [hereâ€™s](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSVHNkXb/) a video of two girls with a ton of trunk signs in their car because they stole them.

I mean I doubt they know anything about trump but theyâ€™ve been told to hate him by others. 

Anyway, the comments are giving a ton of support and itâ€™s sad to see

Conclusion: If someone has a different political belief to you, grow up and accept that
