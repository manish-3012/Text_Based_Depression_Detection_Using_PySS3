Gather around bitches opinion hour is upon us This sub is getting annoying again with stupid trends that nobody cares about, some yall shouldn't have access to the internet

This super straight bullshit is also worthy of eating crayons to. Because low and behold you can support trans people while not wanting to get a surprise dick. At the end of the day idrc what makes you happy so long as it doesnt hurt others, but some yall need to calm the fuck down. Just because you dont wanna get piped by a trans peep doesnt make you transphobic oddly enough. smh, we got enough issues in the world, but "not getting laid by trans peep makes you transphobic" yea, thats some real shit we need to take care of right away. 

aight opinion hour is over, stay safe and i hope you have a better day than me
