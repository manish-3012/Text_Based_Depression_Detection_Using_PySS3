Should I wait till she texts first this time? Me and this girl have good conversations and then at the end we say good night and most of the time she says â€œletâ€™s talk tomorrowâ€ then I start the conversation the next day. A couple days ago I ask how her day was she goes on a rant, I try to comfort her. We move onto another conversation but I can tell she wanted to be left alone for that night cause she said she was tired of everything. Itâ€™s been four days. Should I wait till she texts me or should i text her?
