I wanted to see a trans I always loved that cartoon. Bumblebee was my favorite, therefore yellow became my favorite color. My dad said yellow was gay, so I never talked about Bumblebee since. When I got the balls to say to him that I wanted to see a yellow trans, he laughed at me, and said "fine, I'll arrange a trip". He arranged a trip to Bangkok, Thailand, to meet a yellow trans. He just left me in a room with this woman, with a pair of scissors, and she had a protrusion on her front side. It was too late. That night, I lost my balls, figuratively and literally, as well as my dignity. My ass has been penetrated. After that, the lady said in a snarky way "That's why they call in Bangkok, and not Bangkunt". I was traumatized since then.
