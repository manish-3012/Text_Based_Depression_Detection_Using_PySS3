Fuck it, I can't keep it in anymore, ima vent Ok, so it start it off,  we should go a long way back 

2002, my father and mother got married, a love marriage?

#No

It was a forced due to Societal pressure 

Ok, moving on, at 2004,I was born

U should know that my father was diagnosed with schizophrenia in late 90s, after serious issues, my mum divorced him in 2006 and I went with my mum

So, in 2008, my mum married my stepfather, which was a "love marriage", or so she thought...

In 2011, she discovered the horrible truth, the reason he married or faked love is to use her gold to repay his debts, now that his purpose is finished, his attitude turned entirely..

At 2015, She was diagnosed with Brain Tumor, at the time, my dad was said to have celebrated this event, saying that "She would die and he could remarry"

So, the next year, At 2016, started my journey downhill, my mum took me to court cuz my biological dad filed for child custody, I had to spend the second Saturday of every month at the country from 2016-2019, which is basically me avoiding him

In 2017, during one of these days, I went wild, he was constantly pestering me to talk with him and he grabbed my wrist hard that I got this sudden urge of anger,  I pinned him to the ground screaming and bit his hands, I remember the taste of blood in my mouth and people tugging me away from him

The court ruled me to psychotherapy sessions, which was a total scam and the meds totally fucked my sleep cycles forever 

Also during 2017, one day at school, I felt a sudden pain in my lower abdomen, and was rushed to the hospital, where I was diagnosed with stage 1 Fatty Liver

From 2017, onwards my grades went downhill too, and in 2018, I was diagnosed with dyscalculia(maths dyslexia), which explained my struggle in arithematics

In 2018, I was sent to live with my grandparents, most of the time was used up in trying to keep my grades up 

In 2019, I was under constant pressure of studies 

In 2020, I don't know how, but I finally passed maths with 40%(33% being the minimum to pass)

So, then came the decision which stream to take, my weakness in maths meant that I could not go forward with my dream of pursuing Computer science, there was 3 subjects I was strong at, 

&gt;English 

&gt;Social Science 

&gt;Biology 

My mum told me to take biology, but I knew damn well that the supplementary Physics and Chemistry that is going to come along it is gonna be hard as fuck

So, I told her that I will take social science and then after 18  , I will privately pursue Computer Science 

But when the time came, I was pressurised and I had to take Bio-Homescience which is hard as fuck

Mum declared that she will ship me off to Iraq under labour Visa if I don't pass and calls me worthless...

Other than all this, there are a lot of internal family issues which is pushing me to the limit 

Whatever I study dont get retained, no matter what method I take

I feel like everything is futile ..

Everyday I wake up to my mum screaming at me, saying how useless I am and how she got me

Sorry for the grammatical errors
