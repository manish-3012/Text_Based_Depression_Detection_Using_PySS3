I rejected some because of a preference of mine and now some people are mad at me some of my guy friends are mad. so basically one of my guy friends asked me out. I definitely would of said yes but thereâ€™s a couple things that are stopping me(Iâ€™m not gonna name them all some are more personal things.) I kindly rejected him and then some of his guy friends which are also his friends were asking me why I rejected him when heâ€™s definitely a good match for me. I explained the personal ones and that I donâ€™t really want to date a guy shorter than me. Iâ€™m not trying to be mean to any shorter dudes if your shorter itâ€™s completely fine itâ€™s just a preference of mine. thatâ€™s not the main thing stopping me from dating him but itâ€™s a part of why I donâ€™t want too. but anyways all of his friends are saying he canâ€™t control his height. I get that you canâ€™t but they are completely ignoring the other things I explained and upset that I said that. idk what to do about this they are non stop texting me. please give me some advice
