My autistic (getting checked) sister has been mean to me My autistic 4 year old sister (i know age gap me 13 her being 4 sounds like im an ass hole but wait) she has been acting weirder than usual, pulling down my pants peeing in my room and saying she hates me and destroying the things i made for her. My mom thinks I am the one to blame since i am her remodel and she looks up to me because I oBvIoUsLy pee in other peoples rooms and destroy things people gave me. My mom has been mad at me because i instinctively slapped her when I got my pants pulled down. ^(thats all ik my mom follows this subreddit so i put this here bc i dont wana say this to her face but she needs to know how im feeling. i dont know why i included her mental illness but still.)
