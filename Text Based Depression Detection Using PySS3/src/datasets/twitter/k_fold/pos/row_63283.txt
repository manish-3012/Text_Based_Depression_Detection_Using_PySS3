Ughh why are social interactions so stressful and tiring I literally just had to make a simple phone call asking a few questions to this one place and boy did it stress me out. It literally took me like 15-20 minutes to summon the courage to call them. I even had to make a script for myself so I know what to say. And I know the place I called will forget about this interaction or just not care but it still stresses me out so much. And now that I finished the phone call I'm so tired and worn out even though I talked to that one place for like only 2 minutes.
