I need a plan I have 6 months to change my life. Iâ€™m 17 and Iâ€™m living alone. I need to graduate on time, I need to make enough money to live, and I need to become much buffer than I am now

And I donâ€™t know what to do.

If Iâ€™m not graduated on time I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to handle it. Mentally I wonâ€™t be able to handle not graduating. Iâ€™m already basically a loser, then Iâ€™ll be a loser whoâ€™s even more behind?

If Iâ€™m not much stronger by July 11th, then Iâ€™ve failed I wouldâ€™ve had to Kms. ( https://youtu.be/BTtZZszdffc )

Iâ€™m already working a job but I donâ€™t know how to leverage my time. I have so much riding on all of this and I need help.
