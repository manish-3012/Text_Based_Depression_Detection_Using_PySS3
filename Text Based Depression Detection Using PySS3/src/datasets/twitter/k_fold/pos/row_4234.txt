1 hour from now I have an exam and I haven't studied at all, I was a little worried about it, but now, I just don't care about it. I fixed a 1000 dollar item in an hour today, and am fulfilled for the rest of the day, nothing can get rid of my happiness for the rest of the day.

Oh and also fixed my friends pc that wasn't posting, but that's not important.
