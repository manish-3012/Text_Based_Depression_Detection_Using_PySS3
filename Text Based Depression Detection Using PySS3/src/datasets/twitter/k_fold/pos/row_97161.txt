I still haven't gotten my drivers license yet I just turned 17 a week ago. I haven't gotten my learners permit yet, and so I haven't been able to attain my drivers license. I need to get it soon, because next year I will be 18. I can't start off 18, going to college, without a drivers license. I just really don't want to drive. I am terrified, and worried that I would do something stupid because of my anxiety. You can't just freeze up behind a steering wheel. 

Also, I haven't really been motivated to get one. I don't really have much use for it currently. I don't have a job as of now.  I don't go out. Even before the pandemic, I went to school, came home, and did a lot of homework, and then watched tv and went to bed. If I want to go to the mall(which is like once or twice a year), I just go with my mother because she typically also wants to buy some clothes. 

Any other 17 year old's without a drivers license?
