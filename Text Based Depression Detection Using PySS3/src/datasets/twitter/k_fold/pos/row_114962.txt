I need to rant so yeah So about a week ago I made a post here asking whether or not I was the asshole over a friend reposting memes, and then he called me an idiot and blocked me. So fast forward to today I ask him why he blocked me and he says because I was being "tOxIc" when HE HIMSELF IS BEING TOXIC RIGHT NOW AS A DIFFERENT FRIEND OF MINE IS ARGUING WITH HIM ABOUT THIS. HE'S CLAIMING THAT THE FRIEND IS "HARASSING" HIM WHEN HE HIMSELF IS HARASSING A FRIEND OF MINE. SO I CONFRONT HIM ABOUT IT AND HE BLOCKS ME AGAIN. THIS IS THE FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF MY ALREADY-NEARLY-DESTROYED MENTAL HEALTH. THANKS A LOT u/supergiraffe475, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN FUCKING HELL!
