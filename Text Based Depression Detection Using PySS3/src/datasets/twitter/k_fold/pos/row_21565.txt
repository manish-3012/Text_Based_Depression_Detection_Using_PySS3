HEY YOU! Some people are saying this sub is boring or falling apart. I've heard my fellow teens say they are leaving or no longer enjoy sorting by new because it is not fun and it is boring. 

Well if you are feeling bored, then come on down and have a chat with me! I've posted lots and always live the responses I get in the DMs, and comments are also fun :)

I'm an 18m Canadian university student. I'm athletic, "smart", nerdy, extroverted sometimes, introverted other times, I'm a Slav, and I'm pretty good at conversations. Hit me up to talk about the NFL or The Lord of the Rings or anything in between!
