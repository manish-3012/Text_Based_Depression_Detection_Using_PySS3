Please be in as many family pictures as you can. Upon entering middle school, I stopped voluntarily participating in family photos because 1. I hated how I looked 2. I was one of the most well known kids in school and I didnâ€™t want them seeing something embarrassing 3. My relatives will comment on how Iâ€™ve â€œgrownâ€ (their nice way of calling me fat)

I am now 17, turning 18 in a little less than 6 months. Knowing that I will be out of the house soon, it just hit me that I will not be able to see my family as often. I donâ€™t want to grow up and look back at my teenage years and see only 3 family photos Iâ€™m in.
