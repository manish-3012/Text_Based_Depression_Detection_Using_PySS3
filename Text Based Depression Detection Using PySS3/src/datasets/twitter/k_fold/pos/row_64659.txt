The story of how I found out Iâ€™m asexual Hey everyone! If you didnâ€™t know from the title, this is the story of how i found out that Iâ€™m asexual.

If you donâ€™t know, Asexuality is when youâ€™re attracted to nobody. Not men, not women, no-one.

It all started in year 9. In my maths class, there are these three kids, who Iâ€™m gonna call Donkey, Diddy and Bluster. Names aside, these kids bullied me for EVERYTHING. They bullied me for playing Minecraft, watching Sonic Boom, they even bullied me for openly admitting that I use Reddit. These kids had it out for me.

Out of all of them, Donkey was easily the most offensive. He hated me more than anyone else. I would get insulted by my friend group, but hey, itâ€™s Britain. Thats what friends do to each other. Anyway, Donkey was offensive. He was openly homophobic in front of me, calling me gay a lot. At the time, I thought I was straight, but over time, I slowly began finding myself during this period. I realised that I found no-one attractive at all.

Later, Donkey called me gay again. Thatâ€™s when I dropped the bombshell. I donâ€™t remember exactly what I said, but it must have been along the lines of â€œActually, I donâ€™t find anyone attractive. So in turn, Iâ€™m not gay.â€

After this, people kept telling me that Iâ€™m asexual. I looked it up, and they were right! Iâ€™m asexual!
