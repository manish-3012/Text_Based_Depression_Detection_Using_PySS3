The Antartican Scorpio Karanami First discovered in: a lab facility called La12 filled with Scientists located in Antartica during 2030

Description) 

A species of scorpions though this is due to confusion if itâ€™s a scorpion

It primarily hunts humanoid prey, it is believed this is so they can use it as bait as shown by their iq results [SEE IN EXPO-1] though it is yet to be confirmed if it was just luck, they also hunt other animals but only if their necks are big enough

They have the ability to climb on walls and ceilings like lizards though they canâ€™t climb on rough terrain

Their tail seems to instead of having a stinger, have a C-shaped claw similar to that of a crabâ€™s pincers though more curved (which weâ€™ll claw a â€˜Curvalawâ€™ this is due itâ€™s tail having one of the most complicated muscles, able to lift 20 tons, making it useful for getting onto paces but even more useful for huge

The Curvalaw is specifically designed to choke necks as it stand stills on the ceiling and let itâ€™s tail down towards the ground which is known as â€œStelicideâ€ or hunting

When performing Stelicide, itâ€™ll attempt to move itâ€™s Curvalaw so it can be around the prey similar to a rope, itâ€™ll than lift itâ€™s tail upwards while tightening the clawâ€™s grip force to choke the victim

for combat however, itâ€™ll attempt to grab the victimâ€™s legs and tighten before launching itself by suddenly thrusting itâ€™s long tail towards the victim and attaching itâ€™s piercing legs and attempt to break itâ€™s ribs or heart out

Although it may seem dangerous, it only lingers in dark places such as abandon buildings, caves, and forests at night AND it is unable to kill a victim who is moving a lot, infact

Having phobias of it can help you by making you prone to run away from scorpions
