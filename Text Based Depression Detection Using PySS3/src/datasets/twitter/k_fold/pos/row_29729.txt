School inappropriate talk Iâ€™m so scared for school tomorrow, I hope this is the right place to type this here. To be honest I donâ€™t know where else too. Okay so yesterday at school a teacher yanked a students hood from their hoodie to pick up the students head from the table. Then the student picked up their head and said you didnâ€™t have to yanked it hard l. Then the teacher said something after very inappropriate â€œI just you like it soft.â€ He said it  twice and everyone in that class heard him. The they student said that g@y. I so grossed out because of him, I donâ€™t care you should be â€œjokingâ€ like that. I emailed the principal everything but I didnâ€™t know the other student name and she said she needed more information. Now Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to get in trouble when I get to school later because I have a feeling the teacher going to turn it back to me saying something of â€œ I was joking, or you made it sound like that.â€ Think about this cause my anxiety to go up high. I have like 5 hours till I have to go to school. Was I wrong for telling the principal.
