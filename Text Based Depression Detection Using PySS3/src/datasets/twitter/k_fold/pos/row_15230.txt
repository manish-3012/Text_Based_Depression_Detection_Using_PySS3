oh shit oh no dysphoria please don't do this I used to be like "well I'll just be chill with a social transition and having short hair, wearing binders, etc"

then dysphoria comes to me in the middle of the night like "ok bitch now you're going to cry because of how much you want top surgery" and "haha you DO desperately want to go on T, don't kid yourself"

n o   fuck those are so expensive and will be a whole THING, dysphoria have mercy ;_;

i am but a sad little trans child
