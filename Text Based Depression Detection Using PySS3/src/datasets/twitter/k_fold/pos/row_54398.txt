Mixed signals suck I have been getting mixed signals from the guy I like for about a year now.

1) we rly do be vibin when we spend time together

2) Iâ€™m initiating conversation 95% of the time (fucker leaves me on seen)

3) I told him I liked him and I still wanted to be friends and he told me that â€œsure we can still be friendsâ€

4) heâ€™s timing up schedule to match mine (I told him what time I get to school at normally and now heâ€™s coming in at the same time as me)

5) coincidentally (?) running into him. Idfk if Iâ€™m reading too much into this one but I swear i keep on running into him at the random-est moments


IM SO CONFUSED AAAA
