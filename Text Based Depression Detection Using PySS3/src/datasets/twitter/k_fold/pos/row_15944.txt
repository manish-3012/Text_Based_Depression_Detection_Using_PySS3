Short story We learnt photoshop in our school in grade 5. Nobody in our class was interested, except for me. I continued to learn it and got better at it.

Last year, in grade 9, we had a competition regarding photoshop. The whole class turned to me, so I just took part without thinking too much.

Me and my partner practiced different things and new tools, and were ready for the competition.

When we reached the school where the competition was to be held, we were told the topic, which was to make a website cover.

They provided us with some pics to use. To our surprise, there were some meme formats in there, such as the 'me and the boys' one.

We. Actually. Made. A. Meme. Making. Website. Cover.
 
We had to explain to the judge what memes are. She was more than 50 years old. 

We came in second :)
