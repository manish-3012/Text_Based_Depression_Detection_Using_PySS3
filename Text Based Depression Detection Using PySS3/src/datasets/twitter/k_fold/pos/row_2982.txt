Students: "tHe EdUcAtIoN sYsTeM nEeDs ReFoRmInG" ok, tell me a detailed plan on how we would "reform it"  I see tons of students saying to reform the education system but never the how. and yes, I saw the recent post in hot about teachers being hypocrites and I agree but I believe if you want something, make a plan. Don't say I want something then do nothing to achieve it, even if you think you are insignificant, I want at least a plan on HOW we could reform it. I don't think the education system is good but since I personally can't think of a good way to reform it, I'm ok with it.

If reddit isn't busy I want a plan on ***HOW*** we can reform the education system.
