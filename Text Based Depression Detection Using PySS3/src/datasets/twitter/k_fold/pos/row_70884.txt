Title that wont get me automodded So i want to come out as bisexual to my parents, and i think they might not support me and i have a crush on a one of my best friends(female) but in one of our late night convos she told me not to catch feels and ive kinda stopped liking her a bit, and i really have a crush on a guy that joined my boy scout troop a little while ago and idk if he is straight or not. Anyone have any advice, im scared to come out to my parents and nervous about asking for the guys number. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
