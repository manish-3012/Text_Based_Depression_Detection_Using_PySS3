Next year in school. Next year in school Iâ€™m not going to be in any of the same high school classes with my crush, I was in the same home room with her this year. And now Iâ€™m scared and terrified. Me and her talk over text almost everyday I feel like things could be going well. But Iâ€™m scared and terrified. I feel like next year since we arenâ€™t in any of the same classes, Iâ€™m not going to have a chance with her. Am I over thinking this whole thing? Will it be fine? What can I do to stop being so damaging on myself? And is it still possible to get with her while not being in the same class?? This has been hurting me inside for awhile and I canâ€™t get the thought out of my head.
