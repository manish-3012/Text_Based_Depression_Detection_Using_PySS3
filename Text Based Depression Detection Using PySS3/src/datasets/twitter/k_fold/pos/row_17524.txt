I won today at making the right decisions but jeez man So yeah Im an idiot that joined the navy as a Hospital Corpsman, ( like a nurse but not paid as well ). I joined mostly because I could barely pass highschool due to adhd and the structure of military really helps. so life is definitely stressful on my ship especially with the pandemic.

But today managed to call a therapist and I have 12 free sessions and it took me so long to convince myself to do it. Hell toss gotta fight that repressed emotional baggage

But what wasn't so fun today was that I asked this group of guys to stop staring at me and they got butthurt and wanted to fight so I walked away. Later tonight 2 of them followed me into the bathroom and started screaming at me trying to fight me again. So I zipped it up, washed my hands and tried to reason with him but he kept telling over me so I just left again.

I'm happy I made the right decision to just walk away but I feel like I shouldn't be threatened by someone higher ranked with violence. I'm going to let them cool off and if they want to fight then they can just get reported and kicked out of the navy or at least get into deep shit.
