Anyone that lived in New York or like any east coast states most of their life please enlighten me. Alright so I plan on studying in American in the future. (I'm from Asia btw.) Can someone give me an insight of what it's like living there. I've only lived there when I was like toddler. All I can remember is snow and rolling up pill bugs in my backyard. Like is the party scene crazy? R most ppl very extroverted from what I heard. What do I need to be aware of while I stay there.
