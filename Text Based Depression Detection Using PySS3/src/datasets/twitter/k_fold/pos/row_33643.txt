My mom got the vaccine. She works at a nursing home so she had to get it but she said everyone at her job who took the vaccine is kinda feeling funny right now. Like their body is just hurting (mainly the arms and neck). 

My mom job wants them to all get a second dose of the vaccine but my mom is gonna say no this time because her co worker that took the second dose got so sick that she had to take 4 days off of work.

My mom said her neck and arm is kinda hurting soooo yea.
