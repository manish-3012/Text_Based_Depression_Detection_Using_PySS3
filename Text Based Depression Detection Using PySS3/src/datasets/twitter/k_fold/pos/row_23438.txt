High Expectations (poem by me)  

***High Expectations***

When Little Timmy got a B

he showed it off with pride

and gave it to his friends to see

to show how hard he tried

&amp;#x200B;

And all his friends gave him congrats

for getting a good score

They threw a toast, with pats on backs

and brought him to the store

&amp;#x200B;

"Three cheers for Tim" his friends did say

but much to his surprise

his parents wanted him an A

and Timmy fucking died
