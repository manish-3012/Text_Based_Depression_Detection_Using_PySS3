Favourite rap verse: Day 1 
Jesus lord, relieve me more of stress

I need some more revenge

Distort your neck and forge a stretch like prehistoric Rex

Don't ask me to be your guest feature
More or less, 

your new song a foreplay like a tease before the sex

You need some more success

I'm still a teen of course

I need endorsement checks Tech?

I heard you made the Forbes

I need you for some bread and I don't treat my girls like queens

I treat them more like kings in chess

I keep the horse in check

I feel like Jesus when you leave me bored to death
