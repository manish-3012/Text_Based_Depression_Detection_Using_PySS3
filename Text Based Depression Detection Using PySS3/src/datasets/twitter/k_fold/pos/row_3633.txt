being trans is just looking back and going 'oh shit, that was dysphoria?' anyways I want to rant about cheerleading as a young "girl" Bruh. So I did cheerleading as a kid. I liked doing some gymnastics and routines, they were fun enough. I, like 7-10 years old (I did it for 3 years), still felt really uncomfortable in the leotards (the uniforms for practice, as revealing as like one piece swimsuits). They were also hot pink. :/ mehh

And when we did competitions at the end of each if the years, on the last one when I was 10 it was mandatory that we wore makeup???? as part of the uniform???? and??? had hairspray and a pink bow??? Straight up after it I remember crying in the bathroom and washing my face off because I hated how that had made me feel

At the time I didn't know why I hated it so much, but now I recognize that was some very fucking crippling dysphoria. Anyways at least I didn't do it again after that because I just felt worse about the forced feminity everywhere each year. so I just, quit
