iâ€™m not anti-mask or anything but lemme say this my schoolâ€™s policies right now are kinda wack. For example were at lunch and eating and were like 10 feet apart (understandable) and to eat yâ€™know you have to have your mask off. well i was eating a bit and on my phone and a teacher came up to me and said â€œget upâ€ i was kinda confused but i got up and she moved me like across the yard from everyone. like, i was eating and i got moved because i had my mask below my mouth. i guess the teacher didnâ€™t see my food so i said iâ€™m eating but she said â€œwell oh wellâ€ and moved me anyway. kinda garbage.
