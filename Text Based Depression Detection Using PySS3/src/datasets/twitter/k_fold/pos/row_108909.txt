I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE I was in the middle of class and I was thinking about the homemade vanilla that my moms work friend gifted me

For context I had to stir it like once every month for half a year or so

So then I was like, â€œwhy does vanilla even exist? Who decided to do that long process?â€

I SO LOOKED UP HOW VANILLA EXTRACT CAME TO BE

OH I REGRET IT

so to calm myself down I looked up how to make home made vanilla extract and it made me feel better for a second .... until I realized what the second ingredient is.....

When i get home Iâ€™m going to ask my mom for details and hope I can still eat vanilla the same way

JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS POST IS WARNING YOU TO -NOT- LOOK IT UP

PLEASE DO NOT
