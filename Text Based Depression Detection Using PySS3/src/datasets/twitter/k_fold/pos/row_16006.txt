Anybody elseâ€™s teachers very biased when they teach? My sociology teacher is balls to the walls feminist

She still claims the wage gap exists (even though it doesnâ€™t factor in anything and especially with sports, the highest earners will get paid more, itâ€™s why the highest paid female model gets paid 15x more than the highest paid male model

She ignores shit like that and I canâ€™t believe it but on one slide she complains about how women do too much housework (Even though 41% of women part time compared to only 12% of men) and on the next slide she complains about how women are working too much at jobs

Shit doesnâ€™t make sense as she tries so hard to say women in first world countries are unbelievably oppressed

I mean sheâ€™s allowed to have that view but the work she gives and tells us is very biased for no reason
