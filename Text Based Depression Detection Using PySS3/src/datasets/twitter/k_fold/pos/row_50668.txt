sometimes i want to run away with my friends and go to a big cottage core house in the woods and in a field and have picnics and journal. we could have a couple cats and maybe thereâ€™s a lake nearby. we could put up a swing and watch the sunsets. 
in a perfect world there would be a big dusty library with old books and big armchairs. during the holiday season we would stay inside by the fire and be cozy. 

the town would be a little bit away, maybe a 10 minute drive, it could have a cute little ice cream  shop. 

anyways anyone wanna come?
