I have a question it relates to video games So what do you guys think of an automatically adapting difficulty. It takes your performance and makes small changes to the game to make it easier or harder depending on how well you do. This would be good because most of the time you don't know what each difficulty level is like if you haven't played the game before and most people won't fit into those difficulty levels perfectly so this would help keep all players in the flow state which would make the overall experience more enjoyable. Of course you would be able to turn it off in the options menu probably.

This isn't a new idea but I want to hear other opinions on it because some people hate it and others (like myself) think it's stood idea
