What if It was all a dream, my life isnâ€™t a mess, iâ€™m not depressed and alone, i didnâ€™t spend 7 years bullied every day at school, my brother isnâ€™t that stupid and and my parents didnâ€™t divorced when i was 5. I could be here, happy, in my room, playing with my lego on a cool summer day with my best friend.
