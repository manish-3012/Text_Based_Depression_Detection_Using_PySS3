Hereâ€™s some of my mediocre poetry â€Just smashed 
a photograph
with a hammer

A giant hole in
a perfect picture
of a group
Group of mannequins
Yeah
A really big one

I walk away

Shattered glass
cutting my feet 
openâ€

I wrote this yesterday after some questionable thoughts came to me. Well, depends on what view you look at it from.
