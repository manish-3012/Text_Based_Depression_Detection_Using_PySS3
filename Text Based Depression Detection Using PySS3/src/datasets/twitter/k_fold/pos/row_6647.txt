Does anyone else absolutely hate this situation? By that I mean getting scolded by your parent(s) and remaining calm trying to explain everything but after some time finally getting annoyed by the situation for that exact second to turn so they're calm out of nowhere trying to act like nothing at all happened and then they getting even more angry just after that because you're annoyed and don't get instantly happy like they did a second ago
