Bought a product it didn't work and and got refused a refund So basicaly i bought something in the shop the other day and when i went home that night it didnt work. I went back to the shop the next day and asked for a refund but the cashier just laughed at me and went to get his manager. When the manager arived and saw i was serious i was told to leave. What the fuck. Theres ignorant and then theres that. Thats the last time i ever but a lottery ticket again
