I wanna learn how to box/defend my self in general, but I dunno how to start. I highly doubt my mom would let me take a class, nor would I have the time for it, but I just wanna learn at least how to block, take/give hits, and proper form because knowing how to defend yourself is something everyone should know. 

This is prolly far-fetched, but is there any game on the Oculus quest 2? I wonâ€™t be able to see until Christmas, but it seems plausible. 

Does anyone know how I can learn on my own?
