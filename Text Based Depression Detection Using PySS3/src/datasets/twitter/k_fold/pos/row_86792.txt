Unpopular opinion: â€œDifferent Gendersâ€ are getting out of hand Ok, you are a male that is attracted to other males. Great! Youâ€™re a female attracted to other females. Fine. 

But then we have the people who say they are attracted to dogs, lamp posts, pans, and even underage people!

This needs to stop. Inventing different genders does not make it okay for you to be attracted to a child when you are a grown man (in other words, a pedophile). 

And we donâ€™t need 10,000 different genders. Why would you need to make a gender to say that you are only attracted to this age or this race or this skin colour when thatâ€™s just called your preference? Because all you want is attention and gender is not an excuse for it.

Tl;dr - we donâ€™t need 10,000 genders. Often, they can be named as â€œyour preferenceâ€ and are excuses for attention or â€œillegalâ€ acts.
