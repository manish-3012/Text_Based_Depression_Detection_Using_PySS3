Iâ€™m so depressed and this is why Iâ€™m depressed because Iâ€™ve just been thinking about all those times people have called me things like â€œthe special kidâ€ and Itâ€™s just making me realize how much I need a girlfriend because if I have one Iâ€™ll actually have somebody to support me for once
