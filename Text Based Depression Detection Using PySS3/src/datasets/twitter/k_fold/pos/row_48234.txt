The friday and this week have been the worst thing happening to my life. My GF broke up with me *it's from last post, still founded it weird she wanted to get back together. But i didn't care* i have stomach ache, my bones are heavy and i feel like i can't move. I am depressed and my parents became super religious and i am sad. I couldn't focus on my math test to let us know what the test is. My best friend now don't know what to do when we meet up cuz i was too focused on my GF. I hope my future won't be this shitty like these last 7 days.
