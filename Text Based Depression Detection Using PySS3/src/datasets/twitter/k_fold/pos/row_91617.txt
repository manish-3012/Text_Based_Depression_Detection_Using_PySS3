this is a rant because I need to rant Some of my old friends are trying to contact me, but they often stood me up and stuff so I stopped talking to them awhile ago. But now they are coming back. I tried talking to some of them but idk itâ€™s just mentally exhausting ig.
Iâ€™ve only been talking to like 2 ppl for the past year and now 4 extra people are talking to me and itâ€™s stressing me out.
I recently redownloaded insta and it rly messes with my mental health. My friend said I should post more there for my art, and I took her advice. But Iâ€™m just so stressed about people liking me and stuff. Itâ€™s dhjsjdjdkkd
My siblings are in town and they keep on telling me how much Iâ€™m fucking up. They arenâ€™t here in my good moments. 
Also I payed someone for some edibles and they didnâ€™t even give me what I wanted. I spent 50 dollars (didnâ€™t even get to look at a receipt- NOT accurate at all pricing wise) and itâ€™s just pissing me off.
Iâ€™m in a shit mood rn.
