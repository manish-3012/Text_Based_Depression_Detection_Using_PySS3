I really wish stories had more warnings So Iâ€™m reading a fairly interesting piece of fiction. Itâ€™s about Dragon people and other creatures along with humans. Now Iâ€™m a sucker for romance. So of course itâ€™s about a dragon and a human.

Well itâ€™s all sweet and dandy. And I had skipped past this one scene where it got a bit uh... steamy? I donâ€™t really mind explicit stuff just not really into it. But then it starts to get into their adopted kidâ€™s life. I think itâ€™s all so cute

Well itâ€™s talking about the kid and all that. The â€œkidâ€ grows up really fast something about his species. AND THEN IT STARTS GETTING STEAMY WITH THE KID AND ONE OF THE PARENTS AND IM LIKE WTFFFFFF

AND ITS LIKE â€œINCEST IS NORMAL FOR DRAGON PEOPLEâ€. IT WAS SO CUTE AND FLUFFY UP UNTIL THIS POINT AND IVE READ AROUND 50,000 WORDS ONLY TO HAVE TO READ ABOUT FRICKING DRAGON PEOPLE INCEST

Never will I ever open my mind to reading about furries again
