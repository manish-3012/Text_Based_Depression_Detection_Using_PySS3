Iâ€™m an unvaccinated kid. My mom isnâ€™t a typical anti vaxxer, Iâ€™m guessing she just never got around to getting me vaccinated, but I was born in 05, and I think she told me thatâ€™s when the vaccines give your kids autism thing started up and I think she got scared. Itâ€™s not a long story, I just thought it would be semi interesting to some people.
