While it is true that big cities have their benefits, small towns tend to have better and/or more benefits  that outweigh that of big cities.  Two good examples are that in small towns, there is less air pollution and more open space.  There is an old saying about small towns: "the nice thing about living in a small town is that if you don't know what you're doing, someone else does."

Historically, larger cities have been becoming more and more dangerous to live in due to air pollution.  A great example of this is Los Angeles, California and Gruene, Texas.  Los Angeles has a major air pollution issue due to industry and careless dumping.  Meanwhile, Gruene has little to no air pollution because there's no industry.  Throughout history, cities have been becoming more cramped because of rapid population increase, meaning everyone is in an apartment.  Meanwhile, in small towns, there is more space because the population is at a constant.  Others might say crime is easier to get away with in small towns that large cities.  A good refutation to this is that everyone knows everyone's secrets, making crime harder to get away with.

In closing, living in a small town is easier than living in a big city because of less air pollution and there is more space for homes.  It is highly suggested that people go and experience small town life.
