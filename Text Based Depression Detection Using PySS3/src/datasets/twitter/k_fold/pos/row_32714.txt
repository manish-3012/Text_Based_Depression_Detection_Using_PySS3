I want to buy a gun A year ago if you asked me about that, Iâ€™d think itâ€™s crazy. But these days, and now that Iâ€™m 18, it actually seems like a decent idea. Not some AR bullshit, not some Acog scope COD type Advanced Warshit. A handgun, locked in a safe, just in case. Probably a revolver, cause theyâ€™re simple to operate in a stressful situation. These days, with those George Floyd riots, and all the crazy shit, itâ€™d be good to have something to protect myself just in case shit hit the fan. And Iâ€™m cheap, but itâ€™s only like $450 for a good one anyway

Iâ€™d wait til I move out, and probably not tell my family
