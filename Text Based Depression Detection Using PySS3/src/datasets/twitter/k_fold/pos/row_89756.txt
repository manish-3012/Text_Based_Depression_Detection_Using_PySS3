I don't know I don't know I don't know anymore Thought I had, thought I had it under control
Hear my voice, there it goes, hear it louder than most
Here it goes, hear it, 1, 2, 3, 4

It's not worth it, it's not working
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over
You don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if you have to
Get control (take it out on me)
So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if you have to
Get control

You try to move, try to move, try but you don't wanna lose
So afraid, so afraid, you don't want it to fade
Hear my voice, here it goes, hear it louder than most
Let it go, let it 1, 2, 3, 4

It's not worth it, it's not working
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over
You don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if you have to
Get control (take it out on me)
So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if you have to
Get control

1, 2, 3, 4
It's not worth it, it's not working
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over
You don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if you have to
Get control (take it out on me)
Scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if you have to
Get control
