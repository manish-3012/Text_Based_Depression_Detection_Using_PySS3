My P.E. Teachers made us dance tiktoks dances Ok so firstly I wana say that this P.E. teacher is one of does cool teachers that is firstly, fit, and secondly understands that we humans can get tired. I think that he thought that we will have liked to do this activity, because well, another class had actually enjoyed it. The video was one of does videos that aded squat and jumping jacks to the already cringy dances. So it ended up that have the class was happily dancing this dances with the camera open, while the other half was doing aboutstly nothing, more than cringing. Most people would have prefer to do push-ups and REAL exercise, but whatever, we all knew the teacher had good intentions.

Sorry about the spelling, English ain't my native language.
