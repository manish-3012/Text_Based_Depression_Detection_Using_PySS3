I fucking hate my team So today we had house football(soccer), and I wanted to be moved up from the D team(the useless morons who cant be asked) to the C team (second from worst), I was trying to get loved all week and in the end it didnâ€™t happen. So we had three games, lost 5-0, 6-0 and 3-1 and me and my friend (u/skinny_pale_nonce) were the only ones who played decently. Nobody tried, we defended like utter shit unless I had dropped back and there was no attacking until our last game (where the goal came from me sprinting half of the pitch, getting the ball in the middle and leaving u/skinny_pale_nonce with an easy chance. Literally I just spent the entire time sprinting back and forth, watching our team be shit, and I really like football so Iâ€™m beyond pissed. The best bit is our C team didnâ€™t do well because none of the attackers were getting forward, which I was doing all the fucking time.
