I literally have a bruise in the middle of my foot A little bit ago I stepped on a belt buckle and one part was sticking out and it hurt a ton but I didn't think much of it. Then just now I happened to glance at the bottom of my foot and the middle of it was green and I was like wtf?? And I pressed it and it hurt. Luckily it wasn't on the parts of your foot that you put the most pressure on when you walk, so I can walk just fine
