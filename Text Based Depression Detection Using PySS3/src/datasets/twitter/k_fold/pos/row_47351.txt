Stop scrolling, and help a fellow teen out! There's this girl I've liked for nearly 7 years, and I wanted to tell her how I feel. One problem: She's my best friend. I'm not too worried about actually dating her, because it's unlikely that she'd want to, but I at least want her to know how I feel. I trust her, and I want her to be able to trust me. How should I tell her?
