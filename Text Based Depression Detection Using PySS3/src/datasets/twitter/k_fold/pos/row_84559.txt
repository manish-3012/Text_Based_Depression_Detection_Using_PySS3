What kind of reading do you have at your school? TLDR: Do you have forced reading at your school? How long do you get for a single book? Is there types of books you can't read? Do you have to do advanced analysis of characters, plot, literary devices, etc? How much do you enjoy reading? 


So at my school (in the Netherlands) our Dutch teachers are always going off about the literacy level dropping compared to other European countries. The obvious cause behind this seems that we are at the very bottom of the list comparing reading enjoyment across European countries so I'm wondering why that could be.

At my school if you want to have time for your hobbies and homework, you'll pretty much only have time for the books you have to read for school so that's why I'm only taking those into consideration.

I got to thinking why I myself don't enjoy the reading we do for class and narrowed it down to a few things. We can only choose from a list of books that were originally written in Dutch and have a certain reading level and they always have to stand out from the other books you've read. That pretty much already means I don't give a crap about the book and I'm just picking it for an arbitrary requirement.

Secondly I'm always put off from reading it at all because the time we get to read it is so short and I'd rather just look up an online summary and get the same amount of information.

And then lastly, we always get assigned to look for literary devices or certain character properties and it turns into more of a search for that certain thing than a genuine reading of the book.

So I want to compare other people's experiences with mine and see if I can draw any conclusions from that.
