Global Covid Discord? (GCD) I was thinking of making a global public discord server for people (teens probably) all over the world facing problems with Covid. Iâ€™m probably not the first one to think of this either.

I want it to become a place where people from all over the world come to talk to others, maybe play some games, etc. Iâ€™m talking on a wide scale.

I would have different sections for different languages; English, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, etc. The main language would probably be English because itâ€™s widely used and I only speak it (lmao).

If anyone wants to help with this, let me know.
