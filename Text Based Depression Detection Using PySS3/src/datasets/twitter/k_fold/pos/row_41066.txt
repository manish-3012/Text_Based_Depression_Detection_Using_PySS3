How do I stop overthinking Whenever I think about trying to be more social and talk to more people, I think of a lot of stuff. A big thing is that people just don't like me and don't want to talk to me so I find it hard to try to talk to other people myself. People didn't talk to me much and I didn't talk to a lot of people either, so it's hard to justify any reason why I should even try since nobody likes me anyways. 

Another thing is just how weird it is to talk to someone I don't know for no reason other than to try to make some friends. The more I think about it the weirder the idea gets and the worse I feel the outcome would be. This ties into the first thing a good bit as well.

And girls. I don't fucking understand how to talk to them without accidentally flirting or anything. If I tried to flirt with a girl I'd probably end up with a restraining order (not literally, but she probably wouldn't take it as a compliment coming from me), or even if I didn't try to flirt but did something that could be interpreted as such. I already have enough social anxiety and I don't need it to be worse for girls.

I'm also 18 and feel like the biggest fucking loser because I still don't know how to do all this shit. Like for fucks sake I'm too old to not know how to talk to girls or anything, so it feels too late to even try to fix anything. 

But if I were to try anyways, how? Anytime I'm in a social situation with people I don't know all I can think about is how as soon as I start making an effort to talk to people that it'll all turn against me and everyone will hate me. I don't know what to do but I can't just be alone for the rest of my life
