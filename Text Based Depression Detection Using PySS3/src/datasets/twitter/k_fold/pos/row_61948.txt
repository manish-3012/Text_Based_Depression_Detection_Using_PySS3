Leonardo DiCaprio gets too much shit for dating girls in their 20s but Drake doesn't get enough shit for his questionable relationship with Millie Bobby Brown I tried to post this on r/unpopularopinion but apparently hating on Drake is not an unpopular opinion. I didn't know where to post this. Please at least hear me out


Leonardo DiCaprio is extremely rich and he's also incredibly good looking. There are plenty of women who'd date him. 

The youngest girl he's dated has been 18, that was when he was 24. 6 years?? What's so weird in that? That's a pretty normal difference

If I was 46 years old, had billions of dollars, incredibly good looks, and on top of that had millions of people of all ages who want to date me I'd also probably pick girls in their 20s

Being an adult means you're supposed to make your own decisions
All these girls made their decision to date a guy who could afford anything he wants
So what's the issue? 

If he'd been grooming all these girl from a young age then obviously it makes sense to get justice 


Drake on the other hand

There's a difference of 17 years between them

Millie Bobby Brown is fucking 15
Drake is 32

If Millie Bobby Brown had been 30 and Drake 47 then that wouldn't be weird

She's in her teenage years. Teenagers have no idea what's good for them and what's not
Adults are supposed to show them the right path 

We're told in schools that we should talk to a trusted adult if we ever need help 


I'm currently 14 and if a 30 year old ever tries to text me such casually I'd fucking run to my parents crying

On the other hand if I'm 24 and really good looking female with enough money to buy a planet wants to date me (which now that I think about it is a lot like the relationship between Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra) I wouldn't decline 


Ok I'm done ranting

I'm gonna get hate
I don't care
I just want discussion
