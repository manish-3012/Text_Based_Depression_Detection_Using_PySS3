So I'm getting hit on by an upperclassmen basically, there's this upperclassmen who's getting real touchy touchy with me and facetiming me at random times. She even wanted to chat about stuff tonight out of the blue. I personally have a bottom line for relationships, which is to never date anyone older than me, so naturally it would be a no from me. She didn't ask me out yet, but this is a prickly situation I never thought I would have. Ol' Ye' Wise teenagers of reddit, what's your wisom.
