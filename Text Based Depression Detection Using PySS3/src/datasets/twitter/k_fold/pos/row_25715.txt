My mama made me get an app that tells her my location, but the only person affected by it is her. Itâ€™d be a problem if I went to public school or actually were able to leave the house but I can do neither. The apps called Life360 and we have the free version. I can save three locations and get notifications if anyone else in the group comes and goes. Only me, my mom, and my step dad are in the group. 


I have the house saved so I get a notification when she goes over 1,000 feet away from the house, and then another one when she gets within that same amount. I know when either her or my step dadâ€™s phone battery is low, and I know their exact location at all times. 


My mom wonâ€™t get any of the paid versions because it then goes as far as to say what apps they were on, how many times theyâ€™ve checked their phone while in a moving car, what places theyâ€™ve been to and left within the last seven days, and letâ€™s me save more places. 

Seriously if Iâ€™m going to do anything bad Iâ€™m going to do it at the house. And theyâ€™ve basically just givin me an app that warns me about when their close. And not to mention Iâ€™m gunna keep one location save open so if I know sheâ€™s going to the mall for instance I can save it and get a notification when she gets there and when sheâ€™s coming back. 

Sheâ€™s literally made it easier for me to get away with stuff.
