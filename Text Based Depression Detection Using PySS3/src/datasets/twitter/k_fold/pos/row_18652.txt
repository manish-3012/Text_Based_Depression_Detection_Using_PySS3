Tiny Advice For Girls (From a Guy) So I know there were a couple big posts, but I just wanna say something pretty specific that has happened to me multiple times. Letâ€™s say you really like a guy, and itâ€™s mutual, but your not personally ready for a relationship. State that at the beginning and give the reason. Obviously only say what your comfortable talking about, but donâ€™t be misleading. Please say if you would be ready soon, or if you just donâ€™t know. We all have shit to deal with, and he will most likely understand and will be fine with being friends (especially if you tell him from the start). Also donâ€™t use this excuse if you donâ€™t mean it. It feels like ass when you say this and then you go and date someone else in like a week. Just be truthful and communicate when you are talking to someone that is mutually interested in you.
