my thoughts about all social medias not ranked just explained

-reddit: a big pro for it is the number of subreddits, where youre nearly guaranteed to find something you like. there is a bit of a hivemind which can make you scared to comment a bit

-instagram: used to be good, not really anymore. theres a ton of accounts/competition, so growing is pretty much impossible for a small acc. theres no â€œtrendingâ€ anymore so you cant find news unless you follow it. i dont have the reels update but its not well liked.

-twitter: can be hard to build an audience, but there are also communities to find. pretty good for trending so you can see whats happening

-tiktok: i dont use it much. from what ive seen it isnt too bad and just a place to hang out. also has some pretty funny vids

-4chan: we all know how 4chan is. i like the format but people can be pretty extreme. ultimate anonymity, and several interest forums. also requires captcha, so no bots.

if i missed any let me know also what are yalls opinions
