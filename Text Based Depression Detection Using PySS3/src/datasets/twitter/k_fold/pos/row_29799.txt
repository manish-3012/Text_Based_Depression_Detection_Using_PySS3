I think I might have an addiction So instead of talking to human beings like a normal person, I lift weights in my down time

But I've gotten stronger over quarantine, and now I'm running out of weight to lift heavier, so I lift for more sets instead

So I just did arms and legs for like 3.5 hours with pauses for using reddit between sets. I deadlifted like 400 lbs tonight for reps

I just bought bigger shirts a few months ago and I need a size up again. Funny thing is, I feel like I'm less liked by girls now that I'm big. So that's probably not great
