Dad made me cry just because of two bad grades. It may not be suitable for this group, but I just have to talk to anyone about it.
There may be spelling mistakes because I haven't calmed down yet ...sorry.

I may not learn very well, but I try my best. I only got two bad grades but I'm going to correct them anyway. Fuck grades. I didn't cry because of some stupid grades. 

Because of my brother, my parents absolutely wanted to see my grades. I was a little nervous because every time I did something wrong, they yelled at me. Even for the smallest mistakes. And then they ask why I don't ask them for help in learning. Idk man. Maybe because every time I ask for help, they tell me to handle it on my own or they call me stupid??? Maybe that's why?
....anyway....At least my mother let me explain why I got these grades. But my father started yelling at me :)
He even said I shouldn't be allowed to speak up or defend myself. He treated me like fucking shit because of those stupid grades. I'm sick of this. Every fucking time I do something wrong, everyone in this "family" treats me like the worst litter.
Now. I locked myself in the room and cried. And he laughs about it. I can hear him.
The only thing I expect from them is any respect for me and my decisions in life. 

I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of them all. I just want peace for myself.
