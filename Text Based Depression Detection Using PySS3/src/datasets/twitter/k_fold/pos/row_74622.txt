Need a lil help Hey friends class of 2020 here. Does anyone have any advice on how to tell your parents that you are in severe need of mental help. Iâ€™ve been struggling for too long and itâ€™s getting to a point where Iâ€™m not sure how much longer I can deal with it. Thank you for the help yâ€™all.
