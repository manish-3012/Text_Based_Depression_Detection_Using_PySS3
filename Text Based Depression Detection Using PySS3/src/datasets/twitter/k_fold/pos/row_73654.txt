Hey I've written another short story, again i didn't edit it but yesterday I got some good feedback so here's day#2 The sands rushing quickly past, dunes rising and falling as if the earth were filling it's lungs. The life is scarce and water ever more. A distant traveler, unfamiliar with these lands, leaving shortly forgotten footsteps in the ever changing landscape. As he walked, flowers began to sprout, finding life anew. Clouds from his lands follow behind as an omen of life. The rains began and life ran rampant. People never walked through these lands, he was the first, and yet instead of destroying what little there was, he created life from nothing. Deer followed, and then the birds, and then the decay to begin life over again. Sand turned to dirt, dirt began life, and life made room for death. The circle of life had been restored to these distant lands. The strangers journey was near it's end, as he walked through the mountains the petals of the new found life fade. The deer perish, leaving the life which was given for the short time. Then the dirt degraded and turned back to the uninhabitable earth as it had began. Life drained from the desert, leaving it as barren as it had started. The earth continued it's breathes as if this brief moment had not interrupted the barrenness.
