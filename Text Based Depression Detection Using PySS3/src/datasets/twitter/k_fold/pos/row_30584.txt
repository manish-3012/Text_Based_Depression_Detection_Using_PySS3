Five damn kilograms So, i really didn't think my weight loss attemp would be effective cuz i am fat since i was a toddler, BUT HOLY FUCKING SHIT IT IS EFFECTIVE.

On october 27th (the day i started)  i first saw my weight, it was 86.250 kilograms.

Then two days later on october 29th i checked and i had lost 850 grams (my weight that day was 85.400) , which i thought was already crazy fast for weight loss and now on November 2, i am weighting 81, 300 kilograms, almost 5 whole kilograms since I've started! That is a huuuuge weight loss, since in less than a week i lost almost 5 kilograms! 

I don't even know if this is possible, but am i proud of myself for not falling under temptations lol, thanks for reading guys
