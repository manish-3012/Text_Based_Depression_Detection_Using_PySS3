They want gender equality Sorry if this offends you I need to say this.


Can we please take a minute to realise that there is nearly nothing on sexism towards men. It is always protecting women saying men are sexist and all that. Yeah we are sometimes but it goes both ways.
Even after the Jonny Depp situation nothing changed it is just infuriating that nothing is said.
Go on search "sexism against men" then go to news nothing comes up. Ik it is international women's day but still go back a few weeks no difference.
On mobile sorry for formatting.
