My life is... strange I'm attracted to girls, I am a girl. I look like a boy. I wanna be with a girl. She's nice. We get along. I ask her. She says no. I ask for reason. She doesn't have a reason. I forget about it. 

I like Lego. I want new sets. I don't have space. I buy a set anyway.

I have no school until the 4th of January. I would normally be in Scarborough right now but the pandemic says no. Now I'm bored at home. Tomorrow, I'm going to a shop to buy more Lego. Time to turn my room into a minefield.
