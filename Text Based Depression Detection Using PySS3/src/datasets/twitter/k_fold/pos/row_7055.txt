Does anyone else feel empty Like Iâ€™m not sad or anything, Iâ€™m pretty good with life. Everything is going well apart from lockdown. But when Iâ€™m tired and not in the mood for life I feel empty. 

Like Iâ€™m not happy, sad, angry or anything, Iâ€™m just *there*. Itâ€™s really weird. Itâ€™s only when I focus my brain on something do I not feel like this. Iâ€™m existing and thatâ€™s it. 

Anyone else?
