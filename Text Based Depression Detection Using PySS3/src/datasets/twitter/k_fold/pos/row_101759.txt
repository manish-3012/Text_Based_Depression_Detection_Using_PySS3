For all the people that feel bad about their appearance Here is the thing everyone needs to accept, Iâ€™m not very good at making people feel better but this is something that even if you believe it to not be true it is. No one is ugly there is someone out there that will accept you for who you are but the thing you have to do first is accept yourself and learn that your not ugly you just feel that way. Iâ€™ve seen a few people say they are ugly and they had a picture of themselves and I didnâ€™t think any of them are particularly ugly. I know itâ€™s hard to accept yourself but you gotta try Iâ€™m trying to and itâ€™s made me feel better than I was when I just thought I was ugly.
