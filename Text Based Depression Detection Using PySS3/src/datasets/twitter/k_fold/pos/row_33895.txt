I love my parents but I really mad about them now because in a few days I will be walking 90ish km plus 40 km on a bus ride so it's supposed to be three days of walking so they want me to start walking on the 11th I need to get back home at the 14th so there will be no way for me to rest when I get there because i'm taking a train back home, dtw they want me to be at a school trip at that day.
