What should I do to get my friend to talk to me again? A few days ago I made a post saying that my crush(also a good friend if mine)blew me a kiss when she sent me a snapchat and I was gonna make a move

Anyway,the next day I overheard her talking to her friend about a guy that she likes and I needed to say something because it was now or never 

So I told her and she said that she had no idea that I liked her and that she thought that it would be best if we just stayed friends,and I'm ok with that as long as I am still able to talk to her and have the craic like we always have(btw craic is Irish slang for fun,I dont mean we do drugs)

We agreed that in school tomorrow that we wouldn't make things awkward and that we would leave this behind us,but the next day she didnt even speak to me

Should I say anything about it or should I just leave it and hope for the best?
