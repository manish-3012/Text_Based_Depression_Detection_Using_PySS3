My sister damaged my new car and my parents called me the asshole So my sister and I hate each other. No secret there. My mom has me take her her places tho and I hate it cause no matter what happens they only listen to her and I get in trouble. 

Whenever she touches my car I spent all my own hard earned money on, she's slamming it. 

She slammed the trunk so hard a few days ago it damaged the latch and since then my trunk has opened randomly while I was at work, going home from school and even on the freeway. They of course don't see this as her fault even though she had both hands on and jumped pulling it down with her fat ass until she was on top it it rocking the entire car. She also slams the doors extremely hard. 

I've politely asked her to treat my $5,000 car with a little more respect.

She comes home today and i take her to get a Covid test and she goes and interrupted my moms board meeting to tell her how mean I was. Yes I wasn't the nicest about her slamming my door today cause I'm very pissed about the trunk. Well now my dad had an hour long talk to me about how this is bull shit and I'm an ass hole they never even wanted. While my sister got ice cream...SHE'S 15 GOD DAMNIT YOU WOULD'VE MADE ME SLEEP OUTSIDE AFTER SMASHING MY PHONE IF I DID **ANY** IF THAT SHIT!
