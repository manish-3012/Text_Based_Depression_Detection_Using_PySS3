Day #8 of asking how your day is. Sorry for being late, I was doing school work. So, I've been thinking about pre-court me. He was a fucking idiot. But there are a few things that carried over from him. The biggest one would be our love for zdzislaw beksinski (sorry for mispelling that). Something about his art just appeals to me. Maybe it's the little thought in my head that in worlds/realities, i won't have to be controlled, I won't have to worry about the news and all of the things that are fucked up about this world/reality. Anywhos, enough about me,






#How's life going for ya'?
