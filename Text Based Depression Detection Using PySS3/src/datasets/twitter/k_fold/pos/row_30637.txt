my girlfriend since freshman year is moving away before we start our senior year together we're both 17 and currently in our junior year, we've been dating since freshmen year and it's been a healthy and loving relationship since the beginning. we watch anime together, play minecraft together, go on dates, do art projects, ect. but she's moving 2 states away this summer. i'm going to be spending my entire senior year alone. i know im a dude and should be tough and stuff about this, but it's breaking my heart. we'll get to visit and stuff, but rarely. this is my worst nightmare.
