Unsure of my eating habits So, from the year 2019-2020 I went to a boarding school. While I was there, my eating habits went pretty downhill, due to the lack of supervision at this school, I would eat maybe one meal a day on a good day. I remember my mom visiting me at the school a few months in and her seeing how much weight I'd lost. This continued until the first quarantine in March where we were all sent home. At home, my parents bought breakfast and cooked dinner so I started to eat more.
However, now I feel like I'm heading in the opposite direction. I have online school now, and I find myself eating big meals at home and constantly snacking. I'm starting to feel fat. I feel like I'm just constantly eating.
I'm trying to workout here at home and I'm trying to eat somewhat healthier, but I feel like I've put on a lot of weight and I'm really missing the body I had at my bordering school even though I know it wasn't healthy. 
I wanted to post this and ask if anyone feels the same or maybe has advice. I don't really know. 
I'm 162cm (5'4) and 58kg (127 lbs) btw.
