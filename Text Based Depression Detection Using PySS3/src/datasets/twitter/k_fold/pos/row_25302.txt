Looking in the mirror and not being able to tell if Iâ€™m fat or is it loose muscles or some shit Cuz like, it looks kinda like I have a 6 pack but like, very loose and not able to make the muscles do the thing, same with my arms, like I looks like if I would do the flexing thingy it would look muscular but it doesnâ€™t.

I earlier asked my mom about it and stuff and she said that it was because when I was younger I trained a lot so my muscles at that age formed like that but just werenâ€™t able to do that at that age, so technically if I would work not even that much it could be pretty easy for me to look pretty muscular, 

But it could just be the fact that itâ€™s 4 am and my depressed brain is still thinking about that mother fucking character from a bl Iâ€™m reading that is fucking 8â€™2 and is with a character that is 5â€™10 and the 5â€™10 character looks tiny compared to him and Iâ€™m fucking 5â€™1 so my brain is just malfunctioning.
