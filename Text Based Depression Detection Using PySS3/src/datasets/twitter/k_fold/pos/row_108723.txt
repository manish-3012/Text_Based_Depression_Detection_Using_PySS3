I've seen a lot of posts regarding transgender individuals so I have a stupid question: why don't we determine a person's gender through scientific tests and assign their appropriate gender at birth? Research has shown that transgender  individuals exhibit variances in genetics and brain structure compared  to their cis counterparts, why don't we determine a person's gender  through scientific tests and assign their appropriate gender at birth?

Studies  have shown that mtf personnel are more likely than cisgender males to  have a longer version of a receptor gene for the sex hormone androgen.   Another study showed that ftm personnel don't have the cyp17 t -34C  allele (which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone).   While these differences in genetics don't definitely conclude if someone  is trans or not, they do serve as an indicator in which more tests  could be done.  Such as observing the structure of the brain, which has  multiple indicators for whether or not a person would experience gender  dysphoria in the future.

Basically,  when a child is born first doctors would do a  assessment of their dna  (which sometimes is done anyways to determine genetic diseases).  If  those results suggested there might be a possibility,  then they would  do further examinations with mri machines and other apparatuses to  confirm their predictions.  I realize that this would probably be costly  (especially in places with sub-par health care) but, this is a  optimistic view of the healthcare system (and some parents have the  resources to have these examinations preformed in the current system,  however neglect to preform them since these assessments aren't very wide  spread).

These examinations could  greatly decrease the amount of gender dysphoria and distress the  individual would have to go through later in life.  On top of that,  treatments could start much earlier, therefore be a bit easier and more  effective.  The person wouldn't have to go through the incorrect puberty  in which their bodies are blasted with the inappropriate hormones for  their gender or deal with years of dysphoria and nervousness.    Furthermore, having scientific procedures being standard would probably  greatly increase acceptance of trans individuals in many societies.
