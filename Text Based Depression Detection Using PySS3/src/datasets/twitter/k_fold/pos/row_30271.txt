Fuck school School is done so poorly. The average teenager needs 8-9 hours of sleep to function at their best, and melatonin production only naturally starts in teenagers at around 10pm. Now, middle school requires you to be at school before 8:25. Which, is 10 hours, right? Well, a lot of students wake up an hour or so before then, now that's 9 hours of sleep, still good. Well, middle school releases kids at around 4pm, but some students get home as late as 4:30, so that's 5 hours and 30 minutes until you start to feel tired. Now, here's the fucked part, homework. For a lot of kids, it's not bad, but let's say your enrolled into band, algebra, and all advanced (1 grade ahead) classes. If your classes are like mine, you'll usually have algebra homework, English homework, and band homework, with science and Spanish projects. Band takes probably about an 30m to an hour of work, so now we have 4 hours and 30 minutes till 10pm. Algebra homework will most likely be 15-20 questions, so let's say that's 35 minutes. Now we have 3 hours and 55 minutes. OOP DINNER TIME- 25 minutes.  3 hours and 35 minutes. So english homework is usually easy, so let's say 20 minutes. Now we have 3 hours and 15 minutes. Here comes the projects! Let's just say you spend an hour on each. Boom, 1 hour and 15 minutes left. oh wait, we haven't talked about... DISTRACTIONS! Soo, let's say you spend 30 minutes a day on your phone, finding new music, etc. 45 minutes left. Cutting it close, eh? Most kids usually have daily chores, so that's 25 minutes. But, we havent counted after school meetings, football games, hanging out with friends, etc.


TLDR: schools dont take account of the fact that we have 7 different classes, and proceed to bombard us with tons of work and homework from each class, which often leads to kids receiving unnecessary amounts of stress at a young age.
