So far, I have missed 3/9 of my periodic exams out of my own accord. I just don't feel motivated, really. The only reason I got to finish other exams is either because they're easy or unconditional support from a teacher. These ones I missed, they're too much for me to handle. They amount to around 10-20% of my grade in each subject. Considering the amount of bullshit I've been doing this grading, it's safe I'd be on borderline 75, which is the passing grade, or maybe even lower. The big factor to diminish is my incompetence to code 6 flowcharts on C++, which amounts to 35% for that subject, and bullshitting my dance project, which also amounts to 35% for that subject. I just wanna rest and waiting for a few months isn't going to help it.
