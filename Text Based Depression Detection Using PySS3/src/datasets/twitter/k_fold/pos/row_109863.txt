I had a very stressful moment yesterday Soooo me and my old crush both had a. Hour off at school and i decided to talk about some things like the fight we had 2 weeks ago. Didnt go very easy and she said some shit so i got mad and she asked me why i am so in my feels and then we talked more and eventually she walked away

When she walked away i sent her on snap some things and for some reason she came back to me but she didnt read it yet. So i asked her if she could look at it and she goes sit next to me and reads it up.

I felt like i had a heartattack, i was super nervous

And then after she read it we talked together for a actual long time till lessons started again.
