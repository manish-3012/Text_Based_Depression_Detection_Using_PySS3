Guess the song by the lyrics, and even if you donâ€™t know what it is just guess a name I wanna kill myself, but no one believes me
I just wanna be loved, why they gotta deceive me?
Get what they want, then they leave me (GothBoiClique)
I just want you to see me, believe me
Honestly, I'm the one and you need me
And I need you
It's transparent, it's see through
I'm gettin' money, still sad too
I'm gettin' money, still sad too
I remember when I had you
I'm gettin' money, still sad too
I remember when I had you, now I don't
I'm gettin' money, still sad too
I remember when I had you
I'm gettin' money, still sad too
I remember when I had you, now I don't
Now I know, I don't love you anymore
But if you show me a sign, if you show me a sign
Maybe I could find another reason to try
Now I know, now I know, I don't love you anymore
But if you show me a sign, if you show me a sign
Maybe I could find another reason to cry
You're the reason I try
You make me wanna die
I think you're so cute
It kills me every time
And I got a death wish
So I wanna make you mine
I think it's a sign that when the stars align
GothBoiClique, in the black Benz truck, I don't give a fuck
I'm gettin' money, still sad too
I remember when I had you
I'm gettin' money, still sad too
I remember when I had you, now I don't
I'm gettin' money, still sad too
I remember when I had you
I'm gettin' money, still sad too
I remember when I had you, now I don't
