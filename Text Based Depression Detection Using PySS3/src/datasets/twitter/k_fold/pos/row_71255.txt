Imagine a world where there is zero politicians Would it be better? Or worse? 

Ok now from there, Get rid of any kind of government regulations on the economy 

Would that be better? Or worse

And from there. Let everyone share and work for each other

Congratulations you just made a true communist country ðŸ‘

Impossible utopia
