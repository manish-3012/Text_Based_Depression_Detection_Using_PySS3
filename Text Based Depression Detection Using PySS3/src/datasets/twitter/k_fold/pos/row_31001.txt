I just learned about this thing called pemdas and it just sounds like bimdas In maths I learned bimdas which means:
B-rackets
I-ndices
M-ultiplication
D-ivision
A-ddition
S-ubtraction
But apparently thereâ€™s this other one called pemdas and itâ€™s almost the exact same but it uses some different words that mean the same. 

Who learned pemdas and who learned bimdas?
