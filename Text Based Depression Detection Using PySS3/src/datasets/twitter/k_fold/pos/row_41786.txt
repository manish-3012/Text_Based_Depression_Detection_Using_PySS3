A rant about school. Why just why do we have to do all this meaningless homework and then we are told to sleep earlier, bruh we cant sleep because of YOU and YOUR motherload of homework. And dont get me started on math because i literally had a couple of breakdowns since i dont understand anything when it comes to algebra even though i try my hardest and ask for help and stuff.. i just want this to be over. But life will be full of work no matter what. When do we get to "live and socialize" when we have all this to do that prevents us from doing that. Sorry for the rant i just needed to get this off my chest.
