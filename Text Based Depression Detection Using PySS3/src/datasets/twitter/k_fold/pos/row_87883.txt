No way in hell did anyone ace high school without trying Heard so many people (even family members) talk about how they finished school with nearly perfect grades, but without any effort, and I've concluded it is absolute bullshit.

Pretty much had to give up all my hopes and dreams I've relentlessly worked towards for 2 years to keep my grades from falling into absolute oblivion. Also I haven't slept in like a month (school's been back for 2 months and I've been on the verge of jumping off a bridge ^not ^literally^ha^ha for those 2 months.)

So yeah, there are a lot of bullshitters in this world, especially those who say they aced high school without trying, and those who say you should just wOrK hArDeR even though there are 50 assignments for every hour of free time.

Ight thanks for coming to my mad rambling, have a good day.
