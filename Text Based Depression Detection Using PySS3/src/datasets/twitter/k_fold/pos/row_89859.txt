What's the point of serious relationships? I recently got into my first relationship a couple weeks ago with a girl who had moved 1000 miles to come to school in my town. We are both 18. I knew she wanted to go back home after she had finished school but that was years away and I didn't want to worry about that yet. Now she is thinking about switching majors which would cause her to have to move further from home and a long ways from me in 6 months instead of years in the future. Now I am questioning if it's even worth to have a relationship if she will just end up moving away. This is probably more suited for a therapist to help me with but I thought it would be worth asking here too.

What's the point of having a relationship or friendship with anyone if they are just going to eventually move away never to be seen again?

It all boils down to 3 questions: Should I continue the relationship with her or downgrade to just friends again? Should I be going to a therapist to discuss these issues? And what's the point of making friend who's destiny will eventually lead them to moving thousands of miles away?
