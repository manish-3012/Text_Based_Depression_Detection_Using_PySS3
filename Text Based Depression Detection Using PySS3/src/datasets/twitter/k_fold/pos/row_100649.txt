it's been a little over a month since I stopped playing video games I don't really have anyone else to tell so guess it'll be here lol.

Besides the academic consequences, I've realized that I've got no other hobbies other than grinding maps on aimlab and memorizing smoke lineups, so fuck it. No steam, no origin, no riot, no lunar client, nothing until I get my shit together.

Now I understand how hard it is to get into a new hobby, cuz it took me a solid week just to figure out how to use my midi keyboard on reaper.

mad respect to anyone who can use these god forsaken programs lmao.

To anyone facing any kind of addiction, whether it's as trivial as mine or something more serious, I hope you'll someday take those first steps towards self improvement. I'll be rooting for you every step for the way!
