My friends suck I just unfriended a couple of people on Xbox because they are liars and general pieces of garbage. 

Let me begin with this: I am probably in the wrong but I still just need to rant.

I met two people about a year ago and we hit it off from there. A few rough patches here and there, but we stuck together for most of the time. I recently reunited with one of them after he blocked me because I spammed him with party invites once, but it was short lived. Here's where things pick up. I invited the one I got back together with earlier, and he joins, but leaves immediately and doesn't say anything. I think "oh let me invite him back, he must have disconnected". No, he joined my other friend and his group who are working on setups for a heist. I told them prior that I would help, but I didn't want to end up not doing the finale or them leaving and doing it without me. I then find out that my other friend decided to join them instead and ignore me. I invited him to the party again, and he blocked me. I just now realized that the whole time they've been playing together and ignoring me after he blocked me. This made me freakin furious because the one that didn't block me told me that the one that did said that he was probably going to stop playing with us, which at this point is obviously untrue. 

What are your thoughts?
