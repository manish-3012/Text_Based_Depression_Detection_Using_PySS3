I hate spiders, but love Harry Potter I think you know where this is going. So when I had all my stuff tooken away a long time ago, I watched Harry Potter to pass the time. I was watching the Chamber of secrets until "spoiler"(it was to the part where Harry and Ron go to some room and see spiders, one big one in particular that cal talk.) 

Well, I stood up in my seat, cause I hate them things. I see them everywhere and it always gets me scared. Every time I feel a hair spring up on my body, I think it's a spider and look down. I can't go to the bathroom or take a shower due to spiders. I cant go 5 seconds without seeing a spider in a book. My sister watches tarantula videos, and it always gets me scared when I see it in my recommended.

Pleases help me.
