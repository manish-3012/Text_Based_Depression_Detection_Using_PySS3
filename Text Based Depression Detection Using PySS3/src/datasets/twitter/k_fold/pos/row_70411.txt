I hate being funny â€œsometimesâ€ Basically Iâ€™m only funny when Iâ€™m not trying to be since Iâ€™m pretty bad at a lot of things and Iâ€™m really clumsy and I get hurt alot, but when Iâ€™m actually trying to make jokes around my crush I sound like an idiot or I canâ€™t get the courage to even talk

And whenever I am accidentally funny itâ€™s only around my friends and random people that I donâ€™t know
