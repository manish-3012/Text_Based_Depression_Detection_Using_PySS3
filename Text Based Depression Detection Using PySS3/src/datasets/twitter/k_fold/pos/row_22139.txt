She be making things up So basically today this morning at school my friend accidentally sat on my laptop when i wasnt there and did some minor damage to it that is pretty much 100% either replaceable or repairable. He apologises and all is good. I don't think about it too much because i know that i have alot of saved up money in my bank account for things like these so i don't stress too much.
I get home and show my mum and she literally freaks out and yells at me for damaging my laptop when it wasnt even me and i said that to her.
She continues to lecture me for like 2 hours on how it's "irreplaceable and "we ain't getting u a new laptop" when i dont need a new one.
She just doesn't fcking listen to my pov sometimes. Drives me insane.
