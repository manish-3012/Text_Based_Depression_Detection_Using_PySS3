Made a poem for fun lemme know what you think Reap and sow- by Seven_MV

Beware the cursâ€™ed harvester
For he does not share your pain
His blade, a cold and rigid steel
Meant for waiting grain

Run and hide oâ€™ fettered soul
You cannot flee the truth
He knows your sin but doesnâ€™t care
His job brought him, to you
