Dear Parents If you want your child to open up to you, please listen to them, there are times where I tried to open up but my mother was playing candy crash while listening. You can imagine how that went.

Don't bug them about it, whether it's relation ships or mental states, just don't it makes us uncomfortable and not want to tell you about it. This is emphasized with relation ships. When a guy finds a female friend or vice versa most parents are like '_gender_ huh?'

Don't talk about it with anyone else. This is common sense but a lot of parents do so. I open up to my mother about anything and few minutes after that I hear her talking and laughing about it with a friend on the phone; this is invasion of our privacy which isn't really awesome since this is the age where we should develop some privacy.

Don't judge them after they open up, talk about it. Sometimes you open up and get a 'okay, it'll get better' kind of response. If you don't show interest there's no way we could show interest.
