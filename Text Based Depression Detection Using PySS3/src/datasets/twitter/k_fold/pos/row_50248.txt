Mom wants to go to the beach on her birthday despite covid, and I am ranting because idk what else to do at this point. My mom wants to go to the beach on her birthday, but I don't agree with it because there is a MOTHERFUCKING VIRUS going around. 

I try to reason y'know get her to chance her mind but all she did was tell me to calm down, and joke around saying that I like trump, despite her acting like him.

Need I mention that both me and my older sister are immunocompromised, and she isn't taking this seriously at all. She said that she and my dad will get tested, but what the fuck will that do if they're going home right afterwards.

I swear she thinks her birthday is more important than our lives.
