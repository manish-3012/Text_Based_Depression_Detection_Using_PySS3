I miss my cat, I miss my gf, school is stressful My cat ran away and might be dead, my gf lives 10 hours away and it has been forever since I've gotten a hug. I am in a new school and it is really hard and I need to make friends bc I have none from my last school. The one friend I have made is a sophomore so we are never in the same hallway. FUCKKKKK. Anyway how was your day?
