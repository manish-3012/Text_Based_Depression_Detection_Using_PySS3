Entire I.M. Meen transcript for those sorting by new I.M. Meen: *(singing)*  
Oh look, what clever children!  
See them study, watch them learn  
How I hate those goody goodies  
How they make my stomach turn!  
I've got a little secret  
That'll really make them cry  
It's a nasty kind of magic  
From a special kind of guy!  
This book is made to order  
But it isn't to be read  
When they open up this book  
They're sucked inside instead  
To the most unpleasant place they've ever seen  
The magic labyrinth of I. M. Meen!  
Very scary and confusing  
Destination of my choosing!  
Magic labyrinth of I. M. Meen! (*Laughs*)

Gnorris the Gnome: Here, take this crystal orb! You can use it to contact me whenever you touch a scroll. Now go, before the guardians catch you!

Gnorris the Gnome: You've got to be careful, one of the boss's special creations is guarding the way out! Fight it from a distance, if you can!

Gnorris the Gnome: I've only got a second! There's a powerful wand hidden in this level. It will help you beat the guardians!

Gnorris the Gnome: Go! Find the scrolls, hidden in the labyrinth. You must free the other children! Please don't tell the boss or he'll turn me into a warthog.

Gnorris the Gnome: The boss is waiting for you up there. He's really mad! You don't stand a chance without Writewell's Book of Better Grammar!

Gnorris the Gnome: Here you are! You've got to be more careful; the boss is getting suspicious.

Gnorris the Gnome: Wow! At this rate, you'll free all of the children before dinnertime!

Gnorris the Gnome: I knew you could do it! Good luck!

Gnorris the Gnome: You are doing very well! Keep going!

I.M. Meen: You won't get far, you studious little brat, my pets will see to that! *(Laughs then disappears)*

I.M. Meen: Still loose, little bookworm? Don't get used to it, my pets are closing in! (*Laughs then disappears*)

I.M. Meen: What's the matter, smarty? Lost your way? My guardians would be happy to escort you... to a cozy cell! (*Laughs then disappears*)

I.M. Meen: Better luck next time, bookworm! Of course, there probably won't be a next time! *(Laughs then disappears)*

I.M. Meen: Why, hello, little bookworm. I do hope you're enjoying your whirlwind tour of my labyrinth, hmm?Â *(disappears)*

I.M. Meen: Lost? Frightened? Confused? Good! (*Laughs then disappears*)

I.M. Meen: (*Grumbles*) You are beginning to annoy me, you miserable little goody goody!Â *(disappears)*

I.M. Meen: You're tougher than you look, twerp! But I've still got some nasty tricks up my sleeve...Â *(disappears)*

I.M. Meen: Well, well... I'm surprised you don't give up, bookworm! You're beginning to look run down. Why not take a little nap...?Â *(disappears)*

I.M. Meen: Here's a rhyme for you: \**ahem*\* I knew a little bookworm, who tried to get away, until the friendly guardians persuaded him to stay! (*Laughs then disappears*)

I.M. Meen: You can't win, bookworm! I am the most powerful magician in the world, and you're just a little smarty!Â *(disappears)*

I.M. Meen: Mirror, mirror, on the wall, there's a bookworm in the hall... but not for long! (*Laughs then disappears*)

I.M. Meen: Okay bookworm, now you're really starting to annoy me! Get back to your cell before I turn you into a... chipmunk!Â *(disappears)*

I.M. Meen: Today's lesson is about the dangers of being too smart for your own good. I hope you're paying attention, bookworm!Â *(disappears)*

I.M. Meen: Back into your cell, bookworm! Don't worry, I'm sure you'll escape again... in a hundred years! (*Laughs then disappears*)

I.M. Meen: (*Pants*) Wretched child! You've ruined my beautiful labyrinth! Now you're going to pay!Â *(disappears)*

I.M. Meen: Aaaaaaaahh! You may have outsmarted me this time, bookworm, but I'll be back! I. M. Meen never quits, you'll see...!
