Hey guys. i need some legal help. I have a pocket knife and i live in Californian. I'm wondering if its legal for me to fiddle with it(e.g. Open and close it over and over) I ask because i have ADHD, and i typically need something to fiddle with. I dont want anybody getting all "HES GOT A KNIFE! RUN! AHHHHH" because im opening and closing my knife. I'm not making any attempt to hide it and im not intending to brandish it. Any advide would be helpful
