After 2 months, I finally know the reason why my crush from March ghosted me So she ghosted me back in June. We've been bestfriends since March. We did everything together. We shared a bond, secrets, and a close friendship. We told each other our fears, we legit snapped and held amazing conversations. She's the first attractive girl to give me attention. She didnt give a fuck about looks. She's a solid 8/10. Anyways we had too many breakdowns. I'd get pissed whenever she responded late (although i never brought it up to her). I did many things I regret. And those were the exact reasons why she ghosted me. 

She told me today in the paragraph the reason she dropped me was because she believed I had 0 trust in her, she didnt believe that I believed that she cared about me (if that makes sense). She basically saw me as toxic bc one day we'll be making jokes and laughing and the other day we'd be having a breakdown over something she didnt know about. She had no idea what she did wrong. And that's because I was toxic.

I had too many spare time in my hands to actually do other shit since i was too focused on her. The conversation is about to end, but I wished her an amazing journey into her future and that she's an amazing person but the friendship just isn't going to work. I still love her but I have to let go. 

I finally have closure as to why she ghosted me. I feel relieved and I finally realize what ive been doing was extremely toxic and everyone kept telling me, but did i listen ?? no. Why? Because i always thought after a breakdown we'd  be friends again. Nope! After our last breakdown in June that COSTED our friendship.

Its saddening. She acc gave a shit abt me, always cared, always sent me chains of paragraphs when i was depressed. But it's over now. At least 2 months later I got closure.
