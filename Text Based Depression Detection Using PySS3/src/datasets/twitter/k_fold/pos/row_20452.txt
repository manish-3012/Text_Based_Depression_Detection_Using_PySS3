I'm losing my hearing in my right ear and my parents don't take me seriously So about 2 days ago I was cleaning my ears with a Qtip. I got to my right ear and next thing I know everything I hear is slightly quieter in that ear. It's only been getting worse and things are now at a muffled sound when I hear things from that ear. If you guys have any advice pls help
