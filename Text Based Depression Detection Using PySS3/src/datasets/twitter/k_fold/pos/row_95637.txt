Skateboarders of Reddit, do you judge beginners? Heyy so iâ€™m a 14 yo girl and iâ€™m really scared to empty parking lots and skate parts because i donâ€™t wanna be judged. like iâ€™m afraid more advanced skateboarders would like laugh at me or call me a poser. do you guys actually think like that or an i just being anxious.
