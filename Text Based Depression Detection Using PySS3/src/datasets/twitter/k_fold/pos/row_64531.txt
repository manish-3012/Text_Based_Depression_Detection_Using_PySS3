Why do I feel so alone when Iâ€™m surrounded by people who love me? My depression and low self esteem have disappeared Iâ€™m doing good socially and in school. Iâ€™m surrounded by people who love me yet I have no one to talk to. My friends are too toxic to talk about sensitive matters, I havenâ€™t exchanged more the 100 words with my sister since she moved to the us two years ago, my mom is stressed and a little psycho right now, my father is in Hong Kong and sleeping, and Iâ€™m gonna break up with my gf Tomorrow so I donâ€™t wanna bother her. My brother and father had a huge argument and donâ€™t talk anymore ever since things have been ruff with him. My parents are divorced forgot to say that. 

My mom wanted me to go sailing with her and my stepdad but I said I didnâ€™t want to and said that I have plans. I didnâ€™t do anything all day and told her that I was going out for a bike ride and somehow she figured I hadnâ€™t been outside all day. Now sheâ€™s mad and I donâ€™t wanna go home and donâ€™t know where to go
