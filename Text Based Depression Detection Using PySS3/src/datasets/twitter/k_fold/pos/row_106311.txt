Stop hating on police officers Please stop. Downvote this all you fucking like or i dont care. Police officers are so important and should be celebrated more. So many people put the police in a bad light because of the small handfulls of idiots who love killing and arresting people for no reason.

My brother is a police officer and hes the nicest guy i know, and he wouldnt even hurt someone unless he has to! Alot of times they have to resort to violence because they keep arguing with the officers and not complying. Just obey and you wont be hurt! 

So please. If you ever get pulled over by a police officer on the road or get caught doing something illegal, dont resist. It'll make everything worse.

Thanks for reading and have a great day.
