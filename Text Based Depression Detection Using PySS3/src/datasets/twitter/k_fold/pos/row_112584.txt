Ok Iâ€™ve come to terms with it. I think I might maybe have a tiny crush on my friend I hate that this is happening, especially since nobody knows and I donâ€™t want to crush on him and best of all heâ€™s interested in someone else and has been for the longest time. Iâ€™m not even his type and he kinda isnâ€™t my type either lol. I donâ€™t know why I suddenly feel this way toward him, but I do and I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know if I should talk to my good friend about it because heâ€™s also close with the friend I like, but I am tired of keeping it a secret and maybe my friend can knock some sense into me. Idk. Advice please. And no I will def not bring this up to the friend I like, not yet at least. Itâ€™s the beginning stages of this crush so maybe my feelings will change over time. I donâ€™t wanna do anything thatâ€™ll change the dynamic of our friendship.
