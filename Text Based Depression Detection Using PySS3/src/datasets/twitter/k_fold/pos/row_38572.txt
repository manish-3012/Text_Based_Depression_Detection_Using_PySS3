Kid being bullied on my bus First Iâ€™ll start by giving some background information. Iâ€™m on the swim team for my school and Iâ€™m currently going to a swim meet on the bus. On the bus with me is a couple of other kids namely two named (for privacy purposes) Chris and Brian. Brian I believe is either autistic or has ADHD Iâ€™m not sure.â€œChrisâ€ here is constantly insulting Brian for no reason other than that heâ€™s different. In conclusion what should I do, should I let Brian fend for himself or help him?
