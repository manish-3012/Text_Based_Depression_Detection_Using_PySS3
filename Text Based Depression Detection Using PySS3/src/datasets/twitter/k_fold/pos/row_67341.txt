I'm so done with my parents ignoring my boundries with hugging and kissing. Countless times I have asked them not to and told them that it is a boundry. Nevertheless, they keep pushing back and forcing it. Each time I feel gross and uncomfortable. 

I wish parents would teach consent consistently. Consent shouldn't be ignored just because they are your kid. You want to teach no means no, start by leading by example
