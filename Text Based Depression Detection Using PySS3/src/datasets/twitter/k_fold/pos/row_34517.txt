I don't know how I'm supposed to feel right now A kind-of friend of mine died today. I don't know how to feel about it. We weren't best friends, but we had an Instagram group chat and we and another kid used to meet up on Fridays to go to Starbucks.

The three of us were going to go on one last Friday Starbucks run last year, but then covid came and we put it off until everything opened again. I still have his order in my notes app. A venti pink drink with light ice. 

I've never known anybody who died before. I feel like I shouldn't be upset, I wasn't that close to him, so because I am upset I feel like I'm faking it. I'm just doing homework now and trying not to think about it, but I can't.
