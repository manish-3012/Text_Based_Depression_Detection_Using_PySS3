I miss my friend so much I miss my best friend so much. She was so nice to, she always made me happy. We rarely see each other in middle school, but when we do it makes me so happy, but know that can't even happen because of remote learning. I wish I could contact her, i miss her a lot. I like as more than just a friend, and I really want to tell her that. I how she's doing fine during the virus though, i haven't seen since it shut everything down.
