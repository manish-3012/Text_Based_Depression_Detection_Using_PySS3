lets play a fun game :) where we find my motivation bc WHERE THE FUCK DID IT GO



fr like i had all the motivation in the world last week, i was caught up with school, i was active and eating regularly

now i can barely get out of bed to play minecraft â˜ï¸ðŸ¤¨ and if i do get up i just stay hunched in my chair staring at the minecraft main menu and it huRtss. im barely eating and even with all the laying in bed im barely sleeping ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜«

this happens so often too where its just a cycle and i just want someone to come change my brain chemicals bc im sick of being mentally ill ðŸ§


anyways hey lol im in desperate need of friends ðŸ¦§ im fucking stupid and thats all u need to know.
