I want to hide myself forever and not come back. I want to know who decided to put the "share screen" function in MS Teams right next to the microphone toggle, i accidentally clicked it and shared some manga i was reading (totally not in the middle of class, i am a good student), luckily i reacted quickly and the teacher didn't say anything, he continued giving class after putting the presentation back on, but i don't know if everyone else saw it (they probably did, since the corners of my screen turned red). The manga wasn't anything "cultured", but it was fluffy colorful yuri (in a wholesome moment, so it is impossible to deduct), so now i'll be looked at as someone weird (as weird as a somone who reads manga is, since there is also a furry in my group).
