[serious]Odd experience I had... I was on a sub, and just commented something. It ended up turning into a bit of a discussion between some other guy and me. 
Well, at some point I think I accidentally told them I was a highschooler 
So..they just kept talking, like holding a convo 
They were in their 80s and it felt like...maybe an elderly person shouldnâ€™t be just chatting with a teen. 
I felt like quitting, but they including things like how they were Nearing the end of their life, or how they had heart issues, ect. Honestly I felt a bit guilty for randomly ghosting the conversation. 
Iâ€™m probably mixing details up, but I think he knew I was young..not sure how young he thought I was. There was someone else to whom I mentioned (ok kinda dangerous, Ik) being in hi school..but that convo stopped fairly quickly for obvious reasons. 
The 80 year old guy I mentioned earlier seemed to mention these facts in many of his comments. He wasnâ€™t in teen sites, but still was kinda odd. 
I deleted the account later since it was a throwaway but I still feel it was kinda off. 
Your thoughts?
