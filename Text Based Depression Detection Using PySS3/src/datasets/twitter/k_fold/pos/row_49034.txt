Donâ€™t force your sexuality on me and I wonâ€™t force my religion on you. I want to start off by saying Iâ€™ll be friends with anyone. Black, white, gay, straight, cis, trans, Christian, Buddhist, whatever. Iâ€™ll be friends with you, as long as your nice to me. Iâ€™ll even be best friends if we connect. You can try to change anything you want about me (even though it might not work), but never, ever try to change my religious beliefs. Donâ€™t force me to accept your sexuality either. Sure, I will congratulate you for coming out, and I wonâ€™t try to make you straight, but I wonâ€™t support your decision. Iâ€™ll just ignore it. While I might think itâ€™s wrong, I wonâ€™t force you to change in any way, and you should do the same to me. Itâ€™s my religion, and my whole life revolves around it, so you donâ€™t have the right to tell me all my beliefs are wrong
