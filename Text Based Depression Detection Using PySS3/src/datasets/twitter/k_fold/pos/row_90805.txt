I find this idea of privileges like in "pretty privilege" unhealthy and I think it needs to stop. I find this concept of trying to always find who have the most privileges or who is the biggest victim vicious and it's only good at creating more differences and more conflict among people. Ok we get this that it's harder sometimes when you are black, overweighted.. Or anything. But the solution isn't to vent about how injust it is because "those people have more advantages that's so unfair" it just looks like a witch hunt to find who has the most privileges to make their lives harder or something or just to expose them. People doing this are just pointing out at the other people and it looks like discrimination. This is also totally unlegitimate because just like you, those people did not choose to be white or pretty. Pointing them out and making their situation seen as a bad thing is just a good process to get enemy with them whereas they asked for nothing. This is also immature to point out people like this and to always try to see where the grass is greener instead of actually prioritizing doing more effort. Also this vision of "privileged" people is just looking like a big cliche about white people and it feels very arbitrary. Basically, people who are always bragging about pribileges are also the worst because they are the one who always divide people in cases and apply a tag to them whereas it is exactly what they are claiming to fight against. I hate this and find this useless and only good at creating stupid conflicts that are misleading humanity into not fighting against more important problems.

I am also sorry for my horrendous english. And this thought isn't pushed to it's best. It's writtend out of the mood but relate an honnest thought.
