I really enjoy all the artwork on this subreddit I just really like all the artwork here, just the style is so good. I feel like the artists of this subreddit donâ€™t get enough credit for their hard work. All of the art here always makes me pause and really savor it, and I love it. Please keep making these comic-sequel drawings, they are always funny and well drawn. Thank you and keep up the good work!
