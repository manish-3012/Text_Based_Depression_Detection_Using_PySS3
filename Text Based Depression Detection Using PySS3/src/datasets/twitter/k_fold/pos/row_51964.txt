Questions to all the girls! How do you know if a girl has a crush on you, and how much? I have a girl in my class and I am very nervous to ask her out, and should eye ask her out. We sit next to each other in our classroom, and we have the same intresses in movies and books, I recommende the Star wars prequals and the clone wars and she said "I think I might like them."
