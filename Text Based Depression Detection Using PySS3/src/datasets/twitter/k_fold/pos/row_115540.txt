Im very confused on what i shouldâ€™ve done Confusion

hey guys... i am very confused as of now. So basically what happened was that me and some girl in my class liked the same music band as i did. So she started calling me best friend and whatnot so I was getting the feeling she liked me but I still went with the flow even though I didnâ€™t like her. But then she started texting me for hours straight about like life in general and to be honest she was a bit annoying because if I were to say anything to her then she would get mad but if she said something to me I was expected to not react. So what I did after some time was just annoy her a LITTLE bit like what she did only for one day though. Well then it turned out to become a HUGE fiasco because i had already friend-zoned her and was being made fun of by friends for doing so... but the same was happening on her end. So she got mad this one day and POOSH next minute she is gone.

What do you guys think... Should I have left the opportunity to be in a relationship?
