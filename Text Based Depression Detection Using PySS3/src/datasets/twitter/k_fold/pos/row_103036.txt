My dad knows of my suicidal thoughts. Apparently my dad seems to perceive that I'm having suicidal thoughts and is now forcing me to go to a psychiatrist. Like, in an hour and half.

I feel like I should be angry, mad. But actually, it is the first time someone does the right thing to me, instead of asking if I want a chamomile, to calm down cause I'm making who's around me sick as I wanted this and shitty stuff like that.

He's going to make a diagnosis of what I have.

I want to be a good person, I want to be caring, I want to deserve love and affection.

I'm gut, I hate what I have done and the people I hurt. I'm so confused, maybe I don't deserve to feel better again, don't deserve to be good or to be considered so at least. 

I don't know how this situation is going to get solved, but I can guarantee that it will. One way or another.
