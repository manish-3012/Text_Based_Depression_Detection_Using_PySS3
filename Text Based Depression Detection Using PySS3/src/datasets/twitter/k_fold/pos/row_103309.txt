Can everyone stop being political assholes I'm not a Trump supporter. But being a Trump supporter does not make you an asshole. And it's not just that, everyone that I talk about politics with just starts screaming because of a single difference of opinion and I'm really sick of it. It's annoying, immature, and shitting on Trump doesn't make you special. It just makes you sound stupid, so knock it off. Also, if I hear one more person say that Trump's brother deserved to die I will run them over with an 18 wheeler.
