Hello all, fellow teenager here. I have a pretty strange question but one I'm sure at least a few will understand. This might be long so I'll add a tldr Now, if you're familiar with games such as doom, assaultcube, etc. You'll know (or might know) they use something called a skybox. Basically a big cube with textures of mountains or sky textures on all six sides. The actual game map is inside the cube, right in the centre. No my point: why do I feel like I'm on another planet when I look out of the map and at the skybox. It feels so surreal, and unnatural, yet oddly nostalgic? Does anyone else experience this? 

Here you go tldr, I feel very strange yet (genuinely can't describe it) when I look out of a game map and at the skybox

Hopefully some of you out there know what I'm on about
