Oh so here's something funny that happened a couple of days ago So I was at school, and we were changing classes (from 2nd block to 3rd block), and the hallway smelt BAD. 

Like really bad, it smelled like shit. We didn't know what could've caused it and it was quite bothersome.

The next day a girl in my class said her brother bought liquid shit of the internet and put it in the vents or something.
