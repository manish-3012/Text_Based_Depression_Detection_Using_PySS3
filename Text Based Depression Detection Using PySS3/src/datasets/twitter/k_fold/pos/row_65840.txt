This one thing changed my life during COVID I started working out, I highly recommend. Iâ€™m stronger, I lost wight, and I did it all with almost 0 equipment. I just have a few dumbbells a place to do pull ups, and a bike. The bike really helps leg muscles if you do steep hills and cardiovascular, and body wight exercise is great. Things like push up plank and chin up/pull up. If you donâ€™t, try! just work your way up if itâ€™s to hard, start with just a few reps.
