Iâ€™m pathetic So some girl Iâ€™ve been hanging out with left me on read for a day and never got back and Iâ€™m taking it rlly hard some reason. For context, this has happened to me b4. Ig thatâ€™s why, idk. Last time it was a party girl, so at least that wasnâ€™t surprising. I guess it hit so hard this time cause she seemed like a really sweet shy girl who was enjoying our time together, and weâ€™ve been hanging out for a month and change. I guess not tho, I mean who doesnâ€™t respond for a freaking day, but I see U with ur friends and shit, unless you never wanna talk again

I feel like a fool now cause when I was just chilling and doing my hobbies and hanging with friends, i felt so good. Now Iâ€™ve put myself out there for dating again and now Iâ€™m so down I canâ€™t get out of bed. And I feel pathetic for getting down in the first place. I wish I never put myself out there

Edit: the text was asking to hangout
