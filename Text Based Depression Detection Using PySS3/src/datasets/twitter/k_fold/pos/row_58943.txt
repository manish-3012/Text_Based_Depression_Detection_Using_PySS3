Everybody listen up (LGBTQ+ community especially)! Last night my car was vandalized. One of the things that was done was "Honk if your Gay" (ik its "you're" but they wrote "your" ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸) was written on the back of my windshield.

Last night it completely wrecked me as I have been through alot recently and the fact that someone dislikes me enough to come find my car (which everyone in my life knows is extremely valuable to me) and vandalize it kinda sent me over the edge. 

However, as I drove to work this morning, so so many people were honking, driving by and smiling, I was getting waves, and even this big ass semi truck honked his horn a few times (which scared tf outta me tbh because I forgot the words were on the back of my window and I thought I was about to get hit by a semi hahhh..) 

The point im trying to make is i would never have thought there would be that many people so supportive of the gay community in my area, and that got me thinking that alot of you struggling with your sexuality probably feel the same way, and probably feel like there's not alot of people in your daily life that would love and support you if they knew. Today taught me a very valuable lesson, that no matter how alone you feel, or what you're struggling with, there's support out there and people who know exactly what you're dealing with.

You are all loved, and anything and everything you need (including love and support) is out there for you, none of you are ever alone!
