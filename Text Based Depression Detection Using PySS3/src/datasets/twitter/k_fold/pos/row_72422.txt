So my cousin comes home from work last night She works at a daycare that her son goes to. 2 girls were pulling my little cousins hair and my cousin (his mom) kicks them down. SHE KICKED 2 TODDLERS DOWN. ITS BAD ENOUGH SHE HITTIN CHILDREN BUT THIS IS 2 FAR SHE TOUCHED SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHILD. And her rants about the boss and co-workers make it seem this daycare ain't professional. Should I report my cousin and the daycare for child abuse?
