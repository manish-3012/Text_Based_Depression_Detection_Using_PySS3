I screwed up accidentally almost burnt my house down... again by forgetting to put water in my mac and cheese before cooking. Now my whole house smells like it caught fire. Never try to cook food while on 1 brain cell, you may even go further and burn your house. I didn't realize my mistake until I saw smoke coming out the microwave then i opened it to find a fire. I immediately told my mom and got my mask on, took the burning mac and cheese out and put it in the sink and left the water running to cool it off. Fucked up bad enough gay people think straighter than me.
