Aye question for my florida people down there (or anyone really) So im moving to florida in a few months but i have a chance of going down there next month and staying with my sister. I dont want to say where im gonna be staying but its gonna be really close to Orlando. After this covid shit over im trying to get out more and make new friends/ meet girls but i dont know anything about florida i dont even know anybody other than my 30 year old sister lol. Im 17 and turn 18 in like 8 months too, so if anybody has any idea on best places to go to meet people wnd how to make friends let me know please lol
