How anime changed my life First thing first, I kind of know what do I want to learn after high school. I want to be a teacher. (Even if I have to work something else simultaneously) How I got this idea? I want to be like Korosensei (Teacher in the Assassination Classroom anime). I'm not that strong obviously, but I want to be a memorable person to teens, who they can look up to. My aim is to be a high school grammar teacher. Where I live, they don't pay the teachers well, but I'd still love that job. (After I wrote down, I remembered. Other motivation: Rimuru Tempest. Anime: Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken S1 last episodes.)

Secondly. Animes were the first non-real life things that could make me cry. I surely was a crybaby even 2-3years ago, but since I watch anime, my constant sadness transforms into crying on an anime. (For example: Your Lie in April)

Thirdly. Animes motivated me to excerise once a day (My Hero Academia) and I found a new hobby, swordart. (Sword Art Online)

Last, I learnt empathy, optimism, and that you have to accept yourself as you are even when you're different. (Can't tell an example, there are a lot of anime based on this.

+ Since I'm neither English or Japanese, watching subbed/dubbed anime improves my language skills
