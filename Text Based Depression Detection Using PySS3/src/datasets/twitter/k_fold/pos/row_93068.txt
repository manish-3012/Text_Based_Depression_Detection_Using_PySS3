Do you think my friend could forgive me and give me another chance I messed everything up for the hundredth time. I'm not someone people want to be friends with but I finally made a friend who actually wanted to talk to me and he was the only one who talked to me throughout the day but I ruined everything. I have hurt him in so many ways and now he hates me
