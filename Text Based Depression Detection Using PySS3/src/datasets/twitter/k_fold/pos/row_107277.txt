*gets attacked by an experienced serial killer in my own home* *gets kicked in the stomach to the ground and manages to catches the knife in my right hand just as the attacker brings it down on me, and we both wrestled on the ground for the knife before the attacker gets the upper hand and stabs me in the chest and neck over and over again*



Imagine dying like this.

Ouch.
