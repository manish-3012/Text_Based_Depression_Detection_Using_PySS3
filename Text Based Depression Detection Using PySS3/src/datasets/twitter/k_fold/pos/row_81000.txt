Bad prank Last night my online friend of 8 months told me he was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer. I asked if he was joking and he kept telling me about how he's gonna die soon and he thinks this is good because he hates living anyway (our humour usually involves wanting to die but this felt different atm).

I spent 30 minutes texting him about how he is going to make it and how he should want to live, how much he matters to me and everyone around him, I'll be there if he ever needs to talk etc etc (at this point I was actually convinced that he has cancer), he kept telling me that he's alright with dying this way and after 30 mins of texting he told me that he made that up. Because he was bored. Wtf?

I trusted him because I thought he would not joke about something like that. Which was pretty dumb but it was believable atm. I got mad at him for that and he apologized. But I'm still pretty upset. 

I really hate pranks like these because I am not that comfortable with people seeing my emotions and these pranks work because a person trusts someone with their feelings in the first place, and then that someone lies about having cancer for half an hour and makes them think twice about trusting them ever again. I might be overreacting but it is kinda hard for me to get over minor stuff like these. So i just needed to vent. 
Thanks for reading if you made it this far. How would YOU react if your friend did this to you? Also, do you think this prank is an okay thing to do and I am disproportionately upset?

Ps- hope ur taking care of urself, have a great day :)
