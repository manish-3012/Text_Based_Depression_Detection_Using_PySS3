My mom sucks She didnâ€™t care my entire preadolescent life, and didnâ€™t start until I wanted to fucking kill myself. She still doesnâ€™t consider my feelings, my ideologies, what I think, and how I act. She ignores the trauma and other problems sheâ€™s caused. And is a racist bigot, she hates trans people and thinks BLM is liberals taking the government over, my mom is Captain Crack Crazy.

I miss my dad and wish I could move in with him because then at least Iâ€™d feel loved and respected.

Iâ€™m going to bed good night peeps, sleep well/have a good morning, evening, or night. Youâ€™re all deserving to be treated with respect and love no matter your race, sexual orientation or identity, you matter and please donâ€™t think Iâ€™m anything like my mother. 

I only posted here because at least someone would hear it
