lets gooo i found someone to buy me alcohol none of my good friends are 18 yet so i always feel so awkward asking other people in my grade to buy me drinks. but luckily this one girl who used to like me offered to drive me home from school tomorrow and i took the opportunity to ask if we could drop in to the bottlo to get some drinks on the way home 

thank god that saved me a lot of hassle trying to get alc for a party
