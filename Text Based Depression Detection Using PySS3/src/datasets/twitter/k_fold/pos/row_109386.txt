I want to play a sport desperately. All of my friends do and I am self conscious about it. The only sport I have fallen in love with so far is football, yet Iâ€™m not allowed to play, and I think it is taking a toll on my mental health Iâ€™m looking for some advice here. 
So let me start off by saying I have very poor self confidence (most of the time anyway). Tonight I got home from school, and went to my brothers track meet. Right after that I went to a family friends volleyball game. While I was there I noticed how much it sucks to not be doing a sport. I had thought about it all summer, but football is the only sport that I have experience in that I would be willing to commit to. Every one of my friends that I can think of plays a sport at my Highschool. What do you think I should do or say to my parents. They know how badly I want to play but are spooked about injuries and crap like that. I will admit the times I get most depressed are when I go watch other people do what I want to do (ex playing a sport, wearing jerseys to school on game day) Is there any argument I could bring up to help my case?
