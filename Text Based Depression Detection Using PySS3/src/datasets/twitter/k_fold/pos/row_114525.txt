Iâ€™ll be moving to Mexico Recently I got myself an iPhone and my case arrived so I decided to officially transfer my SIM card. As the bright teenage boy I am; I decided to visit an 18+ plus site to tenderize some meat. Iâ€™m gay so I put on the gay vid but I wanted to put on some AirPods. Now hereâ€™s where it goes down hill, while connecting my pods I saw this icon near the vid player so I clicked it but just my luck it was airdrop. Now Iâ€™m shitting my pants. It didnâ€™t ask me who I wanted to share with so hopefully it didnâ€™t drop to anyone (my grandparents have iPhones and I live with them) but Iâ€™m not sure how this thing works. What an awkward way to come out to my entire family. I really hope it didnâ€™t do anything and I want to kms

On a positive side if I did screw up I guess I can get free karma out of my pain on r/TIFU
