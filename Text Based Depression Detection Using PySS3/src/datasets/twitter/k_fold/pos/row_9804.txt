My TikTokker GF dumped me for liking Pewds... I thought we had something special. I loved making Pewds references around her and repping the merch in her dance videos, but she had a talk with me about how I apparently just talk way too much about Pewds and itâ€™s the ONLY thing I talk about?

Bruh. Iâ€™m so confused right now.
