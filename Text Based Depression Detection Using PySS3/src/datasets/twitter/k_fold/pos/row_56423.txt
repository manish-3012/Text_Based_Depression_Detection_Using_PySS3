iâ€™d really appreciate it if i could stop forming crushes on any boy who treats me like a human being. idolization and attachment issues, years of bullying and abuse, and the fact i have almost zero friends has made me like a puppy, following and obsessing with anyone who treats me with kindness. even if they hate me, because i know everyone does, and they treat me with kindness only out of pity or obligation, such as with three of my coworkers, i canâ€™t help but want to be in their presence - i canâ€™t leave you. youâ€™re the only person who... is decent to me. youâ€™re the only place that iâ€™m safe. 

iâ€™m a creep.
