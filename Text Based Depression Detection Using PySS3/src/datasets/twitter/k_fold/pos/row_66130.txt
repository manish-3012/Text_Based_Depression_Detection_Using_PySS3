Should I get new friends? Hello, two days ago I asked a friend of mine who I thought was pretty close with me if he wanted to go hammocking with me during virtual school (Iâ€™m a junior in hs) and he said he canâ€™t but we agreed on him calling me a bit after school was done to let me know he was coming over to pick me up. Well I waited and waited, but I was super bummed when night came around and he hadnâ€™t called back. I found out later that night that he hung out with two other best friends of mine because they sent photos in the gc. So I was even more bummed, I know I probably shouldâ€™ve called and asked what was up but I didnâ€™t want to seem needy because to be honest these were the first real friends Iâ€™ve made and I didnâ€™t want to mess things up. I feel like they mean more to me than I do to them. The next day he doesnâ€™t ever message back or call so I decided Iâ€™d just move on and try to make some better friends because I had always felt like I didnâ€™t fit in but this just confirmed it. Anyways today he messaged me and told me the same friends were coming over to his house to spend the night and if I wanted to come. I didnâ€™t respond and a few minutes later the other friends call me. I didnâ€™t pick up I just let it ring, I really thought these guys were my bros but I feel betrayed and kind of alone now. In a few years I probably will forget all about this and just chalk it up to high school drama but rn it still hurts a little. Anywho, should I just ignore any further messages and just move on and drop these â€œfriends?â€ I wish I could call them and say whatâ€™s up with him ghosting me when we were supposed to go hiking but Iâ€™m not a conflict person and Iâ€™m worried that he may just make a good excuse and Iâ€™ll just fall for it because I am kinda desperate. It took forever to find these guys who I thought were real friends. Iâ€™ve known them since 8th grade.
