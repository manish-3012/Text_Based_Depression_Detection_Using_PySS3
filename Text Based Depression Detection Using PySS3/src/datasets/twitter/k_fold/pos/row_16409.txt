My Fucked Up, Bipolar Life: Part 2 Well. Day two. 

Yesterday's Recap: I felt really good yesterday. Had breakfast with the only two people I really talk to about how I feel. It was nice. I struggled socially and wanted to breakdown the entire time. But thats ok. I made it through and I felt a lot better walking out of there than I did walking in.

Today: I didn't do much today, it was nice and relaxing. But honestly I feel really good today as well. I slept in, played some madden with the boys, went outside and had a competition with my brother on how many leaves we can catch falling from the tree. I won. Watched some TV, mostly nogalstic stuff and now im ready to go to bed. I kept myself distracted and that really helped me stay sane. Now tonight as I'm sitting here I feel a little restless and I can almost feel my crazy side want to come out. But, I'm ok and im gonna try to sleep before it keeps me up all night. I dont know what tommorow holds. School days really make my nights hard because so much happens and that leads to so much I can look back on and all the people I see. Its just nuts. But, I'm focused on tonight. And I guess we will see what happens tommorow. Night!
