Being a teenager is like a shitstorm of emotions and feelings So I wanted to vent. I feel like there is a lot of pressure on me as a teenager that wasnâ€™t there before and it is making me feel miserable, honestly. Thereâ€™s looks, I feel like I have to look at my best all the time, but especially in summer thereâ€™s the whole â€œdonâ€™t wear that or youâ€™ll get assaultedâ€ but also the â€œshow some skin itâ€™s not winterâ€. Thereâ€™s new insecurities, feelings youâ€™ve never felt before, expectations that weigh you down, fears of being assaulted, school stress and I could go on and on.
 I see my friends that are not doing well, and sometimes I feel helpless when I canâ€™t think of solutions. We do have a tight friend group though, and thats what helped me through a lot so I am incredibly thankful for that. 
But yea, ranting feels good.
