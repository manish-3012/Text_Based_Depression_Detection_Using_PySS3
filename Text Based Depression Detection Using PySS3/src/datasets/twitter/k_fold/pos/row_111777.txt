My laptop hates me I spent 5 years gathering enough money to finally buy myself a working gaming Laptop. When it came It was probably one of the happiest moments of my life. it was so slick, with red glowing key binds, and a beautiful display. But then after using it I started to notice something. actually i noticed it from the very beginning but I thought it was just my wifi. It cant run shit. I tried everything, from using a super good internet, to upgrading my graphics card. nothing. And im not saying it cant run games that were just released like Cyberpunk or something. nonono. It cant run shit from 5 years ago. the funniest thing is that on websites that check if your pc can run games, it says that mine can run the newest of the new games, but at the same time, it fucking cant. I don't want to come of as selfish or something, but I just wanted to rant about it. for the record its last years MSI gaming laptop so nothing fishy on the seller
