Beyblades are highly underrated Most people assume that they are just tops that you launch at each other until one slows down but there is so much more to it. I wasnâ€™t able to fully appreciate the ingeniousness Of beyblades until now. Every single part in a beyblade serves a different purpose and affects how a bey preforms. Not only that but you can also affect how a beyblade moves by launching it in different ways and the stadium you use also can have an effect on how a certain beyblade preforms. Plus you donâ€™t even need to battle them, they are just fun in general. You can race them around and try to launch on to a platform, shoot it through a hole, or ricochet them around corners. They are probably one of the best non electric toys and I donâ€™t see why they went out of style.
