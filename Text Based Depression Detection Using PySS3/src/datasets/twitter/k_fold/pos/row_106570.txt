I wanna make a TikTok, but I donâ€™t know if it is morally right. Please read, this is not about â€œTikTok bad, reddit goodâ€, it is about a fly.

I want to capture a fly and put it in a plastic syringe, push it almost to the end, block the end off with chewing gum, and then open it. 

This will create a zero-pressure experience for the fly, and eventually the flyâ€™s insides will stain the syringe.

Should I, or should I not?
