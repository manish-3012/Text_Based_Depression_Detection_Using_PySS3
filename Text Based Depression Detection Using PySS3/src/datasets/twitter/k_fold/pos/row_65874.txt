Quarantine is like refreshing a website over and over and getting different ads Itâ€™s so fucking repetitive. Wake up, play game, eat and sleep. Same shit but with slight differences like going for a walk or something. This is the worst time to be pubescent like Iâ€™m sad all the fucking time and the only time I have joy is hanging out with others like fuck off life. I hate being serious online but I have to vent somehow so fuck it.
