Question to Americans about politics What would you think if I told you that my country's government consists of a coalition between 18 different parties and 9 of them have 1 seat in parliament each? And it isn't 1 party that dominates the wgole coalition either, it's led by 3 different conservative parties fights eachother quite often. They're also supported by a few representatives from 3 more parties that are in the opposition who consistently votes against their own party.
