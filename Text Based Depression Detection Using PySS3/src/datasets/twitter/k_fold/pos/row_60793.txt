Writing about my dreams on reddit day 4 My dream last night was fairly short and uninteresting, but Iâ€™ll post it for you guys anyway

My family was living at this giant rock cliff with some parts that had water falling down. the rocks were arranged like steps and in between the steps there was giant holes of void. We were there with a bunch of fish and we just kind of hung out, then we left for somewhere else. Where went to was this kind of nature preserve next to a lake where there was many hippos. I dove in the water and there was a cave where I could stay so I went to sleep in there and then I woke up from the dream
