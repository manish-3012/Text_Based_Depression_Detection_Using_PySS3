Fuck summers. All my homies hate the summer. But honestly tho I have never been able to understand why people love summers as much as they do. Like, bruh, what the fuck is so appealing about sticky sweaty clothes and sticky sweaty hairs and mosquitoes and flies and busg and the blinding sunlight that rains upon you and sunburned skin.

Every other season is so much better.

Monsoon? Amazing! Rain! Smell of rain! Gloomy weather! Everything this Amazing!

Autum? Amazing! It's cold but not really tho. It's beautiful.

Winter? Amazing. Cold! Blankets! Hot chocky! Short days!

Spring? Well, not exactly the biggest fan of spring but it sure as hell better than summer.

Honestly, what the fuck is so appealing about summers?
