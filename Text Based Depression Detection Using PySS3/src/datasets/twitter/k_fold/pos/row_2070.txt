I donâ€™t get feminism Learning about Susan B Anthony in history class right now and feminism started out to get women the right to vote. A very important and basic right that was incredibly important to fight for. Now we have women getting mad at men for holding doors and shit and they call themselves feminists. These seem like very different issues wtf happened. Like why donâ€™t they let guys be nice when they are trying to be nice and use their feminism on something important like always ensuring equal pay.

I hope this isnâ€™t coming off as an incel in any way I just donâ€™t get why women actually have important issues to deal with and some of them decide to use their energy on nonsense and then give all feminists a bad name.
