LETS FUCKEN GOOOO So my older brother is going to basic training and wont be back until early January. Since hes going, he has to leave his car here with my parents and I. But we cant just leave it and not drive it or else it will mess up the car when he finally uses it for being cold for too long. My brother is very picky about who uses the car, and hes been teaching me how to drive in that car, so today he tells me that when he leaves next week, the car will be mine to use, and only mine, until he comes back. I'm so hyper, cause I just got my license and the car is so nice. It's a 2020 white Toyota Corolla. The only problem is if he messes up on payments or anything, my parents said I'll be the one paying for it, since I just got a well paying job. So hopefully he stays on top of that. Either way, I'm so fucken hyped
