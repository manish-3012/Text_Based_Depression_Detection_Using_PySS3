happy rant but like a second time (obligatory trigger warning - happy couple) dude sometimes iâ€™m texting this girl iâ€™m talking to and as i send something the read thing will pop up and iâ€™ll send something else (weâ€™re pretty â€œwetâ€ texters) and it goes to delivered and thatâ€™s so adorable bc that means i know she was reading back through our texts and i know sheâ€™s definitely slightly embarrassed about it and sitting there with a soft blush. such a cute babygirl dudes i love her this is gonna be such a pain to delete all my posts about her afterwards but like idk i guess iâ€™ll just like marry her or something like that hahaha thatâ€™s not that ridiculous right?
