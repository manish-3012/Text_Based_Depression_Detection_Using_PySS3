Anyone else ever lie about there interests when meeting someone new? Bruh whenever I meet someone for the first time I always agree with them on stuff cause I feel bad to disagree. Like even if I donâ€™t know something they bring up or donâ€™t know much about it Iâ€™ll be like yo Iâ€™ve heard of them there pretty cool.
