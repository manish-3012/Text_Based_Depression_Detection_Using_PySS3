Please help I don't know if my online friend is an internet troll or not, and my brain is incapable of recognizing that My online friend hasn't sent a message in three weeks now, and I'm not sure if I should send a message asking if he still wants to continue chatting or that he's just a troll and I'm doing exactly what he wants by doing that
