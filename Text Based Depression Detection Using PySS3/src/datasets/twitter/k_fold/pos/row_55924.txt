Someone pulled a gun on me. Let me start by saying Iâ€™m okay and no shots were fired. I was driving home from work, and someone in dark clothing with a red bandana was about a foot into the road. I slowed down and steered to give him room, but he backed out of the road and pulled a gun on me. I think he thought I was trying to hit him or slow down for a drive by.

Really I feel sorry for him if he is in a gang. I feel sorry that he has to constantly be in fear of that sort of thing.
