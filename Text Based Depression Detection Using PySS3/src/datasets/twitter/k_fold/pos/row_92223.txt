Stop glorifying mental illnesses Please.
I see so many people on social media (here and other ones too) making it a beauty accessory.
Being mentally ill is not fun. 
It doesnt make u "aLt"( btw indie kids are not alternative sorrynotsorry) 
Dying your hair is not having a mental breakdown.
And ik people here are gonna say "uh thats only tiktok kids cringe that do that" but no !
A lot of people here do that too, so yeah being sad one day doesnt make u depressed and being stressed doesnt mean u have anxiety.
Being organized is not OCD  blah blah i could go on for hours.
All that to resume : dont say you have a mental illness if youre not diagnosed.

As a cutter, i find it extremely annoying to hear my friends say theyâ€™re "so depressed" and shit like that.
Im not invalidating their mental health but that stuff is not a joke. 

Oh also unrelated but dont make comments about selfharm scars pretty please !
Some of my friends JOKE about them like "oh they cut hahaha theyre depressed" when seeing my scars.
I lie and say its my cat but u have no clue how painful that is. 
(Also i am currently getting medical help so dont worry for me on that point)


Anyways this rant probably makes absolutely no sense and people are probably gonna downvote or something but well just had to share whats on my mind.
