Message to the Ignorant I have seen some posts here saying that 'no matter who you support, you can still stay friends'. And, that is simply not true for the US 2020 elections. This can apply to other things such as your music taste, hobbies, etc. but not your political support of Republican or Democrat candidate this year. You cannot possibly support Trump whilst having friends who are part of the LGBTQ+ community, are not Christian (Protestant), are not white, and are not men. By voting for Trump you are voting against them and basically hurting them. I know lots of you might be angry at this, but if you have a friend who is not white, cis, hetero, and protestant, and you voted for Trump, you hurt them. You shouldn't separate this from relationship. Not something as serious as this. Thank you for reading.
