If I want to eat, I would yes, i know my parents care for me but sometimes they get me a full bowl of noodles at 9 am without checking with me first and that is very filling and too early for me to eat

we have other smaller snacks like donuts, i would prefer to eat those instead but they say eating that big bowl of noodles is better as it's supposedly "brunch" time right nos
