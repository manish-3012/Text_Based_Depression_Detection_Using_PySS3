I have a blessing and a curse: I don't like coffee or alcohol I don't relate to coffee memes and I don't get to enjoy alcohol like most people. I have yet to try a kind of alcohol that I would genuinely like. There's one kind I want to try but idk if I'll even like it. I've tried one kind of coffee I liked over 9 years ago and it didn't even taste like coffee because it was a latte I think. Idk if this counts as NSFW but I'm marking this post as that just in case.
