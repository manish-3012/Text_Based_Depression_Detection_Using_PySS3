Me and the boys went to see the Croods 2 in theaters lmao It was probably a waste of $20 but it was a good waste of $20. We had many a great laughs. I couldn't tell if any of the actually funny bits in the movie were meant to be funny tho lmao! Anyways, I confirmed the theory that the boys together have 1 collective brain cell. Great night! 10/10 would recommend. Gonna do it again with Boss Baby 2.
