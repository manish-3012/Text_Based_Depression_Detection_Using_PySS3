I need some help I've fallen in love with a girl that I've known for about 2 or so years. We have become great friends and as a guy I'm bound to fall for someone eventually right? Well I fell for her and I was thinking about telling her. The only reason I havent is because I dont want to lose the great friendship we have if things go wrong. I'm basically asking for advice on whether or not I should tell her how I feel or not.
