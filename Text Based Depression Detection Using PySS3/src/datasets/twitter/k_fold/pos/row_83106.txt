The other day, while I was sleeping, my online friend said he was tired of Reddit. Then, he said heâ€™ll always love me and deleted it so this is a text for him. 

   So, Diego, I know you wonâ€™t read this but I just wanted to say some last words before I force myself to forget you. 
   I remember when we started talking and we realized you were the male version of me, because we liked the same things. Then, we stayed all night long talking about theories. Sometimes, when Iâ€™m alone in my room, I miss you sending some rap song lyrics to me, I miss the â€œf$&amp;@ youâ€ and the â€œthis was legally a joke, I love youâ€. I miss sharing secrets with you, I miss the ST$U and me asking you what was the meaning of st$u because Iâ€™m not American, I miss the â€œIâ€™m gonna beat her up because she hurt your feelingsâ€ and the â€œIM FLYING TO BRAZILâ€. I miss YOU. 
   Diego Martinez, I just wanted you to know that I freaking love you, I always did tbh, and Iâ€™ll never forget you.
Take care of your online friends guys, they are worth it :)
