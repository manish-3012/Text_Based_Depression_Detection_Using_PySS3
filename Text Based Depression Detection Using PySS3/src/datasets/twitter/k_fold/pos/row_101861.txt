People these days say the political correctness has gone too far but... Remember when it was "political incorrect" to be openly gay, or vote as a woman. 
Don't get me wrong, I fermly believe that political correctness is a disease in our society but there is nothing special about our generation.
Scenes the beginning, people have been trying to silence others and being told what they can and can't say so it doesn't offend and opposes there ideologies.
