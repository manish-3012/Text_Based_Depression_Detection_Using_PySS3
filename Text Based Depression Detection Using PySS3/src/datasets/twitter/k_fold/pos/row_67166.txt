Help with love? So there's this girl in my class that I like but the thing is, I only know her in class. We've talked before for projects and I've dm'ed her on instagram but that's about it. I think she's funny, kind, and amazing but I don't know if I should tell her. Is she out of my league here? Also, I'm in my last year of high school. I don't know if I'll encounter her again after that.
