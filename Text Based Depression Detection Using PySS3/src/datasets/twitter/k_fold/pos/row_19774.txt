Snap glitch? or did I do something wrong ðŸ’€ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m talking to this girl and I was on delivered for like 17 hours so I clicked on her profile to see when she was last active and I accidentally clicked on our chat. I then exited out and it said that she opened my snap like 2s ago.... what do you think happened? I think the chances of me clicking on her profile and her opening my snap at the same time are really low so was snap glitching or what do you think happened? 

Merry Christmas btw
