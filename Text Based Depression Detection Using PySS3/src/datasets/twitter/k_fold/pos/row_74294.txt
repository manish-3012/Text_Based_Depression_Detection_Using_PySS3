Interesting fact as a someone from New Jersey So thereâ€™s only two states that allow gambling, which is Nevada and New Jersey. So as a result I get about half my ads related to gambling applications like â€œGolden Nugget Casinoâ€ and â€œThe Hill Sports Bettingâ€ even though Iâ€™m 14 and canâ€™t even go to these places without being fined. So I never see these â€œshitty game adsâ€ and I get these ones that have zero purpose to me. They trying to get me to impulsively gamble?
