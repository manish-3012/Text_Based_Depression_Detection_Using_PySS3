Should I show my face on the internet? Iâ€™m thinking of starting a YouTube channel for fun but now Iâ€™m questioning whether or not I want to do that. The style of videos I want to do requires me showing my face. I donâ€™t want to do the kind where Iâ€™m a talking picture. 

My thought process was this: 
- Pros: I have a fun YouTube channel
- Cons: I may potentially have a hard time getting employed somewhere in the future 

My channel isnâ€™t going to have my real name, and is probably just gonna be some really unpopular channel with barely any subs and basically unknown. Even if my channel does blow up, thatâ€™s great, Iâ€™m famous or whatever. But what if itâ€™s not in a good way? What if Iâ€™m such an unlikable person that I do something so bad that I, connected to my real face, become controversial? 

Does â€œinternet fameâ€ actually mean anything in the real world? Does everyone recognize PewDiePie, the most famous youtuber, when he goes to the grocery store? Or even the most hated and controversial people like Onision? What if he applies for a job somewhere? What is the likeliness that anyone will actually recognize him? 

Jenna Marbles said she had to delete her original channel because it was ruining her momâ€™s job applications when the employers searched her name. Then Jenna got a new channel and replaced her irl last name to her dogâ€™s name, â€œMarblesâ€ and everything was solved? Is that how easy that is? 


TL;DR: I want to show my face (but not my name) on a YouTube channel but Iâ€™m worried that it might ruin my reputation. Is that a concern I should be having?
