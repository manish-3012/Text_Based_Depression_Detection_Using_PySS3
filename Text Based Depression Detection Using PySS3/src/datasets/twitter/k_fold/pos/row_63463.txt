Keeping children's "innocence" Tell me your thoughts about telling children about where babies really come from. Tell me what you would do

My thoughts are, considering that sex is something biological and not to be ashamed of, or something that should be hidden.

Plants, fungi, bacteria, viruses, animals... all reproduce in some way. Internal or external, asexually, or sexually. So... I'd teach them the truth. The actual biology. Telling the truth doesn't take away their "innocence", it only makes us innocent of possible miscomprehensions on the future. Things that if not taught, could lead to STDs, birth, between others.

I'd do this to protect them.

Wbu? What do ya think?
