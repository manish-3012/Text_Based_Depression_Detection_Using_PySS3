Guys, my dad found out that I use Reddit pretty frequently. He doesnâ€™t know about my account yet, but heâ€™s a network engineer, so heâ€™ll find out eventually. He blocked Reddit on the WiFi at home, so Iâ€™m not going to be on here for a while. Since my dad is going through my phoneâ€™s Internet usage with a fine-tooth comb, it wonâ€™t take him long to find my account. When he does, Iâ€™ll be done for. So this is goodbye. At least, for a while. He wonâ€™t unblock Reddit, but Iâ€™m going to try to move out, so Iâ€™ll update all of you as soon as I get regular access to Reddit back. 

Btw Iâ€™m at work on break at the moment. Thatâ€™s why I can use Reddit for now.
