iâ€™m a fucking idiot i made an online friend over two years ago. thatâ€™s the longest anyone has ever stuck around. this year i had finally made some what felt like genuine irl friends, but they all ghosted me during quarantine. anyway this year i got really depressed and ghosted him for a little while, but then i told him why and we started talking again. then last week i did it for a week or so again. i messaged him but now he hasnâ€™t talked to me in a month. itâ€™s my fault. why am i like this? why am i such a worthless piece of shit? i have no one now and can only blame myself. i canâ€™t get anyone to stay and when i do i fuck it up.
