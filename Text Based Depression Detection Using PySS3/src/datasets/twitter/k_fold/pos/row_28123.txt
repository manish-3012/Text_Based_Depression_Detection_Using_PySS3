Iâ€™m a terrible boyfriend Iâ€™ve been trying to help my girlfriend with her depression and anxiety. I accidentally made her uncomfortable today while trying to help her and I think I might need to stop trying to help her. She says she is fine but I donâ€™t really believe it. And I fucking suck at holding her hand. I canâ€™t even apologize right. Iâ€™m really trying to help her with her problems but I think she doesnâ€™t like that I am. I might try to break up with her to see if that makes her happier that Iâ€™m not trying to bother her about her problems. I just donâ€™t know what to do for her
