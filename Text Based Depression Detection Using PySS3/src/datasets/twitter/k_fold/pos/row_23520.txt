How Australia lost a war to emus So emus ate Australian crops costing them money and they didnâ€™t like that. So there plan was to kill 20k emus. They killed 984 this was because emus where fast so they couldnâ€™t hit them. The amount of money they spent on this was more than what it cost them for the emus to just steal crops. This is why they quit and technically lost a war to fucking emus. EMUS CANT EVEN FLY.
