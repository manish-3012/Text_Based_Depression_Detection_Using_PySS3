Ok I just wanna clear something up I see a lot of people talking about how it's stupid how colleges give football players (along with other athletes) scholarships to go to their school, while a not giving enough scholarships to academically gifted students scholarships, so I'm gonna weigh in as a high school football player. 
 only 7% of high school players go to play varsity in college, only 2% at a d1 school, so its not like colleges are giving them out free, while 12% of high school students get academic scholarships, so its not like a disproportionate amount of athletes get scholarships.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
