Twice! It happened twice now! I just got off my bus that took me to a different school that I never seen and didn't know the area so I was stuck wandering around like a dumbass until someone finally came and helped me call someone to come pick me up. Turns out, I'm the other dam side of the city. From here on out, I'm walking home.
