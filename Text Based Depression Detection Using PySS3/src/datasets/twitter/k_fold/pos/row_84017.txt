my mom: oH yOu JuSt NeEd To GeT oFf ThAt GaMe SyStEm BeFoRe 9 PM


like i am literally begging you to let me see someone about this for fucks sakes woman not everything is because of my phone or game system or whatever. (i spent 7 hours on minecraft yesterday because it was a friend of mine who i haven't seen in a while, i don't normally play that long anyway) 


literally i cannot get out of bed in the morning, i've slept through most of my classes, i barely leave my room if i even leave my bed, i'm too tired to clean or anything so i just have dishes and garbage everywhere, i don't give a shit if i get kicked out of school or something for not doing the work because i'm too fucking exhausted to care anymore. but ah yes, the phone and ps4 is the problem. for sure.




she always puts on a facade for other parents/teachers where she seems to care so much about mental health and shit. when it comes to my step siblings its always "oh he has add, you have to take your time with him, don't overwhelm him" or "oh she has anxiety that's why she does that"while she just entirely disregards what i probably have, and also my severe adhd that is unmedicated despite me asking to go on meds. i don't get told instructions in a way that makes sense in my brain like my step brother does. i just get called a lazy piece of shit who needs to get their act together and get good grades or else they're going to be a failure. i'm tired of it.
