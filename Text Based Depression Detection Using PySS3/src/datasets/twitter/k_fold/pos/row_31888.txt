Do you guys ever convince yourself u dont like someone and then u see them and u feel like a literal child all over again? So i felt weirdly mature today and like im ready to start preparing to be an adult in a year and a half or so. I thought about my crush again and was like â€˜why did i ever like him anyway, iâ€™ve never really talked to him or anything and its such a childish thing to like someone like thisâ€™. So, in that instance i convinced myself i didnt like him.

Not kidding half a second later he walks past me and i almost spit out my water. Heâ€™s so cute â˜¹ï¸ WHO GAVE HIM PERMISSION TO BE SO CUTE. He was like wearing his scarf around his mouth and stuff :(((( And then that maturity instantly vanished and i felt like a hopeless teenage girl again
