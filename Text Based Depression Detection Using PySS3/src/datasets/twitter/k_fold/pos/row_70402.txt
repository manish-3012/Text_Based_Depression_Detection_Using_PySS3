damn my mental state really do be collapsing i knew getting perfect scores in high school was gonna be hard and i knew i had to get rid of all my hobbies and free time but even giving all of my free time away isn't enough to keep the grades perfect. doing school work until 9 pm every day is really beginning to affect me.

my grades are unbelievable but man do i feel hollow.
