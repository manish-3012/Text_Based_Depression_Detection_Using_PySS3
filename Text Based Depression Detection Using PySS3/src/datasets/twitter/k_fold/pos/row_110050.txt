update on the burnt toast someone pointed out that this is a sign of a stroke, i got worried and went to tell my parents, they apparently smell it as well. we all went downstairs but to no avail, no toaster burning or anything. then we went upstairs to go ask our sister if SHE smelt it, but she was infact the cause of the smell. the hair dryer was fucked up and making weird smells :(
