Flirt or wait? Im lonely af in my class. I dont even have the confidence to talk to a person that i dont know. Im like one of the best looking guy in my school but my appearance isn't just enough for them to like me, they want me to be confident first but for godsake its frikking hard! It would take me years to be confident. So do i just have to wait until some girl talks to me like she wants to be friends or something? Like accept me of who i truly am. I know its impossible because 80% of the girls in my school are confident af and they usually have boyfriends that are confident too and muscular, while me being the exact opposite. My life really sucks man!
