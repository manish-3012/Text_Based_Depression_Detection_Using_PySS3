A Private school near me makes it a pain to get to my home Ok so I live near a private school (wich I donâ€™t go to) wich at around the same time as when I get home they dismiss and make a line of cars down my street so almost every time Iâ€™m going home it is just a pain. We already tried contacting the school to get them to move the car line awhile ago but they donâ€™t care man private schools suck.
