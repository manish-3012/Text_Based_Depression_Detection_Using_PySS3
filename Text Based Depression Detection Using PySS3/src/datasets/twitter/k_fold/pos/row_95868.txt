If you are a (I)GCSE or A-levels student and want to find others to study with  

I know studying alone can be quite difficult, so that's why my friends and I decided to create a discord server.

At the moment, we are a small server with 350+ members, but we have a loving community that will welcome anyone with open arms, filled with many smart individuals who can help you with any of your questions. We also have a large ever-growing amount of resources, ranging from resources from O-levels to A-levels. Though our main focus isn't only studying, we plan many events ranging from playing Minecraft together to just playing a little skribble and have a movie theater where we watch movies together.

So if you need some motivation to study or find it more efficient to study with others, this is the place for you.

If you want to join, comment below, and I will dm you the link.
