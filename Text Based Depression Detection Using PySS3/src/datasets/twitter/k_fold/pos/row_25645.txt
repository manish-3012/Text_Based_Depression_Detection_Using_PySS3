Sasha Sloan is like Billie Eilish except not for cringey 16 year old "depressed" girls She's alot more realistic in her music and honestly just seems deeper and more real. I'm so glad I discovered this artist she's super underrated go check her out. That wasn't a suggestion it was an order. ***Go check her out***
