Friends are overrated For the past 3 years I've been slowly changing myself to be a more likeable person to my toxic friend (who introduced me to even more toxic friends).A couple days ago we had a huge argument so I stopped talking to everyone. During that time I realized how happy I was. I started doing things that I liked again. I felt like myself for the first time in 3 years. 


So yesterday I came back to our group chat and find out everyone has been lying to this girl we met on xbox a while saying I liked her and other weird shit. So I get pissed and they get mad at me because it was "just a joke". I also find out they made a secret group chat to plot on me. So I just say fuck them and I leave it alone.

Finally today after school they come to me spouting bullshit about me sending all of them pictures of explicit imagery( I would say it but idk how to use NSFW flair) so they start insulting me and stuff. They also said I sent it to them on someone else's acc. I explain that I never had the acc but they dont believe me. So I've blocked most of them (except my one supportive friend).


Tldr: I get accused of sending weird pictures to my friends because I got into an argument with them a couple days before.
