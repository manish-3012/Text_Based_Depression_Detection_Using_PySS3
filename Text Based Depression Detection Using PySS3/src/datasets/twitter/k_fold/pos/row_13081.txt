I made a new friend! Some old friends (from middle school) invited me to a discord chat, and there was someone on the call I did not recognize. Turns out, we became great friends and are both JoJoâ€™s Bizarre Adventure fans. Just wanted to say, the friends of your friends sometimes turn out to become YOUR friends.
