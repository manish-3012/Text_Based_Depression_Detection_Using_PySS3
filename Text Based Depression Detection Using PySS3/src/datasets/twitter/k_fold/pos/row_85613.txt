Pronouns and Sexuality. I was born a cis female, but recently I've started to address myself as they/them. I've been trying to tell people I know about my new pronouns, such as my friends and relatives. Some of them respect my pronouns, while others, such as my asian parents, have fucking YELLED at me. For being a they/them. My mother also said something along the lines of-

"God created you as a female, if you neglect that you're betraying God, that's a sin so you will go to Hell."

So my parents are STILL referring to me as she/her. I don't want to betray God, because I'm Christian, but I just want people to respect me and refer to me as what I want to be referred as to.

I've also recently came out of the closet as a bisexual with a huge female lean. I didn't want to tell my parents, because I knew they were homophobic Christians. They found out anyway, though, because I said "I love you" to my girlfriend over the phone. I'm now not allowed to make calls or texts. I really don't know what to do, I just want my parents to accept me.
