Bye bye So I'm 14 and my grades have dropped drastically due to online school with me not being able to focus on the subjects, instead I play video games or lurk Reddit. So I'm going to do the logical thing and delete my account and uninstall my games. It was fun while it lasted but everything has an end. If anyone sees this have a good day and strive to succeed. Ciao
