Star wars version of uber eats?? So on the death star right. Theres a LOT of people there, all of whom need to eat regularly. I imagine they have a food supply but what if it runs out? They cant exactly park the death star out front of a grocery store, nor can they take it through drive thru. So do they send out ships to that for them? What if they got blown uo by the rebels and ran out of those ships? 

They could send out spare tie fighters but they dont look like they could carry much food so they would have to take tons of trips, using up a lot of fuel and i imagine space fuel isnt cheap. So would they have to use some kind of space uber eats?? Imagine being an intergalactic uber eats pilot and you gotta deliver HEAPS of food to the death star, enough food for the whole population that has to last god knows how long and when you arrive you got darth vader just waiting there with his credit card or something.

Thank you for reading if you did. Plz leave a comment below on your thoughts?
