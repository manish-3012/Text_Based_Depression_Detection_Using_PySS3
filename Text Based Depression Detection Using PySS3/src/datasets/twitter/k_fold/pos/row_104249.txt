I might die soon of my constant problems i have constant headache, stress, panic attacks and my heart beats faster than usual. My headache is too much too handle and every time I move when i have headache, my head hurts even worst. And my family doesn't want to pay attention to me very often. An example of that was when i was 4 i went to IKEA to buy something. There was a kid section and i wanted to go to there. I asked my dad and mom if i can go. And they said yes. I went to there for 10 seconds and they were gone. It took 10 minute to find me, and instead of them saying "we were so scared to lose you" , they said "come here''. I hope that in the future it will be better. If you have the same problems like me, feel free to dm me,
