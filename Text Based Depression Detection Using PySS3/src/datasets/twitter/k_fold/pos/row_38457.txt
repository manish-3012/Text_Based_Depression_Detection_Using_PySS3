So thereâ€™s this girl in my class I like her by her looks and how I see her react sometimes, but i never talked to her really only a little during some class projects. I would really like to talk to her cause weâ€™re in 9th grade so this is last year I can do something. She doesnâ€™t really use social media, only I know of is instagram but im not sure if she really uses it cause she never posted anything there. She also isnâ€™t too popular so that gives me more chances. 

Anybody got any advice on how to start talking to her?
