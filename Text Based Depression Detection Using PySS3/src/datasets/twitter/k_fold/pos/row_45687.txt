I actually have the coolest teacher in the world So, my German teacher has told us on Tuesday (when we met him) that he loves gaming. In fact, he started playing CS back in 1999 and he still plays it which is fckin' epic.   


And now he just invited our entire class to play CS:GO with him, what a guy.
