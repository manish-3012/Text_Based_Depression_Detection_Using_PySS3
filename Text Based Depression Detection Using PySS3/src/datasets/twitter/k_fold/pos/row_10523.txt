I fucking hate this house Slight TW on this for PTSD Mention

I fucking hate this house so much. All my parents ever do is make me feel like shit for shit thatâ€™s out of my control (i.e my tics and potentially ADD), deter me from trying to dress the way I want, and yell at me to the point of literal breakdowns. And my brother guilt trips me every time I try and be my own goddamn person and make my own decisions that donâ€™t involve my parents. The only person in this house is my dog and my dad and brother yell at him for being a puppy. Not only that, but my dad fucking refuses to understand that there are things I CANNOT do because of my PTSD (i.e say certain words, talk about certain things), and when I came out to him as non-binary he said some sort of bullshit like â€œyOuâ€™Re aLwAyS gOnNa bE (deadname) aNd yOuâ€™Re aLwAyS gOnNa bE mY dAuGhTeRâ€ Like gee, thanks dad, you sack of human garbage.
Ok, Iâ€™m done, itâ€™s just they all my friends are offline and I need to get this off my chest, have a good day fellow teens, &lt;3
