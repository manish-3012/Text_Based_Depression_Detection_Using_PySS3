I know not a lot of you might care, but I created a theory while watching one of my favorite YouTube streamers. Persona 4 Golden's acronym is P4G, and the first vowel of "four" is O. So Persona 4 Golden is pog.  


Yeah, it was kinda stupid. I was just watching some streamer on YT who was playing P4G.
