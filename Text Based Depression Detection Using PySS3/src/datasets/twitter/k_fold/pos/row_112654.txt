Low-key if you say that you have self diagnosed depression, please shut up. Like, stop whining about how you "have depression" and that "you're doctor just doesn't know what he's talking about" because depression is a serious topic. As someone who has stopped a kid from jumping off a bridge, I can't stand it when people make up their depression for attention.
