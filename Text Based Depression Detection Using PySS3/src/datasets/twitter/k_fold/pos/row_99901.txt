A weird experience in public So I was going to get a haircut yesterday with my dad and my sister. As we were walking I felt really nervous for no reason. When we sat down to wait I felt my hands go really clammy and my heartbeat started going really fast. I felt nauseous and I didnâ€™t know why.

I went inside and the sick feeling went away and tears started pricking in my eyes. I was scared to get a haircut! Iâ€™ve done this millions of times and I donâ€™t know why it was so scary and I donâ€™t why it happened. This experience did happen when I was going to go to the dentist a week ago but I thought nothing of it. It was clammy hands, rushed heartbeat and feeling sick. 

I told my dad about it but he said nothing of it. I feel like itâ€™s social anxiety but Iâ€™ve never had this before. Iâ€™m quite introverted and donâ€™t really like social situations that much but Iâ€™ve always been able to handle it pretty well. 

Any advice?
