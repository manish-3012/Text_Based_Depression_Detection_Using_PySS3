Online school* is fucking stupid I'm sitting in a meeting right now and I am trying to participate in a discussion with the other half of the class that's at school right now and I just can't. Like the teacher isn't even looking at the meeting. Imo class discussions are the best possible use of meetings and yet they're pulled off so terribly I cant even participate. Live lectures and all that bullshit basically do nothing because I could read the slideshow and take notes and it would be about as effective.

Online courses on the other hand actually do it better. They have almost no mandatory meetings at all, and their content is laid out so much better. Can we just do that but with live discussions? Would be the best combination for online education in my opinion.
