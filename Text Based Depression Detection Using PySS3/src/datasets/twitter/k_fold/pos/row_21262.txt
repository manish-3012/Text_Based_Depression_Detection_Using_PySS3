I'm Gonna Start A Business I'm gonna start a business making furniture. Chairs, drawers, tables etc. My dad already has some of the tools and there's places nearby to get any tools I don't already have. It seems like a simple enough subject and there's woodworking in school so if I out in a couple extra hours, it would be enough to start a business off. 
 In the current climate that being of a pandemic, with people being stuck in their houses, they will come to notice their furniture more often and so people are more akin to buying furniture, at this moment there is more demand to a somewhat dry market with the nearest furniture store being atleast 20 minutes away from my town.
