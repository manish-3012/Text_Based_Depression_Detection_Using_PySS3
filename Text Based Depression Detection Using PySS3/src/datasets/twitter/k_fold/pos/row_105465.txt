So the other day my family had the best Uno game ever so my mom had played the blank card(allows you to make a rule) and she said she wanted us to say the colors in french, and she went on to say them, but not telling us the english counterparts. for yellow, she said the word in french, then added "like jondas", which basically started a religion among my siblings. Now, whenever we see something yellow, we just say jondas. and then a bit later, i was forced to draw 16 cards, meaning i had more than 20 cards, and i had only 1 green, and 5 special cards (skip, reverse, etc.). that was probably one of the best nights of my life
