Do you guys think about life on the toilet and think of random things in the shower? Or do you do the opposite? My girlfriend and I are having a heated debate over this. I think that toilet time is life time. And shower thoughts generally aren't part of your life. Please yell at my girlfriend, internet. Or, I guess, me, if I'm wrong.
