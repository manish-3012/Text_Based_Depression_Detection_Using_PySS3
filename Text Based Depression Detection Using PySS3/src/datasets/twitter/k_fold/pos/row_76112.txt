I almost died So I was riding in a golf cart while my neighbor who I will call  shaun, was riding in front of me in a gocart. I was following him up and down the streets of my little neighborhood safely and at night, the parents knew and were ok with it. We did no have any predetermined route so I had no idea where we were going.

So all of a sudden he turns, I was not expecting that so I turned very sharply. Since there were no seatbelts, I flew to the other side of the two seat open cab. There were no doors or windows do I almost flew out of the cart. We were still moving at around 12-19 mph (idk it didn't have a speedy thing) and it was pretty heavy. I was stoped by the arm things that were made out of metal. 

It hurt a lot and scared me a bit but I'm ok now. thanks for reading through my experience, have a good night. (Sorry for bad english)
