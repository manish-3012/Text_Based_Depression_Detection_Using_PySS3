I have decided this is the end. Honestly even after calling the helpline I'm still not better soo this is probably the last time anyone will see me this life was ok but I don't think I can keep going like this if I don't do it right now I'll have to rely on heroin and I don't really have a good source of it and some lives just aren't meant to last Soo say anything you want to say maybe it'll be the last thing I'll see.
