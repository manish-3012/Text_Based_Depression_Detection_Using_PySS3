Day 4 of posting things related to the International Waffles Day Waffle Day (Swedish: VÃ¥ffeldagen [ËˆvÉ”Ì‚fËÉ›lËŒdÉ‘ËÉ¡É›n]) is a tradition that is celebrated in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, on March 25, which is also the Feast of the Annunciation, upon which waffles are typically eaten. The shift from the religious celebration to Waffle Day occurred because the Swedish VÃ¥rfrudagen, meaning "Our Lady's Day" (the Feast of the Annunciation), sounds similar to VÃ¥ffeldagen ("waffle day") in faster speech, and so over time Swedes began calling it Waffle Day and celebrating by eating waffles.
