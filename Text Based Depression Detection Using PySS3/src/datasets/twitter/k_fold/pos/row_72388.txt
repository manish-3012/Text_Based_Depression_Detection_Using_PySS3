need some help ! So there are these people I met on PlayStation 7 months ago and they are very toxic people. They say the n word constantly as well as the f slur, make transphobic â€˜jokesâ€™ and say transphobic/homophobic/racist things everytime we play. They even said â€œN-Word Lives Matter.â€ Yesterday one of them even called me the f slur and I had enough of it. When I confronted the person who said it, they got incredibly defensive and said, and I quote â€œitâ€™s not our fault,
if we say slurs, you should say you are uncomfortable with it.â€ Clearly they are terrible scumbag people, but Iâ€™m trying to build up the courage to leave the group chat Iâ€™m in with them and block them. The thought of blocking them alone makes me nervous so I donâ€™t know what to do thanks.
