GUYS I FINALLY GET A BF Since we meet, I know it's the right for me. 
He is so cute when he is angry and mad, he says that usual things like "take me out of your basement" and "I don't even know who you are!" But sometimes he says that he hate me and all that false and childish stuff and then I have to use a lot of cloroformo. He is so sweet sleeping in the electric Chair &lt;3
