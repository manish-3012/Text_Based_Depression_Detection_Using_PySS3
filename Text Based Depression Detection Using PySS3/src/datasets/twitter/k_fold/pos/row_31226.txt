okay hear me out: being depressed and never leaving your bed is a good thing right so if you don't leave ur bed much you ain't using many of ur muscles and stuff right, so they aren't getting worn down much. that way, when you're old ur muscles haven't been used much and they're still kinda fresh so you can live to be old and still do stuff

well that's assuming the depression don't take you first but yanno, side benefits and that
