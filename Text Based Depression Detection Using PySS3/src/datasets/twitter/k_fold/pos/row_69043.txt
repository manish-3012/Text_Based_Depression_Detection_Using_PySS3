Yall ever just wanna go back to when you were in like elementary school or just me Like I deadass miss that shit so much life was so much easier then. My family got along, I wasn't failing school, I had a social life. And then there's a part of me where I wanna get all of my old discord friends in a server and just vibe, and talk about life. There's only 1 friend I still have on discord from 2018. There's just so much I wanna be able to relieve from when I was child.
