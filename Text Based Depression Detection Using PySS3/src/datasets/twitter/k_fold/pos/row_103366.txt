Oh shit i left something super embarrassing at my grandmas house So, I was staying at my Grandmaâ€™s house and i got super h0rny so I tried the old mattress-box spring trick. Well, that got pretty uncomfortable so i decided to get a latex glove and lotion it up. 

I got distracted for reasons, and now iâ€™m on the car ride home realizing i left it wedged in the bed. I kinda doubt she wonâ€™t notice unless she just doesnâ€™t go into my room at all. I donâ€™t know if sheâ€™ll actually know what it is but I doubt sheâ€™ll think itâ€™s anything good.

I could tell my mom i forgot something and ask her to turn around but weâ€™re already like 20 minutes away, and it just doesnâ€™t seem like a good idea.
