I remember some people say I'm to well spoken for my age and honestly I don't know why. I'm 13 not 7 I'm obviously going to be able to say things normally my age doesn't change that.

Age after 13 or 14 doesn't dictate how well spoken or "smart" you are nearly as much.

Of course below that the arguement makes more sense as a 8 year old will most definetly not be as smart as someone older than them.

Just my two cents on that sort of reply I sometimes receive.
