Today I asked my mom when my next check up was to see if I could get tested for ADHD She told me I shouldnâ€™t think like that and she thought I was gonna ask the doctor for pimple medication, now sheâ€™s made at me basically telling me I shouldnâ€™t ask the doctor anything about my mental health and only if my face looks ugly now Iâ€™m just crying while writing this.
