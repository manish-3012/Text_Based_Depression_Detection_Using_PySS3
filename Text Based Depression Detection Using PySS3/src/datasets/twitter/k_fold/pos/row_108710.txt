Daddy issues Can someone pleaseexplain this to me: Why? Why the actual fuck does it feel like my â€œDadâ€ is more like a distant uncle that doesnâ€™t really like me.

Like i have tried so many times to make him happy, but itâ€™s all in vain. Like i try so damn hard to please him but nothing, i can get a fucking A+ on a test and yet, nothing, and when i try to help him with stuff i never complimented for helping him, he just criticizes everything that i do. And when i do something that i am passionate about he doesnâ€™t even care at all. And when i try to tell him this he just gets so damn mad.

At this point i am just lost, i donâ€™t know what i expect from posting my problems on reddit, but i was just hoping maybe a few people may have some advice for me or may find themselves in a similar situation.

Sincerely: 14yr old boy currently crying in his room on the norwegian countryside
