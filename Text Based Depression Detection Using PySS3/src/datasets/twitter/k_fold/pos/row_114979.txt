Why is Easter Egg painting hard Tonight I painted three eggs, the first one I made was Mike Wazowski and it came out pretty decent so I figured Iâ€™d try another... and oh boy did it come out looking horrible... I donâ€™t paint or draw in my free time so I donâ€™t know why I thought attempting to paint an egg would be even better. :)
