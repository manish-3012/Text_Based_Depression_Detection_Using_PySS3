What I'm did that I'm most proud of in 2020 The thing that I did that I'm most proud of in 2020 is that I told my doctor I was cutting and having not-so-happy thoughts and now everyone including myself are trying to get me the help I need. So I can really say I survived 2020 and it be a major accomplishment.

So anyone else struggling just tell a trusted adult and you hopefully will get the right help. I'm proud of you for also surviving that dreadful year. Happy 2021!
