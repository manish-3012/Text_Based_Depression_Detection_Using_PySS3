I know this isnt a gun subreddit but... American guns are confusing as fuck. In world of guns, I spent a week studying the P2022, and got almost all the achievements and a shitton of xp. I was happy. And then i decided to blow it on the AMT Backup, and the technology in it... well, let's say it wasn't easy. I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE SPENT IT ON THE AK-47, DAMMIT!
