just say ok to your mom my mom was yelling at me for a very small thing i did. she kept calling me stupid and disrespectful (in spanish lol). i kept saying ok every ten seconds or so while i kept eye contact with her. she got uncomfortable as hell after a couple of seconds so she called me stupid one last time and went to her room. a small victory for me i guess
