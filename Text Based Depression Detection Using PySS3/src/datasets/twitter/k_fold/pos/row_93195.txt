What are the effects of being raised by boomers? I'm almost 15 and have spent most of my life being carelessly chucked around and babied by many different adults, all much much older than me and very strict and very technophobic. I had the internet on and off, and whenever I did get access, it was often restricted or monitored and I absolutely hated it.

I noticed that I had no friends (though that may have just been my autism), felt like an "old soul", and also developed an eating disorder (however that may have stemmed from being picked on for my weight when I was fat).
