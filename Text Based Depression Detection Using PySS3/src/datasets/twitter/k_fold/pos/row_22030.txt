Should I commit to the emo phase or nah Iâ€™ve never really been an emo kid, but Iâ€™m definitely kinda feeling it. I got to a private school so the aesthetic would be preppy emo. And I canâ€™t dye my hair so Iâ€™d be the shittiest emo. No no no... Iâ€™d be a true emo. Only fucking posers feel the need to overly express themselves to the fucking conformists.

*oh fuck itâ€™s already happening!*
