Women should not be part of the minority. Warning: unpopular opinion a head. I canâ€™t post in unpopular opinion so this is the next best thing. 
A lot of the problems that put them there in the first place are more or less fixed. Men have waaaaaaaaaay more problems than women. Of a man says he likes younger women, he is a pedo. If a man says he is not ready for sex, he is gay and a pussy. If a man is cheated on itâ€™s because he was not good enough. Bad male mental health is laughed at and in result, the male suicide rate is three times higher than womanâ€™s. The list goes on. Women are always made the victim and itâ€™s time it stops. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
