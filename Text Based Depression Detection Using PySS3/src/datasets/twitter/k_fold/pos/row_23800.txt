bruh i did not have a fun sleep so i went to sleep last night

and i started to dream

and in my dream all i was doing was fucking vomiting

it felt like an eternity, like i could actually feel the vomit irl leaving my body as if it happened in reality

it must have happened for at least an hour in my dream

also when i woke up there was a fuck ton of dribble next to my mouth ^(call it disgusting but it doesn't happen to me usually, and if it does it's a small patch - this was a whole fucking ocean of the shit)

and there was dribble in my mouth when i woke up too, i had to run to the sink to spit it all out

my stomach still feels really fucking weird and i'm kinda shaking so that kinda sucks

fuck dreams
