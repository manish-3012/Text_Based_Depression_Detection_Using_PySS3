Just one tip when you're learning to drive When you're done driving and are walking into the house, just go straight into your room to avoid talking about the whole drive. Otherwise they will expect you to remember the whole trip and exactly where you drove and they're probably gonna ask you what you think about the trip like 15 times over the course on half an hour.
