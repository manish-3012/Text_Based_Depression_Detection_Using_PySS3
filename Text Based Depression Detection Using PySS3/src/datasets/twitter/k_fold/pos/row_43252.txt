My only real takeaways from school: Your life is worthless compared to a number on a screen.

No matter how hard it gets, there's always room for it to get worse.

Life isn't supposed to be enjoyed.

Your work never pays off.

Happiness is a privilege.

Your own safety and mental health should never be a priority over work.
