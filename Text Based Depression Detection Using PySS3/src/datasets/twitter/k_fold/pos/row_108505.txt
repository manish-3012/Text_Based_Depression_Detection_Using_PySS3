I really fucked up myself So, i just fully understood that i had missed several chances to go out with good pretty girls. I've been studying in the same lyceum for several years and i was that one guy that was in touch with everyone in class and that's mostly the reason several girls were in love with me or they liked me. Two of them were special.

There is almost nothing to say about the first one. We were good friends and i missed all her hints of her liking me. On the last of our days studying together we met in group of our classmates and at the end of our conversation she told me that she liked me for some time. Thus i understood that i was such a naive kid in relationships. 

Our friendship with the second one, which lasted for one year, started with me unexpectedly sending her meme. And so in one year i started noticing that she gave me tips to go out. We discussed it by not saying things straight forward and we started dating.  She was pretty cool girl. That lasted ONE WEEK. I told her that i liked the other one (not really, i just couldn't sort out my feelings). And that fucked all our friendship. Soon later she started dating the guy, whom she began sitting at the class with. I soonly understood the hell i had done and regretted it for half a year. 

And recently the group of my closest, even best, friends started their life with alcohol and weed. Of course i was dragged along. Though i meet them to get drunk or use drugs not so often as they do (like 3-4 times a month), i feel like that's not my thing (but this feeling awakens, when i'm left with myself for a good amount of time) and i feel that i want to go higher to reach my ambitions. But i can see all the pain losing these friends and being left alone in front of my ambitions and all the hard obstacles they have. 

Also i can try combining going up and having fun w/ my friends, but i can't see the way to do it, because of one simple reason. I'm teenager and the bursting emotions inside of me can't leave me with cool head. 

I fucking hate this teenager's life, cuz' of all the emotional shit happening to me, but i sincerely love it, cuz' of freedom it has. 

Fuck. This. Shit
