I'm 13, gay, a furry, paranoid, could use some advice. Hey, I'm Derce, as stated, I'm gay and I'm a furry. I could use some advice.  
I'm constantly paranoid that someone finds I'm gay or a furry. I go into an internal panic mode sometimes when anyone says anything even remotely related to furries. I know my family would be supportive if they knew I was gay but I don't come out because it's gonna be just a little awkward and I don't see myself dating anytime soon. I honestly don't see myself dating ever because I'd have to tell someone I'm a furry since that's something that's important when you're dating someone.  
I talk to some friends online who are furries and obviously know I'm a furry. I'm just super scared about my family or friends finding out about me. 

I'm super scared about disappointing people around me and making them mad or sad because I'm gay and a furry. I'm also scared of hiding it all my life because that raises the risk of it being found. Any advice on hiding it or getting it out?
