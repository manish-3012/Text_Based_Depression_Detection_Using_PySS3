I made another song. And my irl friend screw off. I hope yall enjoy! 
I stand here staring,
At a very long road,
It's the only road I know,
And it's one I have to walk alone,

As I start to walk alone,
I start to see all my broken dreams,
And has I continue to walk,
I start to see future dreams to be broken,

And no matter how much I squint,
I can never see a end to this road,
And I have never seen a person cross,
I feel like i'm about to take a wrong turn,

Till I see the end,
I will walk alone,
I have never seen anyone,
And I doubt I ever will,

As the road goes on,
I feel my mind cracking,
As if its about to break,
And all I see is a lonely road,

I wish to see just one person,
One person to see walk down this road,
One person to help me to the end,
But I still have not seen anybody,

Now i'm starting to question,
Whether it's worth to continue this path,
This road has been filled with pain,
And not much light,

Now I feel myself broken,
Unable to go on,
I hope to see the end,
But this road is seemingly endless,

As it stands now,
The only path is forward,
So that's where I will continue to go,
I just wish to find someone at the end,
