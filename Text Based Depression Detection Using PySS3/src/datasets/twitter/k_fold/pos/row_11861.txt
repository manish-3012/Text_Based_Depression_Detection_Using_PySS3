I really need help like some plz Ok so this is probably gonna be long and lots of spelling mistakes but I fell comfortable here so like I am a guy but I'm more on the feminine side of guy. I just took a shower and idek like now I feel really sad and depressed as i sit o. the toilet. I am literally fully dressed just sitting on the toilet. I am really insecure about myself and I wanna shave my legs and shit and I wanna wear eye liner but I dont wanna get caught doing it. Bc my mom told me to not do makeup, or shave my legs. But I just want confidence, that's all. I just wanna go it but what if I get caught and get in trouble or something... I just wanna be me without being held back. But I'm being held back. Idk what to do and I need to know do I shave my legs and do eyeliner. I dont even really wanna live anymore tbh. I'm just ranting now if you are still reading ily
