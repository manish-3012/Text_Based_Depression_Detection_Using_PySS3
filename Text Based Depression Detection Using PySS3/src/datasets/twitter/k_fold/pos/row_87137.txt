The spongebob canon makes no sense So they are making a new Spongebob prequel series, but it has Sandy Squirrel. And as all of you Spongebob fans should know, Sandy was introduced as a new resident of Bikini Bottom in Season 1 Episode 3. So putting her in a prequel series makes no sense as Spongebob didn't know her! Put your theories on how this works out in the comments.
