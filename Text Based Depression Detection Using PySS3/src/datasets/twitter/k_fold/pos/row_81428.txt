How do I prove to someone that I care about them I know this may seem odd for this sub but Iâ€™m asking here because most of us are teens and probably have had the same problem.

My best friends mental health is horrible and Iâ€™m very afraid of loosing her and something that this makes her feel is that sheâ€™s not cared about by anyone and she always says Iâ€™m regards to this that actions speak louder than words but sadly I have no idea what to do. She means my entire life to me but I have no idea of how to show that Iâ€™ve told her more times than I can count and Iâ€™ve tried gifts and helping her or just being her friend or making sure Iâ€™m always there for her but this isnâ€™t the stuff that really shows that I care at all this is just normal stuff that everyone should do and it doesnâ€™t work so please if you have any idea please tell me.

Iâ€™m sorry if this post hurt or offended anyone itâ€™s just Iâ€™m desperate and want to make sure that she feels cared for.

Thank you in advance
