Is it me or is school becoming a little bit too political? So this year in school, our teachers had made us read a novel called All American Boys. Now, this novel was about a young boy named Rashad (who is black) being framed for stealing and then being beat up for the color of his skin, police brutality, blah blah blah. And this certainly could not just be some sort of coincidence considering what was currently happening around us. We watched a video of some white guy talking about â€œwhite privilegeâ€ and yaddi yaddi yadda. Now, is it me or has school just become a bit too political?
