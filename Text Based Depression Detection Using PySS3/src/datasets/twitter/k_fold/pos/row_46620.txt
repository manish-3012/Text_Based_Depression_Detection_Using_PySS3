I just hate being so alone for this long I know this year is probably making it worse, but Iâ€™m so tired of being lonely.

Iâ€™ve lived for almost 20 years and for all those years, no relationship, but plenty of crushes that never fell through. Thereâ€™s those stupid dating apps but no one wants anything serious anyway, and anyone who does I donâ€™t vibe with.

I just want to have fun experiences and memories I can share with someone, I want to grow with someone because I have barely had anyone in my life for a long time.

Iâ€™m also lonely friend wise, I overthink every interaction I have with people and doubt anyone ever likes me as a friend and actually wants to be around me. I feel like such a floater in life and I just want to have a close circle of friends and a good relationship 

Iâ€™ve been feeling so worthless lately and Iâ€™ve been trying to ignore it but the negative thoughts never escape. I know Iâ€™m pretty much a friendless loser that canâ€™t even get a guy to be interested in me genuinely.
