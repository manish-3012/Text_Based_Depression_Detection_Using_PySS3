Well hello fellow teens Today Iâ€™d like to talk about Americaâ€™s twisted views on whether corona is a â€œbig dealâ€ 

Iâ€™ve seen way too many twitter posts about how â€œiTs OnLy 1 PeRcEnT mOrTaLiTy ItS nO bIg DeAlâ€ well... thatâ€™s around 3,300,000 people who have died. But no big deal in all of it right?

Well how about this: if 1 percent isnâ€™t much the I guess 9/11 isnâ€™t a big deal cuz only 0.0001 percent of the population at the time lost their lives. But no because that â€œthreatened their right to be Americanâ€. COVID is very much doing much more and much faster all over the world. Despite the fact that 1% of people die most people still suffer other effects after recovering such as severe heart and lung damage as well as it inhibiting your cognitive functions and causing mood swings

Thank you for coming to my ted talk
