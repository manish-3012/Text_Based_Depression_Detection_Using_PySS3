Iâ€™m being sexually harassed by my sister. lately my sister has been doing things to me. Let me give a better explanation with some examples of the things shes been doing to me.

everytime itâ€™s just me and her in the room she would run up here and start twerking trying to get my attention, the only way I get her to go away is if I scream at her really loud or try to push her away. she never does this in front of our parents and acts all innocent when theyâ€™re around. she will also speak in a tone thatâ€™s considered â€™sluttyâ€™ basically what Iâ€™m trying to say, is she will try to get my attention by doing sexual things. Iâ€™ve had incidents where Iâ€™ve been on the couch and sheâ€˜d sneak up behind the couch and jump on my crouch and try to get her ass near my face.

ive tried talking to my parents about this but they just wonâ€™t listen, she gets away with everything because sheâ€™s the favourite child
