Why do people keep saying 2020 is the worst year and everything will go back to normal after? 2020 is just a number,it doesnt mean anything and if shit keeps happening,month after month,what makes them think that the change of time will stop this? Well that is if we even survive 2020(cough cough r/5september2020 ) Anyway,mark my words,things are gonna keep happening in 2021,2022,and so on,i dont usually go on rants like this,but i just had to get this out of me.
