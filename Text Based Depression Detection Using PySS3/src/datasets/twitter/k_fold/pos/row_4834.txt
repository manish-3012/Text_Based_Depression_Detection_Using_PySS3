My nana is a big fucking bigot So basically I'm with my papa and nana for the week and political stuff came up and one dude from the campground brought up the fact that signs in Miami are in English and Spanish and I kid you fucking not said "this is AMERICA speak English" . Like yes the main language is English but Spanish is #2. And after that that my nana and the dude brought up how apparently "illegal" immigrants are getting American social security numbers and welfare and all of this other stuff. And then my nana said that the immigrants should work to stay in America without them having social security numbers when you literally need a fucking social security number to get a fucking job.


And the weird thing is my other grandma is Christian and more accepting of immigrants, lgbtq+ (not including pedos), and African Americans
