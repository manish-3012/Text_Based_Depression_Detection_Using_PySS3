What the fuck are some people on?! I had a guy at school (mine's just opened) come up to me today and say that he had seen me go into the bathroom with a pad, and literally ask me to, and I'm quoting- "turn my period off". Like wtf! 1) why the fuck would you come up to me and say that, 2) what does it matter to you, asshole, and 3) I CANT TURN MY FUCKING PERIOD OFF! Jesus!
