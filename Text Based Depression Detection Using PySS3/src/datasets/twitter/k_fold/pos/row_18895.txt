Aight, so I don't like motivational speakers. I don't know why tho. Jk I know exactly why. The thing with motivational speakers is that, they come off too, I guess, pretentious to me. They act and talk like they know everything about everything and yet they don't know shit just like the rest of us. And all their motivational talks and their self help books can all, at the end of the day, be boiled down to "You can do this. You have the power inside you to achieve anything you can dream of." And Idk I just don't like that sort of thinking. Yes, it is good if you pursue and achieve whatever it was you wanted to but, when a motivational speaker says it it doesn't come off as genuine.

Like, there's no whay you know about the internal struggles of everyone who reads your books and listens to you. You're just pretending you do. 

And then there's also this phrase "You can do it." That I just hate. Like it puts so much pressure on you to succeed. And if you don't, you just feel like absolute shit. Something like "I believe in you" is so much better because it says "You can succeed but even if you don't, that's alright." 

And just to make it clear, no hate to anyone who relys on self help books. If they help you, they help you and there's nothing wrong with that. It's just that I don't like them.

No one asked for this little rant but I wrote it anyway. And if you read it, thanks :)
