How do you just give up? Like how do you stop thinking about someone when they haven't ever actually rejected you?

I haven't talked to her for like six months cause she doesnt have her own computer or phone, and she probably just doesn't want to go through the trouble of asking to use her mom's phone so she hasn't been on in months.

I just want a chance, why dont i get that? Why don't i get to have the chance for her to just say to my face that she doesnt like me and be done with it.

Instead im constantly sitting here hanging on for no reason wondering "what if" and "woukd she have said yes if i asked before covid forced us apart"

Its so fricking annoying
