My parents think I have problems with my nervous system or shit like that Since I was little I would constantly squint my face and flap my hands around and I still do it 

And when I was little my parents didn't even care about it, but now they do, like why now?

I still flap my hands around and squint (or something like that) my face and I would put my hands on my nose and shake them up and down (kinda like starting a fire with a stick, you put your hands around and spin it, this movement) recently I started doing the same thing but my palms touch my eyes. Its mostly when I'm excited (sometimes I do it at random and i can't control it)
