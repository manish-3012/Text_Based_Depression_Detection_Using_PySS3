If a girl doesn't like you, she should tell you So here is a little backstory. I have been texting this girl since almost the start of the panademic. She is my classmate. I had a crush on her for half a year now. She always texted me back, and we had some great conversations. I also took her to get a coffee once before the start of the summer. I felt like I may have a chance. She also dropped me some hints I think, but you never know....  
Yesterday I was at my friends house with the bois, and we were just hanging out. Two of them downloaded the app Yubo. It's a dating app for teens. They been using the app for 30 mins. I just finished a game of Beat Saber and one of them goes: "Okay bro come here now look at this"  
I sat next to him and looked at the phone. It was her. I was like "yeah, fuck me...."  


I was thinking about it over the night, and I feel betrayed. To be honest, I kinda felt that she doesn't like me back. But she still like acted she was interested but never said anything that would have made me sure about myself.   
But still, I think if a girl doesn't like you back, she should just tell you. But not in an agressive way, like "ew no what the fuck you thinking". Just to let the person know that she's not into him or something....  


Anyways I just wanted to post this here cause I'm really down because of this. Feels like shit
