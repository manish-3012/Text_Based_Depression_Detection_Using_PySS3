I went on a date with my crush but... Ok so we were texting almost everyday so I asked her out and she said yes. We went on few dates but nothing besides talking happened. When I was texting with her she said that she needs time. Since then whenewer I text her she replies with only one word. I asked if she's still interested, she said yes. I asked if everything is okay, she said yes. Like bruhh what? It's been a month from the last date and she never has time to go on date (here we now have 1 week holiday). 

What do you guys think?
Did I do something wrong?


Sorry for english, 3rd language
