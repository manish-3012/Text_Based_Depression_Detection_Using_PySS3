Hey [r/teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/). I have come across this subreddit that makes fun of us for who we are ... Redditors.

The sub name is [r/averageredditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/averageredditor/)  .  Please all gather and downvote all posts on that sub, that way we  can stop them forever and keep Reddit awesome for all with no  cyberbullying.

Stay strong Reddit army.
