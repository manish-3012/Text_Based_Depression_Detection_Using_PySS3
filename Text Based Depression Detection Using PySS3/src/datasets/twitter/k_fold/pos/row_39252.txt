Anyone else just afraid of the future? I mean, hereâ€™s our earth, hanging on by a thread, slipping because of all the violence, bigotry, and pollution, and the only ones who care donâ€™t have much power in it.

Because as long as the rich white men in charge stay in charge and rich, they donâ€™t give a damn about what theyâ€™re doing to our earth. How much longer will it take for them to want to do something?

Until thereâ€™s no more fish?

Until our trees are all gone?

Until the sky turns black and we canâ€™t see the sun?

How much longer do we have until thereâ€™s no going back? And in the end, will we all just die?

Will we ever get another chance at life? 

Is this the only chance we have? If so, weâ€™ve screwed it up a long time ago.

Hi, Iâ€™m u/The_ChaosBean, and welcome to me talking about things we want to ignore and will keep you awake at night.
