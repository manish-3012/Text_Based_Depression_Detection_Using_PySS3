Is it weird that I listen to music absolutely all the time, to the point that songs get old in just days-weeks? I don't mean an hour or 2 a day, I mean that spotify is being used in the background of my phone and laptop for upwards of a combined 6 hours a day. Is this weird, or am I overthinking and is it more common than I think?
