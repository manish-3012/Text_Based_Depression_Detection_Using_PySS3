I canâ€™t wait til Gen Z becomes parents I feel like Gen Z has been exposed to a lot of stuff and we have a better understanding of the needs of what a kid would want so when we do become parents weâ€™ll probably be able to understand our kids much better than other parents have.

Idk if Iâ€™m the only one who thinks this or if Iâ€™m even right to think this... what do yâ€™all think?
