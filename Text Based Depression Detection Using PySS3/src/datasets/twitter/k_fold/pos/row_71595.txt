Do people not understand what clout farming is? OKay so on r/FortniteBR theres this post showing a bug and i can see this dudes ugly ass locker

and im a sweat and i only buy sweaty skins and seeing skins like slurp jonesy, big mouth, skull beef boss, venom, and other skins make me cringe so hard

so i just say "the skins you have are dogshit" and he proceeds to try and roast me

nobody understands what clout farming is

aura and other sweat skins look better than half the skins in the game
