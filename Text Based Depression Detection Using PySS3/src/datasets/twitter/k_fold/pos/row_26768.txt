My dog almost died. Iâ€™m really scared My dog ate a box and a half of rat poison. Sheâ€™s at the vet right now, but the one we usually go to is closed. We were lucky. She brought the empty box to the door. We managed to find a vet that was open not too far away. Please pray for her, the vet is keeping her over night. Iâ€™ve grown up with her and I really donâ€™t wanna lose her. Itâ€™s too soon.

Please pray for her
