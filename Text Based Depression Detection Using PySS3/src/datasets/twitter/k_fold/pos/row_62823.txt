Something about people seeking out relationships is weird Like seeking a relationship with a specific person is fine. if I see a girl/boy I am fond of, yeah I wanna date them because theyâ€™re neat. But just seeking a relationship for the sake of a relationship is weird tbh. Then it makes you think â€œdoes this person like me? Or do they just like the idea of having a gf/bf?â€



Because I donâ€™t just wanna be some kind of thing for them to feel better about themself.
