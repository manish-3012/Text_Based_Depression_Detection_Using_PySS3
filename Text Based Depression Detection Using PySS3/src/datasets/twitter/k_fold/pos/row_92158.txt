Iâ€™m losing myself slowly :/ How the hell do I start, im fourteen and I struggle with alcohol and self harm, yesterday was a mess and I took multiple shots in the morning on an empty stomach later on the day some stuff happened with an ex and I ended up breaking down during class meetings. Itâ€™s like a giant knot in my stomach and I canâ€™t distract myself from the pain, I know he loves me and wants to help but I just canâ€™t allow myself to make people I care about worry, I want to let go but Iâ€™ll leave a burden on my friends. I want help but I donâ€™t know everything is just a mess and I feel like crying again damn it. Thanks for coming to my ted talk Iâ€™m gonna go smoke
