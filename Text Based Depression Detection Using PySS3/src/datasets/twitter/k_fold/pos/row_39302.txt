ever since i got released from my mental hospital, i have been having nightmares about it every night, and i don't know what to do. it wasn't that bad, i actually kind of liked it there. the people there were so nice. i even got room mates. they were funny and unique, too. they had really good cereal and hot showers and the view from my dorm was beautiful. but ever since i got released i have been having so many dreams and nightmares about that place. it's every night and i don't know what to do.
