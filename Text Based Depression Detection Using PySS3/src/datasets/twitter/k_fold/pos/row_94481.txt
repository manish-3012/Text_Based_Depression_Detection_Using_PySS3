Corona arrived at my school. So yeah, Covid 19 finally arrived to my school, after months of praying it wouldnt. Im genuinely shaking, i dont know what to do. We have to go tomorrow with our masks on the whole time (which we didnt need to before).
I seriously dont want to go, risk my life for school. Our school closed when there was 200 cases in the country recorded, at it opened at 15k and now there is 20k cases.
Im genuinely very angry knowing that they want us to risk our lives for school.
Im listening to music to calm down, but i am so genuinely terrified to go to school tomorrow.
