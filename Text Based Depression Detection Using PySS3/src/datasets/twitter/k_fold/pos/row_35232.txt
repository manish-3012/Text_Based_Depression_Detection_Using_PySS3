Does anyone know of any YouTube channels or videos of people improving bootleg toys? I went to a dollar store and saw some Gundams that were colored with like 7 plastics and were labeled as Robots. The toy looks good aside from the color choice, I'm sure some paint would make them look official enough.

Now I'm wondering if there's a YouTube channel that would take these bootlegs and make them look good, and I'm not talking about putting clay on a giraffe to make it into a dragon.
