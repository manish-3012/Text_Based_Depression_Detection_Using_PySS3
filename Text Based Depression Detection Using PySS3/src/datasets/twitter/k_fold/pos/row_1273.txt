My cat has feline leukemia :( i don't know where he could get it and how, but here we are, two days ago everything was ok and now he has it. I don't know what will we do :( i found out that there's a vaccine but idk if we can afford it, we're pretty poor. He's also not the only cat i have so we have to keep him away from others. I don't think my mom knows btw. She knows that there's a risk he'll die, but she doesn't know what virus it is exactly. Idk what to think of all this.
