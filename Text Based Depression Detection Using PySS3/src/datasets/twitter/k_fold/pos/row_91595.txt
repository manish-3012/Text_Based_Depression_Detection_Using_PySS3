Iâ€™m the big sad So Iâ€™m in a discord chat with a few of my friends and I sent them a link to a article of The Sacred Band of Thebes (really cool, look at it if you have the chance) and almost the immediate reply I got was one of my friends friends say â€œf** forceâ€ and now Iâ€™m feeling a bunch of emotions from sadness and shame which is now leading me to think of myself as an abnormal person.
