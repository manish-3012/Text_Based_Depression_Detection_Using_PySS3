I literally feel like crying fuck Minecraft I just want to feel relaxed and happy once in my fucking break for 1 day please! I fucking died 5 times to either bugs or incredibly low odd deaths in the past 24 hours in my modded server while everyone else has not had my bad luck.

5 elytras, 5 rare swords, hundreds of diamonds lost. All my tools lost. I have not made any progress and now Iâ€™m at that point of no recovery.

I hate life, I canâ€™t be happy for one day.
