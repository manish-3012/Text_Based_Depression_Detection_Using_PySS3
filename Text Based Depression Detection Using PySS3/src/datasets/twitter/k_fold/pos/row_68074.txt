Is anyone else that friend? &lt;&lt; I'll put a warning here cuz it's a touchy subject and I don't wanna cause ptsd for anyone &gt;&gt;  


Is anyone that friend that everyone both loves and hate at the same time? The one that everyone vents to even tho you can't handle it anymore? That one kid that isn't allowed to step out of line and start venting cuz now they start calling you self centered.  


Well, I'm that friend. *(if you can even call that a friend)*   
I try my best to appeal everyone but somehow it all turns on me. I do my best to keep everyone together but everyone comes to me like I'm a miracle worker. I've carried to burden of so many people's suicide thoughts and when even your parents are struggling, it's hard to carry any more than that. But when I tell people that I can't take care of that anymore, they get mad at me. Then they ask me what's wrong and I keep it to myself because I know what comes next. When they finally pry it out of me, I start venting... And that's when everything crumbles. 

"Why am I not allowed to vent to you anymore huh? You tell me you're there but each time I try to vent, you push me away saying you can't do it anymore. Why are *you* allowed to vent and I'm not? You're so self centered."

I hear those words echo over and over. What made me the self centered one? Why not call me selfish instead, I'd understand that a bit better... When did I become self centered..?  


Honestly it haunts me... idk what to do anymore. My friends have been ruining my mental health for a while now and they don't seem to understand their actions. Then when I tell them I need to take a break from them, they look at me like I was the one stirring trouble. It hurt you know... and why am I the only one with these problems..?
