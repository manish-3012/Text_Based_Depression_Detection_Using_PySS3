I've yet to meet a valid pro-lifer. I've literally never seen any of them with the correct argument, all they do is shout about how pro-choicers like killing babies.

The only valid argument for pro-lifers is that instead of just doing abortion; we should give funding for sexual education and have easy access to multiple forms of birth control. It's been proven this cuts down on the pregnancy rate which in turn cuts down the abortion rate. Maybe even throw something in there about improving the shitty foster care system too.

If you believe in those things we can be cool, otherwise you're probably an annoying prick at best or a misogynistic neo-con at worst.
