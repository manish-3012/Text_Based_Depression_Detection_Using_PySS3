Trigger warning It has been 6 months since I stop self harming. I plan on continuing once school starts again normally which I hope is in a cold season. I'm proud of myself but I don't feel accomplished. Truth be told I used to harm myself because I didn't feel worth it, I still sometimes feel like that but when I used to cut, I did it because I was attached to it, there was no other reasoning I just did it because I did it. There were still  reasons for other cuts, but that was it.
