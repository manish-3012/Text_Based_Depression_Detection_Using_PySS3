I found a way us teens can actually make some extra cash! Hi everyone, I hope you are well!

Being 14 I know what it's like to need some extra cash but have nowhere to get any. I love hanging out with friends at the weekend but it can start to add up.

There are not many ways teens can make a lot of money online because of taxes. All you need for this is an email address and a PayPal.

The site is called [Qmee](http://qm.ee/B2D50097) and it is a survey site that pays a lot for each survey and is 100% legit. I have been using it for the last 2 weeks and I have made over $50 so far! I have written an article about Qmee and how you can maximise how much money you can make here: [Make Money With Qmee](https://medium.com/the-ascent/can-you-make-money-from-survey-sites-and-what-are-they-ligit-28e9414bf49f)

The surveys are very simple and can go up to more than $1 for only 10 minutes of your time.

They have no minimum payout meaning that if you only have 1Â¢ in your account then you can cash it out to Paypal straight away. They payout almost instantly as well so you can be assured you will get your money!

If you would like to join then I would really appreciate If you would use my link by clicking here: [http://qm.ee/B2D50097](http://qm.ee/B2D50097) I don't make much from it but it's free for you to do!

I hope this helped at least one person out there gain some extra cash!
