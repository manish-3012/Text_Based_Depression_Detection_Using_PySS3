Hey yall. Hope your Christmas is better than mine has been going. It started off fine. See, my biological parents are divorced, and I have to spend every other Christmas with my dad and my step-mother. Long story short, I have Autism, depression, and anxiety. My step-mother was raised in a southern family, and she was raised strictly. Her parenting methods are similar. I just can't with her. Anything I do, she will find something that was imperfect about it and nitpick. She can't deal with the way I eat, as if I am eating like a caveman (I don't), if I am looking slightly sad she will pull the usuals like "Why do you look sad?' Or 'You have nothing to be sad about, why are you crying?' But the worst part? The guilt trips. She will sit me down, and basically tell me I'm the next Hitler because I want some alone time from my step-brother after playing with him for 50 hours straight.  My Father refuses to do anything about it, and often justifies or backs up her actions. Mark my words, the day that me and my mother go back to court, they are all dead to me.
