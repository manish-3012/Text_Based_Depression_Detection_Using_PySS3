Thoughts on Weed or Marijuana? Hey, I thought it could be a cool idea if we could all have a discussion about weed. Doing weed is becoming the norm nowadays, and I've heard the arguments from those who are all for it and those who are against it. But these are all adults so I want to hear what my age group has to say about it. Feel free to comment your opinion or debate one another in the comments. My personal opinion is that weed should be taken ONLY medically, and should not be used recreationally because I believe that the human body is equipped only to breathe in oxygen, not chemicals. You can try changing my mind if you want.
