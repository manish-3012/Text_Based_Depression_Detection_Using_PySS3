I cried infront of my girlfriend last night TL;DR I found my one and only and she wonâ€™t let me feel like I donâ€™t deserve her 

Iâ€™ve been seeing this girl since April and it really is just like a dream.

About 2 years ago I got out of a 2 year relationship. I didnâ€™t realize it then but she was very toxic and I was never really comfortable around her, we would have sex but I never felt loved, I never felt like I was really accepted by her. After her I didnâ€™t really talk to anybody and I went down a spiral of depression (I fought with it since I was 12 and went through the suicide of my brother, different story sorry) but I just didnâ€™t feel like I had anything to offer this world. I dropped out of high school and started working a shitty job (Walmart...) 

After meeting this girl she has helped me in so many ways mentally. Iâ€™ve moved out of my parents, started working construction and making that $$, and I can fucking sleep at night now. She lives a few hours away so we donâ€™t see each other but a couple times a week at best but we make the most out of it everytime even if we just watch movies.

Well last night I got overwhelmed. I had a very bad anxiety attack because I really donâ€™t feel like I deserve the love she gives me and her knowing my signs she just held me and let me squeeze her. She started talking and telling me how much she loves me and how the things that make us different do not bother her, they just make her love me more. And I started crying, and I felt really weak, and she wouldnâ€™t even let me feel that. She just held me, in those soft loving arms. I know Iâ€™m 19 and Iâ€™m not supposed to say this but Iâ€™m already doing enough of this life shit as it is.. I want to marry this girl, I donâ€™t ever want her being anything but mine.
