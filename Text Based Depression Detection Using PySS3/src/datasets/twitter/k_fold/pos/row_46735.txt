Anyone else hate it when people try to force their ships on everyone else? Yes, I get this character and that character would be a good couple in your opinion, doesn't mean everyone else thinks the same thing, even if a majority of the people do, respect that not everyone thinks the same thing as you, would ya?


In my opinion, that character looks better with another character, but I respect your opinion. I don't respect, however, that you expect everyone to ship this character with that character.

(I'm tired of typing this/that character, so I'll just use w, x, y, and z)

I respect you think w and x would be cute together, but I personally see w as being single, x and z being together, and y having a crush on w. Some people could agree with me on that, others might agree with you, but that doesnt mean you can just be like "I think you should put w and x together since they're my OTP even if you dont ship them whatsoever!1!1"

Like I respect shippers, but don't force your ship on everyone else.
