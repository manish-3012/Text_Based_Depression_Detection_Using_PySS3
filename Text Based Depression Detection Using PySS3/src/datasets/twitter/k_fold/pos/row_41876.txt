I hate wanting to digital art I really want to digitize one of my recent pieces but the iPad- itâ€™s my gmaâ€™s but she lets us use it sometimes- which I bought pocket procreate on is being used by my sister. I have medibang on my phone but I havenâ€™t used it in ages and I hate how small my phone screen is.
