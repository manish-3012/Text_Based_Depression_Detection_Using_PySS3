Does anyone else do this when they hike? I get thirsty like 1/4 the way into it. I have a huge water bottle but don't drink it because if i drink it I will finish the whole thing and then be thirsty later and I will get even more thirsty from the people that still have water left so I end up not drinking it for the whole hike and chug it all down at the end.
