Anybody else here who also has like 30 tabs open? I just canâ€™t remember what Iâ€™m doing unless I can see it, so I always have a bunch of tabs open. Itâ€™s honestly just a bunch of twitch streams and YouTube videos I wanna watch. I wonâ€™t remember it unless I can see it all the time. Am I the only one?
