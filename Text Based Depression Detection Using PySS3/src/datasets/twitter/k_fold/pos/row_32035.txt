I'm having breathing issues and don't wanna die Idk if this is the right sub for this but oh well, for the past year or so I've been having breathing issues, my chest feel a lil tight and to get a full breath I have to take a really deep Breath. My parents also say the noticed me wheezing a bit. Drinking something relieves it for like 5 min but then it comes back. Any ideas about what the fuck is wrong with me?
