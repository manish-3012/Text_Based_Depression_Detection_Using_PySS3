My dad ran over a cat in the road (TW: Dead animal) It was an accident. He didn't see it, it was dark out and it was a black cat. It was swift, my dad didn't slow down. It was just a quick bump and it was over. All I can hope for is that that cat didn't have a family. I don't want them to walk outside to try and find their cat, only too see it in the road. 

I feel so guilty even though I didn't even see the cat. I just saw it laying there when we pasted it again.
