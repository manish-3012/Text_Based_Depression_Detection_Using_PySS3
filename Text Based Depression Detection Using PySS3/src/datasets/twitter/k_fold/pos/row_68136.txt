The worst thing about school is that weâ€™re just required to memorize shit and get good grades and no one really cares if you truly understand what youâ€™re learning I know that was a long title but all I want is a teacher to teach me something in depth. They know what theyâ€™re teaching but they still give me all this surface level bull shit that isnâ€™t helping me in any way other than preparing me for tests. Maybe Iâ€™d have an actual interest in what youâ€™re teaching me if you show me how interesting it is. Donâ€™t just read off of your fucking syllabus
