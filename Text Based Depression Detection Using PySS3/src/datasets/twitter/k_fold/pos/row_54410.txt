THE BLACK Chapter 3 The Blizzard (please tell me what you think) Chris looked outside the window and saw the creature again but this time he had little horns and little wings.
Chris needed to call jack to ask him about this but he didnâ€™t find the number in his bag so he thought max might have took it so he went to Maxâ€™s roomâ€where the fuck is the number max!â€Chris asked,max looked at him and told himâ€I ripped apart cause you didnâ€™t want me to be with you in this!â€Chris then told himâ€youâ€™re such a fucking idiot what is wrong with you! He is the only one we know that knows anything about these creaturesâ€max then looked at him and he had nothing to sayâ€weâ€™ll have to go look for himâ€Chris said then went outside with max.
Max and Chris were walking in the city looking for jack,while they were walking Chris and max went in a bar and took a seat,while they were sitting it suddenly started snowing outside,Chris then looked at maxâ€this is all your fucking faultâ€Chris saidâ€if you didnâ€™t tear apart the number we wouldnâ€™t have been in this situation!â€max then looked at Chrisâ€listen man Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t mean to get us into this troubleâ€max saidâ€sorry wonâ€™t help us...thatâ€™s it Iâ€™m out...â€Chris said then walked outside the shopâ€stay here and donâ€™t go anywhere maxâ€
2 hours later a blizzard hit the town and Chris was still outside and he was barely able to see anything,he then fell on the ground and wasnâ€™t been able to moveâ€I guess thatâ€™s it...â€Chris saidâ€Iâ€™m gonna die here aloneâ€
While he was on the ground he saw a shadow coming towards himâ€what the...â€Chris said.
A person then stood in front of Chrisâ€hey wake the fuck upâ€the person told Chris the Chris looked at the person it was jack!
â€œItâ€™s you...youâ€™re jack right?â€Chris said while getting upâ€no time to remember names we need to goâ€jack said.
Jack and Chris started running to where max is.
â€œChris! Youâ€™re back!â€max saidâ€yeah and I have jack here with meâ€Chris saidâ€well thatâ€™s goodâ€max said.
â€œWeâ€™re gonna have to wait here until this blizzard calms down...â€jack said.
