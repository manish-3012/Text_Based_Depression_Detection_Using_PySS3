You should be allowed to legally leave high school halfway through with a general diploma. This is written mainly from a North American perspective. So you would be around 16 or 17 years old at this point. My area used to do this. And thinking it over it sounds like a good idea to me.

For some kids the last 2 years of high school just isn't worth it. Some kids are just too smart for high school by the time they are 16. They keep acing tests and have great ideas, and the high school climate just isn't allowing them to pursue their full potential. I think it would be very beneficial for students who are sure of their commitment and interests to be allowed to pursue them, instead of waiting in an uncompetitive environment for 2 whole years before moving on.

Theres also the kids who just don't align with the current method of schooling. Its not for everyone, and the way we structure society should understand that, and allow for people to choose their own paths. I know many, many kids in my area who began to work full time as an apprentice in a trade. They were much better off in a hands on environment like that, and they were making good coin too. Most of them either dropped out, or just put in minimum effort into school. Its not going to matter to them. They are building valuable seniority and life experience.

Allowing this would also increase the availability of resources to kids who want the entire 4 years of high school. Many school systems are underfunded and overpopulated, and I don't think forcing the population to remain the same, even when some kids are clearly ready to move on, is necessary.

Obviously there are the kids who don't value education, and have poor work ethics. But hey, maybe that real life shock is a better wake up call to them instead of the millions of "Stay in School" posters put up every year.
