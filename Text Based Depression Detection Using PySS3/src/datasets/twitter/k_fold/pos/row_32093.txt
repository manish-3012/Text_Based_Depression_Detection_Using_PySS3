I need to rant So today literally 5min back I had an exam in computer and am still pissed. So basically our teacher told us to submit our exam paper in OneNote and not the assignment tab where it had been assigned. So I was over there righting my exam and had removed my headphones cause I donâ€™t want to listen to the background noise in the class. Then I had to get my computer for practicals so I went to my room to ask my mom to use the computer. My mom uses the computer for work. So then when I transported my laptop form the room to my table I was gone for like 5min. Then I did the Practical part of the exam. Guess what that teacher told me after I submitted the exam. â€œYou did not submit the theory part of the paper in onenote therefore I am deducting 30marksâ€. So basically she told me that I was supposed to submit the practical is Assignments and the theory in onenote. All of our other teachers said that I was supposed to submit either in onenote or assignment , so I chose assignment. When I told my teacher I did not hear she proceeded to berate me for being disrespectful. Now I am pissed as I was sure that I would score 80/80 but now I lost 30marks. How do I proceed from this.
