I *kind of* quit gaming :( Yes, you read it right, I quit. 

Reasons:

1. My PC crashes a lot. Specs are 4GB RAM and NVidia GeForce GTX 710A. As of now, my PC lags bad af and now it's completely crashed. I know you would say that buy/build/upgrade your PC, but I cannot spend a huge amount of money on my PC. My dad is running out of temper looking at my activity on the PC. 
2. I am bored. I just wanna quit. I want to get productive and not waste (sorry to use this, gamers) my time in gaming. I want to grow more and in **my** life, gaming is kinda avoiding me to do that.

I have Rocket League, Valorant, CS:GO, Minecraft and other games. I am deleting everything &gt;!except minecraft!&lt; and just refreshing my mind. I don't mean, and I never will, that games are useless and  harmful. Play games, my people. But I can't move on. 

&gt;!I'll earn money and buy a nice PS/Xbox.!&lt; 

I'm just expressing myself and not encouraging quitting of games. All I wanna say is life your fucking life.
