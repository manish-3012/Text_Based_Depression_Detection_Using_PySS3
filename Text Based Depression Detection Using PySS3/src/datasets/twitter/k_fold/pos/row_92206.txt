So I had to take an "Interest Profiler" test. Like wtf? Since when does a *computer* have to tell me what I like and what I don't like. And then the test proceeds to inaccurately describe me as an individual, yet that score is what the school is going to use to profile me. Hello? I am a person, with  a brain, and the ability to communicate what I like. Why don't they just ask the students "what the fuck you like bro?" So annoying.
