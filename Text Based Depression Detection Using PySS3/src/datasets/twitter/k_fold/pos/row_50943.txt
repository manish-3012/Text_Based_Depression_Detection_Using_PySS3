Day #42 of recommending songs. [Jdam - Before you go to sleep, here's a lullaby](https://youtu.be/trkWhgsHOFY)

Actually doing way better and feeling way better. Only every morning, I don't feel so good for like 2 hours. Idk, almost that I feel sick... 

Today, I made a excuse so I could go outside. I was feeling light headed. I know when I am going to pass out, so I don't take any risk. 
One time I had history and almost passed out, but I stayed strong and didn't pass out. I didn't see anything, just black. Heard a weird noise... nobody noticed... fuck this dudes.
