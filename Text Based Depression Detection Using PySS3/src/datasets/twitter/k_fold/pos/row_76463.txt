I'm sick and tired of Politics Older people often point out that young people didn't used to give a shit about politics. I wish it was still this way now.

All politics does is divide people. Have you lost a friend because you don't have the 'right opinion'? That seems increasingly common now. I've heard stories of people disowning their whole families over this stuff. It isn't good, it can even lead to violence.

Throwback to the 2008 US Presidential election, [where John McCain defended Obama](https://youtu.be/JIjenjANqAk). Do you think something like that could happen now? No chance, because each side believes the opposing side are awful people. There used to be a standard of civility and respect.

You have to have an opinion on everything. I'm not interested in discussing this because I hear enough of it as it is. If I refuse to say, I am a secret Trump or Biden supporter and clearly I must be an awful person.

People need to chill out, and recognise that no matter who wins, the buses will run and the sun will set at the end of the day. Also, learn that not everyone you disagree with is a bad person. They believe this stuff because they generally think it is right, not because they hate x or despise y group of people.

Thank you for listening to me.
