Why does everyone complain about Nintendo switch online so much? Like, people always say stuff like "im paying 20$ for this crappy service"

But they act like they spend their lifes earnings for it. Its either crappy Nintendo internet or no internet. They aren't going to improve it at all and these people know what they are signing up for when they buy it.

Its significantly cheaper than other consoles online subscriptions aswell.
