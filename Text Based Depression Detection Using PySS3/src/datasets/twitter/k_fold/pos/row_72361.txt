Ok. So thereâ€™s this girl who I met a while back, weâ€™ve been talking for a while. Just friends for now. However, I get the idea she likes me. But I want to make sure that Iâ€™m reading the signs correctly. Or if the signs I think Iâ€™m reading are superstitions, if you understand what Iâ€™m saying. Ok.

I am a 15 male, almost 16( January) sheâ€™s a 14 girl, close to 15( may)


Ok. So when Iâ€™m around her, sheâ€™s very playful with me, we make jokes, and sometimes sheâ€™ll poke fun at me. Not in a mean mean way but as a fun way. Last time I saw her, we got lunch together( we work at the same place) the entire backstory Iâ€™m willing to share will be at the end of this, Iâ€™ll indent it for people wanting to read it first) I didnâ€™t pay for it, and Iâ€™m still kicking myself for it, but back to it, we talked a lot and generally we get along really well. The second time ever we worked together we talked about the fact that she loves Taylor Swift, and how I used to like Taylor Swift( yes Iâ€™m a guy, but it was when I was like 9) ok, hereâ€™s the backstory
       

      Ok so around summer 2019, I was volunteering at the local museum, Iâ€™ve been doing it since I was 13, itâ€™s a nice place. And I work with a lot of girls. The place has a Lego station where the kids can be entertained while the parents rest, and I usually ask to work there because Iâ€™m good around little kids( I still havenâ€™t found a better way to word it so I donâ€™t sound like a pedophile but) but yeah, I work with a lot of girls. But when this girl and I were assigned together, we clicked. We got along so well. We had so much in common, we talked basically the whole time to each other. And right off the bat she would make jokes about me. Like I made a lego sword. Really cool. And so the kids would ask to see it, my sword( oh gosh, gotta figure out how to word that better too) and the girl would joke about how she made it and then would be like I let him( me) borrow it. Throughout our entire banter I probably had a lot of â€œswordâ€ jokes that I missed out on, but anyway yeah, sheâ€™d make jokes, Iâ€™d make jokes. We had great chemistry. So, I, never ever have I been that brave, still now. And Iâ€™m glad I did, but I decided to write her a note on my last day volunteering for the summer, unfortunately she wasnâ€™t working that day, and I wouldnâ€™t be working again. So I left a note saying if I remember correctly â€œHey, hereâ€™s a sword, you can have it. We get along really great and I would like to keep in touch as friends, hereâ€™s my phone number.  So about 2 weeks later she texts me and is like, hey Iâ€™m really sorry but my dad is really strict and doesnâ€™t want me dating boys. Hope we can still be friends though. And so I responded, oh thatâ€™s fine. That wasnâ€™t my intention anyway. I just wanted to be friends. So weâ€™ve been talking by text since then. I had seen her twice after that. Once for a Octoberfest the museum was doing. We got along great then too, I bought her a donut during that. I have adhd and usually I take medicine for it, but I forgot all about it that day. And so personally I felt like, now looking back, I was a little clingy. But she seemed fine with it. The last time because of Covid I saw her was in January, we did a winter thing at the museum. Personally I think that was our best interaction. We had lunch together, we were at the same place, I got a snack and asked if she wanted one, she said no, and I ate my snack but she wanted some so we shared a bag of fruit gummy/ snacks, to be exact. Since then we havenâ€™t seen each other in person. Weâ€™ve been texting, I talk to her every day. Every holiday we talk. No phone calls though. Ok now about her( what I know)


-Shes very Christian. Iâ€™m nothing really, however I have cut down on my use of Jesus, Jesus Christ, and oh my god, to jeez, and oh my gosh recently( probably because of her)
- her parents are very strict.
- i know a lot more about her, but I doesnâ€™t apply here so itâ€™s not important
An important thing I didnâ€™t mention. A month ago I asked her if she wanted to have lunch together sometime, as friends. And she said she canâ€™t, her dad wouldnâ€™t let her. She said she wanted to though. Whether or not thatâ€™s true is not for me to contemplate.
So basically Iâ€™m very sorry about this entire essay. When I started this I didnâ€™t plan on this but maybe I just needed to right this all down. My question is does she like me. I know this isnâ€™t a lot of info to figure that out. So maybe put common signs that you think sheâ€™d do. I donâ€™t know. Just what do you think about this. Thanks. Merry Christmas. Also Iâ€™m sorry if you just saw this from a different account. Thatâ€™s my alt and I didnâ€™t mean to post it from that one
