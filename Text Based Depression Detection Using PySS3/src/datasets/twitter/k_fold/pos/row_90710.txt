im so scared about my next surgery so I have to be put under for a major tooth surgery and it'll be the 6th surgery ive ever gotten, and the 9th time ive been put under serious anesthesia. on one hand, my brains going "same shit different day" and on the other hand my brains panicking since i dont want any more surgeries. on the 29th im finding out of its going to be one surgery or multiple. im so nervous.
