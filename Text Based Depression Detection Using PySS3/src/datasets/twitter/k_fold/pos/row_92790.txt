I tried to book an appointment and they left me on seen? I was tryna book a tattoo appointment, they replied to my quote request but the second I ask to book an appointment they leave me on seen?
I don't understand?

What am I supposed to do,just go find another place to get the tattoo, cause I was really happy with the price they gave me and now I'm just confused
