Iâ€™m gonna miss her I never got to say goodbye to my Grandma. I never even gave her a last â€œI love youâ€ to her. She died a few hours ago. And Iâ€™ve really never had a very close family member die on me...at least that I know of. And now I have... It absolutely destroyed my heart seeing every one crying. It especially hurt seeing my dad, and my aunt cry hard. Iâ€™m gonna miss her...so damn much. But god is gonna protect her.. I know he is.
