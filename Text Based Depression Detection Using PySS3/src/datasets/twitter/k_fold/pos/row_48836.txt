this is something I have wanted to say for a long time but some people might find it offensive but I want to get it off my chest During these BLM protests about how there is police brutality and how police are racists, I hate to break it to you but that's a small handful of police that are racist, employers most of the time cant tell if this someone they hire is racist or not but whether it be a cop or someone in any other profession there will always be a racist person and so it bothers me how they just put a target on a police officers back just because they are a police officer. In my opinion before these protests and even more now being a police is one of the most dangerous jobs out there and sometimes they have to kill someone to save their life or the lives of others so just because they have to kill a black person for trying to kill them (this is an example) and they shoot back and kill them does not mean that they are racist. That concludes my rant dont downvote me to hell I just wanted to put this out there.
