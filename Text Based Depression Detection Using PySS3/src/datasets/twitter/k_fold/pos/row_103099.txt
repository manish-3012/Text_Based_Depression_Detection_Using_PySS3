Another terrifying realization: Iâ€™m afraid to die Im taking medicine for my wisdom teeth removal, and an hour after taking it my chest arms and legs got fuzzy and tickly, I became really dizzy, shaky, and drowsy. I looked at my palms and they were really pale. I was ready to put my shoes on and run to the hospital. I was good but it made me realize that I really would be afraid to die.
