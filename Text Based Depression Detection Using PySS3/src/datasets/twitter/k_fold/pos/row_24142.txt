Midnight Ramblings, Volume III (Quick side note: this series, if you can call it that, is simply my mental vomit whenever I feel fatigued. I have usually fallen asleep by midnight. The name is simply a reflection of my state of mind at the time of drafting a new entry.)

All high school relationships are doomed to fail. Everyone will get separated as opportunities and availability of funds will pull everyone to their own universities, trade schools, and careers. At the point of failure for most relationships, the parties involved become seriously depressed for a while. What's the point of risking that happening multiple times before high school ends and you become a distant memory to all those who you shared camaraderie with? Why risk dating if there isn't even a possibility of the two of you eventually spending life together?

There is no such thing as love at first sight, and everyone, including me, seems to confuse romantic love with platonic love all the damn time. My personal believe is that one of the prerequisites to romantic love between two people is complete belief that there is no maximum to the growth of the love between those people. Beyond the fact that the brains of high school aged people are rewriting the decision making parts of said brains, everyone in high school in a relationship probably knows subconsciously that it's bound to go down the toilet at some point, causing them to not work as hard as they need to to keep their relationships afloat for even that long.

Fuck this mind destroying garbage otherwise known as "dating".
