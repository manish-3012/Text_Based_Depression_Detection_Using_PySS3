I know we all joke about it but I really am sad that Iâ€™m alone. My girlfriend of 2 years dumped me a week before our anniversary back in December. Since then, her and I have still been expressing lots of feeling for each other. Just a semi-mutual understanding that â€œweâ€ arenâ€™t ready for a relationship. Iâ€™m truly sad, to be alone. I had a great relationship with her, I think I truly experienced love. Now that I gotta taste for it I crave it. I want it in my life. I have pretty much no friends, no girl. At least I got my bro u/Zr_Stealth and a few boys to hopefully game with tonight. Unless they all watch anime or play PC lol, then I might just play siege and chug some monsters on my own. Anyways point is like those â€œguess whoâ€™s single and looking at Redditâ€ memes genuinely h u r t me on the inside. Any ideas for what to do to get my mind off of being absolutely fucking single?
