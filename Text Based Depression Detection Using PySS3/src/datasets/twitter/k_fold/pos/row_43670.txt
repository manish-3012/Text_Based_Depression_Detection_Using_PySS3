Is this wrong? So let me start off by saying Iâ€™m not an Anti-Masker in any way. Nor am I an Anti-Vaxxer. I think that the people who think these way need to be educated more on the subject. (Basically, theyâ€™re dumb) Anyways, I recently heard about the new vaccine thatâ€™s coming out for the virus that fucked up the entire planet. (You know the one) And Iâ€™m really not sure about it. I just think it should be tested more for either long term effects or unforeseen consequences. And for that reason, I wouldnâ€™t get the vaccine as soon as it was available to me. Is it wrong to think this way or am I overthinking it lol
