My mom took the mouse away so I cant do anything on the pc hahahasheah

why is my life like this.

I have unfinished assignment that is also a group project that I was doing but she got mad at me bcs she saw me playing games instead of doing assignments or sleeping bcs it's like past midnight here.


she said I need to sleep so I can wake up early to attend class and that I can just do the assignment like at 5am in the morning lmao

That's like only a few hours left,,wtf??I'm not even gonna get enough sleep so why even sleep.

it's so fucking stupid,like I get forced to sleep early but I have trouble sleeping,I'm fucking awake at night.Also why should I sleep if I'm not tired and have things to do?

wtf I cant understand her.just why.Cant she just let me be?She literally doesnt know that I get 3 hours of sleep bcs she thinks that once I switch off the lights in my room she thinks I'm already sleeping.This is just dumb.

So dumb.I cant even switch off the PC.Couldnt even play games.Couldnt finish my assignment.Im fucked.I hate it.Why is everything making me so stressed.
