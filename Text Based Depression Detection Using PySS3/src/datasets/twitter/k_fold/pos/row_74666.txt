Yeah I have problems I was listening to my playlist thatâ€™s is hrs long and came across a song called â€œMy enormous Penisâ€ and I think itâ€™s hilarious. Recently it was replayed and I then showed it to my mom and she thought it was funny. Later while we were driving I showed it to my dad and he was smiling a lot then after it ended he said that the song was inappropriate to show to young women (respect for throwing in his wife Is young) and then I say I would never show it to someone I didnâ€™t know/trust, then he asked my mom if â€œ this is how you wanna raise gentleman â€œ my mom then said she thought it a funny song. My dad continues to talk about it then I say â€œ this is why I donâ€™t feel comfortable around you guys and donâ€™t tell you about my personal problemsâ€ my dads face was then surprised pikachu face, and then I put on my headphones contained to listen to music. Now Iâ€™m writing this.
