I am in a situation of social dilemma. I have this problem with myself that I usually cannot understand the tone of the conversation or if people are ignoring or not. I am very honest about my words and sometimes it has lead to me getting beaten or punished.... If you were 'me' what would you have done to compensate this lethal influx of HONESTY which our society has made pretty general in conversation .


Long Story Short: I cannot lie easily.
