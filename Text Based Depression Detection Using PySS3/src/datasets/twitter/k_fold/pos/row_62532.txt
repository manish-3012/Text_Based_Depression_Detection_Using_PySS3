Today, I made a leap... ... And flopped. Well lads, first time posting here but I honestly kinda need to vent off my excess emotions. I asked my crush out. And it was a really scary thing to do, being a very introverted person. Got along really well with this girl, we've been friends for two years, and I had recently started feeling a lot more attached to her. But, it was not meant to be. She apparently hadn't truly got over her breakup from a few months ago, and she feels too apprehensive and unsure about relationships to start a new one. And that's absolutely fine. Am I disappointed? Yes. Am I angry? No. I came out of this experience feeling a lot better, because I was able to not be a coward and didn't hold my feelings inside my heart where they would gnaw at me for the rest of time. So, despite the fact that I am still single, I was courageous, and I did what I felt like I had to do. We agreed to remain friends, and she took it pretty well all considering. We still go on about our wacky shenanigans and send memes to each other, or talk when we're feeling unwell and need someone. All in all, I'm feeling good.
Edit: Grammar, typical I'm sure.
