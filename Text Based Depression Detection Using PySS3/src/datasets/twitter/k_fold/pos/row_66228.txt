ok but like, why does my dad always think I'm lying about outlandish things?? Like a recent example of this is a couple days ago. My hair wasn't brushed and my dad told me to turn around and he began feeling it and inspecting it. I don't like my hair being touched at all, whether it's brushed or not. I've told him this *many* times. Both when my hair was and wasn't brushed. After he feeled up my hair, he told me to go brush it. And because I was extremely uncomfortable and a bitch, I just said "okay" in a bitchy tone and tried walking away. He stopped me and threatened to hurt me and he shoved me in front of him. He said he was tired of me being like this and asked why it was "just so hard to brush my hair and why I have to be a bitch everytime he asks". I told him I was a bitch because I've repeatedly told him *I don't want my hair being fucking touched* and he accused me of being a lair. He says I'm lying because when he hugs me, his arms touch my hair. I tried explaining him that's different than feeling it up and inspecting it but he screamed at me and called me a liar some more and said I've never told him this when my hair was brushed. Which???? I have?????
