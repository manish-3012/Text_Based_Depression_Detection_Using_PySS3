It's kinda annoying that I get to see this one friend sometimes when everyone meets up but then barely get to talk to her because she's talking with the other girls the whole time  Like I want to talk to her but in the group of like 9 kids (5 boys and 4 girls today) the boys all talk to eachother and the girls talk to eachother mostly and she sits off away and so I barely get to talk to her really even though I miss her a bit cause I've barely got to see her all summer and she's a really good friend. Like I got to talk to her a bunch like last week when me and one other friend (another boy) met up at a DQ and that was really great and a second time like the next day but otherwise today I barely got to talk to her even though I really wanted to. It's just a bummer.
