I need help Iâ€™m not sure what to do, I recently did a lot of research on clinical depression and ik this sounds like every other teenager fishing for karma but itâ€™s not like that. just the few people that see this could you help me out. I seriously think I have depression and Iâ€™m scared to talk to my mom about it because Iâ€™m scared sheâ€™ll laugh at me and dismiss it but I think I need help and I think I could really benefit from a shrink or smthn idk but I have no idea what to do
