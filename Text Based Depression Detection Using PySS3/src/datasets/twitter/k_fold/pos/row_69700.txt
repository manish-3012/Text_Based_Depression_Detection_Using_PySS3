Iâ€™m gonna say something which has been bothering me for the past day about Ever since that post with the 14 year old girl getting banned, (Iâ€™m sure you know which one I mean) Iâ€™ve seen people shitting on the mods. Yes, itâ€™s not a good look to have done that, and Iâ€™m sure they could have handled it better. But by the LITERAL RULES OF REDDIT that post had to have been removed, and like it or not that happened. There can still be other means to catch the truly evil person and others like him, but if the subreddit was taken down, all of this, this whole community would be gone for good. We still can make an effort to clean the community, and rid of the truly evil people who do things like what happened to the 14 year old girl. However, when we call the mods themself evil people, and say they are on the predators side, you just realize they are humans too (teenagers at that), and no human is perfect. They are doing their job, and in my opinion, a pretty good one, besides what imperfections there may be. I am conscious this post likely will be downvoted to oblivion, but I hate the predators just as much as the next guy. I just think when you shit on the mods, and talk about them being evil or deranged, there is a human on the other side, who is receiving and taking whatever you have to say. You donâ€™t see then banning people who speak out against them, you see them politely responding a majority of the time, and I think thatâ€™s something to be respected. We can get out of the place this subreddit is as a community, not by division. Thanks if you read this far, stay safe
