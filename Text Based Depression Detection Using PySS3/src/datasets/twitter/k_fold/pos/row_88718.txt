Being "skinny and scrawny" vs "skinny and lean" So I just wanted to post it someone and formulate what I'm feeling into works and see if anyone can relate. So I'm a cross country runner so I'm super skinny. And I mean like no fat like at all. But that also means that I basically have no muscle. When I see other guys who people would also find "skinny" they always have muscles and its like they're not built but their arms are defined and stuff and I just wish I could be them. And guys like them have abs too and I don't. I hate my body.
