Is it too soon to say, "I like you,"? So there's this girl that I like, and I have had a crush on her for quite a long time. So me (14M) and her (14F) were playing some minecraft bedwars tonight, like we do almost every night, and I have been sending her some flirty stuff on discord, nothing weird, and she's responded to all of them. Tonight when we were playing, I was humming the tune to "hooked on a feeling" and she started singing out-loud the part that goes like, "I'm hooked on a feeling, I'm high on believing, That you're in love with me" just kind of randomly. Also pre-covid when people could get together, I went up to her room just to see what was happening and she kind of mumbled, "I want to kiss you." and I was just like, "what?" then left cause I didn't want to impede on boundaries or something.  


So is she like actually in to me or am I just imagining things? Sorry I'm super clueless about this kind of stuff. I know this post seems like it's a joke or satire, but I honestly can't tell.
