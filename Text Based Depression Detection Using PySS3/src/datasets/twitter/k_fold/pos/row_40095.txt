I miss affection. To the few people who see this: thanks for reading.

All I want is for someone to show they appreciate my existence. I know numerous people who appreciate that I am here for them, and some even look up to me because I'm always so kind and confident and have a bright future and stuff. But I feel very cold and alone and I just want someone to give me a spontaneous hug even though I don't ask for one.

I've always been more of a lone wolf anyway and I can really make it far on my own, but I just really want someone to share my life with, who can warm me up when I feel cold and cheer me up when I feel down.

I don't even want sex, I just want someone who likes me for who I am and who hugs me even when I don't need it.

People always say that guys should act tough and man up and stuff but it's not easy manning up every single time you feel lonely.
