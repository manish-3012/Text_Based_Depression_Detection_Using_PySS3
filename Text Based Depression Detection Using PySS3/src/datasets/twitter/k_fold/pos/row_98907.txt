Don't kill spiders. personally, I think spiders are really cool. They can do so many things. (Some shoot webs, some jump really high, etc.) The only reason I've heard that people don't like spiders are because they are creepy. So many of my friends kill spiders, but I don't see why. For anyone who kills spiders, stop being a dick and respect these amazing creatures.
