What did i do wrong? So a few weeks ago I got this crazy idea with a girl who lived 12 hours away that when i pass by her city with my family (as we were on a road trip) I would pick her up and we would live together in our other house for like a week. I had a huge crush on her and she seemed interested as well even though we had met only once before. Now I super excited to meet her as this girl was a dream come true for me, she was gorgeous, had a good personality and we shared many interests. Everything went really well and we were cuddling basically all the time for the first two days. I was happier than I've been in a such a long time. Yesterday we Played COD the entire evening and had a lot of fun. However I noticed that she was not so much into cuddling anymore so I gave her some space and asked if she feels okay with me cuddling with her, she said it's fine. However this morning she told me she doesn't want me sleeping with her anymore and doesn't come close to me anymore. It's pretty clear she lost all interest in me and I have no idea why. I hadn't done anything special during the night/evening. This just broke me completely and I have no idea what should I do as she's still going to be here with me for quite some time. 

Not only this but we walked into some of my old high school bullies and as usual got told I look like shit etc, she witnessed it all. She obviously tried to cheer me up but Something like that really hurts. With all this and a lot of stress about school I can feel getting deprssed again. I just feel like im a person who's really hard to like in any way and i just know that afterall the problem is me. I just don't know how to change.
