(insert title here) i need help. 

i just ruined two long friendships 

i dont have a way to fix it 

i need advice 

â€”Contextâ€”

My friends were all ganging up on me about things, and the banter would get passed to someone else, essentially just a hot potato of tame shit talk. It starts to get a little wild, and they bring up more serious things, like the fact that i dont go out, shit like that. 

Eventually it gets to the point of one bringing up the fact that I take meds for â€œbeing a sad bitchâ€ and â€œwanting to dieâ€ (Note: Iâ€™m bi-polar, not something i can really control. Lots of family members have it too.)

I eventually lost my shit and brought up the fact that oneâ€™s sister was dead, and the others grandmother died too. In the moment it seemed fair, because they were sensitive about their issues as i was mine, but now that i look back it wasnt worth. 

i talked to the others about it and they told me that it was fucked but they forgave me, not sure how.

i dont have an excuse for this and want to fix it asap, i didnt have anyone close to ask so i wanted some outside opinions.
