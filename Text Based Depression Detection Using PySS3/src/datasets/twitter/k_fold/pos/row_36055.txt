Today I found out I was catfished I mean Iâ€™m not surprised this would happen to me since Iâ€™ve been on the internet for like 10 years now doing Lord knows what. But I got a message on Sunday from the guy I used to really like to in 2018 telling me that heâ€™s actually a girl and yea. I only saw it today though.
I kinda blame myself bc I didnâ€™t see the signs. I was 14-15 and â€œsheâ€ was 17-18. I was dumb clearly. Anyways yea. 
I handled it pretty well I guess. Im not mad at her at all but you know I was kinda upset, still am but definitely less. ok
