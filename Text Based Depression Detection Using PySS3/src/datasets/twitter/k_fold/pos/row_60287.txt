Do yâ€™all ever meet someone on here and start messaging them and theyâ€™re ok at first but then they turn out to be absolutely insane? If yes pls tell me abt it I had to delete my 12k karma account cuz this guy was a psychopath and I was scared he was gonna look for me in my city cuz he was only a couple hours away and I had to change my appearance just in case but I never gave him personal info such as phone number or family members names or my high school or anything like that just my first name and my age and the name of the city I live in but damn I was just tryna make friends why it always gotta backfire!!! I even changed the way I type on this account just in case heâ€™s still looking for me or notices similarities ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶ 

It was crazy man I was paranoid for the longest time but in retrospect I was just overreacting and yeah never trying to make Reddit friends again lol 

I tried to look up his username on here to see if he was saying anything but i think his account got deleted or something but that is a good thing anyways tell me your stories
