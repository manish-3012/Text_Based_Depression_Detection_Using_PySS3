My dad is a minor alcoholic I never really knew about it until this year, but his job and overall life situation made him drink a lot heavier (this started years ago) and I just need to get it off my chest I guess. 

I know it runs in our family and itâ€™s kinda scary that I could go down that road too, especially after my run-in last year. I was silently struggling with a drinking problem for the entirety of last year and some of this year, but Iâ€™m doing a lot better now. Just scary to think about. I donâ€™t need comfort or anything, but I think going in somewhere like reddit, where Iâ€™m basically an anonymous stranger, gives me some sort of solace
