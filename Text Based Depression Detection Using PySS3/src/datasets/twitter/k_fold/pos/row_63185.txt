My school district is abusing Chromebook enterprise enrollment Why do I have to use DNS blocking to view something that is blocked for no good reason  
Why do I have to reset my password every time I log into Twitter in order to prevent the admin-forced proxy from blocking the password verification packets  
Why do I have to log into my account from old Reddit, then switch to New Reddit just to avoid the same problem I was talking about with Twitter (I'm probably gonna get hated on for using New Reddit, but I'm more used to New Reddit OK?)  
Why do I have to use an outdated and highly insecure version of ChromeOS (Hell, even Google themselves recommend not using the update blocker feature unless absolutely, ABSOLUTELY, neccesary and I don't think it is in this case)  
Why is it that themes and a lot of popular extentions are blocked I just want dark mode and better privacy man  
Why is it that experimental features that would probably be genuiently useful are blocked  
This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the many (Often major) annoyances/restrictions that is possible with abusive admins and enterprise enrollment
