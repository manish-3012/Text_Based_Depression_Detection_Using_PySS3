I had a mental breakdown at the doctor's office today So I was at the doctor's for a physical, and my doctor kept talking on and on, and she didnt stop for an hour. Then my dad explained to her that my cat passed away, that and the talkative doctor, caused me to have a mental breakdown and I started crying in the bathroom and left early. I never did get the physical.
