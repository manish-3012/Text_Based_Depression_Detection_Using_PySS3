Iâ€™m leaving reddit I watched this place fall from â€œgloryâ€ to nothing but a cesspool of adult children that go around and mock people that have what they donâ€™t for the most part. There is a couple good communities on here but the negatives outweigh the positives. If you want to take my advice, leave this godforsaken place. And
1. Stop watching porn. Itâ€™s absolutely crushing you.
2. go out and talk to some people in person if you can.
3. When in a conversation be as unbiased as possible, look more towards facts instead just off someoneâ€™s feeling, keep a good mixture
4. If you want anything good in this world you have to work for it, So go and start now, if you want to lose some fat just start doing push-ups and sit-ups, then do a mile run its gonna take a while to get going but itâ€™s so rewarding once you get into it.
5. donâ€™t be prejudiced to other people for their beliefs and views.

This is a final goodbye, iâ€™m deleting my account soon. Good luck to all of you
