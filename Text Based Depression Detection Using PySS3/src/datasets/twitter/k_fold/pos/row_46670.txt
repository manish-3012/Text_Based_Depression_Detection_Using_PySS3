okay i need some help So my bf is mod and a co-founder of a discord server. And he really loves his server. Long story short the creator of the server got pissed and left because people kept calling them names and there's a new person trying become a mod so they can completely wipe that server in order to "restore glory". My bf however is not giving them mod permissions because of that. And he is really stressed because of it. I dont want to see him sad. I want to do something for him. After all he loves me a lot. Some users in that server are siding against my bf. I want to help him but I only joined that server very recently and I dont have enough history for it to stand up for my bf. What should i do?
