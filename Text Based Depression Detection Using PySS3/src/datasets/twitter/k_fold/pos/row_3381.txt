Living life as the child of a Karen Well, today she;


*Reprimanded a hairdresser

*Told the coffee shop manager that she didn't ask for sugar in her decaf because it causes cancer. (apparentlyðŸ™„) 

*It was mine and it was actually an Americano. 

*Took her mask off in the shopping mall.

*Tried to get me to take mine off.

*I said no.


***She ACTUALLY ALLOWED IT***.
