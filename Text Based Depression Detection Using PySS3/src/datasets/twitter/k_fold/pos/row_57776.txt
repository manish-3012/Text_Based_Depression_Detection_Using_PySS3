how do i talk to other people i met a few people at my new school recently. they have the same interests as me. whenever i try to talk to them, i always stutter and mix up my words. i also start talking really quietly without noticing. and when im talking to teachers, it seems that im always talking too quiet for them to understand. none of that has happened while talking to my parents. i dont know why that happens. it seems so easy for other people. can anyone help me?
