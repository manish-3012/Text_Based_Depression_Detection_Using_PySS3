everytime I visit my cousins I feel so dead when I come back home I had a very different childhood compared to my cousins, they had a very happy and go lucky childhood, and the whole family together is just such a nice and happy family, and I wished I had that and like when I visit them or see them I get so happy and just get on such a high from being with my cousins and the family but when I come back home I just feel so dead and empty inside, like yeah it's a pretty depressing thing to say but that's how I feel, I'm home alone all day, my mom is a single mother that is always working, my older brother is in new York for college and has been there ever since I was in 8th grade and now I'm in 11th, i just wished things weren't like this, I want a family, I want a happy and energetic home, not a quiet and depressing home, idk what the point of this post is but I just wanted to get this out
