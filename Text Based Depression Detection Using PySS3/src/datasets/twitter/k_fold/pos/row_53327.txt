Help me out here guys...  I'm gonna start off by saying that I have literally not looked at a living thing for the past 4 months. I have been living alone since the pandemic. Parents are in London and cannot return any time soon due to the travel restrictions in my country. I am feeling lonely af and probably WILL go insane in a few weeks lol.

Dad said they were trying to come back home but like i said our country hasn't eased travel restrictions yet. And doesn't plan to anytime soon. I got dumped before the pandemic started so, I am really sad and fucked up all the time. Dad transferred me money and I've been living off instant noodles and biscuits cuz i don't know how to cook. Dad said it will take him 2 months more to reach home and he does sound genuinely worried cuz he can tell by my voice that i'm sad.

I keep gaming but i don't feel like playing games all the time anymore. I don't wanna go out because none of my friend's parents are allowing us to meet up due to obvious reasons.

The point of the post is - Where can i get a pet?

I don't care if it's a doggo or a kitten. I just need a living being with me. Haha, it's okay to say i want to feel loved i guess lmao. I looked up on google if there are any animal shelters nearby to no avail. And as long as i know, there are no animals on the street for me to adopt.

Can anyone tell me where/how can i get a pet? Rest assured i am good enough to take care of it. If anyone can point me in the right direction, it would be great thanks!
