WHY DO PEOPLE CARE?! People who's against anything, like homosexuality or how they look like, I mean why do homophobic people care about what others like,  dude let them do whatever they want cause it doesnt affect you in any way, like if I like to wear skirts at my house leave me f*king alone, its not your problem and I'm so mad about it.
And ik about religion and stuff but its not your life, and dont try to "save them" from hell and shit if they dont want.
This type of shit makes me so angry...
