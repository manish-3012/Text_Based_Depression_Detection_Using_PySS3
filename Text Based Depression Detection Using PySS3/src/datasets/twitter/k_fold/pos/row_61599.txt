anygays, here it is and if *you* are reading this, dm me your name in reddit so i know its you, enjoy


I know you have a boyfriend wich, with all respect, i didnt expect.

I know you remember when i said i loved you and you said you didnt love me back. 
I recently said i dont have a crush on you anymore.. I wish i spoke the truth because i know you still see me as a bro and that is the only thing that i find not perfect about you.
You are absolutely perfect in all aspects: mentally and physycally.
You are beautiful, funny, caring and the most perfect person i have ever met.

You are the girl i love and i am locked to you, everytime i think i am over you, i'm happy because i dont want to fall in love with you because i know you'll never love me back but then i see you and i fall in love with you all over again..

i miss you, even when you are sitting right next to me.

you are the one i have loved from the moment we were friends and i still love you with my soul and hart.

i just hope your current boyfriend is good for you but if this is just you playing hard to get for some reason, i don't know if i can be together with you because i'm scared i'm going to hurt you..

in short: I love you.
