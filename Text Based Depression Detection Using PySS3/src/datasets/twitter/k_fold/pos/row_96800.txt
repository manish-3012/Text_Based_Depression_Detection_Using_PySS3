A Group of friends I've known for 5+ years decided to cut me off fully. K I'm gonna keep it short and sweet since no one's gonna give a rat's ass about it,a few weeks ago most of the people in my friend group decided to treat me like I don't exist and treat me like a pile of garbage besides only one of them, who I'm still really really good friends with, thinking of just cutting most of them off as well instead of trying to solve the problem. I have no idea what I did to deserve this,I haven't said anything offensive. Any advice?

Part 2: Yea the person who I said I'm still really good friends with is deciding to ignore me now and probably shit talks me with the rest of them in their insta gc without me.even though I've done nothing wrong. GGs ig
