Mmm I'm so scared of growing up lol Like nobody has ever really given a shit about me. And that'll just get worse

Nobody will be there to help me or to care about me

I'm 17, I'm gonna be an adult soon. I wish I was 13 again... 


Like god I'm already worthless but like as a kid, you can't do much. But I can't do anything. I dont have any talents. I can't contribute to anything. So I'm gonna be even more worthless as I age. And I'm scared 

I don't want responsibilities. I want someone to care for me. To care about me. But I'm gonna age some and well.. That's it. I'm all alone. No teachers, no councilors, no principles... 

When I have a panic attack in public people aren't gonna think "oh no I hope they're ok. Let me see what I can do". They're gonna think "oh who's this psycho"

I'm not gonna be young and naive, im gonna be some dumb dipshit

I'm gonna have to do stuff on my own. I'm gonna have to be alone in public. That's so hard for me. I'm gonna be all alone. Nobody to help


Even if it was the teachers jobs, the counsilers job... It felt good to be cared about, you know? 


I'm scared. I'm not sure if I can take it... I don't want to do it, I don't see any upside to being an adult


Anyway, sorry for the rant again. This anonymity is comforting...
