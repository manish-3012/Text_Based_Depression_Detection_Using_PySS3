Iâ€™m getting sick of this but I canâ€™t leave I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Iâ€™ve known this guy for 2 years now, and all that he does is just toxic. I get yelled at for asking questions or simply not responding to a text fast enough for his liking. 

I have to watch what I send to him because I donâ€™t want to aggravate him. Iâ€™ve broken down so many times talking to him because of things heâ€™s said but havenâ€™t told him because, again, I donâ€™t want to piss him off more.

But I feel bad. Iâ€™m the only person he has to talk to, and heâ€™s always home alone. Heâ€™s really depressed and Iâ€™m trying to help but I Think Iâ€™m just making it worse.
