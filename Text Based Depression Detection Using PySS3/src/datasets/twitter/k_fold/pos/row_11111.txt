I don't know what to do about this. I've been feeling like absolute shit for a long time. Barely getting any sleep and not eating much at all and it shows. I've attempted to commit suicide, failed, and for the last few months I've been alternating between small pockets of almost-happiness, stress, depression, and anger at myself for not being able to fight it. Honestly I can't even list the sheer number of things I find wrong with myself.  


Today I was doing ELA homework and listening to my music playlist when I got a text from someone I've loved for a long time. He said he was going to kill himself, and he was sorry to just randomly "spring it on me". Like it was a minor inconvenience. So...now what? I can't even fully process this.
