I lost 7.5 kgs / 16.5 lbs  it's not much but it's a lot for me, after getting body shamed a lot from since I was 9 or smth  (15 now) I've been struggling with dieting and stuff all my life but rn I'm going to the gym a lot and I'm on a good diet. I wasn't like huge or anything but I had manboobs (still do but it's almost gone) and it always made me uncomfortable on vacations or smth or whenever I took my shirt off. Only around 4 kilos to get to my ideal weight now. :)

Also, to anybody getting body shamed, You are awesome and you can do it and never let anyone make you hate your own body. You are beautiful :)

(sorry idk what flair to pick)
