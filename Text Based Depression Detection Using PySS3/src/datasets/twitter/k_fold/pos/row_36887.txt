Guess who kissed a girl Ok i(17m) am incel with social anxiety so I've never been able to get a partner that meaningful to me. The other day though I decided to ask a girl out since I was feeling confident and wanted to see if she would say yes. She's a big qt from my band class and for some reason she said yes when I asked her to a movie. It was the 40th anniversary of empire strikes back on Saturday and nothing else good was playing so I decided to take her to that, which she
 seemed fine with. I picked her up around 6 and we talked for a while in my car, found out she plays Witcher 3 and watches anime we some things in common. I payed for our tickets and food and we went to the theater, noone else was there so we talked for a while in the theater before the movie started

A few minutes into the movie I asked if I could hold her hand and she said yes, we kept holding hands for most of the movie. A while into the movie I kissed her on the cheek and I even kissed her for real close to the end of the movie. 

After we made out in my car for a while and I took her home and I have never felt happier 

Tl;Dr: I took girl on date and kissed, was nice
