I feel pressured Everyone is saying how strong I am and how I should keep my head up and stay strong and stuff like that. I feel pressured to hide how I really feel right now. I have to make sure people donâ€™t worry about me. 

But what they all donâ€™t know is that Iâ€™m completely broken. Iâ€™ve gotten so close to try ending it all again. Iâ€™m struggling so fucking much!!! I just want all my pain to stop, mental and physical. 

I feel like Iâ€™m being tortured. Yet I canâ€™t show that. I have to be happy, and it just tears me down even more...
