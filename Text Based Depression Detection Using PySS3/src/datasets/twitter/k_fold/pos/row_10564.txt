I change my opinions quickly don't I I just made a post asking for people to comment since I have this thing where at night normally when I'm about or when I'm trying to sleep I get really paranoid and anxious sometimes I get a full on panic attack and loss my sense of surrounding and everything from the paranoia and anxiety and in the post I made I just wanted people to comment because since I just felt like I needed to hear or see some people typing or just interacting with someone but I decided it's probably healthier if I try and confront it since it's been this way since I was 2 and I just want to know if anyone else has this problem or if you have any advice I'll add more details in the comments.
