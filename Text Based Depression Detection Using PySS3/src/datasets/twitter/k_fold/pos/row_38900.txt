Ha, Relyks, we are almost there This is it. I can feel it. The string started with a spark, you Relyks, but it has traveled far. So close. If all goes according to plan, pain will be gone forever, because pain=happiness. It's too bad she isn't here right now. If she were we could finish it right now. But you scared here away. She is gone. I hope she comes back. I need her for just one last thing. Then it will be all over. All over :) Heh.
