High Blood Sugar Iâ€™ve been feeling really bad recently, and searched online and found out that I have all the symptoms of high blood sugar. Is this a problem? I donâ€™t know what to do or if I need to do anything right now. Iâ€™m having trouble sleeping and my veins will hurt every once and a while. Please can I have some advice on what to do or something telling me about it?
