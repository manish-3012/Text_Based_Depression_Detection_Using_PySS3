Well Ã©motions 100 I am writing my overwatch fanfiction about widowmaker and recently I wrote more about characters I created. I am writing about a new character, that enters the action after her boyfriend died in their home's ruins after an omnic attack. And I authentically had this discomfort in my chest like when I'm really sad. I got into the action too much xD
