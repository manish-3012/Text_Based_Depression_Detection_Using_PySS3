Have you ever went out of your comfort zone to make new friends? Iâ€™m not really â€œintrovertedâ€, everyone needs time for themselves but other than that Iâ€™m quite out going and I love to get involved in things and for the most part I would say Iâ€™m not exactly the annoying type either unless I was purposely trying to annoy someone.

Especially during lockdown Iâ€™ve just been wanting to try to make new friends specifically from my school. I can easily find an excuse and a way to talk to someone if theyâ€™re in my classes but when Iâ€™m interested in being friends with someone who isnâ€™t in any of my classes I have NO idea how to be friends with them.

So basically Iâ€™m wondering what people have done that was maybe a weird way of making a new friend or something that was done out of your comfort zone?

I was wanting to maybe reply to peoples Instagram stories if they posted something that I can make a conversation out of, Iâ€™ve done this once a few weeks ago but Iâ€™m not sure if I should pop up to them again?
