Made a poem story thing, idk what to call it. Tell me how y'all like it, its my first time :p A friend of yours gives you a doll.
Right before bed, you put the doll on your shelf.
A few hours later, you wake up at around midnight.
You stare at the doll and get an uneasy feeling.
You get up to move the doll..
But suddenly it stands up and a demonic, faintly glowing smile grows on its face.
You back up slowly. Shaking in fear, as the doll slowly turns into some sort of demon.
The sounds of bones cracking, muscles squeezing, and guts growing makes you're ears bleed.
Suddenly you're pinned by the beast. Seconds before it starts tearing you limb by limb.
The demons starts eating your limbs.
As your soul watches the demon devour you.
The grim reaper appears behind you, and grabs you by you're throat. Dragging you to the under world.
You see scolding flames as high as mountains, tired and thin slaves painfully working, and the screams of the sinners fills you're ears. Chipping away at you're sanity.
Then suddenly you're face to face with the devil himself..
You feel a dreadful chill crawl down you're spine as the devil gives u an intense look.
He sits there, pondering to himself how you should spend the rest of eternity.
Suddenly you get the feeling you're being stabbed. Over, and over, and over again by 100 swords.
The pain gets worse, and worse every time it happens.
You start to feel numb.
Eventually, you burst out a blood curdling scream.
The devil grins and let's out a deep terrifying laugh as you scream.
Spending the rest of eternity in hell..
