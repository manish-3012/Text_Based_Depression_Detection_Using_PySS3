I need help Hello there, I am not depressed or anything, I'm just lost in life and I feel like a failure. I am generally a very optimistic person, I pick myself up very fast and move on with life. But this feels like a major hurdle I can't seem to see myself crossing...

I just finished high school and I am in the first year of junior college on a scholarship. I never really loved the science stream but I am good at science subjects. I have always loved art and I could do it forever if I could but never had the bravery to learn it officially due to my parents and my friends saying it is a waste of my talents.

So in my first year during the quarantine I went through an existential crisis. I wondered about how insignificant I was so I tried looking for my calling. I tried learning to draw and I was surprised how persistent I was. For the first time I actually had the drive to do something and it was my reason to wake up in the morning.

This time I don't have my parents with me cuz I am overseas. I thought it was just an impulsive decision so I kept it quiet for 3 months, which is about the period of time I lose interest in something I thought I would do as a career such as coding. But it's been 5 months now and I still love learning to draw, like studying anatomy, perspective, capturing motion and character design on my own.

And now I am lagging behind my studies, I am getting crappy grades, have no motivation to study school stuff, worried I won't get to second year which means the cancellation of my  scholarship. I called my parents, told them that I want to pursue a career in art and of course they are shocked and disappointed. Them finding out about my grades didn't help too. I don't know what I should do. I want to just drop out of junior college and enter polytechnic school to study art.

My parents aren't rich which I am aware of, and I don't want them to incur the cost of my scholarship which contractually obligate my parents to pay the cost of my accommodation and first year school fee if I don't get to second year. They also told me that they will not financially support me if I pursue art. But I feel like I am wasting my life not pursuing what I want. 

What should I do? I know it isn't the biggest problem anyone has faced but I just don't know what to do...
