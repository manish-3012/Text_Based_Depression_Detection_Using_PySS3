These feelings are actually so strong Im M17 living in Milwaukee actually wanting to lose my virginity asap. This urge to relieve myself are insane. Theyre starting to overcome every thought. I can only think about other things for so long. I just need some advice to calm my nerves because i know i need to chill out but liiike its so hard (literally). These feelings to come from left field and hit like a truck. And its not like im popular enough to know people willing to help me out get it on. Im just stuck thinking and hoping some time soon. Ive been contemplating i might want a fwb relation when in older to help myself or maybe i need to go to church i have no clue.
Thnx for reading
Bye now
