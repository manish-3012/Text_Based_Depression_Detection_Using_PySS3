How do you fall asleep? I can't fall asleep easily since I suffer from anxiety and stress. Every night I am trapped in my plaguing thoughts that won't leave me alone. I usually end up 2/3 hours rotating in my bed and still can't fall asleep. I'm always sleepy at school and when I need to sleep I'm always not sleepy.
