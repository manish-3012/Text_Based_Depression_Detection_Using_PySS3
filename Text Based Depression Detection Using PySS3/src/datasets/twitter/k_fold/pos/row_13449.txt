The girl I liked is now spreading lies about me I donâ€™t know how to explain the gradual decent today, it began as a laugh, then I got more and more concerned for myself, turns out a girl I liked and was friend with for more then a few months last year has been spreading lies about me. She told me she wanted some time but I guess she has no problem standing people up for almost a year, she told my friend that I sent people after her to make her feel bad about herself, I have stood awake until 4 am to talk to her for the exact opposite reason, she said that I stalked her and followed her around, when all I did was accidentally run into her at school and go on her bus to talk to my friends. She accused me of sending her perverted messages when the furthest I went to her was telling her she looked nice and that she didnâ€™t have to worry about herself. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
