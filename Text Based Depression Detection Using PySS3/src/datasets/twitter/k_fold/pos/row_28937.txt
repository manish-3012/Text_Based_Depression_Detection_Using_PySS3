Stop complaining, itâ€™s the internet. What do you expect? Yes, stop. People are complaining about how the subreddit is changing and no longer what it used to be. Well what do you expect, its the internet and worst of all its a subreddit with a bunch of teenagers going through puberty. Why would one even have specific expectations from an online community?  I get that people miss the old days when there were apparently quality posts..so what? Were you expecting that to last forever? 

Sorry if this seems harsh, but it is what it is. Stop expecting something decent from an online community filled with people varying in ages and views.
