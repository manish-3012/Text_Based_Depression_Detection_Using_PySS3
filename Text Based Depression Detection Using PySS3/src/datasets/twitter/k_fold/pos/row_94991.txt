This shouldn't even be possible I will not use the real names of the people involved in this story.

So, well my weird orange friend had a friend we call ghost guy and I always said: "Ghost guy is the least ugly nerd!" Where responded to with: "Fuck, him, then..." That summer I lay down with a guy who looked a little bit like ghost guy... I made me feel a little bit uncomfortable but I gave it a chance, but after giving a good look I discovered that he even had the same belly button as Ghost Guy and I started yelling and felt sick for the rest of the night!
