I'm so needy I'm not doing much better tonight. I had a happy day but I'm just alone when I end up in bed.

I need to be held right now, but there's no chance I will be. I want to make someone feel warm and safe by resting my head on his shoulder, arm on his chest. I want someone to spoon me to make me feel safe, too.

I honestly want a boyfriend more than I ever have.
