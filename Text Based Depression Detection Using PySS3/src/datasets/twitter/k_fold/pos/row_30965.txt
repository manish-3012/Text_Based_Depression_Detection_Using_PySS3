Is it a sign if a girl laughs to your jokes and gives you a cookie? I have a crush to this girl in our theatre group, i've known her for years. We are almost ready at our play, we are gonna premiere it when covid ends. I cracked a few jokes last week, and she laughed. She has always liked my jokes, but never really come talking to me. She gave me a cookie last time we saw. I said i'll give her a cookie next time, but kow we can't meet cuz covid has got worse. Is this a sign? should i confess to her.?
