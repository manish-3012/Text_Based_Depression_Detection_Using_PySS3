I've been so gay lately I'm bisexual, and I'm think I'm turning full gay, girls don't interest me at all anymore, I used to love looking at pictures of pretty women now I'm like "ðŸ˜ ok", I unfollowed so many girls that used to turn me on on Instagram I dont have feelings towards any of them anymore, I'm looking at their pics and im like "why do I even follow you??" And the other hand, Ive been perplexed with emotions on how much I want a bf ðŸ¤¤
