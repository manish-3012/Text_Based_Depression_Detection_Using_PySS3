one of my friends is making me really uncomfortable, and I donâ€™t really know what to do  Iâ€™m a gay female, and my friend is male. we have been friends for abt half a year, and he knows that i like girls. though recently, he has been talking abt how much he wants a girlfriend, and he tells me that im cute and he would date me if i was straight. he also sent me a meme that said he would like to eat my ass (ewwww) and i dont know if heâ€™s joking or not. yesterday and today heâ€™s been pressuring me to come over to his house, and i keep making excuses.

even if he is joking, his behavior has made me super uncomfortable and since we are friends i just cant find a way to politely say that he is making me uncomfortable, i donâ€™t want to hurt his feelings or anything (he gets rejected a lot)



tldr: im a lesbian and one of my guy friends has made me super uncomfortable, and I donâ€™t know how to tell him to stop
