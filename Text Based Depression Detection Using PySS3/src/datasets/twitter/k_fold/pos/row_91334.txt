Guess the song 2 Difficulty: medium

I told myself: "If I go out, then I'ma light my wrist" (boom)
If I die today, I'm happy for the life I live (blah, blah)
And my son is only three, he be like: "Mama rich"
Told him: "Go outside to play, just be inside by six" (ay)
I done made my n***as proud, you ain't gotta love me (good)
Give a f*ck about your opinion, only God could judge me (blah, blah)
