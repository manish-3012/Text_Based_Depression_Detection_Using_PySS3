That moment when youâ€™re about to get on the train and the door doesnâ€™t open so you just kinda awkwardly stand there while everyone else just gets on the train and stares at you because they donâ€™t know why you arenâ€™t getting on Happens too often for me. 

Anyways Iâ€™m getting a burger, you want any?
