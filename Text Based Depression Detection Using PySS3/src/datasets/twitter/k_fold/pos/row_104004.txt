Tiktok is destroying brain cells wE hAtE tIkToK bUt Do ThEy HaTe Us? MaKe PeAcE wItH eM iN tH...

My best friendâ€™s little sister was some kind of nerd before, serious, working, good grades and all... 
But since she downloaded tiktok, she started doing those cringy hand dance, posting pics and videos of herself and doing thot like things. Luckily my friend keeps her from being totally dumb.

Another exemple:
I nearly had a crush on that shy girl in my class who was always drawing. She was pretty introverted and only talked when it was necessary.
Then she downloaded tiktok. Bruh. Personality change 1000%. She did cringy tiktok and fortnite dances. She was getting dumb friends. Became loud. And totally changed clothes style. I was like â€˜ok now itâ€™s too late, she canâ€™t be savedâ€™ and lost my interest in her.

There was also a simp in my class who did tiktok stuff but letâ€™s not talk about it.

Tiktok is like a brain cell destroying virus, spreading from girl to girl, and sometimes to unvaccinated guys. 
Guys the real pandemic isnâ€™t the coronavirus but this fucking shit named tiktok. If every women on Earth are tiktokers,  I swear I will turn myself in a chinese monk and staying alone for the rest of my life.
