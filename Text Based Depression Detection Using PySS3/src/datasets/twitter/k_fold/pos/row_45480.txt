I'm kinda trapped on my antidepressants. Drug dependence. Dependence and addiction are different. Zoloft doesn't make me addicted. It doesn't make me high. I would describe it as wearing glasses in a world where most people have decent vision just to live somewhat normally. Well 2 years down the line you find you are better. That you don't really need your meds anymore and so you try to go without them. never ever should you quit anti depressants cold turkey. I got these weird intermittent feelings of being high almost,  as if my Brain was being electrocuted every 5 seconds. Eventually that feeling will intensify to what feels like explosions of sparks inside the skull. My emotions become really fucked and my anxiety becomes significantly unbearable. I become nastier to everybody around me and it has some almost paranoia like symptoms. It's drug withdrawal, what do you expect?  

But you take a zoloft pill and all of it goes back to normal. It's crazy really. That's what's fucked.
