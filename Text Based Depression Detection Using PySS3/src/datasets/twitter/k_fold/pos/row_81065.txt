Pregnancy scare So I 18F am in a long distance relationship with my BF 20M and he came up to visit over the holidays and we engaged in certain unprotected activities and had a pregnancy scare till I was able to get an accurate test result this morning, and it hasn't hit us of what we did till a few days later as our likelyhood of even conceiving was really low as I'd just ended my period, so long story short the past few weeks have just been us worrying over what to do if I was pregnant from our activities and deciding that no matter what we were going to be okay and with each other and tackle it together, and I've had a long range of emotions about this from fear of not knowing to even a little excitement of starting a family with this man who I've been with for 4 years, which scares me I mean hell I'm still in HS, anyways I was wondering if anyone else has been through anything remotely similar, and if my feelings of slight disappointment are valid or if they are manipulative, because he isn't ready to have kids, and I worry about trapping him in our relationship.
