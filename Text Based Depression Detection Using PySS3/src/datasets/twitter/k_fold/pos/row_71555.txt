This really pisses me off, if the government can't help California, who can?

My school created a fundraiser to help with the wildfires, link in my description, Please donate.

Devastating wildfires continue to burn across California, including six of the largest fires in the stateâ€™s history. In the last two months, flames have burned through as many as 3.4 million acres of land and nearly 5,400 structures have been destroyed. And wildfire season is just getting underway â€“ historically, California experiences the most devastating fires in September and October.

To support all impacted residents, the Red Cross is working closely with community partners across California to provide evacuees with safe refuge and immediate relief. Disaster workers are also supporting residents with mental and physical health care, providing needed prescription refills, replacing lost eyeglasses and offering hope that recovery is possible.Â
