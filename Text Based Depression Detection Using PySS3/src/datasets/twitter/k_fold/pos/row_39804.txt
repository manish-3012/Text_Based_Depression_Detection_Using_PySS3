I've been filled with nostalgia. The pandemic made me realise that all these years all I did was nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
I chose the wrong friends throughout my life. 
Stopped doing the things that I love. 
Stared at the ceiling for hours. 
Wasted a lot of time scrolling through social media. 
Let people fuck my life up. 
Trusted a whole bunch of a**holes.
I was way too obsessed with numbers especially my weight and stopped myself from enjoying life. 

So if you're seeing this please take that chance and do the thing you love life's way too short.
