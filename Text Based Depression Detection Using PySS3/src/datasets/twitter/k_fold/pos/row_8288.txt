I just cut all ties with my crush/best friend I met this guy about a year and I fell in love with him almost instantly he was so charismatic and cute and I loved to be around him but as time grew on he stopped wanting to see me and we only talked over discord tho he obviously liked talking to me as heâ€™d get mad when I didnâ€™t, we tried dating and he called it off after I let him know I was still exploring other options as we werenâ€™t truly dating (he had admitted to the same thing a day before) and ever since he had made me feel it was a privilege to talk to him and  that he was above me, I was always scared of upsetting him and whenever I came to my sense and stopped talking for a few days he would threaten suicide or tell me he loved or ask to take my virginity, I even changed a lot about my own sexuality to be appealing to him, sacrificed things I enjoyed (Iâ€™m a closeted femboy which he didnâ€™t like) and generally just idolised him, very recently he introduced me to another guy, a joke due to our identical personalities and names who slowly has made me realise that I donâ€™t love him, I love the idea of him and that for the past year I have been used and exploited for validation and my self esteem has been driving to the ground to feed his ego, Iâ€™ve finalised realised that for these past 13 months Iâ€™ve been in an abusive relationship (without even the admittedly few benefits) and I just want to say to anyone in my position, just because youâ€™re not dating it doesnâ€™t mean it isnâ€™t abuse, you shouldnâ€™t be in fear of your friends and how you might upset them with every little thing you say
