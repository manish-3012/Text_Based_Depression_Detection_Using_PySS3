Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 64 Late facts are best facts.   


As always, if you have questions about space OR topics you'd like to see a fact on, you can let me know in the comments! See you tomorrow!  


Fact: You all know the iconic image of a rocket launch. The clouds coming out of the side of the rocket on the pad from the liquid oxygen in the tanks, the countdown, and the engine ignition, followed by the bright light, the plume, and the awesome *roar* it creates. Rockets are diverse, but there's one thing that most of these scenes have in common: the launch pad.

Notice how I said *most?* Yeah, that's because not all rockets actually launch from the ground! Sure, 99% of them do, but there are a select few that have launched from the *air*. The advantage of this is simple: when you're higher up in the atmosphere, there's less air to push through to get to space.

It all started in 1959, with NASA's legendary X-15 *hypersonic* rocket-powered craft. This absolute monster was "launched" from the wing of a B-52 bomber, and was capable of reaching speeds of up to ***4,520 miles per hour***. That's mach 6.7!! This set the record for the highest speed ever recorded by a crewed aircraft, a record that is still unbroken! The X-15 was mainly an atmospheric vehicle, but it did technically enter space a few times, so 8 X-15 pilots did earn their astronaut wings. This included Neil Armstrong!

However, the first orbital air-launched rocket didn't come until 1990. This was Orbital Science's Pegasus. Orbital Sciences operated this thing, launched from the wing of a Lockheed L-1011 jet, until 2018, when they were bought by Northrop Grumman. So yes, the first privately-owned rocket to reach orbit was launched from a plane!!

And finally, we come to the present. Just yesterday, Virgin Orbit (yes, just like the airliner) successfully "launched" their LauncherOne rocket into orbit for the very first time!! This thing is a *beast,* and is the first air-launched rocket to use liquid propellant. Also, the 747 it launches from has an awesome name. "Cosmic Girl". Congrats to Virgin Orbit for becoming only the 4th company to make it, and by doing it in such a unique way!!
