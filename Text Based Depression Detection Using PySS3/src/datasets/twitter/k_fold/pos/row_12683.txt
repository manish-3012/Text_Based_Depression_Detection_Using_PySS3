How do I reconnect with a friend? I use an app on my phone that allows me to learn Japanese with people who are from Japan that are learning English. About a month ago, I made a friend. We bonded because we have the same name, interests, and language learning skills. We havenâ€™t talked in a bit, so how do I strike up a conversation?
