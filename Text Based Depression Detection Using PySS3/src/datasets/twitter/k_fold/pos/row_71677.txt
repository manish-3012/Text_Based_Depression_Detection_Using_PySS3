I hope your'e all doing fine We all have our ups and downs and i just wanna say, tell your friends you appreciate them, it could make their day. Like two weeks ago one of my friends suddenly said he likes hanging out with me and how he's happy when im around, and im honestly so stoked to hear someone appreciates me even if i keep telling myself noone likes me.

So i guess to tell your friends you appreciate them, let them know what their company means to you :) &lt;3
