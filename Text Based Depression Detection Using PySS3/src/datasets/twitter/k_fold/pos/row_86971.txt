did you get Pokemon cards banned at school when i was younger, my parents would take me to Pacific Mall every weekend. one day when i went there, one of the stores sold fake Pokemon card booster boxes. i got tons of Level X cards (this was around 2011) from them. i then traded them with the other kids. soon they then realized they were fake so they told the teacher. after that they were banned. any of you guys out there have a similar experience?
