Am I a simp? I was walking home with my two best friends [both girls I am a guy] when we where stopped by a group of sophomores and they where trying to get my friends to get in their car and go "party" with them [I know what they meant] and I told them to just leave us alone and the 3 of them got out and started threatening me to get lost or I would get jumped so I called their bluff and got in the "alphas" face when he said get them I punched him in the face and yelled for my friends too run and they did and I fought for as long as I could and my friends got home safe and now im at the hospital and only my dad is allowed to see me because of covid and I just got my phone from the doctors. also one of them had a knife and cut my arm after that it was just me trying to not die
