magnum,

im sorry. im sorry there isnâ€™t a way for me to help you. im sorry that we wonâ€™t be able to see each other anymore. im sorry i canâ€™t take you on your favourite hikes. im sorry youâ€™re in pain. im sorry i canâ€™t walk you to dairy queen and get you a bowl of ice cream. im sorry i canâ€™t laugh anymore when you splash water all over me. im sorry that we canâ€™t play together. im sorry you will never see devin again. you have done so much for me but im asking for one more favour. please watch over emma forever and make sure sheâ€™s ok. remember to do all of your favourite things and be happy. 

im really going to miss you,
take care and live on â¤ï¸
