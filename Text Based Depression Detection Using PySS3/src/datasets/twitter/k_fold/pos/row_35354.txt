My great grandpa passed away He lived in Connecticut while i live in texas so we couldnt talk much.

He was good at football and loved it with a passion and i just got into football. I constantly was hoping to meet him and tell him how my team was undefeated. 

I play center and he did too.

I knew he would be proud. Although i never really knew him, i really wanted to know him. We were both fans of football and i knew we could talk about so much if we knew eachother. 

It pains me to know i couldnt tell him i wanted to play college football just like he did

But he was 95 and he was ready to see his wife

Thank you for inspiring me gramps.

Sorry i just really needed to vent and get it out
