Hmu I'm illðŸ˜’ Hi stranger(for now), I'm 18 from the UK.

A little about me:
I was born in london and lived there for about 8 years, then my family decided to move up to Scotland and tbh its beautiful here. However I will be moving back down in about 2 months for my future career in the military. I will be joining the Air force as an aircraft engineer and can't wait. Don't even get me started on how super duper excited I am! Anyways I will hopefully travel the world and explore lots of different places and cultures around the world. I'm quite an open guy about that kinda stuff and respect everything as much as I can as it is very important to do so.

Interests:
Fitness- I am really into fitness, both cardio and weights, especially at this time. I run twice a week and have 3 min workout sessions. I think it's really important to keep fit and healthy as it really helps with your mentality and mind state. So if your not doing a physical activity at least once a day get it going. As well as diet and nutrition which is a key factor for it
Music- I am into American rap as well as pop music but tbh I'm down to listen to whatever. My fav artists rn are lil baby and Lewis calpaldi. 
Gaming- I like to game occasionally, not much tho cause I just have time really. But when I do I play Cod and Gta. 
Driving and cars- I love to drive around, its so fun. If you look on my profile you will see my dad's car and what a beast it is haha. Whenever I'm at traffic lights I always think someone is tryna race me, so I floor itðŸ¤£. 
Others- I like to go for walks at the coast and am open to try literally whatever activity/sport you have for me. Eg mountain walk, bike ride, skiing etc

So ye, if you got this far good on you. DM me or something. 

If not then you have a great and successful lifeðŸ‘ðŸ˜‰
