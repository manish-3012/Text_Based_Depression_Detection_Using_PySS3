Polish education system Like, its so dumb. All of my teachers with the exception of one gave me grades, this one history teacher doesnt grade me! She has list of kids she hast to grade and at this point she probably graded everyone but me! If i dont get any grades untill this semester ends (in 2 months, which is the same amount of time i have left to prepare for an important as fuck exam) this teacher might ruin my life(i should also mention that she comes back on april 22 so yeah) also im in 8th grade right now so if i dont get at least 3 grades in the span of these 2 months i wont graduate from 8th grade to college n shit therefore, ruining my life. I just hope that we get a test (we dont have any since, well we are still learning from home) with our substitute teacher (which is also vice-principal of our school) so that i can get a couple of them at least, even 3 C'S would be great.




TL;DR: my history teacher fucked up big time and that caused me to have no grades
