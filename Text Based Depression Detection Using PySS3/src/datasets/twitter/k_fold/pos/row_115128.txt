Spiderman PS4 Silver Lining DLC Review This is the last spiderman DLC, the game as a whole was great from start to finish, could I say *amazing*. The story has this amazing moment where all 3 DLC stories connect, and it also continues one of my favorite parts so far which is the Yuri Watanabe story. I just was disappointed by how inactive the side story, as it was just "ok here's everywhere you go to find the story and you have to find a little package there to listen to the story. 

The main full DLC story was amazing and the final part where you fight hammerhead again was wonderful especially with that epic part where the lazer goes all like *psheeeew* and spiderman is trying to hold hammerhead still.

The side content was also alright, I personally didnt like the change in sensory with the hammerhead hideouts, but they added those fancy lights so it's fine, like I can imagine them thinking now the place looks amazing with these perfect lights up. Screwball was alright, there were just en oi uhh missions for me to not want to break the controller, except in the final chase where she has those stupid fricking drones.

All in of it together was an amazing playthrough of this dlc. 5.5/7

Now the full game + DLC. The game was a great way to show what great movement is like, and it should set an example for games to come. But IGN was wrong I didn't feel like spiderman at all 6/7
