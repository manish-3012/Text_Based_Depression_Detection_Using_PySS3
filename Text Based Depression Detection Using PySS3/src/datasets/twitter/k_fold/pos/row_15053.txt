I donâ€™t like getting old When I look at the age flairs of some users and I see 13, 14, 15, I feel such envy. I feel like my early teenage years were wasted because of depression and anxiety and I could have enjoyed them more. I miss the innocence, doing a lot of things for the first time, spending time with my friends at school, being a bit more independent but not too much. Everything was exciting. I wish I could have seen it then. Today Iâ€™m starting college and I feel really old. I donâ€™t want to feel like this. I donâ€™t want to look at this period of my life 5 years from now and feel the same way I do now. I just feel weird
