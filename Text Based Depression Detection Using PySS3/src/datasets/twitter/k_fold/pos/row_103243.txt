I need to vent, I am so mad rn last year I was going on my youth group's 2020 mission trip. I had gone to the 2019 one and I enjoyed it, I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to come but he didn't want to go to the 2020 or 2019. I was a part of the planning and fundraising for the 2020 mission trip. I even did public speaking (my worst nightmare), planned, and did the kid's sermon on stage for the 2020 mission trip fundraiser. I was supposed to have a partner to help but she did nothing besides show up and bring glowsticks. the 2020 mission trip was canceled but they still did a local trip instead. I could not go because they did not social distance or wear masks. they completely forgot about me.

So now the planning for the 2021 mission trip has started. I messaged the youth leader asking what the options are for me to go on the 2021 mission trip because my family is being very cautious of Coivd. He tells me that the signups ended 2 days ago and that all the spots are full.... they never told anyone about the end date through social media or online... they only told the people who go to youth group in person the due date.. and they know that I can't go to in-person youth group right now and they have zero options for virtual. not only that but of course my boyfriend decides to go on the one mission trip that I can't go on.  they said the only way that I can go is if someone drops out.. even though they know this might be the last mission trip I can go on.

It's been a year since covid started. I'm one of the only ones that can't go to in-person youth group and they know that but they have not done a damn thing to reach out to me. they have not done anything. they only care about the people that can go in person and I'm not one of them. I had gone to their youth group for years and they forgot about me in 5 minutes.
