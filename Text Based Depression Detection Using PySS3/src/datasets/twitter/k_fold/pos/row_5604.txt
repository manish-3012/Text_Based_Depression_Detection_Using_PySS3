I fucked up bad... I (15f) showed my little brother (8m) a post mocking Fortnite because he wanted to know why I was snorting at my phone every five minutes. Turns out he thought it looked cool, and now whenever I go near the games room I hear stuff like â€˜yooo broooâ€™ or â€˜aimbot! Heâ€™s got aimbot!!â€™  or â€˜noob!â€™.

Anyway I want to commit autodefenstration.
