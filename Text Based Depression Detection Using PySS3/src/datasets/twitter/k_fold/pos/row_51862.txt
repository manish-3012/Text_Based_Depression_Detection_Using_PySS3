An introduction to Flawless August Hey Hey! So since its a new month, I want to introduce a new "event" like NoNutNovember and FingerFreeFebruary to you. Flawless August! (I know that the name doesn't nearly sound as good as the other two, but I didn't come up with it anyways.) The Idea came from a German Streamer/YouTuber named Taddl btw will link him at the end of this Post.  What is the Idea of Flawless August ? It's nothing really ground-breaking or revolutionary but I still wanna share it with you. Soooo The Idea is to do or not do things that are good/bad for you for an entire month and maybe even longer. (You have to pay attention that you do it in the correct off course. I wouldn't recommend that you do things that are bad for you and don't do things that are good for you.) The Idea isn't, that you try to do things that you know you won't have the motivation to do it anyways. (You know pretty damn well, that you are to lazy to work out consistently.) It's easier to not do things than to do things so maybe if you think you drink to much Cola or something consider to don't drink Cola. What you do or not do in the end, do you have to choose for yourself. You can also push yourself to your limits  
and beyond, but we could also make a  SuperSaiyajinSeptember for that. Here a little example what I do for Flawles August:

1. Don't watch porn
2. Don't go on Twitter 
3. Practice French on Duolingo everyday 
4. Write in my diary at least once in the week 
5. Practice playing Piano or guitar at least every two days 

If you also decide to participate in Flawless August. I would be happy if you write your list in the comments.
