I have a story from 6th grade it's short In 6th grade I was just walking to my next class and this girl makes eye contact with me and fucking charges. She essentially grappled me and yelled "OH MY GOD I MISSED YOU!" Very stereotypical white teenager style. I've never met this person before so I do what any reasonable person would do panic and fucking elbow her in the stomach. Thankfully she didn't do anything after so I wasn't punished for harming another student but I feel bad for that it was a bit of an over reaction and now I see this person in 2 of my classes currently and have had at least one with her every year since then so I always remember it.
