i actually did the right thing for once. and i feel great for years ive just been ignoring school assignments that were too hard. and i just stopped caring. tonight, i finally said fuck it, im gonna do this even if it kills me. and i did. and even though i spend a half hour crying, and got a d on it, i feel it was worth every second of it. i kinda feel like jj in outer banks when he gets arrested .
