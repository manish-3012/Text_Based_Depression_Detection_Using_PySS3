It's been months since she died and I'm still not ok. 
My mother died in April. She came home from the hospital one day and laid in bed as the doctors that came home with her were explaining how things would work from then on. Suddenly I'm in my room crying as I hear my family panicking and my mother dying.

 The worst part is that the last time we talked was the night before. She sounded so happy that she was coming home. I was gonna make her favorite cereal for her. My mother had a lot of things wrong with her. Infected toe the doctors couldn't fix, something was wrong with her spine, but in the end liver cancer somehow got her without the doctors noticing. 

It's been months since she died but it still feels like last week. I can't stop crying everytime I think of her. And now I'm stuck knowing that she's never gonna see my quinceanera, wedding, or even hold her grandchildren. It hurts knowing she's not here anymore. I don't know why I wrote this. I just feel like I needed to vent somewhere.
