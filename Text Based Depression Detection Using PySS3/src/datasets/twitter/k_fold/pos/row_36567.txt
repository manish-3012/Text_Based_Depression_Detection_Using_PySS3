My parents spank my brother and I donâ€™t know what to do about it Iâ€™m 16 and my brother is 4. I also have an older brother whoâ€™s 23 and an older sister who is 19. Thereâ€™s obviously a very large gap between me and my younger brother while the rest of my siblings are relatively close in age.

My parents are good people. Theyâ€™re very kind and loving and they are the farthest thing from abusive. Although they take extremely good care of their children and did a fine job raising us, they never really knew how to handle us acting up.

My older siblings and I never really had a problem following directions. If our mom told us to do something, 9/10 times weâ€™d do it. My younger brother on the other hand as a bit of trouble doing what my mom says. He doesnâ€™t take many things seriously (as most 4 year olds wouldnâ€™t), and sometimes this causes him to get into trouble.

Just today he was wrestling with my mom over a water bottle when she was telling him to try to go to the bathroom (heâ€™s still not fully potty trained). She started off laughing but then she got more serious, when he wouldnâ€™t listen to her she threatened to spank him. He kept messing around so she turned around him spanked him. He said it didnâ€™t hurt so she replied with â€œdo you want me to make it hurt?â€, and he quietly walked away. My mom went to check on him a few minutes later and he was crying by himself in the bathroom and he said he thought she wasnâ€™t gonna come and see him.

That broke my heart. I struggle with telling my parents when I mess up because Iâ€™m afraid of what theyâ€™ll do, and I usually go to the bathroom to cry so they wonâ€™t see me, but my brother is only 4 years old and he feels like he has to do this. Iâ€™m pretty screwed up mentally and I know my brother is too. Iâ€™m not as close with my sister but I know sheâ€™s probably in a similar situation. I donâ€™t want my brother to have to deal with the same things I did. Especially if itâ€™s preventable.

Iâ€™ve mentioned it a couple times to my dad but it hasnâ€™t done anything. I havenâ€™t told them how much itâ€™s affected me but Iâ€™m worried that might scar them, since they obviously care about us so much and Iâ€™m sure it would hurt them a lot to know that theyâ€™ve psychologically damaged their own children.

I probably wonâ€™t go into detail about my depression and stuff cause also a lot of my mental health problems string from other stuff too not just them. Iâ€™ll probably just tell them that getting spanked made me afraid to tell them when I did something wrong and your parents are supposed to be the ones to help you out of a bad situation, not punish you for being in it.

I was just hoping you guys could give me some advice about this. I really donâ€™t know what to do, and I obviously canâ€™t go to my parents for advice
