being a big boy using my main account First off, there is a major difference between stupid and idiot. idiot is a ack of judgement. stupid is not smart in a not-judgement-related way.

now that that is cleared up:

a lot of people say "men are stupid" "all men are stupid" i see it a lot in discord servers. i dont take personal offense to this. (its one of those things that i pretend to care about, like when someone pronounces cheesecake factory the wrong way). but the problem i have with this is how hypocritical it is. all men are not stupid. man-babies are stupid. if i said "all women are stupid," im sure people would be all over me saying im a dick. this is an issue. now i dont know if that would be the response cuz i havent tried it, but im willing to make a bet.

this isnt a major problem (in my eyes), but i just cant stand people bein hypocrites, its the one thing that i absolutely despise.
