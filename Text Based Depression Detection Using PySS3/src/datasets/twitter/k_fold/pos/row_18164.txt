I cringe at the fact that one of my oldest posts on this sub was why I didnâ€™t like TikTok It wasnâ€™t on this account but I made a whole bunch of generalizations and that was before I got the app so I could follow a friend. What you see on your fyp is recommended to you based on what you like so if you donâ€™t like your fyp maybe you gotta like shit that you like. I hated it first and all I saw was really horrible shit on my Instagram fyp and it got on my nerves. Anyways I deleted it now bc I waste too much time scrolling through it. I would never make one bc first of all, I donâ€™t look like the kind of person that would be popular on there and second of all, I would be extremely embarrassed that anyone I actually know irl would see it. Idk, Iâ€™m just not into doing shit like that. Thereâ€™s also the whole thing with TikTok spying on me and I donâ€™t know how much of that is true and I donâ€™t even know if I give a fuck. Honestly, I donâ€™t really care if the Chinese government is spying on me. It is scary to think about tho
