You ever find yourself in an an akward situation and you need to ask reddit for what to do next? I'm basically the personal therapists for one of my friends because I'm one of the few people she trusts enough to be around alone. She's been through a lot and often just vents everything that has been bothering her that day to me and I usually just listen cause I don't know how the fuck to respond. Well today we were just relaxing and after about 20 minutes I get up to make food and she quickly grabs me and kisses me. I am quite visibly shocked by this and she says "I'm sorry if I made this akward." Now I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do now.
