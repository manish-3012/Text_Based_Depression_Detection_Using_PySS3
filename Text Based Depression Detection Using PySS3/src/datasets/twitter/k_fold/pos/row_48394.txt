I just need to tell someone about this My sister use to have a friend, they essentially enabled each other to be rebellious and just be completely toxic people. How rebellious my sister became was litteraly tearing our family apart because of how hateful and cruel she became towards my mom. Eventually her friend moved away to San Diego and for the few months after she moved things have been really peaceful in the house, our family can talk and care about each other and the house can be peacfull without constant arguing and door slams and walls being hit and screaming. But now she's moving back to our town since her father who gained custody of her was useless and lost custody. My moms reasonably livid and I dont know how my sister is feeling. I'm just horrified about the thought of how things will turn out again. 

I want to help my sister in respecting others and I want to help my mom with the stress her friend causes, its just I can never do both.
