The most underrated moments in school are the teachers trying not to sound racist/sexist Like my old biology teacher was about to say black peoples but stuttered â€œpeople with high melanin levelsâ€, or my Christian teacher trying to include both males and females in every topic, but forgets about others 

Whatâ€™s one from you guys?
