"Well everyone has anxiety!" I have diagnosed social anxiety and I'm on medication to it. I struggle massively with simple socialising and getting through each day with people leaves me abosulety exhausted 


Proplem is my boyfriend, anytime there is the mention of things like anxiety or social anxiety he will just say "well everyone has anxiety" and I don't know how to explain to them that feeling anxious isn't the same as diagnosed anxiety


It's very damaging to me because I don't ever imagine that he'll be able to understand me and my mental health because he is very stubborn about this.
