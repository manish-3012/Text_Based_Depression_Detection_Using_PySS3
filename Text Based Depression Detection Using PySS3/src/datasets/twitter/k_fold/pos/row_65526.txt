I am at a healthy weight for the first time in 3 years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I started to gain weight after my parents got divorced, I tried multiple times to get back in shape, but failed every time. But during quarantine I started to exercise again.

 For the first time, I stuck with it for more than a week. I lost 10 pounds at the beginning of quarantine, but sadly I gained it back because I stopped excersising, but about 2 months ago I began to excersise again, I haven't stopped excersising since, and have lost 20 pounds in the last two months!!

And I can now say that I am at a healthy weight of 153.9 pounds, with a BMI of 24.8.

Obviously, I still want to lose more weight and become even healthier,  but I just wanted to share this with people because I have taken the first step towards being healthy!
