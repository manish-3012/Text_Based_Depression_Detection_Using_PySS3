Bots, what the hell? I dont know what is wrong with MAGIC_EYE_BOT. I just posted [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jvo7vo/uvaultsepticeye_for_original_template/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) giving credit to the person who made this template, and it got taken down. Pointing this out, i posted [this billy meme template](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jvodqa/my_post_in_the_comments_hope_this_doesnt_get/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and guess what? It also got taken down by the same u/MAGIC_EYE_BOT . What the hek is wrong with you? People repost the exact same meme and the person being caught is the one who used a template, giving credit to the guy who came up with that template.
