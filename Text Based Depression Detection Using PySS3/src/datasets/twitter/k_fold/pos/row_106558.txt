I just had to watch my dog die I don't know how to feel, i fell angry but also relieved that he isn't suffering anymore, i feel almost sick, I feel empty without my baby boy, I miss him so damn bad but i know i can't get him back, for the last few hours i've just felt lost, he's been with us for almost 15 years, so it feels weird just to exist without him, I don't know any more, man, I just came here to vent
