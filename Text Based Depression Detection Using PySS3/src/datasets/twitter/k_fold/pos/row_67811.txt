I drove a car for the first time today Like REALLY drove a car.

My dad and I usually take the car to my highschool parking lot where I practice making turns, parking, etc... and then he drives us home. 

We've only been doing this for 2 days and today my dad thought it was a good idea for ME to drive the car home.



And I did it.



Sure, I was driving at like 20 mph under the speed limit, but I did it.



I'm so proud of myself.
