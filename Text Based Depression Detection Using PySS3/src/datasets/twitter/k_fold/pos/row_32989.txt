I cant wait to be old. For some reason I can't wait to grow old and have grandchildren. Because that means I've married someone and I've had kids of my own. And I've lived a long good life. Also I want to be like that cliche grandma you see in cartoons. Like a little on the bigger side, always has my hair in a bun, makes the best chocolate chip cookies, and always slips my grandkids a dollar every time I see then. I know this all sounds weird but I just wanted to rant
