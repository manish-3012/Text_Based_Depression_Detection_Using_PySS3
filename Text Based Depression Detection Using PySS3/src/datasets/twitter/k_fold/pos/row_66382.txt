I'm on the verge of being banned from my friends discord [HIVEMIND] Context:

Hivemind : My friends commuidt group, 30 ppl consisting of newbies of my school, nerds, geeks, and an old school associate from 5 years ago

Anyways I was invited to just go check it out, cause me and my classmate were mocking their dumb ideology.

I went there and I managed to convince a user to screw this Hivemind thing. That user was insta-banned by a mod (my friends's best friend, he's an annoying prick). I said what he was doing was wrong and now I'm on there "watchlist"

I might be banned if I speak anymore "foreign propaganda" to the other 7 active users
