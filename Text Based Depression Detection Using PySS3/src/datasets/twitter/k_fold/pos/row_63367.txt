She dumped me and became almost instantly obsessed with minecraft streamers and idk how I should feel about it. I had this short one month relationship with this girl and I thought it was going really well even though it was online and long distance. She broke up with me abruptly telling me that she didn't have time for a relationship because of school and that with college coming up she didn't see a future for us. I've been helping her with her homework when we were dating because we both have ADHD and I understand the struggle, she's been procrastinating a lot over online school. She wanted to still be friends so I kept helping her with homework after we broke up and I thought it was fine but after a few days of that she got really distant and stopped talking to me and our mutual friends as far as I know for about a month. I thought yeah, maybe it was too ambitious for us to go from a breakup to close friends that quickly and I thought she was probably working through her homework on her own. But when she started talking to our friend group again she tells us that she hasn't been doing any school work at all and it's pilling up because she's been watching minecraft streamers. She's like become obsessed with this one streamer making a fan page and constantly talking about it all the time. I'm just sitting here like what? That excuse she gave for breaking up with me felt like an easy let down but now it's starting to feel more insulting... do I have the right to let this bother me? Like she went cold on me for that? What am I supposed to think?
