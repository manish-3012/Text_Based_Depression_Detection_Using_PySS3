anyone else have panic attack when their boyfriend told them they loved them ? we havenâ€™t been dating very long. i like him a lot even though i feel i have trouble saying it sometimes. heâ€™s very sweet to me and really cute and heâ€™s tall too :)). i love spending time with him. 

it was my first time doing anything intimate with anyone, he told me he loved me. i felt myself getting really emotional and i was being more quiet than normal and he asked if i was alright. iâ€™ve been trying really hard to be honest about my feelings with him, i had to force myself to tell him that something was wrong so i told him â€˜i donâ€™t know i just started crying.â€™ and then immediately broke down into tears. he held me and asked me what he did wrong and what was wrong. 
i honestly at the time had no idea what was happening i didnâ€™t know why i was crying hysterically.
i asked him to roll the window down and he stepped outside to put his shirt on and i bolted out the door and continued to cry while he held me and continued to ask what was wrong. 
i ended up having to sit on the ground with my palms flat on the pavement and grounded myself by listing things to myself in my head (ex. 2 things i could hear, 2 things i could smell, 2 things i could see, etc.) he asked me what i was doing and i said i was grounding myself it was what i did when i had anxiety and that was when i realized that i had had a panic attack.
i was able to calm down and i laid on the pavement until i stopped shaking and was able to realize what triggered it was when he said â€˜i love youâ€™
