Finally got over my depression Iâ€™ve had depression for about 5 years now but Iâ€™ve recently gotten over it, some advice for you people that are struggling with depression is that you should try to change your music and truly be yourself around others. I know the last part is going to be extremely difficult but the outcome is amazing. Iâ€™ve never felt more free and happier in my 5 years of having depression and I hope you guys can get past it too. Remember, there is always someone out there that is wishing that you would be by their side or that they care about you. You are not alone in this world and your life is precious, spend every second with joy and you will never regret living. On that note, I hope you have a good day and stay safe in this pandemic.
