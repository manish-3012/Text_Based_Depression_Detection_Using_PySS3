Getting rejected was the best thing to happen to our friendship I got to know someone for a bit over a year now and I would call ourselves good friends. Eventually I grew some feelings and like past crushes I didn't really approach, just think to myself how a relationship with them. I became more self conscious of what I talked to her about  over stupid stuff like "what if she doesn't like that and also makes he not like me".

 A few days I said "fuck it" and asked he out and she said no. That no was one of the most relieving moments, sure it hurt a bit but now all that overthinking stopped and we've been chill ever since. Hell we talk more now since I don't worry about sounding stupid around her. 

TL:DR- Had a crush on someone for over a year which led to me overthinking all our interactions. Asked her out and she said no, been cool with each other and talk more.
