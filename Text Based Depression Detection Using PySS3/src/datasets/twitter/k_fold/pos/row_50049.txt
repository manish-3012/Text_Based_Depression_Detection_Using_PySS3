Im gonna get downvoted for this but all I ask is to hear me out Defunding the police is not the way to go. The police already dont have a lot of noney because they buy new police cars every year and that is the truth, they dont have too much to any other things. If anything the funding needs to go elsewhere. They need to take the money they have which is a good amount and use more for training and how to decrease danger in the situation, police arent trained on deescalating situations to prevent problems. The whole idea of sending in a social worker to help is genius and shouldve been implemented a long time ago but they should also have to the police know how to deescalate
