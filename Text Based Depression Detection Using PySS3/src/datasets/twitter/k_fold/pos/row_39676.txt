Im in quite the predicament I have a big issue: A deathly fear (or hatred) of failure that leads to Self punishment for any amount of failure.

The reason it's weird is because my fear of failure doesn't prevent me from getting things done but it kills my motivation and drive to do because any mistakes make me mad at myself.

My mom is kinda helping me and she suggested that i try forcing myself to fail for extended periods of time.   
I can't. I physically can't do it for more than 2 minutes. She says the point is that i stop feeling like a piece of human waste when i fail but when i try to force myself to fail my body just doesn't work, it actively makes me avoid failing.

I might have to start doing water color paintings because that's what really hurts. Whenever i do them i start hating myself because "It doesn't look good". That's a problem though, i can't make myself keep going through those thoughts, as they pile up and make me feel worse and worse over time

Does anyone have any ideas to help me force myself to fail or begin to solve this?
