most of my friends stopped talking to me Ever seance the social distancing stuff and lock down Iâ€™ve been texting my friends almost Daily. This isnâ€™t out of the ordinary coz we do that even before the sick.
But after a while we slowed down texting, like 4 times a week.

But dam we havenâ€™t hung out in what end of February. Thatâ€™s a long time. 

And now Iâ€™m pretty sure they have blocked me, I havenâ€™t been spamming or anything just like asking of they are ok and if they need anything. Like my whole friend group got the corona at one point so I just was checking on them. Well after everyone got better we started talking less and then I would text them every 3 days or so and ask how they are doing and if they wanted to talk. Well no own responses. Iâ€™ve had some thoughts about our friendships and they were pretty legit but dang. Really makes a man sad when everyone ghost me , I just want to talk. Iâ€™ve been going though a rough time lately. Try to talk to them and they donâ€™t respond like I only text them once a week now , and they donâ€™t text back. This is big sad . Started drinking since they stopped. I need some human interaction, like at least say hi. I really am sad now and donâ€™t really want to exist because then I will be more sad. If some how you read though this I am on mobile so formatting is bad and not even the telemarketers will response. Really just just donâ€™t like it like the shit if life .
