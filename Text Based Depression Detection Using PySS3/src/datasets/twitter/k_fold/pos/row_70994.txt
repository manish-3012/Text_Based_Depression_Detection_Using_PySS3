Just here to recommend a band Streetlight Manifesto. Theyâ€™re ska punk. No clue what that means, but theyâ€™ve got your basic bass/guitar/drums plus a trumpet, 2 saxes, and a trombone. Most of their best songs are from their most recent album, â€œThe Hands That Thieveâ€ and from their second album â€œSomewhere in the Between.â€ Title songs are a good place to start, both are really good. The lead singer also released some of their songs as acoustic covers under the name Toh Kay, and those are really good as well. Listen to the A Better Place, A Better Time cover. 

The Uncluded is also good but this isnâ€™t about them.
