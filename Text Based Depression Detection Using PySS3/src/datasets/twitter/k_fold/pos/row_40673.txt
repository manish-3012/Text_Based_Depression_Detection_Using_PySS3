I've been talking to this girl. She's in my second hour, I think she's cute. Well anyway we're being forced to do online school now. Like around a week ago we started texting on snapchat. She was keeping the conversation alive just as much as me. Well then she told me something along the lines of that I am a very nice guy and asked if she could ask a question. She was typing for a little while then just asked me about my elementary school. Later she called me a goof before saying goodnight. 

Well yesterday she asked me if I could roller skate. I said ya, and she told me how she couldn't. I used this time to ask her out on a date to the skating rink. She said no, she needs to practice before, it would be embarrassing. I just took this as her way saying no as nicely as possible (which it was, never been rejected better). She is still talking to me. Just kinda feels like when a movie implies a character died, but doesn't confirm it.
