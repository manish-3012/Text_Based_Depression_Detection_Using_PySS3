Does anyone else feel like their not normal? I feel like Iâ€™m missing out on being a teenager and this has nothing to do with quarantine. Lately Iâ€™ve realised that I donâ€™t really have an interesting life I have maybe two friends that I occasionally hangout with otherwise I just do sports. I have no friends where I live and no one to talk to at school. Iâ€™ve also never hooked up with anyone and no ones ever expressed a slight interest in me. I feel like I have to have a life like a tv show or a movie even though I know thatâ€™s unrealistic, itâ€™s like Iâ€™ve been left behind. Anyway, have a good night guys and thanks for listening fellow kids.
