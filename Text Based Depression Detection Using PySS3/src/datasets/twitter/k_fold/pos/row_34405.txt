I think there is a curse on my family I realized so much bad stuff is happening to my family lately like the other night my great grandfather had a heart attack and is still in the hospital. The other week we found out that my grandfather has aggressive prostrate cancer that we think has spread to his hips. My aunt and uncle and newborn baby have Covid. My great uncle and aunt had Covid. My mom had Covid and I think something is wrong with my eye. Does anyone have a cure for this.
