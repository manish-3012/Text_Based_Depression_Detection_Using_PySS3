What tf do I do Iâ€™m in my sophomore year in high school but so much shit has happened this year that school was at the bottom of my list of priorities for a long time. There ainâ€™t any excuses for it iâ€™m lazy and have a major procrastination issue. Now I actually have to pass my classes or else ima have to redo my sophomore year most likely. Iâ€™m so far behind in some of my classes and Iâ€™m afraid of confronting my teachers because some of my missing assignments are SO old. Anybody whoâ€™s been in my shoes and got out of it please give me advice.
