Iâ€™m sick of my username I constantly get hate for my username.  Which I see why but itâ€™s not the meaning behind it. I know you canâ€™t change your username. But I donâ€™t want to have to create a new account. Iâ€™m not an edgy piece of shit which is what I get called out for just because of my username even if I say the nicest stuff. Iâ€™m sick of this shit.
