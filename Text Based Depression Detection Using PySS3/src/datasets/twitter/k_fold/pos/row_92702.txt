Tea about coming out jokes Coming out joke that are like "today I came out...........
......of the house" or whatever are not funny. They also kind of make fun of coming out or at least try and make light of a process that can be scary or sometimes even dangerous. Please just stop making jokes like that, be kind to LGBT people. Even if you are LGBT and jokes like that don't bother you they can bother others and can even make it harder for them to actually come out.
