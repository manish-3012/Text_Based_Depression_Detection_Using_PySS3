Opening up about my childhood trauma. So, if you know me/if you go through my profile, you'll see that I've mentioned quite some times that I was molested as a child (6 years).I live in India, so our school year works a little different than America's and all the other country's and due to that, this school year will end on the last week of March. We'll get a few holidays before the next year starts in 2nd week of April.(Coming back to the point now that I've told you the stuff that you needed to know for this whole thing to make sense)

No one in my family knows that I was molested when I was 6, and, I'm thinking of telling them about this in the holiday gap between the year end and year start since, I'm just feeling really bad because they don't know about what happened to me. I'll tell my mother 1st and my dad afterwards, but I'm not sure if I'll gather the courage to do so. I'll try my best and open up to them in the best way I can, since, I'm just anxious of them finding out about this shit from anyone other than me. I'll be opening up to them after about something that happened 8 years ago, and, I've already started preparing myself for what'll happen after I open up. Things will definitely change, but, after 4 years of shutting myself from everyone, I'm ready for change. You all can tell me about your experiences in the comments if you want, that's your choice.  
*I look forward to change, for the 1st time in 8 years.*  
Thank you for taking out your time and reading my long ass paragraph.

***-May peace be upon you-***
