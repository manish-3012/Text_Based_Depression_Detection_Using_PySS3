Just got my online school stats: Why is it all low?? My mum has just now just been informed what I've been doing for work:

Apparently NOTHING. I'm trying to darn best to have good work in school so I can actually have friends in class and I swear this school is TRYING to make me fail.

Most of the not needed classes such as RE or Art I've gotten the worst score for: not visiting classes a d not doing work even though I DID IT ALL.

I'm so done with my school. Its literally ruining my life and lying to me, being split from my only friends and stressing me out more then I've ever been.

At this point I need to change school but the only one nearby has terrible bullying in it and me being a ginger basically means I wont survive a day there.

The worst part is that my brother (who is in the best class) got green in all his work when we did the exact same things. I just don't understand whats happening, I swear i'm gonna break down at one point.

Luckily my mum believes I did my work since she isn't a work as she is helping my sister do work.

So at least home isn't bad.
