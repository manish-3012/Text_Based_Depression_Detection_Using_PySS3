(Rant!) Roblox locked out my account and scrambled my emails and passwords. I wish that whomever did that get infected with Covid-19. A week ago I was simply having issues with 2 factor authentication where I entered everything correctly except that there was an application-level error which causes me to never get past the prompt.

I filed a support ticket to Roblox and ask them to simply fix the issue but a few days later a support team member going by the name of 'Terrence' [deactivated my 2FA to change my passwords and my emails](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716418071358734336/765986957292863488/Capture.PNG) to presumably that of when the account was first made and just two minutes after [he said that](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716418071358734336/765986957645053962/two.PNG) it's been treated as if it's an account recovery issue when it's clearly not.

The thing is I have lost track of both the old Gmail address account and password anymore because I had deleted the former long ago and I have long since updated my Roblox password quite many times.

Even though the application error had been fixed and I could perfectly log in to my account without fuss, that buffoon staff insist that it is an 'account-related issue' where I need to get back to the old Gmail account which *I've long since deleted*. 

Now because of Terrence's fuck-up I can't even reset my password by email anymore. WHAT'S WRONG WITH TERRENCE? CAN I TALK TO AN HR ABOUT HIM?

Because of him I'm likely to lose all of the game progress over a year and re-doing all these will be a super-daunting task for girls like me. Some stuffs like badges are never able to be restored with Robux whatsoever. Just think about it.

Terrence is a fucking asshole incel loser for bullying a girl like that. I hope he some day be infected with Covid-19 and suffer 100x the agony I'm undergoing right now. REEEEEEE!
