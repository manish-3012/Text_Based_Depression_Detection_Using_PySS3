what is spiders were bigger? if spiders were the size of cats would life be easier or harder? i mean on one hand they would be bigger so you can see them and they canâ€™t really sneak up on you, and they wonâ€™t get into your house as easily, but if they do... well then you are kinda in trouble. plus in general, the larger the animal the less children have at one time, thatâ€™s why tarantulas have way less kids than smaller spiders. and if that one spider decides you look yummy so it drops down from the sky... that would be scary. there would be better ways to ward them off because there are less of them but they are still bigger. i keep imagining that scene from harry potter where they all fall from the trees. and because we have big trees at home, itâ€™s kinda scary to think about giant spiders crawling in iâ€™m the trees above you. 

all spiders are venomous, they are just not potent enough to kill humans. but if spiders are larger they might be able to kill humans because their target pray is no longer tiny bugs but birds, squirrels, and mice. they might be more lethal. but i will no longer freak out because they are no longer hiding in the crease of my jacket, if i see it coming than i can kick it away.
