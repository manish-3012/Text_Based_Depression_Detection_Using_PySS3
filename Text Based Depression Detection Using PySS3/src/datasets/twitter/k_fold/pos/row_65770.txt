Earth update 2.020.7 (US) Hello, this is God speaking. A new update is coming to the US version of Earth.

Subscriptions:

-People who have bought the "paying attention to US politics" subscription will receive daily gifts of stupid things people say on Twitter, arguments, and the occasional motivational speech.

COVID19 event:

-Over the course of the year, we have introduced Karens to the event. We are now adding several more levels with them to add more challenge to the game.

-Schools reopening will now have to be passed through to complete the event. This is likely to create some lag, making it harder to finish the event.

Other:

-We are working on a very large change to the game, which has rendered it unplayable to some people. If you are one of the people impacted by this, we are very sorry and are working to find a solution.

We hope you enjoy the changes to the game. As always, if you find any bugs please contact the support team.
