Little kids aren't the worst thing ever okay so I was scrolling through hot and I saw a post about how little kids are terrible because they annoying or they complain and stuff like that. 

Bro there a bunch of fucking 4-6 year olds, of course there going to be a annoying and of course there going to whine and complain and be all over the place. All of us and probably the person who posted that have been like this before and there brains are develop and their just starting to get an understanding of the world. So don't be "oh little kids are so such the worst" because you may have to deal with them but the parents are raising them right now. 

So don't just automatically hate on little kids just because they're annoying.
