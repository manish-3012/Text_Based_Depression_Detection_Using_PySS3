I HATE when people use douchebags hate on men in the name of feminism Before this gets downvoted into oblivion, I would like to get some things straight. I am 100% behind feminism, see no reason why men and women should have equal opportunity and think that we need to break apart the institutional patriarchy and other roadblocks that stop us from achieving that goal. It just REALLY MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL  when douchebags use the platform of feminism to hate on men and make unfair generalizations such as â€œ100% of men are against abortionâ€. That isnâ€™t what feminism is about. It is about achieving gender equality, not about waging gender war. I understand when people call out rapists, but donâ€™t say that all men are. This is the reason why only 16% of men call themselves feminists. Because they feel free to joke about misandry and label anyone who calls them out sexist. Arguing against prejudiced statements that generalize an ENTIRE GENDER SHOULDNâ€™T MAKE YOU A PARIAH!
The bottom line is, if you want to hate on men, do what you want and fuck off. Just donâ€™t do it in the name of feminism.
