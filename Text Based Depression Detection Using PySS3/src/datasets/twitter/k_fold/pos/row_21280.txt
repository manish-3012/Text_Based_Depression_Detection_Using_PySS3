I'm meeting my dad for the first time in about a decade today. Last time I saw him I was pretty much a toddler, and I don't remember a single thing about him. He never tried to talk to me or invite me over during the last 9-10 years. 
I'm kind of scared to see him, I wonder what he'll think of me as I'll be a completely different person. Of course I'm furious with him because he let money control his life (longggg story) but I'll try to avoid any conversations that will lead to arguments. Wish me luck guys ðŸ˜…
