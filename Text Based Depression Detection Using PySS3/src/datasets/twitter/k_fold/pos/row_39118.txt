WHY CAN I NOT POST IMAGES HERE "why can I not post images here"

it is a question that you will always see each friday to the monday of next week - depending on the time zone

you'd imagine everyone knows by now that text post weekend is a thing, but nope, someone are bound to ask the same question every week.

I don't blame them, really, what if they only discovered about this sub this week and this is their first text post weekend?

but still, at this point you'd imagine that the moderation team would've mention something about "text post weekends" in their about or rules section, but I just went there and looked and I see no mentions of it whatsoever. hmm.

thnx for coming to my teddytalk and hav a nice day
