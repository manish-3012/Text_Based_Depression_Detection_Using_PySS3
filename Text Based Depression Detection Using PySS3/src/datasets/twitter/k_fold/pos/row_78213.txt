I feel like i have no control I just don't have control over my own life. I don't know how to explain how i feel but its like i can't change from this schedule. I have been doing the most ordinary and regular things my whole life. Im often insulted whether as a joke or not by my friends as someone with no personality and it really does hit deep for me but i also just lack the ability to properly express myself and therefore i am told im emotionless leading to friends and family not even bothering to ask 'how i am' or even 'how was your day'. But when i try to change i talk myself out of everything.
