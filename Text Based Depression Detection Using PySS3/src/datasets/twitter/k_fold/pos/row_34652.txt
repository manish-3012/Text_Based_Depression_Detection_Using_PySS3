do you ever feel so sad that you want to go home but youre already at home...  ...or like... do you ever feel so sad that you miss someone that you're having a conversation with?

it kinda feels like being teleported into another universe where something or someone has a very minor change, a change that cant be seen but a change that can be felt...

i feel like that quite often, anytime im not overly joyous, which is like at least 80% of the time...

it scales with my mood so like the closer to happy i am the less i feel it, but its always there to an extent...

just wanted to know if others felt like this...
