The unholy light - Verse 1:1 The blood of the sea splashes and soak the flesh of the ground 

for as the cells combust into plants out as the mosquitos of the land eat it before being eaten by each other

But the days of hoping wonâ€™t be fateful

The days of hoping will just be a joke

Like all of us
