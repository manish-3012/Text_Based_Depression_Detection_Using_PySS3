I have a test tomorrow, so Iâ€™m going to expand and test my Chinese vocabulary. Please give me topics I can do some research on. (Also a short and calm rant) There are about 85k+ *characters* in the Chinese language and around 2k+ of them are used on a day-to-day basis.

But this 2k doesnâ€™t sound enough in the eyes of my Chinese language and history classes lol.  Iâ€™ve been speaking the language my whole life, but this is driving me wild.  Iâ€™m going to be taking these 4 hours of free time to torture myself by expanding my vocabulary.  

Our tests donâ€™t have coverage.  Itâ€™s always a â€œweâ€™re gonna show you something and you have to analyse itâ€ type of test.  Read the given text, answer the questions, create an essay, prove your point, and then you can pass.  

Problem is, the topics are very specific and some characters are not normally being brought up in a casual conversation.

my only hope now is to have read those specific terms prior to the test lmao

Give some topics to do research on pls
