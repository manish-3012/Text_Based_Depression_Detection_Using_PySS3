Oh My God! Look, I get it if you like dancing, but dance the subject is retarted. I have this stupid project that, as always, my fucking stupid dumbass self left for the last minute and I have to study the "Elements of Dance". Its so fucking stupid. I hate it so much. I've been working on it for the past hour and I have been crying for twenty minutes. I hate it. I hate it. I'm sorry if you like dance, but I hate it. I'm sorry, I really needed to vent. Thanks for listening.
