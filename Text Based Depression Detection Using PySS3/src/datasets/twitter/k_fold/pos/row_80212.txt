I go through many submissions each week of underrated songs. I take my favorites and put them into a playlist to showcase smaller artists If it's of appeal to any of you, the support is appreciated! [Why The Hell Didn't I Find These? (The Playlist)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5U5vzP6zhB3Dqgfml20RaK?si=yYGUMuK6T_S65oFX-B3u9g)

I'm not sure if any of you teenagers can relate at all, but I've always been very fascinated with music. More specifically finding diamonds in the rough to share with my friends. I always feel like these diamonds rough deserve more attention, and this is my way to try and help out.

This is a playlist I came up with about 2 weeks ago, and it already has amassed 220+ followers. The idea behind it is I will add 75 submitted songs below 100k streams and then rotate songs in and out. As long as they are of good quality. To make this work I'd need people to follow, share, and stream others music in this playlist so the playlist works out for everybody of course.

If you have any interest at all in submitting a track to the playlist, use the following link:

Every week I'll try to rotate new songs in and out so for those of you who follow, keep in touch with the playlist because you might find your next summer jam here. Hopefully with the help from everyone this will work and smaller artists will get boosts from this!

I hope you guys will find this of interest. Feel free to comment your opinions on the idea of playlist, music is subjective so while you mightn't enjoy what's on it, any form of support is appreciated!
