Suggestion: customizable user flairs. On subs like r/commandandconquer you can make your user flair whatever you like, and since I am u/hehastoughtuswell, I have my flair as "Hail to the great Yuri!" I wish we had this feature here because I'm aching to have my user flair be "I'm a mechanical man." Having just age and some other flairs seems a bit boring, do you agree? If you have anything to say about this, like a reason we shouldn't have customizable user flairs, please inform me, it's a discussion post for discussion.
