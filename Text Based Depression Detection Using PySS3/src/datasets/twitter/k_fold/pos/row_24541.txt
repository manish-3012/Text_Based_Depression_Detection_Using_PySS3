Everyone should go to public school for at least a year or two Really gives you perspective and crazy shit happens there. Then you can go off to your private schools if you can afford it. I went to public school K-8 and now I'm in a private school for high school. It'll either help you be less of an asshole to the underprivileged, or more of an asshole. Because I think everyone who goes to private school can attest to the fact that we're all assholes.
