I've known some dom girls and sub guys recently (me being one of them lmao)... ...aaaaand most of them seem to be ashamed for not being "normal", which is a real shame.

I can 100% understand why like I've hated myself for being so sub before as well, but if any dom girls, sub guys, people with extreme kinks or just people who have anything they're ashamed of, feel free to vent to me or in these comments, I'm here for you :)
