A game developed by a friend that I would love to share A friend of mine made a game developed on scratch. He made a post about it here but that got removed because of low karma. I have no interest in breaking the rules of the subreddit by making a post about a post that got removed, but he has worked really hard on it and it's worth a try.

The game is inspired by Trap Adventure, no story as of yet he is working on it and you can recommend him changes if you like, I have given his social links too! 

Its only on PC for now.

Here is the link to the game: [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/428451147](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/428451147)

This is a safe and secure website, no need to worry ;)

He is in need of funds, he decided to make a PayPal account so people can donate but he dropped that idea for now.

That's it.
