If you're like not doing anything rn but browsing thru reddit or chilling, you should listen to this and let me know what you think. I'm the one doing vocals and the one who wrote it, my friend produces them, shout out him for making this beat for me.

yes ik it is soundcloud like I'd move to spotify when I'm more serious about it or there was enough interest but as it stands that's the most convenient platform :(
