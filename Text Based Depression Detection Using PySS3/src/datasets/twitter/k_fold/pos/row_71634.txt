If worse comes to worst, let's repeat history I don't know if you all know but back in August there was a revolution on another subreddit called r/Animemes over the word trap and how the ban of the word was seen as a limitation of freedom of speech. There is the obviously more serious problem of pedophilia in this sub but what happened back in that revolution was that the mods refused to change anything and so another subreddit was created and all the people who were fighting for the unban moved there and things have been peaceful since. 

So if our mods aren't going to budge then it's clear they don't care for us. Therefore, we should become our own mods.

Also I barely found out about this today and from what I've seen, that girl needs justice and that pedo needs to be on some hit list.
