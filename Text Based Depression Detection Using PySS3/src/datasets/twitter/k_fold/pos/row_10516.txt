I am recruiting people to play a game. Its a FPS game called TF2 (Team Fortress 2). Its a PC game and a F2P. Rn F2P cant use chat or voice chat because of bots, but you can go "premium" just by buying a key for a crate for 2.50. You only have to pay one time and you are able to use "premium" tools for as long as you want. I want more people to play it because the devs may pay attention to us and start fixing out bot problem.  The problem rn is that servers are being invaded by bots.They may even give us our first major update in 3 years. Its a really fun game. If you dont feel like playing the objective of the gamemode, you can usually just hope in into a hightower server and just mess around with friends or with the people playing there.

Overall its a really great game and I encourage you all to play it. If you need help getting into the game or learning the basics, you can DM.
