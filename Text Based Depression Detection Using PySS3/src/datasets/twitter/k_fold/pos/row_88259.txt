My cringey school dance story... So last week, I'm in grade 11, I went to the school dance (and here in Australia there are little to no COVID restrictions because it is literally non existent in my state). At the dance, I didn't bring a date or anything because I didn't really want to be there, so I just hung around friends talking and waiting for the whole thing to finish. As the night progressed, I got progressively tiresome of the dance and got more and more bored as each minute passed. One of my teachers then saw me incredibly bored not doing anything, so they came up to me and told me to go and have fun, I didn't want to do that so I said 'no thank you'.
