Imagine having to give up the thing you most enjoy My surgeon told me because of grade 2 chondral degeneration of the lateral femoral condyle that I can't go back to climbing as it would rapidly deteriorate my knee. Climbing is my favourite thing in the entire world. It helps with stress and I have been doing it for 7 years. 

Enjoy things you love, as it may be the last you ever do with it....
