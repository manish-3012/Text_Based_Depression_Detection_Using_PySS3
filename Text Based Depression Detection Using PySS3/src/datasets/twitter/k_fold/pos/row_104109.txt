I don't know what I should do Last night I had some milk and it spilled (not that big of a problem), but it had fallen into a burner on my stovetop, which leads into the oven... I tried my best to clean it up (in side the oven), and I thought I did well, but earlier today I tried to heat some bread in the oven and I could see the smoke and smell the burning. I know that I'm in for it later, does anyone know any good ways deal with the consequences, or maybe stand with dignity while it's happening.
