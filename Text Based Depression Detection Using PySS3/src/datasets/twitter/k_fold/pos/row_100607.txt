This guy like me or no? So, basically I have this friend and he keeps giving me little hints that he likes me, but idk, HE IS SO FUCKING MYSTERIOUS! so pls help me.
2 days ago he said I looked like an e-girl. Then, today, I was talking to him and he said: oh, Iâ€™m not going to kiss anyone, just this e-girl ( IDK IF IT WAS ME OR NO) 
Also, the other day I slept on his shoulder and he texted me later saying: you slept on my shoulder 
Then I said: yeah, I know 
Then he said: it was on purpose thenðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ ? ( YES, HE ADDED THIS FUCKING EMOJI) 
And I said: yes, thatâ€™s what friends are for. 
Anyways, does he like me or not? I DONT FUCKING KNOW AND IM DESPERATE
