if you're more concerned about a man curfew that 1 person said to make a statement about victim blaming than the fact someone was kidnapped and murdered then there's something wrong with you it was one party peer, not even an MP as far as I can tell, that suggested it to make a statement on victim blaming. she said she wasn't serious and was trying to get a point across. fucking do your research before spouting bullshit.
