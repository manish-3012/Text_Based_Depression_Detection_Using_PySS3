Old school steam friend left and I found him again but... I had this friend on steam named Milkman right? this was back in like 2014/15, and we were like vibing  with the boys, meeting on tf2, and making our omega steam group. One day he dissapeared, and we were all sad, wondering where he went from steam and our friends lists. A couple days ago I check our old steam group, and see there is still a comment from him from way back. I saw a blue outline of his name, and saw that he was online. Turns out he unfriended and blocked all of us. I mean, maybe he just wanted to find new people, or we upset him somehow, I really wanna talk to him again, but I dont know if I should or not. Maybe hes fed up?

thank you for attending.
