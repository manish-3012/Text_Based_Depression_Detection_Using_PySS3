I was born in 2002 From 2002-13 I had family and in between I made a lots of friends. 

From 2014-18 I still had family and slowly lose friends as in 2014 my class was shuffled and many of my friends went to other towns/cities. 

In 2019 again I still had family but I don't have much friends as this time I changed my school. 

In 2020 I don't have any friends as due to anxiety I didn't have any conversation with them and also I got depression [studies, social life problems and intrusive thoughts(OCD)] and nobody cares about me not even my family. So yeah I can say I don't have both friends and family now.
