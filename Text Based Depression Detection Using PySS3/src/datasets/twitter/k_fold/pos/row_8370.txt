My crush stopped paying any attention to me. Should I give up? I used to talk to my crush, who is my classmate a lot before we had holidays, she often laughed at my jokes and seemed to have fun around me. 
Now she just doesnâ€™t care, we have no interactions and she ignores me when Iâ€™m saying  a joke or something.
She now talks to another guy, just like we used to, laughs at every single thing he says and stares at him all the time. 
It might me my fault too, before the holidays I talked to my close girl friend a lot right in front of my crush, but if she really liked me would she change her mind that fast?
I really canâ€™t stop thinking about this, I canâ€™t have any more fun now, just thinking about her makes me incredibly sad. 
I liked her in a year now so forgetting her wonâ€™t be so easy.
