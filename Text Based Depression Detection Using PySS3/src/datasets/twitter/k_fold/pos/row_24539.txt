15 f ok so im trying to make new friends and stuff bc my dad died last year and its just me and my mom now. she moved me to a new school and new city and its been so awful and so hard. shes been using me as a grieving crutch and i feel like i have to be the parent sometimes and i feel like i havent even been able to like properly like process anything?? im just feeling like super alone and shitty and isolated and ugshshsusv. basically ive had some luck meeting ppl through reddit before but sometimes ppl just ghost me too even when i feel its going like rly rly well idk. maybe its just not in the stars??
