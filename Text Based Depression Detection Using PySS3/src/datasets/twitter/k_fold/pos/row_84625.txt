A tragic story Tonight is when it happened ... in fact it was only moments ago

&amp;#x200B;

It all started when I was chilling in my room watching Netflix. That's when I saw it. A motherfucking fly snuck into my room. I knew what I had to do, so I a armed myself with the best weapon in my room : the notebook I use for my physics class. I turned off all the fans in my room so no air current would frighten it. I then proceeded to patiently wait in the middle of my room, waiting for it to stop flying around and settle down on one of the surfaces that composes my room. For many minutes I awaited the moment, but thy moment in fact did not came. Since I was no amateur I knew what I had to do next. I adjusted my strategy : Instead of obliterating it I decided to let it live ... BUT AND ONLY BUT if it left my room peacefully. I then opened my door wide open, killed the lights, illuminated the restroom and left to get a quick snack. After grabbing a half empty bag of Doritosâ„¢ I came back to the few squares meters that I use as my own living space. I lifted the tiny lever on the wall and thus there was light! That's when I saw it. The fucking fly. My ultimate, most noble of all, opponent. I guess that the darkness I created gave it a false feeling of security during my departure. I swiftly grabbed my notebook, took my time to aim because I knew it was my only chance, quickly chanted in my mind ''If you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment, would you capture it or just let it slip? His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, there's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti. He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready'' (A mighty ballad to give me courage and strength in this trying time). Afraid of missing my shot I then struck with all the force that the gods handed me. It didn't fly away. My target had been eliminated. I lifted the killer pile of paper and that's when I saw it. It fucking exploded. It was absolutely everywhere on the previously clean and white wall. I grabbed a Kleenexâ„¢ and began the cleaning deed. Unfortunately that action only spread the damn bug and created an even bigger area of insect flesh and organs. I cleaned betterly and that was it.

Now, if ya'll don't mind, we'll move on to the funeral service.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I would like to say some words. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll begin that thanking you all for coming, I know it would mean a lot to it if it was here today. I didn't get to know it very well, but I definitely met it at its prime. When I first saw it it was fluttering gracefully. I don't know if it was out of joy or out of fear, but it sure as hell was beautiful. In fact, for the majority of the time I knew it it was flying, I only saw it land once and, unfortunately, it died quickly succeeding this moment of peace for it. At least we will know that it was a good death for it. On top of that, let's never forget that bits of it will alway be with us on my physics notebook.

Once again, thanks for coming, thanks for listening to me and I'd like to finish this ceremony by playing [its favorite song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yhyp-_hX2s)
