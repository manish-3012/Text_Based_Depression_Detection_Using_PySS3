!HELP! My father is stealing from me and I donâ€™t know what to do So im 15M and my father 45M found out that i have an Youtube channel and is trying to get all the money from it and Iâ€™m very uncomfortable 
I have an art YouTube channel that has quite a number of followers (200K) and i never monetized a single video because since Iâ€™m 14 I donâ€™t really have a credit card, Iâ€™ve been hiding my all social media from my parents because they have shown themselves as manipulative in the past, for example my father once said this after I showed him a crappy animation i did â€œone day youâ€™ll be the money maker of this familyâ€ and i felt so bad after hearing it I didnâ€™t animate for 2 years but now he knows everything about my channel and the amount of followers and is trying to sell my things and telling everyone that im â€œfamousâ€ and i hate it because i want my personal life separated from my art life, he is already trying to get the fucking television to interview me and i am so uncomfortable , i have never shown my face and im planning on keeping it that way until im over 18
Everyone at school knows this now and im really scared because this is not what i wanted at all and every time i do something that my father doesnâ€™t like he threatens my saying heâ€™ll delete all my art and sell it and I donâ€™t know what to do
Art has always been my comfort zone and my father is destroying it
Can someone please tell me what i can do??? Im losing my mind
