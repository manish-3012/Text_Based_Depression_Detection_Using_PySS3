Canâ€™t wake up in the morning Iâ€™m supposed to graduate this year and start a phd program next year, but depression is wiping me out. I sleep 12-14 hours a day, skipping two of my morning classes. Iâ€™ve missed four weeks of classes. 

It has been excruciatingly difficult for me to motivate myself to complete my projects. Every day feels like Iâ€™m moving through molasses. I havenâ€™t left my room in a week. I have to drink an absurd amount of caffeine or get high in order to do things. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll find love. 

In this moment, I wish I could just not exist.
