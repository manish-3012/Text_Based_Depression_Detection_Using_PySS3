It do be hard sometimes Why oh why does every girl I talk to take fucking hours to respond bro. Like some days itâ€™s good and itâ€™s quick back and forth and then some days itâ€™s like five messages a day cause they take hours on end to reply. And one girl, oh boy, weâ€™ve been stuck in this cycle where we talk, it gets good and it peaks, then it starts to crumble, and then she stops talking to me, and then months later we start talking and it starts over again. Now this new girl Iâ€™m talking to, I love talking with her, mostly because I kind of like her, but today was different. We barely texted and itâ€™s been five hours and she hasnâ€™t replied to me, sad boy hours am I right ðŸ˜¢
