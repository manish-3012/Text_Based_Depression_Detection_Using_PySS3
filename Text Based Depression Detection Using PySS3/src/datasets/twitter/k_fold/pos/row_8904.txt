Today I tried wearing different clothes and it really boosted my confidence Usually I wear pretty much the same thing every day. My wardrobe used to consist of a few t-shirts, 2 pairs of jeans, 2 pairs of shorts and a hoodie. I have always liked the way my friends dress but was too scared to try it myself.

Today I decided I would make a change. I went out and bought some cheap (but nice) tops and a skater skirt. I didnâ€™t think it would suit me but I tried it on and I loved it! I looked in the mirror and actually thought I was pretty. I canâ€™t remember the last time I thought that.

I really encourage people to try this. Just start off with a few cheap things and if you like them you can buy nicer stuff. I hope you all have a great day &lt;3
