Any ways to reduce my footprint as a teenager? Iâ€™m planning on not eating as much meat. But I canâ€™t really use an electric car or use public transportation because most things are still up to my parents and their not willing to make any kinds of expensive purchases. What other ways can I reduce my footprint that my parents wonâ€™t be in charge of?
