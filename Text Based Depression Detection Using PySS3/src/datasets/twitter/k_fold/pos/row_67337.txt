I just want to live my fantasy life!! I want to live my fantasy life where I have a secret admirer that keeps leaving clues behind. Like letters and notes and shit. And I could hunt them down like a detective, but they're like super secretive so it takes months for me to find them. And in the end, they're like a lesbian or something that hadn't come out yet so nobody suspected her. Then it's all cute and happy and stuff... well I also have a superpower, of course, either invisibility or like spiderman powers. Probably invisibility because I'm a detective and all.

I'm really lonely... I'm bi btw
