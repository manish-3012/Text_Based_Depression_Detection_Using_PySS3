Donâ€™t want to start anything but Iâ€™m just saying I work at Walmart and overheard a couple of the guys that work in receiving talking about how a truck came in today with crates covered in Microsoft logos. Just another reminder weâ€™re getting close to launch day. (I wonâ€™t give anymore details.)
