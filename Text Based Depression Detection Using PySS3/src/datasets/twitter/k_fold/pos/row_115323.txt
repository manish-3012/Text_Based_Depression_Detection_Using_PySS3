In class I learned that apparently Nightmares and Night terrors are completely different things. With nightmares not much occurs but with night terrors they can actually effect you in the real world and cause things like (screaming, sleepwalking, intense dread, etc). While nightmares donâ€™t really do this as you age. Also night terrors mostly impact kids and you dint tend to remember them that often.
