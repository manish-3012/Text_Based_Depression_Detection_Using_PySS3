I hate having nobody to cry to. I hate knowing that 79% of suicides are men. I hate that people think men cant be raped. I hate that people think men cant be abused when ive been abused. I hate that people think men cant be sexually harassed when ive been sexually harrassed. I hate that society doesnt care about boys
