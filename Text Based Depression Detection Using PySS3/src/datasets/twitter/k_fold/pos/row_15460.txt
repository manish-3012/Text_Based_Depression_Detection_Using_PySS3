Can yâ€™all do a bedroom reveal so i can get decor ideas, redecorating my room 5x a week is the only thing that keeps me sane my room is so minimalist and awkwardly clean tho 

but one of my walls has two different shades on it after my dad tried to cover up some large holes (ðŸ™„) so i donâ€™t know how to hide it. i was thinking iâ€™d just hang my TV but i donâ€™t want a TV to take up so much wall room, itâ€™s too big. let me see your poster walls
