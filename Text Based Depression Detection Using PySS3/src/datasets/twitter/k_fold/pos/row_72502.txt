My dad, who has been gone most of my life, blocked me on Facebook My dad has been gone since I was 2. I have lived a pretty normal life with my mom and stepdad. Other than the day I found out he was lying about being my real dad. A long, long time ago a was nosy enough to find my real dads name and search him up on the Internet. His Facebook popped up and after much consideration I added him. A couple days ago he decided to deny my request and block me on there. I got pretty upset and I couldn't sleep that night.

Moral of the story, never add your long lost dad on Facebook because he'll just block you. :)

F in the chat for me...
