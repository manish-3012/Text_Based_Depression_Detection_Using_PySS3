I have no idea anymore I guess this is a rant or something but I just needed to say this for some unknown reason.

I donâ€™t know anything anymore.

I enter existential crises every day and I donâ€™t seem to find any motivation at all, Iâ€™m pretty sure that Iâ€™ll be alone forever because Iâ€™m unable to commit to anything so yeah.

I really donâ€™t know what to do now so sorry for wasting your time because I really donâ€™t wanna seem needy or attention seeking, or maybe I subconsciously do because I canâ€™t stand being alone but I still wanna be alone, and yes the stuff you read is just as confusing to you as it is to me.
