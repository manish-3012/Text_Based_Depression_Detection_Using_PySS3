I've been speaking English for almost 9 years and I just found out that there's a difference between "will" and "be going to" Other students at my school don't even know how to carry a casual conversation but the education system is like its advanced grammar time. I sucked at kahoot today because I couldn't tell the difference. My teacher has the audacity to say "Native speakers don't pay attention to this rule during daily conversations but you will still learn it". This is bullshit
