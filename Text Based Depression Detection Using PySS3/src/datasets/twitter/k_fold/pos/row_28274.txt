My friends treat me different than how they treat others. Iâ€™ve been starting to notice that my friends have been treating me different than how they treat each other.

What do I do? The other day we were playing a game. One of my friends left out of nowhere, and all my friends were quite disappointed and sad. Once I left, they noticed it, but didnâ€™t say a single word. This has been going on for so long. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I just want friends who would appreciate me in this world. I donâ€™t know what to do. What do I do? (3rd repost because I used the wrong flair.)
