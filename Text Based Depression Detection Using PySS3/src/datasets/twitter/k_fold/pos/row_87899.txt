I do crack I understand that drugs like these are dangerous and can affect the neuro system but hear me out...


I started doing crack after recovering from my accident at the mountains, a fell of a cliff and twisted both of my ankles... Luckily my dog broke my fall because I could have died, god bless her sweet soul.


At the hospital, the nurse accidentally injured  crack in my IV tube, she got fired but unfortunately I didn't have time to thank her because it made me feel amazing. I couldn't bare my dog's death and also being stuck in that pit for seven days, it made me forget the pain and kinda made me a happier person. I don't believe depression can be cured but after doing crack for a year, I never felt better. 


Thank you...
