Anyone else HATE the fact that reply notifications happen instantly but the comment doesnâ€™t actually show up till u refresh like 5 times? LIKE U DUN SHOWED THE TEXT IN THE NOTIFICATION DAMMIT

If I lose FIVE seconds for every time this happens, every 500 comments I will have lost almost AN HOUR AND A HALF OF MY LIFE
