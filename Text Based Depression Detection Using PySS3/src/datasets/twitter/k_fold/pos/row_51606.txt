I kinda like my body Iâ€™m not super chubby but im not like skinny either. I donâ€™t have super big boobs, Iâ€™m like a B cup. I donâ€™t have a super huge butt, sheâ€™s a little bit above average. I have hip dips and thatâ€™s kinda annoying but itâ€™s kinda cool because everyone thinks Iâ€™m flat until I turn around. I just like who I am. I used to see my chub and be like â€œIâ€™m so FAT ughâ€ and then Iâ€™d workout and cry. But thatâ€™s not me. I am who I am and if it werenâ€™t for my fat I probably wouldâ€™ve broken a bone when I get hit by a car. Instead I walked away with a few bruisesðŸ˜ŒðŸ‘ðŸ½that is all.
