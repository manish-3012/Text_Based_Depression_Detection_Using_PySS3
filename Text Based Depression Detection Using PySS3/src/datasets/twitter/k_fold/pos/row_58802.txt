Some random thoughts...  I feel like the levels of hornyness in [r/teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/) is suspiciously high, why do i think that? cause im 16 and i cant relate to any post over here, but the amount of sexual stuff going on here is really abnormal (at least on my perspective), i know a lot of people irl and i have never seen someone as horny as people in this sub, i think there is an alarming amount of creepy old people who act like teenagers trying to make teenagers talk about sexual stuff, with all this fake sex stories and "i masturbated and x thing happened"

do you guys think the same or am I going crazy?
