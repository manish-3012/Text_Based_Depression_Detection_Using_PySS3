Throwback to this funny incident that happened with me when I was 5 or 6 At school I forgot my school bag and went home through school bus without a bag . I didn't realised I had not wore my school bag .
It was only when my mom realised and had to call school teacher  to confirm.

 Childhood was so fun when we didn't cared about things and enjoyed life . We could enjoy things easily and had no problems

Wish that times come again
