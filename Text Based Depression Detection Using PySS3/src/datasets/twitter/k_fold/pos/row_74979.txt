Iâ€™m hella damn happy right now YOOOOOOO

Most people know how bad distanced learning is if you have it or have had it and last year it was horrendous and I had all Fâ€™s and Dâ€™s because the teachers were incompetent and didnâ€™t do anything and we had to teach ourselves. But now Iâ€™m still in distanced learning snow in High school and I know itâ€™s not much but still with how bad it is Iâ€™m happy I got all Câ€™s which is a lot better than last year, and if I get all Aâ€™s at the end of the year my mom said she finna buy me the new Xbox series X

Thank you for coming to my ted talk
