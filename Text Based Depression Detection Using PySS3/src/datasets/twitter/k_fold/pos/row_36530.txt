Just posted on Instagram and I feel so fucking embarassed So today I did the unthinkable, I posted for the first time on my Instagram account in literal years and I've never felt so anxious. My finger was literally hovering over the share button for like 10 seconds because my brain was forcing it not to press it, but I pressed it, and the first thing I did is put my phone into airplane mode because I'm scared of the notifications I'm gonna get. Bruhhh somebody help me I fucking hate anxiety
