I need to get this off my chest 
This has always been a thing between me and my parents, itâ€™s like every time I try to reason with my parents, they always have this stupid mentality thinking Iâ€™m giving an attitude or giving another excuse when in reality, I just wanna speak my little voice and give my view or opinion on whatâ€™s going on. Like today we are just talking about getting me a new tablet that I could use for games and of course Iâ€™m picky as hell when it comes to choosing a tablet and I will admit right now, Iâ€™m wasnâ€™t the best when it comes to handling devices, but Iâ€™ve been trying to reason with them I have been taking more care to my devices that what younger me has done in the past. They gave me an iPhone 6 when it first came out and that was the day I started actually caring for my stuff and Iâ€™ve had it ever since and it still looks good as new but back on topic, I reasoned to them that I handle stuff extremely carefully now and they wonâ€™t accept it, they always talk about the time when I brought my personal laptop to school one day, then all of a sudden the â€œcool kidâ€ stepped on the damn thing and his gang started laughing like turkeys. They think that I broke it when it was ACTUALLY THAT [BLEEP] MISTAKE OF A KID WHO DID IT. All I wanted was just a Samsung galaxy tablet S6 and of course I can understand it is expensive for like 600 something bucks but I showed them the change I have gone through when it comes to device care, and I even showed them how my phone held up through the years and guess what, they still go back to that time where that kid stepped on my laptop while thinking I did it even though I didnâ€™t. I donâ€™t care if reddit thinks this is some fucking fake [bleep] story, I donâ€™t care if I get downvoted, I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t care what all of reddit thinks about me but I wonâ€™t ever physically speak out of my mouth again if every time I do it, my parents think itâ€™s an excuse. Iâ€™m gonna give my family the silent treatment if Iâ€™m not allowed to voice my opinion.  [bleep] mom and dad. You can call me an [bleep] if you want i donâ€™t care.

TLDR: my parents think an excuse comes out of my mouth every time I give my opinion on stuff, especially when it comes to buying new tech.
