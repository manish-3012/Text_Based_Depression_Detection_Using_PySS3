My brother is getting pretty annoying I (15M) am getting really annoyed by my brother (13M)

Don't get me wrong, he is a great bro, I play mc with him all the time, we go to the lake and chill, etc... But lately he's been acting pretty gay  (in a joking way) like grabbing my behind or making sexual jokes very often.

This is getting very annoying and I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my temper very soon and hurt him

Every time he does it I always tell him to stop, and he never does so I just leave after a while. 

How can I get him to stop other than beating him up out of anger cause that would not go well. I want our relationship to be healthier not worse.
