i remember when i was younger i read online that a common reason for leg amputations was no blood flow, so my young brain thought that if my leg was asleep for long enough, iâ€™d have to get my leg amputated so what i did was sit on my leg so it would fall asleep, and stay there for as long as i saw fit. why did i want my leg amputated? i think i thought leg prosthetics were cool, but youâ€™d have to consult 11 year old me. i was not the sharpest bulb in the box
