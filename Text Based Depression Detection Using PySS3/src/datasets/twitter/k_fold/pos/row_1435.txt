Do you ever feel like this Today I saw my best friend and he talked about his summer: he said he started to smoke, drink alcohol and had sex for the first time. This really surprised me because my summer was very calm and not a lot happened. I feel disoriented and lost, almost like Iâ€™m falling behind and Iâ€™m not â€œgrowing upâ€ like all the others and I donâ€™t know what to do. Any advice.
P. S. Me and my friend are both 14.
