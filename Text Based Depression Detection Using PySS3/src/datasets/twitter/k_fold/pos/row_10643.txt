Asking the girl you like out is like betting in a casino I like her really much, and I mean I've never met a girl like her. She is beautiful, charming and has a unique character. I usually didn't mind asking a girl out - I just texted to her and didn't mind too much if she turned me down. But damn, I couldn't stand a rejection from her. 

I try to be nice with her and everything, but I don't know if that's enough and I don't think I can do it. She is on another level.

What should I do? I'm desperate and can't stop thinking about her. Help.
