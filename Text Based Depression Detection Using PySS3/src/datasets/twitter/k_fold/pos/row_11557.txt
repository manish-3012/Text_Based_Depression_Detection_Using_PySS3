Any advices? So there is this girl that I like. We are friends for a few years now. Lets call her Lucy. (Not her real name). There are some other friends of us who we play online games with. Games like Minecraft and Among Us. When there are more people in the call then nothing is wrong. But if something is loading or we are waiting for someone and we are alone (me and Lucy) there is this awkward silence unless there is some really obvious thing to talk about (which is rare). I know that she wants to talk because she always joins the call if I do and she always makes intentional noises to get my attention but I dont know how to start a conversation. Does anyone have any advices? I need them. I could imagine Lucy as my gf. We are 15.
