So I have this friend... ...Who takes politics very seriously. I'm not gonna go into details, but she likes a certain political party, that i do not for one agree with. She makes a very big deal out of it. I never really like talking about politics in general, but she brings it up all the time. She says that she wouldn't be friends with anyone who isn't part of the party, and I haven't told her that I'm not. I dont know if I should break off the friendship or just try to avoid the subject...
