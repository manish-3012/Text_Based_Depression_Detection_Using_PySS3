Is our current system justifiable? Many people would consider the things the elite are doing to the public to be immoral. Is our current system justifiable? Many people would consider the things the elite are doing to the public to be immoral. 

Are they? If you and 9 other prisoners were stuck in a room and there was one food tray slid through the door a day. This food tray could feed 1 person comfortably, or maybe 2-3 people to where they would be on the brink of starvation. Is it more moral to split the food up evenly between all ten prisoners and have everyone die eventually, or to keep it to just a of couple people and have them all live through to the end? I would say to keep it to a couple people and have everyone else die. Well how do you decide who gets to live? How do you deal with people not wanting to die?
Many factors could come into play in deciding who gets to live, but someone of low mental and physical value probably wouldnt be chosen. To make sure the other majority of the prisoners dont try to rob you off the food youd need to manipulate and control them. So maybe evils would be necessary amd justifiable here. 

Chemicals in our soaps, detergents, cleaners, food, ect have all been shown to significantly reduce fertility. Yet they are still on the market. No one is talking about them. The same people who have own the food industries are advocates of population control. Bill gates for example. Public supporter of population control. Hes also the biggest farmland owner in the entire US. No exaggeration, 99.9% of the food we eat comes from only 10 major companies. They all participate in some form of these practices. Some very powerful people are controlling the population sizes. Reasonably so. There isnt enough land for all of us. There aren't enough resources. If you divided up all the arable land evenly, everyone would have less than an acre. You need about an acre to live on. Pollution. Ect. Do you know the actual reason planned parenthood was founded? Population control. And it has evolved so much since then. Do you know why abortion has been attached to womens rights? It's a manipulation tactic that has been used time and time again. They did it during the prohibition era. Attaching things to things people hated or were riled up by. They associated alcohol with blacks to make racists hate it. Ect. They did so many things like this. Made the whole country anti alcohol. A topic women get very heated over is womens rights. Humans have to cut their populations fast or we will all die out. Most humans dont want to be the ones to give up their rights to do things and to have children. So maybe what the elites are doing in regards to population control is justifiable. Keeping people sick and unhealthy also reduces population, it also makes sure no one rises up. Because ignorant people may hate this system. Reasonably so, maybe. And they may want to overthrow it. If they did so all of humanity would collapse and die out. So the elite also have to control people. They do so in many ways, one being media. Did you know that only 6 companies own (almost) all media? Every single one of them takes part in 'negative' manipulation practices. Who is going to do all the poisoning? Who is going to do all the controlling? Who is going to keep this system going? Make sure planned parenthood stays alive? Make sure control is possible? Ect. Roads are needed. Media is needed. Houses are needed. Ect. Jobs are needed. So the elite have to exploit people. The more they do it, the easier everything is. They also already established that they're superior. Because in reality, in many ways they are. Someone along their family tree is/was anyway. They are more worthy than the average folk. They have good genes. They're intelligent. They're educated. They were able to get the power and money that they have. That shows something special. So maybe they get to be the prisoners to eat the food. Basic survival of the fittest. 

So maybe this population control is necessary. Maybe the media control is necessary. Maybe the exploitation is necessary. Is all justifiable.
