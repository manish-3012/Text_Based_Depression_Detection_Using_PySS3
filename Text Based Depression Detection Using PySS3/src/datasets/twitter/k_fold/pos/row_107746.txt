I need help with my dad, he is deceived in me. (m13) So yesterday, i was studying on my family laptop (That my dad paid for) , where i usually game and do other things there. An update for a sound device popped up, it said it needed to update automatically in 15 mins, there wasn't an option to cancel or else. So i said ok. Then tomorrow morning (now) my mother needed the laptop to do online class teaching. She took the laptop and worked with it. And then she told my dad that the laptop was broken and she couldnt even use it. (BSOD appeared repeatedly). My dad was confused and called me downstairs, as he knew i was using the laptop alot. I told him i did nothing and that the update bricked the laptop. He was mad at me and even stopped responding to work emails (My parents are working rn) to fix the laptop. He was disappointed in me and he is mad and wont talk to anybody. Could somebody help me make my dad happy and... how do i say it, back to normal. I have a good relation with my dad, especially the last few days, and i dont want to ruin that.
