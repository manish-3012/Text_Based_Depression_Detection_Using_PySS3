Today I embarrassed the shit out of myself twice So basically we had a half day at school today, and we got a free day in band. We could go to the gym to play basketball or stay in the band room, and I stayed in thr band room. At the end of class, when everyone was walking out of the room, I was given the drumsticks by someone who was messing with the drums. As any teenage guy who was trying to impress the girl he likes with his epic music skills and humor, I didnt think,, and proceeded played the PH theme. (My teacher never calls us out on it, because she knows that if she does, the class knows that she knows the PH theme and what its from) So everyone started laughing, but I just KNOW that it wasn't at my joke, but instead at ME. A guy came up to me in the hall after that telling me something and then he mentioned how I wasn't funny (idk how we got there) after the conversation led there, and now I realize how embarrassing that was.

Second time - same girl I like in band is on my bus. Today I was listening to music in my 3arbuds pretty loud, so I couldn't hear the bus driver telling me that hell drop me off right at my address this time instead of at the stop I usually get off at. I got off at the stop I usually get off at, making it seem like I completely disregarded the bus drivers statement, and my friend I get off the bus with told me when we got off. 

Lesson learned: be quiet and don't do anything to impress anyone, also make sure you don't turn up your music too loud. Off to kms now
