Well guys its christmas Time is running out

Like days are flying by so quick

When i was little christmas was so long and now its just a something that begins and ends

I feel so anxious about the future of this world and im just stuck in a brown bubble and everything is grey

Am i supposed to keep dreaming about life or be aware it might end at 25?

And im always contradicting myself and i dont even know what ground i stand on anymore
