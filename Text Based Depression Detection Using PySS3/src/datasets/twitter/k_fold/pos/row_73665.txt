I made $16218.03 at wish.com using their "wish promoter" scheme. And they did not pay me a single penny. I'm sorry for this post, but I really wanna make ya'll aware of this.

Hi, 

My name is Ali. About a few months ago, I came to know about wish.com's wish promoter scheme where you can earn around $10 each time a sale is generated through your affiliate link. Using wish promoter, I made $16218.03 in around 3 months, but wish.com is not willing to pay me. When I wasn't earning anything, my $0 payments were being confirmed every month. As soon as I started making some money, they stopped confirming my payments. (When you make money using wish promoter, they "confirm" the money that was made in the previous month and then they pay you)  When I reached them through email, no one ever replied. It's been a month since I've been trying to contact them, but nobody ever replied except for one instance. 

One of their correspondents, namely Joe Adams, once replied saying: "...it appears as though this is a situation in which a promoter has multiple accounts, which is against our Terms and Services and subject to deactivation." 

"it appears" :D

This statement of Joe Adams is a blatant lie, which they spoke when they saw me making money. Before that, this lie never existed. And what's worse is that they didn't even provide me with evidence to support their statement. They just said it.  After responding with this lie, no one, literally, no one, ever responded to even a single message out of thousands that I sent at their different email addresses. 

At this stage, I'm really tired, and sad about what happened to me. It took a lot of time and effort to reach that milestone, and it was all in vain.
