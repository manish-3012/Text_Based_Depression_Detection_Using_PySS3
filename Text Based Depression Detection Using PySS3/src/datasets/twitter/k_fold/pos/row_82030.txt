Hey, Iâ€™m 15 and I got my first grey hairs (About 8-10) help. 
So my mom was going through my hair today about 45 minutes ago and she noticed a few grey hairs on the top of my head so she decided to take them out and yep, they were fully white/grey hairs. I am unsure to why this could happen and I donâ€™t want to google about it because google is just gonna scare me even more. Some more information:
1) My dad isnâ€™t bald although heâ€™s got whiteish hair 
2) My grandpa from momâ€™s side was half bald but never lost the color of his hair
3) My mom has natural brown hair and so do I.

Any help or stories about the same experiences will be appreciated.
