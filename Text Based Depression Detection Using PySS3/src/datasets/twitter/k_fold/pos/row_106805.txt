The Moon landings were faked! Psych! 

More of more of our generation are not only saying the Moon landings didn't happen but that "space is fake". They do rightly believe in climate change though.

How can we be so smart on one thing but be so dumb on another?

What happened?

We need to dream big again! While we are fighting climate change and inequality we also need to believe that humanity could achieve something like Star Trek or Mass Effect someday!
