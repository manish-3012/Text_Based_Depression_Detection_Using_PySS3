One of the things that keep me from suicide is that i want my body to be cremated but i live in a country where it is not legal. I don't want my fat ugly ass body to start swelling and rotting and get full of worms it's just so gross even if i won't feel anything or even know about it. I like my body to be cremated and i want the ashes to be scattered in the sea and thats much better. but guess what? It's not legal here! It's a fucking religious country and the dead just HAVE to be buried. 
This is a weird thing to post but i have nobody to share these thoughts with except loki but he's not real.
