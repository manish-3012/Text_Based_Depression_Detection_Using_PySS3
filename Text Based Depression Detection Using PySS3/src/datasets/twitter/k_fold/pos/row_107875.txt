may be slightly triggering for some with issues with eating!! for the past few days Iâ€™ve been forcing myself not to eat breakfast or lunch and only eat dinner and sometimes have a dessert with it. I feel proud when I skip meals but Iâ€™m happy to eat my dinner and then Iâ€™ll eat the dessert and really regret it. Iâ€™m almost 15 and go to school and always end up really shaky and cold but I refuse to eat apart from my dinner. Iâ€™ve also started drinking low calorie monsters to keep my energy up at school. Is this bad for my health or ?? I also constantly think about food itâ€™s always on my mind, Iâ€™m obsessed with what I eat and always feel guilty after eating.
