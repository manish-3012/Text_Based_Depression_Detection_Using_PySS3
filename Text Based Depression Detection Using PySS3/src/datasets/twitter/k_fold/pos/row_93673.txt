I have the perfect idea. It's a win/win. I have the perfect idea to make my life better. I live in California where we have the strictest lockdown in the country and Covid cases are skyrocketing. Things may never return to normal, ever. 

I'm not a very good driver and I have never drove on the freeway before, but I am thinking of driving all the way to Montana or Wyoming where no one lives, and where Coronavirus barely exists.

If I have a panic attack or get in an accident because I don't know how to drive the freeway, I can die and end my suffering on this planet. If I make it to Montana or Wyoming, I can try and experience life again.
