Why do parents hate kids making online friends? My dad confronted me the other day, and informed me that I needed to be careful with my friends I play Minecraft with. He accused them of not caring about me or my feelings, and likely having some ulterior motive. He said that it didn't matter that I'd known them for over a year, and that I've face timed with them. He didn't trust them in the slightest. It's fucking annoying because these are the people keeping me sane through quarantine, and without them, I probably would've become depressed (again). It's not my fault he's in the military and literally all of my friends live in other states or countries because of how much we've moved. It's not my fault we're living through a quarantine and I can't make friends in school.
