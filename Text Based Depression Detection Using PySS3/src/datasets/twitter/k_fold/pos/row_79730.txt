Some nights i am happy But then remember that my friends ignore me and that i still dont know what i did wrong and how to fix it

Also how tf can i be less dramatic?

Also tommorow is the first day of winter break and i bet i wont be allowed to sleep too much and then do nothing and be mad at myself.

You see the dramatic part?
