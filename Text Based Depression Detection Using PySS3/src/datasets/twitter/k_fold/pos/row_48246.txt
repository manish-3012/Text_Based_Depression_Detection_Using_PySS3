My mom is blaming devices for my sister staying up so late. Before you say it, yes, I know that blue light can make you stay awake, and I'm not denying that. But my mom is blaming devices for my sister staying up so late, and that couldn't be farther from the truth.

A while ago, one of our cats died. We didn't even have her for two years. It impacted all of us, especially my sister. My sister loved her, and she's still crying over it today. She's been sleeping in my room for the past 6 months because if she sleeps alone, she thinks about our cat more. My sister has had trouble sleeping especially recently, breaking into tears about it if we even mention our old cat. 

My mom has seen all this and decided that it's devices that are making her stay up so late. Once again, I'm not denying the effects of blue light, and I'm not saying that blue light has nothing to do with my sister staying up. But I am saying that blue light isn't causing my sister to break down in tears at 10 PM. 

My mom has seen my sister come into my room at night just so that she can sleep, she has seen my sister ask not to mention our cat after dinner, and she has heard my sister cry. She's seen all of this, and instead of getting my sister a therapist or doing something else to help her get over this, she has decided that no one in our family can use devices after dinner. My mom isn't abusing us, but she certainly isn't helping my sister with what she's going through.

Thanks for reading, I hope you all have a good day.
