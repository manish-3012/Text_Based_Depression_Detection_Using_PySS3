Basically Iâ€™ve betrayed myself kinda I told my self I would never watch anime because I donâ€™t need to and I will get addicted. Welp my little sister started watching and then I was like aaa Iâ€™ll just watch it with her ig. Welp now Iâ€™m 2 seasons ahead of her and pretending not to be because Iâ€™m embarrassed. I swear if any of my friends find out I will deny to the death of me. One good thing tho is that my older brothers friend who i low key have a crush on  was like oh are you guys watching (insert show name here) and I was like hell ya maybe itâ€™s not super lame. I said ya but I was probably blushing which is really embarrassing.
