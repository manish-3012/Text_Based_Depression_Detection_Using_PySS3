iâ€™m so tired that i canâ€™t even sleep i feel like i havenâ€™t slept in weeks. my schedule has never been so fucked. iâ€™m awake all through the night only to sleep all day and then wake up with no energy just to go back to sleep again. itâ€™s 3am right now, i started going to sleep at midnight, but intrusive thoughts kept me awake and now i canâ€™t sleep again. my brain is exhausted and needs sleep i just canâ€™t do it !!!
