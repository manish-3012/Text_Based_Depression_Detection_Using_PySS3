My mom turned on Screentime So yesterday, my mom asked me if i watch porn. Straight-up, out of the blue. I was going to lie and say no, but then I thought of all the stories on here about parents walking in and them just pretending like it didn't happen. I really don't like to lie, so I took my chances and said "not often."

She just kind of went "um" and walked away. I thought it was cool, so we'd just pretend like nothing happened. But then today, I'm in online class and I get a notif saying Screen time is on. Basically, both my phone and computer are a brick from 10 pm to 7 am, my mom can see every single page I visit, and how long I spend on them. The only apps I can access 24/7 are Messages and Maps. Literally no one I know texts (we use Insta or Discord) and I haven't left the house in 3 months.  I went to go argue with my mom, but she went off on some rant about how I am a Christian (her choice, not mine) and how I don't need to be up "that late." Typically, I'll stay up until 11 or 12 doing hw. I thought she knew that and was okay with it, but I guess not. Weekends, I'll watch Netflix or whatever until 2, but not anymore I gues. She talked about how all her  friends do the same, but they're all Karens who yell at a fast food worker and post about it on facebook. I'm really mad right now, not so much about the porn thing (I have reddit wink), but because of how stupid I was. If u guys have any tips on how to evade screentime, that'd be neat.
