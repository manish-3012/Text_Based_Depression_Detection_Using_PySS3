Gentlemen I've Been Duped So here I am watching Disney's Bolt in my schools agricultural building. How did I get in this situation you ask? That'll take me back to about last week, it was a Saturday and I was volunteering at my schools truck show to raise money for the ffa, but more importantly to get me some ((community service hours)). So while I'm there I met this girl and we hit it off you know? So she tells me that her and her friend will be going to the next get together Tuesday where we'll be watching *bolt*. So I debate about going over for a while, until Monday when I think to myself why not. Monday came and went and now here I come to see that they never came. And now I'm typing this out and sipping on a coke. Living large fellas
