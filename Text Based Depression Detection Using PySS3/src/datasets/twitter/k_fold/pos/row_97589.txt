A woman I know was raped I know, heavy title.


I was staying over at a friend's house this past weekend. We were eating dinner and her mom was clearly bothered by something. We weren't sure about what it was, so my friend finally decided to ask.


Friend: Mom, what's wrong?

Her mom didn't reply. 

Friend: Mom. What's wrong with you?


Her mom sighed and stayed quiet for a minute before looking at us.

She explained that a woman who we'll call A that she works with got raped. She's going through a divorce and decided to go to a bar one night. She met some men there, they talked and they invited her to a party. Her and one of the men drove to the place where the party was supposed to be at and the rest of them drove another vehicle.

There was no party.

The men brought her to the place and raped her. There were *five* of them.


Of course when we heard this, me and my friend were floored. This woman is going through a divorce and has two young children, the last thing she needs on top of that is getting fucking *raped*.

My friend's mom explained that her and another woman were the only people that knew and that they would never have known if they didn't see A break down in the break room. She said she didn't want to tell us but figured that she should since we're both young girls that need to be careful.

What I didn't realize is that I know this woman. A has a pretty common name. I saw her in the store that she works at today and she seemed a little off. I pondered it for a moment before I connected the dots and she fit the description perfectly. I asked my friend and she confirmed it. I don't know her extremely well but I've gone to their kid's birthday party and my little brother plays with her kids. Her little boys are already having a hard time with the divorce so knowing this would break them.

A doesn't know what to do. She doesn't want to go to the police out of embarrassment and fear but she feels like she should. She thinks she knows who did it but doesn't want to falsely accuse someone.

The situation was weighing on me so I told my mom that someone my friend's mom works with was raped. I had forgotten her name so I told my mom that I didn't know but I'm hoping she doesn't connect the dots like did. She doesn't know about it as much as I do though so I don't think she will. My mom knows the woman and I don't want the news spreading.


I haven't been able to stop thinking about it and my friend has been having nightmares and hasn't been able to sleep well at night. I'm an anxious person but I'm sure I'll be able to get over it soon but I'm worried about my friend since she never worried about much. Everyone stay safe and be careful who you trust.
