Need someone to talk to? I want to grow up and be a therapist, (or maybe a photographer) so I can help others who need emotional/mental help. I always feel bad when I go on Reddit, and people who make others feel bad when they say they are depressed or something (ex wholesome awards) I've seen lots of other teens who say they need someone to talk to. So if anyone of you wanna talk to someone, you can just DM me &lt;3
