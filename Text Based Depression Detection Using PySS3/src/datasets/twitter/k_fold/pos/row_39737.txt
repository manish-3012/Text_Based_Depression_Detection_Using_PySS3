I write alot and this is something I wrote that gives me stalkery vibes and my friend really liked it so I gained the confidence to post it:) I dont show my writing to many people except my friends &amp;#x200B;

Admiring is sort of a odd thing to do, a glance across the room, stealing a moment where you can just.. study their face, as your unstable, broken mind begs to create a fantasy where they're yours, and you let yourself love the person in your head, because you'll never get them. You'll never be loved by the one person that occupies every thought in your head.

&amp;#x200B;

You spend every moment creating a false reality in your head where you're happy because you don't have the energy to make it happen. You fall more in love with a thought. A thought in your head. A thought that is nothing like the person you expected them to be, and when you finally, finally get the smallest hold of them you just constantly disappoint yourself because they aren't what you created them as in your head. You lied to yourself. All you can do is cry.

Cry because you create what you fail to create what you want the most.

Why can't life be like a mind? Why can't you just create what makes you happy?
