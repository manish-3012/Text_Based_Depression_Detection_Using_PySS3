I always fantasize about being born in the 80s/90s in America They really seem like the best years. Building some prehistoric tech (new at the time) with friends playing some DnD, going to cinema. I understand why those generations are so hard on today's technology. Or it might be that I just need friends. Anyways, in what era would you like to live?
