everything in my life is going so perfectly right now. fuck i feel good today i came out as bi. my friends are all so supportive. i told them i love and appreciate them so much. i really have the kindest people for friends.

i started being friends with this girl from another school and weâ€™re gonna try to hangout soon. sheâ€™s so fucking cool.

my grades have been slipping but i actually studied and did work last night and fuck i felt so good afterwards.

and now iâ€™m chilling and listening to good ass music hehe hope u guys had a good day too, if not, know thereâ€™s better ones ahead
