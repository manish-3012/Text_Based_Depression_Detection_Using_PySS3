Iâ€™m scared that iâ€™m going to lose her or something Me and this girl have been talking for a while now (everyday, mainly all day). But recently iâ€™ve noticed that she has been taking a while to reply back, i found out this is due to her talking to other people. Is this me being boring or is it out of my control? And is this a sign of jealously?
