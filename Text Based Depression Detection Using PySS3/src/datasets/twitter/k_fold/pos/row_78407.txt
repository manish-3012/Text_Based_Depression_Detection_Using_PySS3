i feel really bad because today during lunch a little year 7 / 7th grader challenged me to a fight and i am a year 11 / 11th grade for you americans. anyways he hit me a few times but they didn't hurt then i punched him and  when my fist made impact with his chest he farted really loudly. i just feel bad for humiliating him my friends and other people in his year were watching.
