Iâ€™ve been missing my friends from my old school so much at the end of last year my mom made me (or at least, coerced me in to agreeing to) change schools because I wasnâ€™t doing well. I wasnâ€™t very close to any of my old friends, so when i changed schools I lost contact with all of them..

but recently Iâ€™ve just been missing them so much it almost hurts and makes me feel sick

I wish I hadnt changed schools, I donâ€™t have bc any one I care about in my life anymore
