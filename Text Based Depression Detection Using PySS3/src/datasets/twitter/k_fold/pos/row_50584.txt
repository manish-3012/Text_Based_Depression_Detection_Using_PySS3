How to not be awkward? So a friend of mine has his birthday in about a week and he will take some people, including me, out for dinner. The other people are a few female friends of his from our school. I don't really know them that much and I'm generally an awkward person so I want advice. I want to not feel awkward and not say anything and perhaps even get to know them better.
