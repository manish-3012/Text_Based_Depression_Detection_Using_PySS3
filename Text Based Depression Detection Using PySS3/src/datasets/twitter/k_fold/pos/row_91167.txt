I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ve done something wrong So me and my best friend were really close before the Christmas lockdown and during it we were texting all the time. Then it gets to the first day of school and I thought it would be great to see her again but then he hardly spoke and now it feels like weâ€™ve never met before she has also not been speaking on our gc that much either.
