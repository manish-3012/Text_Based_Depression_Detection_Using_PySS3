Anyone want to be friends? Hi Iâ€™m Ben, I need new friends.
Recently I went through a break up and lost the group I hung around in because me and my ex were in the same group.
Anyway, Iâ€™m 16 and need new people to talk too.
Some of my interests are Minecraft, Dragon Quest, PokÃ©mon, Food, Music, I like telling jokes, ok also really good at listening, I love acting and performing, Iâ€™m good with numbers (sometimes), musicals.
My favourite musical at the moment is Hadestown, I have performed in a few musicals and I aspire to be a marine biologist or veterinarian but if they donâ€™t work out Iâ€™d love to get into acting.
Enough about me, please feel free to message me if you want to be friends, Iâ€™d love to hear about things others enjoy and it would be amazing to make new friends. 
Sorry for the giant paragraph but thanks for reading, have a wonderful day/night.
