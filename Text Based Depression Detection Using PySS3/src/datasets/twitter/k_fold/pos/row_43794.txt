My sister burned down our local library for a TikTok This is the worst one yet. I think it was for some trend where you record yourself participating in the civil war. My homies Eratosthenes and Zenodotus worked really hard to contribute to the library, and everybody in Alexandria is really sad about it already. Fuck Tiktok
