I just got rejected. Yay. I want to die. It's not even bout the rejection, but that I lost one of my best friends.



And don't even say "there is plenty fish in the sea".

I hate being sensitive. I don't even look bad! I exercise every single day, wear what fits me people literally tell me I look good and yet now this. I want to die.


Aaaaaaaaaaaaa.

I have no idea what to do. I'm just simply sad.
