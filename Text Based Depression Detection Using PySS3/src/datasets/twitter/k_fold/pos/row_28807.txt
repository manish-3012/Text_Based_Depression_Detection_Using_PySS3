my mom just banned me from driving and told me I can only have a small bowl of cereal for breakfast I just need a place to vent. As the title says, my mom basically just took away my license and keys and told me I was only allowed to eat a small bowl of cereal for breakfast. Why? Because of "spatial awareness". 

I have two brothers, one in preschool and one in 2nd grade, so counter space runs out pretty quick due to online school. My mom was unloading dishes and making my brothers breakfast, though that is what my dad normally does. I was in the corner, trying to make a bagel, trying to take up as little of space as possible. I was standing on the outside of the kitchen at the counter, as this part was a peninsula (is that the right term?), and she suddenly takes the bagel bag out of my hand. I asked her why and she started screaming crap about spatial awareness and how if I can't use good spatial awareness I shouldn't be allowed to drive. She told me I was standing right in her way and I was hogging a lot of space. Like no I wasn't, I wasn't even the kitchen, much less "right where you needed to be". 

I don't drive a whole lot, but when I do, its normally to run an errand for my parents or to get away from them for a bit. So now I am probably going to get in trouble for not being able to go to the store to get this or that. I am beyond mad at this point, and I just need somewhere to vent. Sorry for wasting the 3 people who will read this's time.
