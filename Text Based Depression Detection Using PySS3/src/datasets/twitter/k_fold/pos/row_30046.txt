I need advice. (Reposted for time zone purposes) Long story, tldr at the end.

I recently moved into a new city and joined a new school. Because of the rona situation, school starts off online for me. The teacher asks me to introduce myself with my camera on, so I do so nervously. After a few days a girl approaches me via text and we chat for a bit. We share a lot of interests and she's super smart. Eventually she invites me to a group chat with all her other friends and I'm suddenly part of the popular crowd.

While it's great to have friends, I am usually the loner and the quiet kid, so it's a little overwhelming. It doesnt take long for them to accept me though. Fast forward a few weeks and we've video called a lot and watched movies together etc. I develop a crush on the lady who approached me and I think she flirts at least a little.(mind you I am awful at this and I could just be imagining things)

One day she tells me something which is what has me confused. She says that on day 1 when I turned on my camera she was very smitten by me and thought I was VERY hot. I have a terrible self image and dont think I'm very attractive at all. Though I have been working out a lot for the past year because I've had a lot of free time. I haven't met her irl, but I think she's into me. Issue is, she's an extroverted social butterfly and I'm a stereotypical redditor.

For me, a relationship is very personal and I would only consider asking someone out face to face. Still, I'm crushing hard on her. What should I do?

Tldr; Joined new school, classes start online. Introduce myself on camera. Girl approaches me, becomes friend. Adds me to friend circle, I develop crush on her. Crush says later that she thinks I'm hot. Am confusion.

Edit: The entire group has decided to meet up irl in a few weeks (we have exams rn). Dont know if this changes anything.
