I just got rickrolled by my past self. Yeah my past self rickrolled me, a few months ago at school I rickrolled my family through my smart clock by setting a routine but I forgot to turn it off and it the routine never got triggered until now when my smart clock just randomly played Never gonna give you up and that's how I got rickrolled by my past self.
