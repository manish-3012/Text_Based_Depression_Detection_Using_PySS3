I donâ€™t like cats I donâ€™t like how tolerable people are towards them. I donâ€™t like laws around cats. I donâ€™t like how theyâ€™re praised after not doing something bad. I donâ€™t like most of their personalities. I donâ€™t like how theyâ€™re still basically wild animals. I donâ€™t like cat shit in my garden. I donâ€™t like how people give them what they want all the time. I donâ€™t like how untrained they are.
