Hey guys (and gals), Before you read, this is like 8 paragraphs and I took some pills I found under my bed a few hours ago. thank you! (the first few were written in mobile. I blacked out and moved to my laptop)

&amp;#x200B;

So thereâ€™s this girl,right? And Iâ€™ve had a massive crush on her, like this has been going on since like October of 2019. Now, we (used to) volunteer together at a library and we started off as friends until January. Starting that January, I started to have massive feelings for her, like Iâ€™d be thinking about her even when I would be talking to other girls at school or Iâ€™d be going to bed thinking about her. My other friends who volunteered at the library noticed how I was with her: awfully sweet around her, ecstatic when she entered the room, lonesome when she was absent. My other female friend told me out of the blue that weâ€™d make a cute couple; she knew I had  a massive crush on her. So I thought she probably liked me back, so one day I asked her to get a coffee or something after our shift, so we go.

It was going all great, but that wasnâ€™t what I was getting coffee for, I wanted to make a move on her BUT MY NERVOUS ASS NEVER HAD THE GUTS TO DO IT. Yeah thatâ€™s only the first part. So going home that evening, I thought to myself â€œhey, Valentineâ€™s Day is in 3 weeks, Iâ€™ll ask her out for then!â€ So I made my commitment to ask her out on that 4th (the Tuesday a week before). We go to separate schools, so the only chance I get to talk to her was either at the library where we volunteer, or to meet up with her in the neighborhood (we live like 3 blocks away from each other) call/text isnâ€™t an option because 1. She doesnâ€™t check her messages until late at night  2. I prefer to ask girls out in person &amp; 3. IM A TERRIBLE TEXTER.

So I wait for her at the library, practicing what to say when we walk out together, AND SHE NEVER ARRIVES. I think â€œhuh, she must be sick.â€ So I get on with my tasks for that day.  I wait till next week, SHE DOESNâ€™T COME. So I drop a note in her mailbox (yeah we have each otherâ€™s addresses) she texts me the next morning that sheâ€™s busy with school and sports. I understood that because I was like her for a while. I go home, and get on with the rest of the week. The Monday 4 days before V-day rolls up, and I wake up panicking that Iâ€™ll miss out on my big chance. I drop a note in her mailbox (asking her out) as I biked to school and Iâ€™m shitting myself all day wondering when sheâ€™s gonna read that note. I get a text that night she tells me she has a \[basketball tournament\]. Iâ€™m in tears, Iâ€™m punching walls, screaming, breaking down, etc. that Valentineâ€™s Day, I was alone once more.

This ainâ€™t the end, hold on. 2 weeks pass of me drinking before bed, trying to drown any thought of her. I see her again 2 weeks later. As I talk to her, Iâ€™m suppressing all my anger, all my sadness, all my love for her, just trying to look normal. I ask her out ONCE FUCKING MORE and she goes to the tune of â€œYES!!! But can we go out near the end of April? Thatâ€™s when Iâ€™m free?â€ I heartily agree.

Remember when we thought COVID-19 was just gonna blow over us? It didnâ€™t.

I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE DGIHGDGIEH

We werenâ€™t able to hang out really, because of the order and the fact that her parents have heart conditions, so the virus could kill them. I live in a hard-hit area, so everyone was afraid to go out all spring. I got depressed, I started smoking weed. I burnt through my bank account to fuel my $50 a week habit for three months. It wrecked my thought process, It wrecked everything I loved. My mind was no longer focused on getting the girl of my dreams, but chasing that sweet, sweet high. I realized I had a problem, so I quit.

The 2-week withdrawal period hit me like a train. I wasn't able to eat, I was having heart-racing anxiety attacks, I couldn't sleep, and so on. I've been clean for a month now, and the feelings back. I originally realized that we couldn't be together anyways. ACKSHUALLY, I need to clarify a few things.

&amp;#x200B;

* I am 17 years old. I am planning on going to college, and as soon as normal life can resume, I'm leaving my home city for far away.
* My dream girl is 16. She has a busy schedule, but she was down to go out with me.
* My ultimate weakness is myself. I doubt myself a lot, and I have low self esteem. So don't try and say to me "dude just text her". I also hate texting people, it's unnatural to me. I've also been nervous around girls all my life BTW. I also like to sniff paint iff thats relelevant

So as I have quit weed, my feelings for her have returned. I don't plan on resuming weed anytime soon, so my only options are to put my feelings out onto paper, or to drown them with a bottle of McCallan 16-year single malt. I have also realized that I can't drink myself to sleep 5 times a week, and I realized I can't (maybe not) tell her directly how I feel. What triggered this Reddit post for me was me seeing an insanely cute picture of her in my photo box (and the fact that I took some A and I'm getting my juice on). I'm remebering all the good times we had, all the laughter, all the joy. It's all too much. I cant go on like this. i cant take it. this is a cry for help. i want her to see this but she wont she wont she wont she wont. help. i will be my own end. she will be my demise. i will fko f90 ee. (sorry, I'm gacked)

forgot to mention that I have dreams about her, but I hate it so damn much. I just want to forget her, but I have nothing to suppress my memories of her. she was a damn DREAM GIRL for me. (man, that sound weerd)

&amp;#x200B;

IN all seriousness, this is a 50/50 of an off my chest and me asking if anyone has ever felt the same way?
