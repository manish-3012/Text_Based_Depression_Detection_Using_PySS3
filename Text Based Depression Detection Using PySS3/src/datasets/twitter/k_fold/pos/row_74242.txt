i want to make a post about the coincidence between Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy But i think it would be useless, some may be offended, and i dont know how to start it without sounding dumb. But ill do it if some are actually interested in the topic. or you could look at the wiki page [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%E2%80%93Kennedy_coincidences_urban_legend)
