Iâ€™m falling into a dark hole Ive always struggled with stimulants, until I moved to my grandparents house.  I was clean for a few months, but I decided one day to use benzedrex.  I instantly fell back into my old way.  A month later (today) I faked adhd and got a Ritalin prescription.  Iâ€™m getting away with this and itâ€™s so easy.  Iâ€™m moving out in my own in May.  I feel sad and scared.  Can anyone else relate?  I feel alone, my friends donâ€™t talk to me and I canâ€™t tell any adults.
