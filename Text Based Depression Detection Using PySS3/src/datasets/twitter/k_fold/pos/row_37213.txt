So I'm genuinely not sure if I'm correct in this It's a bit of a theory of mine. It goes like this: everyone who transitions is a little crazy. Before you get on my back, let me explain. Most people don't identify heavily with one gender or the other. They care, but not much. I would include both semi-cis and semi-trans in this group. That is to say, people who identify with one gender more strongly than the other, but not to a significant enough degree for it to be truly part of their identity. Because of societal expectations, both of them present as cis(For this reason i believe that people identitying with their non-assigned gender is more common than it seems). Someone who is full-trans or full-cis care deeply about their gender. It is often not noticed in cis people because they were born with the gender they identified with, but I would guess some telltale signs being making gender a part of their identity or aggressively conforming to norms. Trans people are in the same boat, but they have to transition to get to a state they are happy with. I believe that both full-cis and full-trans people are somewhat mentally ill. Not severely, of course, but not quite right either.
