Soon, I will be turning 20. In my teenage years, I faced it all: drug addiction, heartbreak, depression, pregnancy, and more. Here's my advice to you. 
Hi everyone. My name is Maya and I'm about to turn 20 years old. It feels weird to be posting here for probably the last time -- you may not recognize me but I joined this subreddit when I was 14. In the intervening 6 years, I've dropped out of school twice, gotten my heart broken countless times, spent time in a psychiatric facility after a suicide attempt, moved across the country 4 times, and dealt with drug addiction and teen pregnancy. I know that sounds like a lot, but right now I am 1.5 years clean, I live with my boyfriend of 1 year and our cat, I have a full-time job, a good circle of friends, and I couldn't be happier. If anyone can show you that no matter what shit goes down, you can turn it around, it's me. So here's my advice:

*  **Stop giving a fuck about what you look like.**  This has been my biggest personal change since high school. I used to spend HOURS in front of the mirror, worrying about a pimple the size of a pinhead. No one else is noticing that shit, I promise.
* **Reach out to your friends with mental illness.** Even if they never want to hang out, keep inviting them, They always say "if you're struggling, reach out!", but it should be the other way around as well. Check on your friends.Â 
*  **Condoms alone are not effective birth control.**
* **Ask for what you want.** Whether it's a promotion at your job or a date with the girl you like, you have to start asking for things. Point A is where you are now. Point B is where you want to be. The worst thing that happens if what you ask for gets turned down is you stay at Point A.Â 
* **Be kind to your teachers.**
* **Know the signs of an abusive relationship.** [https://au.reachout.com/articles/signs-of-an-abusive-relationship](https://au.reachout.com/articles/signs-of-an-abusive-relationship)
* **There is no age where you are required to have your life plan figured out.**
* **Always wear a helmet and close-toed shoes when riding a moped/motorcycle.**
* **Do not fucking ever do heroin.** Even if you think you won't get addicted. Even if your friends are supervising you. Even if you snort it. Do not do it.
* **If the only reason you won't do something is that you're afraid, do it.** Except for heroin lol. 
* **You will grow apart from your friends.** This is ok and nobody's fault.
*  **Don't worry too much about comparing your life to other people's.** And don't let it make you bitter. Congratulate them on their successes, and don't worry about how your accomplishments stack up next to theirs. 

and lastly,

* **Let yourself be young.** Put the right amount of pressure on yourself to succeed, but don't lose out on the years of your life where you have little to no responsibility and loads of free time! This is a time you will never get back, so make sure you're spending it doing stuff you enjoy. How you spend your days is how you spend your life.
