"Depression is for the weak minded" So here's some backstory

Since corona started I've been going through an emotional downward spiral. I'm at a point in my life where every decision I make will have a huge impact on my adult life all while being at the mercy of some unconsolable unpredictable virus. There's been an ever increasing build up of emotional and social pressure in my head and my only outlet for it all is to mindlessly play videogames and spend money on useless online items. As a result keeping my room clean has been the least of my concerns in the past few months. My room is no "twitch streamer den" but even for a guy's standards it's not clean.

A few days ago my mom walked into my room to return something I left lying around and before she left she looked around and said "If I didn't know that you aren't weak minded I'd think you're depressed".  I scoffed and left it at that. 

Everytime I try confessing how I feel she ignores it or mocks me for being ungrateful or dramatic. The last try I tried telling her I was depressed (5 years ago) she ended up sending me to live while my grandparents for a year. So naturally to avoid arguments I simply don't show emotion around her.
