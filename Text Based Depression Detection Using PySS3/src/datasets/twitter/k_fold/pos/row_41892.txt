is listening to female pop artists 'bad'? so i was on discord with my mate yesterday and listening to music so he asked what i was listening to and i said beyonce and thought nothing of it. but then he started randomly laughing so i asked him what was so fucking funny about it and he just continued so i called him a cunt blocked him and left and went back to listening to bey.


so is listening to female pop artists 'weird' or whatever? or is my friend just a dickhead? yeah probably the latter. not my problem he cant listen to anything that isnt migos talking about how they are going to 'fuck on your bitch she a thot thot thot'. 


id like to know your thoughts please. have a good day gamer girls
