I think Iâ€™m in bois!!!! So i work front end at this fancy grocery store and I loved all the people I worked with. Made a lot of friends and really didnâ€™t want to leave but I needed a higher paying job. I tried staying long enough to meet all the new hires and then put my 2 week notice in.

A few days after another new person starts working and she was really chill. I never thought much of it at first and thought it was just the usual coworker kind of chill. She also happened to be working on my final day and after I left my final shift she said to one of my friends I was cute and that sheâ€™d miss me.

I thought she looked amazing and was pretty confident I had no chance so my mind just disregarded any thoughts of trying until she told my friend I was cute and sheâ€™d miss me. So I had to get in contact with her somehow cause I wasnâ€™t gonna miss this opportunity.

Luckily my friend got her snap and sent it to me so weâ€™ve been talking pretty much since then.

One night we were talking about snowboarding and we both happened to be good skiers that are newbie snowboarders so I thought this was a good time to go for it. I asked if she wanted to go to the slopes and struggle together.

She said yes!!!!

Iâ€™m very excited and nervous. Iâ€™m not usually the best at making conversation so Iâ€™m really worried Iâ€™m gonna make it awkward and ruin my chances of this continuing.

Please any kind of tips are very helpful I just really want to make sure this goes well and I donâ€™t screw it up.
