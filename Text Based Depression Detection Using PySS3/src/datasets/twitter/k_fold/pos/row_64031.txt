Just got told by my classmate not to cut my hair because girls like it A few days ago I was in my French clas which I started taking in middle last year but now Iâ€™m a freshman and taking French 2, but one of the guys in my clas who was a freshman last year saw my hair while my teacher did these breakaway calls of groups of 3 and he said wow your hair is king and I said I needed to cut it but then he said donâ€™t because girls like guys with long hair,
