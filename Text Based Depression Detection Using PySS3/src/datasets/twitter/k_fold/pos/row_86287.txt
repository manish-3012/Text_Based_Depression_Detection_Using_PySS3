Losing weight is weird Long story short I was 155 a year ago, now iâ€™m 103 I think. I donâ€™t even know when it happened, I just looked in the mirror one day and felt different. I weighed myself and realized I lost 30 pounds somehow, got addicted to seeing the numbers drop. 4 years of trying to lose weight and I finally did it, at the cost of whatâ€”paler skin, extreme body dysmorphia, nausea and stomach problems. Wish I could go back and do it the healthy way, with a balanced diet. Idk how I have hair because I starved myself the entire time. Traded one problem for another

I donâ€™t feel like myself even though this is basically what Iâ€™m supposed to look like because I was a 5lb baby/super scrawny kid that only blew up like a balloon because of some stupid disorder. Even with all that weight I still had thin arms and legs. But anyways now that Iâ€™m â€œnormalâ€ Iâ€™m trying to gain weight. Itâ€™s so hard cause my body is convinced I donâ€™t deserve food, and bc my metabolism boosted I think. Iâ€™m weak, iâ€™m a stick, people think iâ€™m 14 and losing weight sucks
