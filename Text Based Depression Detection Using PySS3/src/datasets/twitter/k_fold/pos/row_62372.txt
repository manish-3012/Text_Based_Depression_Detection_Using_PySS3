Not a joke, just describing what just happened to me. I just had a mountain load of diarrhea, I donâ€™t know what was worse. the stomach pain or the acidity of the liquid turd. The pain was unbearable, excruciating, it felt like my asshole was pizza dough going in a hot oven. The feeling  was absolutely agonizing, I can still feel the stinging sensation which by itself feels like a scorpion shoving its poison in my butthole.  It was so strong, it felt like Satan himself French kissed my asshole.
