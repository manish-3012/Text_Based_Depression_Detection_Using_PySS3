Just had an arguements in a group chat with a girl over the fact that men are expected to hide their feelings more Like she kept on saying no cause boys open up to her. Girl, its cause youre a girl. Boys open up to girls, sometimes, and almost never to other guys. I can count on literally like my fingers the number of times a boy has opened up to me. Otherwise, it's basically a fact that Men have an expectation to bottle up feelings. Just look at suicide rates, cause they show this really well. Girls attempt 3 times as often, men die 3 times as much. Cause girls are allowed to be free with emotions more while men get expected to hold them in til they cant.
