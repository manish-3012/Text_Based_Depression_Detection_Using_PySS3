Chip on my shoulder I met my real dad a few months ago and still have that damn chip on my shoulder because I didn't jaw him or spit in his face like I had planned. Guess when it's unexpected you don't know what to do. He said he's gonna be a better dad and try talking to me more. Last message was September 8th. No Merry Christmas or Happy New Year's. I remember that he never paid child support and owes me whatever he makes from his taxes ontop of my 3 sisters he abandoned. Turns out he just wanted to talk to me so he wouldn't have to pay backpay on me. If he had been there for me or at least tried and not wait until I was 18 I would've considered it. Thanks to him abandoning me again and not doing what I wanted I still have that chip.

TLDR: Father met me so he wouldn't have to pay backpay, stopped contacting me in every way and my own regret left me with that same chip he gave me on my shoulder
