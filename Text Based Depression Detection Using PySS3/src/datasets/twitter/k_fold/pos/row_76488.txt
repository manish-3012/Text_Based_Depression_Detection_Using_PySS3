I lost my pants I lost a pair of pants and I need help finding them. Last time I wore them was Saturday and then I changed out of them before work. I left them in my car and I was pretty sure I brought them in my house once I got home. Iâ€™ve checked everywhere I can think of. 
Give me places to search for my pants.
