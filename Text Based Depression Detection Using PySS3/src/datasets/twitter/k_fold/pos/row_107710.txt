A few tips about teen life from someone who will be 18 soon. (Sorry if formating is shit Im on mobile)

So I'm gonna be 18 fairly soon, so i figured I'd spend a little time giving some tips to the younger teens of reddit.

1st off, don't be a dumbass. This part of your life will really define what the rest of your life will be like. I know this sounds like a parent talking, but get good grades. If you just fail school then you're basically going to be fucked for the rest of your life, working a shitty job making $12 an hour. If you at least do the minimum thats required of you, you should be set to game the system.

2nd, don't stress about your future so much. You don't need to have your entire life plan figured out by age 14. Usually  senior year of high school is when you should be making those plans, so you've got some time to think about it.

3rd, don't go crazy over anything that happens socially. It doesn't matter if someone doesn't like you. That's their issue, not yours. That super hot girl doesn't wanna date you? Yeah that sucks, but it doesn't change anything besides the fact that now you get to move on. Dying to have sex? Don't tryhard over that shit. It's not worth all the risks just to have your dick feel nice for a couple minutes. Your number 1 priority in life should be yourself, always.

I would type out more but i have to go back to work, if this helps even 1 person out, I'll be happy for the night.
