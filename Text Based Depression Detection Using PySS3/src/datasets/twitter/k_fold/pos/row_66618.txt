Publicly venting due to a lack of acquaintances Current bio song: Out Of My League by Fitz and the Tantrums

I feel the lyrics are accurate of a deep longing I have for anyone to come along and save me from my seemingly never ending loneliness, whether that be in the form of a relationship or just a friend, i occasionally have dreams of finding that kind of friend, im just too abnormal too strange for that to happen though, i always want someone to talk to but it doesnâ€™t feel right to reach out, and even then i might not always respond when i receive a text from old friends because i feel i have done too much wrong or cant find enough common ground to continue talking to them, i dont even know who im writing this too, if you see this im sorry you had to read all this, i just wanted to transcribe my thoughts into a legible editable medium

TLDR: go read it its a vent i wont sum it up
