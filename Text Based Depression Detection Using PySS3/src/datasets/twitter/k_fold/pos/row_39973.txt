Okay so I definetly need to hear some of you guys opinion of this So Iâ€™ve pretty much been in love with one of my best friends for a while now. Iâ€™m 17M and sheâ€™s 16F. We met a lot during summer but it was pretty much always me who asked her if she wanted to meet. She always wanted, but never asked me. She was also very slow to responds to my messages (sheâ€™s slow to reply to others than me too, I know that because I have asked other friends, I just think she forgets to reply sometimes). I asked one of our mutual friends to ask her if she was interested in me or something because we hung out so much, but she said she only saw me as a friend. After that we didnâ€™t speak for about a month and a half. After that I got a snap from her asking if she could call me, and I said yes of course. We talked about school and random stuff for about 40 minutes and since then we have called each other and talked at least once every week. She started answering my texts very quickly and started to send snaps to me all the time, and she begged me to hang out with her once because she was bored. While we hung out it really felt great and like we had a connection. At this point I felt great because I had hope. This went on for about 2-3 weeks, then it completely stopped. Everything went back to normal. She takes like 1-2 days to reply to my messages (thatâ€™s what she normally takes for other friends too) and I just get another vibe from her (the same I got before she was like this). Thatâ€™s where I am right now and I feel like shit. Iâ€™m planning to tell her about my feelings for her in about a week. I just want to hear what you guys think about her behavior. I also need help on ways to tell her because I donâ€™t want it to become â€œtoo muchâ€ for her so that she distances herself, and I donâ€™t want to make it weird between us. Thanks for the help! :)
