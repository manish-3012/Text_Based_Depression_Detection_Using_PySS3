I want friends but every time I talk to someone I screw up and I just end up wishing I never even tried. So this is probably why Iâ€™ve barely talked to anyone for the past couple of months. Iâ€™m kind of shit at just basic conversation and I really hate myself for it because itâ€™s really fucking embarrassing that I canâ€™t do basic shit like that. It is really sad and I feel lonely alone but you know at least I canâ€™t mess up if I donâ€™t talk to anyone! Thatâ€™s pretty much the whole idea about it. I just donâ€™t wanna hurt myself again because I get really excited to talk to people and then when I realize I canâ€™t do it, it makes me feel even worse. I wish this all could just end.
