I feel fcked While everyone else is going to school after the vacation (I live in the Netherlands), I am still locked inside. Since my mom got a breathing disease, she has to stay away from the virus. It looked like I would go to school but suddenly a week ago the numbers raised. Nobody is keeping distance anymore and that makes it so that i need to stay inside to keep my mom save. I was really looking forward to going to school but now I can't go. I'm still crying

I shared this to hopefully feel a little better.
