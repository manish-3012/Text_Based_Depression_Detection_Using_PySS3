Parents Complain About Me Asking For Stuff, but Refuse to Let Me Get a Job. Iâ€™ve would of been working months ago, if my dad let me. Heâ€™s not letting me as he hasnâ€™t had a job for months. He thought it was unfair that a lot of people â€œgot time offâ€, but he didnâ€™t, even though he was making great money - 200K CAN a year before taxes. 

He hasnâ€™t had a interest in getting a job. Heâ€™s been very lazy. He hasnâ€™t done anything around the house. He hasnâ€™t had an interest in finding a job. He sleeps in, stays up very late, and watches movies all day.

We donâ€™t have a lot of money. We are blowing through savings. My parents are heavy smokers, they end up buying a few packs a week. A few weeks ago, they blew a few hundred dollars away on a lottery - even though we didnâ€™t win. They arenâ€™t making the best financial decisions. 

That wouldnâ€™t be a problem if they would let me get a job. They wonâ€™t let me. My dad doesnâ€™t want me getting a job cause it makes him look bad - cause he doesnâ€™t have one. I donâ€™t live close to anything so I canâ€™t walk. My mom canâ€™t drive me. My dad wonâ€™t drive me. 

I have my learners. If I could get my drivers, I could drive. I could use my Momâ€™s car. However, my dad wonâ€™t pay the $200 CAN ~ fee to take it. I used to get an allowance. I do everything in this house. As soon as I said I wanted to get a job, I havenâ€™t got any money - even though I have been working still. ðŸ˜ž 

My parents donâ€™t want me to be self-sufficient. They want me to rely on them. My older sister, due to a ### environment, left when she was sixteen. I want to do the same, but my parents are making it really difficult for me to do so. If I could, I would of moved out a year ago. 

It sucks as I canâ€™t get anything. I am more than willing to work for my money. I canâ€™t even get things like a haircut. It sucks.
