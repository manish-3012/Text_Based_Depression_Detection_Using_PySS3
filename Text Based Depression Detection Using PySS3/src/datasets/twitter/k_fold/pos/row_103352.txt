My teenage son for YEARS has refused to be photographed due to anxiety issues Out of nowhere a few weeks ago he asked if he could be in an episode of the kids show that I make! I was so proud and I think he did a good job. What do you guys think? (side note, yes the 3yr old is mine too ðŸ™‚) https://youtu.be/WDJyd0UhZeE
