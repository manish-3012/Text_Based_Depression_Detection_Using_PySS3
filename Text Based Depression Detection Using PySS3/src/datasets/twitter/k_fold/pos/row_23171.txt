Any of yâ€™all interested in studying together during the year/helping each other out (High School Students) Iâ€™m taking AP Physics, AP Lang, and AP Econ next year and it seems like itâ€™s gonna be hard especially being virtual which is kinda a fat L. If any of yâ€™all wanna form a study group or smth for the year (and feel comfy zooming in a few days to meet each other) lmk. I was thinking we could have a gc and like a shared google drive and just help each other when we need it. Idk it seems like it could be a p chill time. Lmk if ur interested.
