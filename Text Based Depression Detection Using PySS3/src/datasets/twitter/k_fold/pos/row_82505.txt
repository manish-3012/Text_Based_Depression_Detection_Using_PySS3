Boomers' accidental toxicity I hate how my mom and one teacher say something like "Don't think negatively, do not gravitate negative stuff". Bitch I want to avoid problems, that's why I mention it. I hate how they basically "close" me be cause I stop sharing my worries. Do you have experience with that?
