I am sick of my parents reminding me everytime that "I am not perfect".  I am a 19 year old guy living with my parents. Because of covid we decided to split the chores among us.

One of the chores that I have to do is to fill bottles. But I forgot to do it today cause I woke up late. My parents were out to buy groceries so after they came home they were like "well you've not filled bottles till now, you don't do shit all day and the one job that we gave, you messed that up too". And my parents kept taunting to me like 10 min straight. I admit that it was my mistake but I just forget it sometimes.

And the same is at our dinner table too. I am expected to serve and keep the dishes ready. But sometimes when I am late the taunting starts again and they are like "well we didn't expect that from you anyways" and I become the topic of the whole dinner.

It's not like I hate my parents and I am appreciative of the advice they give but it's just I am sick of constant taunting and they keep me reminding to not speak back as they pay my college fees and stuff.
