I'm not depressed because of videogames Mom and Dad I'm depressed because you take away all my electronics and then act like the victims when I actively express myself and give you solutions other than isolating me from my friends and family.

Jk I'm not an adult so my opinion is irrelevant and I'm supposed to respect you in order to earn social interactions with people who actually listen to me and what I have to say

I totally agree with literally cutting me off from the internet to do 30 minutes of chores and then sit around doing nothing.

What's that? All I do is sit on my ass all day? Wonder who's genius idea that was. 

If you have a problem with me why did you have me in the first place? You can't blame me for being the way I am if all you do is use me to do things you can easily do on your own. Is it really that hard to wash your ONE plate after eating a sandwich? Are you and Dad REQUIRED BY LAW to leave the entire sink full of dishes in the 8 hours of sleep that I get? 

But yeah sure; scold me and ban me. That'll definitely  "improve my attitude". Sound logic. 

I literally get not even 2 full months of time off from school and I don't even get to spend 3 weeks actually relaxing and blowing off some steam. 

I have to express my feelings to strangers on the internet at 5am because you don't listen to or respect my feelings or opinions.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk kind stranger
