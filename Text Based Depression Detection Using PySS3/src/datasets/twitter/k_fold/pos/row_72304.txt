I need to make $6000 by the time I am 16. I am 13 and I turn 14 on January 15th. I need to make $6000 dollars for many reasons. 1 I have to buy my own car. I also came up with a plan for when I move out. Before you move out that is when you start to buy things you want so you can save more money on things you need when your older. Please help me.
