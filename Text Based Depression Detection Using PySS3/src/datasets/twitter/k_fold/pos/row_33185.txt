Day 24 of posting quotes from We Know The Devil until I get some fucking garlic bread. â™€: Why.

â™€: Why are you protecting me.

â™€: Why won't you let me...

â™€: Why can't you just let it have me.

â™€: Why won't you go on without me.

â™€: Why won't you?

â™€: I don't want to be strong. I don't want to be that sort of person at all.

â™€: The lights in the edge of my eyes.

â™€: I want to see them so much.

â™€: They're so horrible, I can't look away.

â™€: I want them within me and without me. All through and about me. I want feathers in my lungs and eyes on my skin. I want my heart to see and my lungs to fly.

â™€: I want to undo the division of day and night.

â™€: I want to cast light over the city and shine shadows where the streetlights used to be.

â™€: You're going to say I shouldn't give up, and there's hope, and we can all get through this...

â™ƒ: Please...don't.

â™€: And that's not a lie but...

â™†: Venus, no, get a grip. Stop.

â™†: I promise, I won't--

â™€: It's nobody's fault but mine.
