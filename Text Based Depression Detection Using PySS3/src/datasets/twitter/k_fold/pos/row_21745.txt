I think I accidentally asked my friend out on a date This happened a couple of minutes ago. So basically we were talking about heights and I'm deathly afraid of heights

"you're afraid of heights? Let's go on ROLLERCOASTER RIDE!"

"WTF NO. But if it's a date to the bookstore I'd be down"

"HAHAHAHHA WELL THEN LET'S GO"


I don't know what to do at this point. I just saw the notification and haven't put it on "read" yet. Idk what to do she's cute and we have so much in common too but I'm not that keen on getting into relationships. I don't know how to answer her. I don't have anyone to talk to about this either.
