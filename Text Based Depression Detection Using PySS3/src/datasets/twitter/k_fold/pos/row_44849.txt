Fuck it. Society has no rules anymore. I won't be paying taxes or supporting any of the supposed people in charge. The government is just an illusion. Race, gender, sexuality, age, its all an illusion to get people to turn themselves against each other and distance themselves. Society is falling apart at the seams.
