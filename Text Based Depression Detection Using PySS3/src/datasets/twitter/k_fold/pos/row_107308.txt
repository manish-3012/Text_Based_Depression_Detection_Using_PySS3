I am so done with this shit I canâ€™t handle any of this shit anymore. I literally cannot look into a mirror without wanting to harm myself. Nothing in life brings me joy anymore. My self esteem is at an all time low. Iâ€™m running out of motivation to actually do stuff. The self harm urges are so strong. I havenâ€™t felt happy since 2017. I donâ€™t understand why people feel like putting up with me. And I canâ€™t exactly talk to my parents about this because last time I tried, they laughed at me and told me to stop wasting their time. They get upset at me whenever I raise my voice slightly, but yet when they yell at me or my siblings to the point of the victim being reduced to a sobbing mess, itâ€™s â€œcompletely okay because theyâ€™re our parentsâ€. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can deal with this.
