Please help! What should I do with my friend who is becomes so depends to me? I have a cousin who is 3 years older than me. I'm 16 and I study in high school so, he is a college student. We used to be very good friends when I was 6, but the relation between his father( my uncle ) and our family ruined by my uncle. We don't saw each other for 8 years, after all these years his father reconciled and then we were allowed to see each other. That day we saw each other was unforgetable. But the more we saw and the more we talked to each other in phone or person, the more I realized that he isn't that person I knew.
He changed a lot. The more we talked the more I noticed that he has major depression, like he don't talk to anyone, in best situation two words. That's because of his damn parents, BUT he talks to me a lot and I was happy that it really helps him. But these days it's so annoying, he calls me every day and talks like 1 hour, what should I do I really want to help him but it is so hard and annoying that I should talk to him every day, and he even don't talk about things I'm into so it is boring to me. PLEASE tell me what should I do, I don't like to hurt him because I'm the only one who he has, but it's hard to listen to him. PLEASE tell me what should I do ?
And also thank you
