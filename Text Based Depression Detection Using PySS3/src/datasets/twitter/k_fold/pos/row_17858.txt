I have an impossible challenge for you. winner gets reddit gold I need you to go to any pewdiepie video. ANY ONE. and try to find one where the top 25 comments do not have any colons in them. this includes this colon ":" and also any human colons.

the first person to find it and post it here with a link gets a reddit gold on their comment.
