One year anniversary! I love my boyfriend so much!!! He calls me sweet names like "Get out of my house", "Stalker" and "How did you find me??"

He's so playful, he runs away from me every time I see him, and he hides from me too :) He even filed a restraining order against me as a prank (obviously!) Such a funny guy!!

The restraining order expires today, on our 1 year anniversary! I'll visit his window at night like I always do, and he'll probably scream in happiness!

So happy for us :))
