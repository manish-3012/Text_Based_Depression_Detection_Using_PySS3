Why are the days going so fast all of a sudden I got home from school at 3PM. I ate and then i watched YouTube and scrolled reddit for what felt like maybe 50 minutes but it somehow ended up being a little over 2 hours. Then i played a game for what felt like 40 minutes, but that ended up being like 2 hours too. Then i watched a few episodes if anime for 40 more mins and whoop de doo its 8 Pm and i still have homework and a test to study for.

It feels like i barely get to do anything in a day because time just goes by so fast.
