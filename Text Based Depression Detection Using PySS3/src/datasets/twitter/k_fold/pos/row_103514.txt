The universe kinda hates me Lemme explain, a month and a half ago, i asked my crush if she wanted to play among us with me (im way too anxious abt doing anything IRL). She said she was busy, i asked her if she wanted to watch a movie with me (around new year), she said she was busy. Around xmas (7th of Jan) i asked her again if she wanted to play among us, she said she was busy. Yesterday, i asked her if she is able to play minecraft, she said her dad doesnt allow it. Tmrw, im asking her if she wants to play Among Us. If she declines, im going to ask her to do sth IRL with me. If she declines, i confess to her on my bday (saturday). On top of all that, my grades have dropped and my mom is pressuring me to study a lot more.
