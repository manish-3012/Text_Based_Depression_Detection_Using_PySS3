Am I the problem or is it just my classmates/friends I hate to post this here, but the more potential opinions the closer  I get to my best solution.

So basically, I dont like my friends anymore, most of them anyway. Im one year older than most of them, but we seem like 5 apart. They constantly make jokes that boild down to â€œsex=funnyâ€(im 14, so most of them are 13) and they constantly slap 2 girls asses. Ive taked to both if them if they like, neither do, but one doesnâ€™t want to be a snitch and the other did report it to a teacher but nothing changed. There are other reasons, but I just dont want to be friends with most of them anymore, but I cant say it due to overlapping friend circles + being friend for 3+ years. It is said that id you find yourself at odds with a lot of people, itâ€™s probably you and not them.

So did I change too much? Am I being just a prude? Do i change myself or do i try to break them off, Wtf do i do?
