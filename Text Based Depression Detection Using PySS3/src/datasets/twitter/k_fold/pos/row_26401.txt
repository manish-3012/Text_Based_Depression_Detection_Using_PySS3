I'm 3 months harm free :) I was sharing stories on Instagram just for them to catch up with stuff what's going on with me lately. I realised it has been 3 months since the last time I slashed my forearm. Things are going well since I've been seeing a therapist. I haven't felt pure darkness or similar like that, and I've been on a joy streak lately. It makes me proud of myself.
