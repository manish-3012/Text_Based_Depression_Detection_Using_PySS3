Idk how to feel at this point- So there is this guy and Ive liked him sense like June of 2019, We talk all the time and I dont remember how but he knows i like him. And He even told me he doesnt know how to feel but he thinks in the end we end up together. 

Over time We have these moments where we dont talk, Not because we are mad just because we are lazy and just arent interacting and I think â€œWow how did i have a crush on him?â€ And then he will text me and he rushes back into my mind. 

My future I always thought Id have a gf, a part of my brain keeps screaming â€œEW BOYS ARE ICKY!â€ but another part of my Brain keeps dragging me back to him.  
Sometime I think about my first Kiss, Or first Time, or Simply just my future and I cant imagine anything but him. Like Idk what anything is and Im not saying thats howll weâ€™ll end up, but thats what I keep thinking and Even though i dont want to i keep doing it. 

I cant imagine me being comfortable with him, Or simply being myself. Not in a way where he has done something but Just Ya know, Idk if I could manage that. And I try to think of what would be good for me but I cant stop with just him. I dont like Dating. Ive never done it. But I still think im too young, Even though to other people I dont think it really matters. 
K sorry for this. I just needed to say something somewhere
