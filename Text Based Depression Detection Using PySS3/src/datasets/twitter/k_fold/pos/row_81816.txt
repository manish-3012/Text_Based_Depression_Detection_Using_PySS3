I can't get past the fact that my life feels like it hasn't even really started I'm trans and closeted so like I can't be happy. I can't have friends because I don't want to say I'm male. I hate doing a lot of stuff. And like I'm an adult and it's crazy, I should be way more advanced and even 13 year olds these days are living their life more than me. 

Like people say only you can change your life, but there's not a lot I can do yet ðŸ˜”
