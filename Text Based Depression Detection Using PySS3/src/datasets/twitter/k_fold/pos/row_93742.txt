My friend's Microsoft account got locked and he didn't do anything to get it locked So my friend got mcpe installed to his phone and logged into his account to play on a server.

The very next day his account gets locked. And he didn't even do anything at all. He went to enter his phone number to get it unlocked and never got the code. 

So we go back to the send code page and he entered the phone number correctly like he did before but then it said it was an invalid number. 

This is one of the reasons why I hate Microsoft
