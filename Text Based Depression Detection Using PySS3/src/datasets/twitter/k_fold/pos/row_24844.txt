Prediction for Godzilla vs Kong So in one of the trailer scenes we see something that looks like a Godzilla with red on it, and it could just be fire Godzilla again, BUT i think something else, i think its Mecha Godzilla, cuz the way M. Godzilla was first shown, was a SECOND Godzilla came from space ATTACKED EVERYTHING, *they say â€œGodzillaâ€ is attacking places*, and Yes it does say the monsters head towards skull island, BUT, that could be to warn Kong, because Kong doesnâ€™t listen to Godzilla anyway, and i think the scene where kong hits Godzilla with the axe will probably just maybe, make a shockwave kind of like when Thor hits captain americas shield with mjollnir, and it will split the â€œskinâ€ on M. Godzilla, and king will realize, and go find the real Godzilla, and they are gonna fight M. Godzilla together, and the end of the movie, instead of the newspapers, after the credits we just hear like, Mecha King Ghidoras roar, or like police radio talking about something new appearing.
