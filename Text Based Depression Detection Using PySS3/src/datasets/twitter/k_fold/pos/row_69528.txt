I could easily beat a goose in a fight Ok, so recently I saw the vine with the girl saying, â€œLook at all those chickens!â€ That led me to some videos of people encountering geese and running away when the demonstrated aggression. Some of the scared people were kids, which I get, but an adult!! Running away from a goose. 

Iâ€™m not the most physically strong or trained in any martial art, but I could easily beat the shit out of a goose if it came at me. It has nothing to attack me with, besides a bite with its bill, and they donâ€™t even have sharp teeth that could puncture my skin. Geese arenâ€™t that smart either, often times they just rush their target head on, without considering their inferior fighting capabilities. Most humans have long enough arms to reach out and stop a goose before they even get into biting range. Geese also have a major disadvantage because of their long necks, which are easy to grab with your hands. The final nail in the coffin in my opinion is that many of the geese I saw didnâ€™t even use their greatest advantage over us, flight. 

TLDR: Geese are dumb, and I could probably beat one in a one v one fight so you could too. Have no fear of these silly waterfowl, for you are the superior predator.
