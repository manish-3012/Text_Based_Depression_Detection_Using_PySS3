Waterproof band-aids arenâ€™t waterproof So, I donâ€™t know if anyone else has this problem but for me, waterproof band-aids always last like ten minutes before they come off. Like, Iâ€™ll put one on before a shower, and itâ€™s off in seconds. However, with a regular band-aid, I could go for days and the worst that would happen would be that that itâ€™d start to unravel. Like, even in showers, regular band-aids excel at waterproofing more than waterproof band-aids.

Sorry, just a rand about band-aids for anyone who stuck to the end of that.
