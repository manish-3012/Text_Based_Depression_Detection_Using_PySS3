kinda cringe post I like making posts on here and I think I get good advice but I think the fact that there arenâ€™t many other females on here, thereâ€™s certain things I canâ€™t say. A lot of people experience the same things regardless of gender but it makes me uncomfortable saying certain things just because the chances of another girl reading my post is highly unlikely. Iâ€™d like to think of this as a place that I can express all my thoughts but I canâ€™t just because there are obvious things that a lot of girls go through that guys donâ€™t and vice versa
