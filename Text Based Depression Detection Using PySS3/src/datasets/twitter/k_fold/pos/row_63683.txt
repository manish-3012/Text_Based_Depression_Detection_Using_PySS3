Theres no way I'm racist. So I was discussing with a friend about our preferences in a girl, and I said that I'm not attracted to 75% of black women because of their large noses and their coarse hair, and my friend agreed. Then people in my discord server are calling me racist. I tried to explain that because of their facial features I didnt find them attractive, but they wouldnt budge (the three who complained are all not black). 1, 2, 3, and 4 including myself were all saying that it isnt because they have an african ethnic background, and I thought they were crazy because these of these two messages:

 "(Me):So because I am not sexually attracted to most african americans, that makes me racist?"

(Them):"Yes".  

And this stook out to me: "you said you donâ€™t find, curly(they said curly instead of coarse) hair, wide noses. Look at any art from Africa, and youâ€™ll see the same thing, most african, dark skin, I mean, have those features, most of them, I never said they were a clone. Just like you could say most Americans have narrow noses, and wider eyes. You said you found that unattractive. Iâ€™m not generalizing, itâ€™s a fact. Women that are darkskinned, go through this everyday, itâ€™s colorist at the very least. And when you pulled up black women you found attractive, they were light skinned(wrong, got one lightskinned another darkskinned) get help soon"

Now obviously, I dont want to be a racist, I take deep deep offense to that. And I thought that E V E R Y B O D Y  had a sexual preference. Theres no way, right?
