The comment:

As a student, this is my worst nightmare. I cannot imagine my zoom call being broadcasted for the entire world. I don't even enjoy turning my camera on at all. Furthermore, I doubt that these kids really had a choice in whether or not this was aired, unfortunately, likely their parents made the decision. Please, don't do this again.
