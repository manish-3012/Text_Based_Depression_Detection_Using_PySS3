The meaning of "simp" is being misinterpreted and it's really getting out of hand for me. So, let me give a bit of context. My family consists of me, my mom, my dad and my grandma. My dad, who's 53 and a doctor himself, was tested positive for covid-19 a few weeks ago. 3 days ago, he was transferred to a hospital for intensive care. This was already a fucked up situation. And yesterday it fucked up ever worse.


I started the day as a regular one and attended all my classes. After that, my mom comes up to me and says she has a severe headache and can't even walk properly. So I told her to rest and that I would do the chores until she feels better. Hours passed and I did everything smoothly. This left me tired as I haven't done this much work ever before. At around 8 or 9 in the night, my *"friend"* texts me and asks what's up. I said I was working and explained how my mom wasn't feelin good and I was doin chores. He literally messaged me "What a simp you are dude". 


This made me angry beyond words. I felt such a degree of hate that it's hard to say it in words. I got so angry that I came down with a 100Â° fever today morning and I'm still in bed, typing this. I blocked that fucker as well. 


I'm just posting this on Reddit to vent a little because the anger is just making the situation worse. Sorry for rambling on like this, but I really needed an escape from all this anger and hate.
