I just got my crush's Snapchat. I've liked her since 6th grade and I finally asked her for it after three years! I was sitting in Health and having an off and on conversation with a girl I've liked since 6th grade. I eventually worked up the courage to ask her if she had Snapchat. She said yes, and I sat there for a second awkwardly until she tore out a piece of paper and wrote it down. She had been acting a little weird. She was really quirky in class, but I never see her acting that way in other classes that I have with her. She was really prone to laugh and I caught her looking at me two or three times.
