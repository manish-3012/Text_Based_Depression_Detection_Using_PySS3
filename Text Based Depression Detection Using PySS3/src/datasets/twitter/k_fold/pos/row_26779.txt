How much money do you have and where do you get it from? I have about $1300 thats all mine to spend on whatever (not like my parents savings for me/roth ira etc) and all of its from my grandparents and parents from birthdays, holidays, etc. I would work but tbh (aware of how terrible this sounds) I don't need to because I already get tons from my grandparents and I'd rather just do fun stuff with friends
