Help! My Laziness. Hello all, I am quite lazy and slow, I get a lot of homework and I have to also study as I have test every now and then. Everything's fine and I also make a plan for a day and divide my day. But due to something (I don't know what) I am unable to follow that plan and end up ruining everything. ;( can anyone help me so I can... You know change my habits.
