For all of yall with a crush Honestly whether your a boy or a girl it doesn't matter just go ask out the person you like hell maybe love. Even  though I'm only 15 I had my first crush (weird ain't it?) had some of my best memories with that girl and yet I still didn't have the guts to tell her, a year passes by and I learn that she's moving to America it's like some teenage love story but no I didn't run up to her in the airport and tell her I love her no I did the exact opposite and had pushed myself away from her to not feel sad honestly one of my biggest mistakes. So the moral of the story is you can't hit the shot if you don't shoot or something like that. But hey what should a butt hurt 15 year old tell you.
