I was thinking back on this one time and it made me laugh So when I was in 7th grade PE class I found a wood staple on the ground. I tell my friend and naturally my first instinct was to stick it in an electrical outlet and he doesnâ€™t stop me. I got shocked then tried to get it out with my show and as you can expect it completed the circuit and freaked everyone out. And thatâ€™s why they put covers on my schoolâ€™s electrical outlets.
