Frick pineapples Like actually I hate pineapple now. I had a dream a few months ago where I distinctly recall eating a chunk of pineapple on a beach and then feeling my throat slowly close up and suffocate me and when I blacked out in my dream I woke up and I still couldnâ€™t breathe for a few seconds. I canâ€™t fucking eat pineapple now because it makes me remember that feeling of helplessness that comes with suffocating.
