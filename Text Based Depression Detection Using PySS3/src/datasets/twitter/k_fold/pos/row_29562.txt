Recently saw an old crush of mine i still have feelings for and im feeling sad right nie It happened yesterday and i was sitting on a bench waiting for the subway and after a few minutes a girl walked next to me and sat down and i was having that feeling that she was familiar and after the subway came wen went in and thats when she approached me and asked me if i remember her and i replied with yes we have known each other in middleschool and we talked about how life is going on right now for us it didnt go on for long because i was meeting a friend and hat to get kut after a few stations and i regretted it because i could talk with her all day she was a wonderful person i immediatly felt sad after i saw the subway leave and i thought about how i would never see her again i was too big of a coward to confess my feelings to her in middleschool and im regretting it to this day i just dont know how to feel exactly she was a wonderful and very intelligent person and had a great character and thats what made it hurt more
