I really think summer assignments should be renamed to â€œstay up all night long writing and reading for 12 hours straight the night before itâ€™s doneâ€ assignments Who the actual heck does their summer assignments on time? Mine is due in 2 hours and I just finished. It was assigned in May. My arm has never had a workout like this before. I had to read and annotate 2 book and write an essay using those books and external sources.
