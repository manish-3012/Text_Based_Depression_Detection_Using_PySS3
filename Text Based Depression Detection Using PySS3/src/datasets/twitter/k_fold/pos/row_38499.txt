I just want a job Iâ€™ve been asking my parents to help find a job, and every time I ask they say itâ€™s not that easy and when I ask why, they just say the same thing. The only person that has helped me is a family friend that lives in the outback, so she canâ€™t help easily, I only want a retail job it canâ€™t be that difficult.
