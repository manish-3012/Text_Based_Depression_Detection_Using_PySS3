So what if I met a guy. Who actually cared for me and didnâ€™t treat me like shit and gave me the affection and attention I needed and helped pull me out of this hell im in rn. That would be wonderful but knowing me Iâ€™m never going to have that, y a y. Also I know I post a lot thatâ€™s because itâ€™s midnight and I canâ€™t function but feel horrible ðŸ˜¼ðŸ¤Ÿ
