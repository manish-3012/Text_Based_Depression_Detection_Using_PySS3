This shouldn't even be possible I will not use the real names of the people involved in this story.

So, well my weird orange friend had a friend we call ghost guy and I always said: "Ghost guy is the least ugly nerd!" Where he responded to with: "Fuck, him, then..." 


That summer I layed down with a guy who looked like ghost guy... It made me feel a little bit uncomfortable but I gave it a chance, but after giving a good look I discovered that he even had the same belly button as Ghost Guy and I started yelling and felt sick for the rest of the night!

I told ghost guy and he started feeling ill too!
