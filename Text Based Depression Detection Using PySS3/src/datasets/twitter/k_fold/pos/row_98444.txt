In the end, girls are the ones who are weird So, I am 16 years old and it's been a month since I started going to that school and I am in a classroom full of girls. Girls are rly not what they seem to be. In the school I am going theres like 2 rly hot male teachers that all of the girls thirst over so all the girls in my classroom go crazy everytime they pass by or get in the classroom. One time a girl asked her friend if she had taken a pic of a teachers ass or forearms and shit like that. I went like wtff girls do that??? I was rly surprised. I also realized how much more gross they are than us. I have been asked if I have painkillers atleast 15 times already which is normal I guess due to period and shit. They talk about dildos and other sexual shit too often and say "I would let this guy rape me" or "yes daddy" kinda shit. I have also realized that girls tend to cry when they reach their limits. Not because they are sad or depressed. Just because it's natural or sth. It's been quite a fun month. Learned alot but damn are girls weird and crazy.
