Now that kissanime has been taken down, where does my poor ass watch anime? It was my only way to watch like... 99% of my anime and now that its been taken down I have nothing else than fucking netflix... Now don't get me wrong netflix has some good anime but they're very limited and I've watched all the anime on netflix that I want to watch. Sooo like any suggestions on how a poor bastard can get anime?
Rip kiss, you will be very missed
