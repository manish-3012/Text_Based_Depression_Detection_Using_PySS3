anyone else wish u could live in the shadows? i know it would be wrong but...


my ideal life would involve me faking my own death and living a completely new life compared to the one i do now. it would just be so nice to start over. another fantasy i often have involves me just living in the shadows, doing my own thing, and completely ignoring responsibilities. 


iâ€™m just wondering if anyone else thinks about these things
