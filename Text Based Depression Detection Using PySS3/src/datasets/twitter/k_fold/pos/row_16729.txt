My cousins accidentally choked me I (15F) leaped off the side of the bed because I was too lazy to walk, and my charger was across the bed on the ground so I just body dived and fell and got stuck, and while she was trying to pull me up, a wire got stuck around my neck so i was going "khakak" 

and she saw me and laughed and let go of me and I fell. And when I got up I said "I want my husband to do that. Not you." and she laughed really hard and choked on her drink. 

TL;DR my cousin was trying to help me but choked me instead.
