Major decisions Ive seen posts of people coming out. When I was in middle school I saw the majority of people deciding to be gay bi or anything of that sorts. I think it's a little to young to be making major decisions like deciding your sexuality of all sorts. I think older ages like 17+ is better. I e seen people trying to be gay or lesbian to get attention to get attention and be different. So I think just wait until you get your self in that stuff
