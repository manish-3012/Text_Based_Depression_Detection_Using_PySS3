Guys how do I gather up the courage to talk to the guy that I like Please help me. There's a boy in my class who I really like, but I'm too nervous to talk to him. He's very shy and only has a couple of friends, but he's insanely clever and very cute. He doesn't talk a lot and I'm worried if I start a conversation with him he'll be unresponsive or think I'm dumb or something, but I do really want to get to know him. I know he's very good at math and science and loves history, if that helps. There are opportunities for me to go up to him such as at break, but so far I haven't been able to think of what to say.

Any ideas on how to proceed?
