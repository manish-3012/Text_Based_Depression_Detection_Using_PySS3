Growth Pains :( Anyone of talk have gone through growth pains? I have been going thru one for abt 9 months, and its still not subsiding... I've been doing a lot of stretching and nothing is helping :( 
I really need tips, my parents say its unnecessary to go and see the doctor, but I think it is time to go and see what's wrong with me...
