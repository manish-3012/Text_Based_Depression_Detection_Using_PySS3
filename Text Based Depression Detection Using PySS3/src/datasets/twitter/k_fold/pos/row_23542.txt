I Feel Alone 
I need to rant/vent. I have not done that in a while. I am sitting here, in my bed, alone at three in the morning, wondering where I went wrong. 

Looking back, since grade eight, I have noticed a steady decline in the amount of friends I have/had. I used to consider myself friends with a lot of people. We all used to get along. Things change. People change. We all move on. It is part of growing up.

Right now, I feel like I have no friends. I have not been at school in months, as I have been doing school online. I have stayed in contact with a close group of friends. We played a lot on PS4. We do not even do that anymore. 

One by one, everyone went their own ways. I was very close with four people. We all got along, we all used played together. I do not even have that anymore. I found out two weeks ago that one of my friends used me for my skill in a video game, being Rainbow Six Siege. I decided to quit the game. Since then, not once has he reached out to me. We used to talk everyday. That was the only game we played. I have messaged him. Nothing. It sucks. I knew him the best, as we got along well. 

I keep this short. I did that on purpose. I could make this a thirty page essay. It sucks. It really does. Even back then, I did not do much with any of these people. I always asked them if they wanted to do anything. Most of the time, nobody wanted to. 

Right now, I would consider myself friends with one person. With that being said, we do not do a lot. We rarely talk. 

Is this my fault? Where did I go wrong? I have not made new friends as I have not been attending school in-person. I am so alone. 

I might be in a mood, as it is late. I should feel better/normal tomorrow.
