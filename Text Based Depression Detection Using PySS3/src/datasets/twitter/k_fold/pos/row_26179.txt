I should be so happy I should be so happy,
I taught myself 6 months worth of school math stuff in 2 weeks, 1000 Spanish words in 4 days, and a hell of a lot of physics, because I had exams coming up and the teachers only focused on kids in the 4th year of MULO (its a level of school ig) and I was in 3rd year and if I failed my exams it wouldn't be that bad because I wouldn't be held back a year but the 4th years would(our education system is very complicated ik), so that's why they didn't help me. The exam is for skipping 4th year MULO btw. Anyway I got my results today and I got a 9/10 for Spanish, English, maths and physics and most 4th years don't even score that high. Like it's super hard to get like an 8 and I got 9s and that's fucking awesome. I also got a 6/10 for Dutch, but I'm pretending that didn't happen because everyone I know said Dutch exam was way harder compared to other exams from previous years.


My point is I fucking passed and I passed fucking awesomely and I get to go to VWO (another level of school in my country) next year and that's fucking cool I get to wear the best uniform of them all. So I should be fucking happy and yet I'm very sad
