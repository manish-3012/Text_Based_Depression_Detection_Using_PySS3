It's okay for boys to cry. I really don't understand why we all get told to hide our emotions when we were little. We have emotions and have to release them somehow! When my dad died I tried to hold it in but it hurt way too fucking much. Crying felt good. I was getting emotion out and letting some pain out with it. It's not emasculating, it's not girly, and its definitely not healthy.
