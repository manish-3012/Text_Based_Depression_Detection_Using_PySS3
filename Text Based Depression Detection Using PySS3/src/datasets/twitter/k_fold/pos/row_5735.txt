A poem, kinda cringe I sit in the darkness of my room and I cry
My thoughts limited to â€œboy Iâ€™d like to dieâ€
â€¢
My mental health is rapidly decaying
Much like a rope, it is fraying
â€¢
These invisible scars marked by tears
I donâ€™t want to show them to my peers
â€¢
My mind is a labyrinth made out of pain
I will search it until the day I am slain
