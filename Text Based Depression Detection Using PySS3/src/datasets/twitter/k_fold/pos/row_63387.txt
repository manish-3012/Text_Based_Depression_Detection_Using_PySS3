Anyone elseâ€™s parents dieting really weirdly during quarantine? My parents have been fasting and keep talking about how bad their bodies are and if I tell them they look completely fine (which they do) they tell me â€œok but actually I am fatâ€.   My mom had an eating disorder as a teen and she keeps telling me that â€œDrs. Actually say this is healthy than eating because then your blood sugar doesnâ€™t spikeâ€.  But she wonâ€™t tell me which Drs. are saying that.  They also get really mad if I mention eating, being hungry, or eat too loudly, because it makes them even hungrier.  They always put off dinner to like 8:30 and say they wish they remembered earlier â€œso they couldâ€™ve made something elseâ€ but now get mad when I remind them or mention what Iâ€™d want or could make.  Itâ€™s upsetting.
