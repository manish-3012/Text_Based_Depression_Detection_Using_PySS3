Seriously stop scrolling I beg you So basically I could get all my assignments done in 9 hours or I can go to a whole new school and to therapy 

Basically to help me decide what to do hereâ€™s some info 

I could get a fresh start a little even though Iâ€™m in a small town and itâ€™s just the next middle school and over and it would only be for the rest of the year but itâ€™s face to face instead of virtual 

At my current school I have 1 real friend 

Also we are going to high school next year FYI 

So what should I do
