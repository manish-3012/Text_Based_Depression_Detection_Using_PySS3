So I tell you where Iâ€™m at Ya kno, post nut depression, thinking about some pretty dark shit, 

But I just donâ€™t want to be horny, itâ€™s a horrible feeling, I just want to have someone who would be here for me, just a hug or just being a person to listen to, but nobody will ever love me, I see other couples my age, and just ya kno it hurts, I say it doesnâ€™t but a girl broke up with cause someone paid her 5$, ya kno, it hurts knowing Iâ€™m only worth 5$
