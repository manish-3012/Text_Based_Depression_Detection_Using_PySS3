Is it just me but sometimes I just look at the ceiling I look at my ceiling at night alot idk why I do it but every time I do I just listen to music and sometimes I cry I feel like it's the only time I have to relax between school and work I really get no time for my self I have medicine to help me sleep but I don't like taking it I feel that it's taking time form me that I could use to make music for just to do something I just realized that I when completely off topic but I guess it just how I feel
