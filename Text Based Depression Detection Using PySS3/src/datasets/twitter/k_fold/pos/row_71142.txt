The first version of the Reddit Family Tree! Sorry it's late but the first version of the Reddit Family Tree from last night is here!

(Imgur link cause its the weekend and i cant post images: [https://imgur.com/a/fLGLSM9](https://imgur.com/a/fLGLSM9))

Blue = Boy

Pink = Girl

White = Unknown or anything other than boy or girl cause those are the only three colors

If there is a question mark, that means no one has filled that role and we need new family members, be sure to apply in the following format in the comments:

Can I be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_'s brother/sister/mother/father?

I will then reply with a yes or no depending if that role has been taken or not, if it's taken you can apply to another spot.

(P.S. should I also make a Reddit Family Discord Server?)
