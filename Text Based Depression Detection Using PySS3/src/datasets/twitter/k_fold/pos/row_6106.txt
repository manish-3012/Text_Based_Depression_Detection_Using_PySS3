My sister used her period as an excuse for cutting me. My sister cut my arm with her nails and it started bleeding. She did this because I was watching TV and she just came up and said "GIVE ME THE REMOTE", I said that when I'm done watching she can have it and she went insane and grabbed me so hard that she gave me a cut on my arm. When my mom came home I told her about this and my mom talked to her and I overheard my sister say that "that's how she gets when she's on her period". That's the worst thing I've heard in my life, using your period as an excuse for abuse. She went unpunished and my mom let her off free. I'm am deeply disappointed in my mom for her double standard and I'm very pissed off.
