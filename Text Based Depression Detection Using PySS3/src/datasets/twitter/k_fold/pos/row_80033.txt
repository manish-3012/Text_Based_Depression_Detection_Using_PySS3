I think i'm going to spend at least 10 years Single. At this point i think it's already a fact.   


There is a Very High Chance that will happen here's why:  


\- I'm Ugly.  
\- I have very little Achievements and I have no Talents that i'm known for.  
\- I'm not a smart guy.  
\- I have weird music taste  
\- I Don't watch Anime (It's not my thing. I have yet to see a girl who doesn't watch or read these kind of stuff.)  
\- The only common game that i have with other people is Minecraft. And i'm not really good at it.  
\- I'm planning to go to a College where having a GF is Near Impossible.  
\- My Skills and Hobbies are i dunno. It's very hard to find someone my age who has a common hobby / interest with me.  
\-  I'm too poor for it. I don't even have a proper house lol.
