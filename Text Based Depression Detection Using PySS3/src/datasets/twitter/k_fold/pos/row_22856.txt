I think this is the perfect sub-reddit for this First of all, sorry if make any mistakes in this paragraph
I just want to tell y'all that please don't spread hate against any country. I am from India and recently found out what others think about us. I was scrolling through my reddit feed when i found a post on r/china about India. The people in the comments were full of hatred to us. They made fun of us calling us "street shitter" without even searching about it that 96% of Indian household use toilet. They said we live in slum without even thinking that Villages and Slums are different. People can live in villages with prosperity. How we struggled to overcome our problems isn't visible to them. The media everywhere talks about rapes in India but they never talk about rape statistics. Ik Indian media isn't good either. Please don't believe all the media about India, see for yourself. Please don't spread hate for other countries as well. I hope i was able to change your perspective.
I hope you come to India and see for yourself that the India you used to know have changed or not




PS: I posted this in here because i think teenagers unlike some adults really understand what other teenager feels like in this type of situation
