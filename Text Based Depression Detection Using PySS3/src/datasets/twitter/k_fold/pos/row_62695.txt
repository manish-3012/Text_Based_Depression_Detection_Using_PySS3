Ok I'm kinda getting scared now I went to Walmart to go buy a soccer ball which is in the sports section (duh) and right next to the sport section is the gun section (merica) and there was a line of around 9 persons to buy guns. That section is always lonely but this is the first time I actually see someone buy a gun form there 
 This was in Houston Texas by the way
