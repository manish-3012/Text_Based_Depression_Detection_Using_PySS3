When your mom gets mad at you My mom got mad at me cause I was telling her about a camera I wanted to buy, with my own money that if COVID wouldnâ€™t have happened wouldâ€™ve been spent on clothes... Iâ€™m taking photography seriously, have had pretty large growth in a year through Instagram using a business account in which I can see my weekly viewership/growth. I donâ€™t mean to sound not grateful, but when youâ€™re given a camera thatâ€™s 10 years old that has nearly no adjustable settings, and grainy pictures, youâ€™d want to upgrade to something (Iâ€™m personally wanting to purchase a used Canon T3i, which is about 225-300$). I donâ€™t see anything I did wrong, I have a pretty good chance with starting to make my own money at 14 taking pictures of cars... but my mom gets mad at when I suggested buying a camera with MY money that I earned. Rant over for now
