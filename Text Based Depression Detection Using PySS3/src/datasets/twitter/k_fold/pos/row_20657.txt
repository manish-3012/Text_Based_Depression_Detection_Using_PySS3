Why do creeps follow teenagers on reddit? Iâ€™m 13F, and some weird â€œgirlâ€ followed me. She was an adult, looked like her page was nsfw, her account was new, probably a bot. Anyways, I blocked her, but the whole experience made me feel really uncomfortable. How do I stop this from happening in the future?
