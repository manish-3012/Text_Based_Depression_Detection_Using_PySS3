I'm heading to bed early, and leaving you with this message. I have two US flag patches. One with a red stripe (for firefighters, some of my dad's friends are firefighters) and one with a blue stripe (for cops, I have friends parents who are cops).

I'm proud to have them out displayed, because I don't have a jacket I could put it on and have it look good. You can't stop me.
