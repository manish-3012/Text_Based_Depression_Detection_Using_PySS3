Bruh the people who make my schools schedules suck Legit last year this kid got 3 lunch periods and 2 of the same class in a row then one later in the day. This year is, well better, but still bad. Its been like over a month and they just changed my schedule because it was â€˜overcrowdedâ€™ even though I was **ONLINE**

I now have a shit geometry who makes us handwrite everything. Fr fuck this lol. I feel worse for people who had horrible schedules and they were just joining whichever zoom links they could to ask that teacher for info
