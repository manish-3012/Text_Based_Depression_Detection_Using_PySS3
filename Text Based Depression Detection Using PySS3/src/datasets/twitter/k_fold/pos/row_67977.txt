Space waffles :D During break [at school] I was chilling with this new girl I met in chemistry class then my friend pushed the girl out of her way and ask if I wanted to try this waffles, I said no because I don't like waffles but she was being pushy and begged me to try them. I knew there was something up and so I asked her if she had put something in them, she nodded her head like those big headed toys plus her pupils were huge asf.


And out of curiosity...I tried at least two of them and well, nothing happened. She said that it will take it's time and I've been waiting for it for about two periods [lessons]. Until Math [second last period], during the lesson everything was slow motion, the teacher wore this white shirt and the walls were also white so it looked like his head was floating which made me laugh maniacally. Even the numbers on the board kept on moving then at biology, I noticed my friend was starring at the wall and apparently she was standing there for ten minutes, I think she had more than two....


We basically just sat there starring at board while the sir was explaining, my friend kept on complaining that she was hungry while I was in my own zone trying to understand why the board created a void filled with creatures.


Sorry my English sucks, IK, I'm still learning â•®(ï¼¾â–½ï¼¾)â•­

This happened last year and I'm planning getting stoned after the exams. âœ¨ðŸŒˆðŸ‘ï¸ðŸ‘„ðŸ‘ï¸
