Why do cartoons do this [important] To all the guys/gals/non-binary pals out there, if a girl picks on you, there's a low chance they like you and a high chance their just being a dick.


I've seen this trope a few times in cartoons, and I don't know why they're glorifying this type of stuff. In the Loud House episode "Heavy Meddler" (I think that's what it's called), a girl named Ronnie Anne kept picking on Lincoln, and all Lincoln's sisters said RA likes him. L kept denying it, but his sisters were right. Kids might take this episode and think "Hey, if it worked out for him, maybe it'll work out for me!" This is one of my least favorite tropes in cartoons, because they can make kids think that if someone bullies you, they wanna be your soulmate, when there's a high ass chance it's the complete opposite and they are just bullying you.


So people, please know that this trope in cartoons is wrong. I don't know why this happens, but it does. While other tropes like the dumbass dad are annoying, this is plain DANGEROUS! Hopefully writers stop using this trope, because if I see it one more time, I'm gonna pull my hair out.
