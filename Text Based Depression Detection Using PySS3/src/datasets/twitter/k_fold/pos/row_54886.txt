Wanna discuss about relationships What is a lover/partner but a sexual partner? what is love other than a primal instinct to have sex and reproduce? 
Im simply 15 but iâ€™m annoyed at the fact that all this shit about having a girlfriend is simply a primal instinct and just like any other fades away as you get used to it. Other than having sex what other unique value would a lover have that none else i know would have. I dont think sex is anything special and is only a way to get ginormous amounts of dopamine and to reproduce.

P.S : I want you guys to find a way to prove me wrong. I dont like the way i view reality and it is too harsh but it seems the most logical.
