Posting something almost daily day 80. So a lot of girls that I meet are like "oh boys only want sex it all they think about." No it isn't.tgis is what I want from a girlfriend and a relationship. I want to go to a nice log cabin in the middle of winter in canada in the mountains and to have a girlfriend who wants to snuggle with me in a nice oversized hoodie and jogging pants on a couch by a log fire that I built. I want to be able to lie down in bed and have someone hug me while I fall asleep. I want hugs and kisses from someone who loves me like I love them. All we want as boys and men. All we want is love.
