If you are too skinny and don't like it this post is for you. I am a 17 year old boy. I am 1,80 meters, quite tall. I have always been skinny. Like really skinny. I weighed 48 kilos. I looked anorexic, but I wasn't. All my life I had been getting comments on how skinny I look. I desperately wanted to get fat, however I blamed it on my fast metabolism and never did anything. Last month I got rejected by a girl. He said I was funny, cute and all, but I was too skinny. I was really upset, and I decided to eat. For the past month I have been eating like an animal. When I can't eat anymore, I eat more. When I simply can't swallow, I use water. I constantly have a snack. And guess what, I gained weight. I now weigh 53 kilograms, and aiming for 60. If you are in the same situation which I was in, get up, go to the fridge and start stuffing your face. I promise you you will gain weight.
