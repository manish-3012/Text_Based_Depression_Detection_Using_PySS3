i feel so unlovable bro i can never contribute anything to anyone and iâ€™m such a boring fucking person to talk to

i hate telling someone i love them because it hurts me so fucking bad when the feelings arenâ€™t reciprocated 

i care so much for people but itâ€™s like i can never show it. then i get mad when they donâ€™t see how much i care for them but iâ€™ve literally done nothing for them
