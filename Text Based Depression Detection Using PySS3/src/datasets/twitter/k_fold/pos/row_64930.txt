So my school is conducting online exams through microsoft teams. I am fine with the exams part. But our teacher just informed us that if any student faces any sort of problems - network issues or anything - and they are unable to submit within the given time,  they will be given 0 marks. Now I hate my school even more.

Network issues happen frequently where I live. Hell even the teachers face these problems. The chem teacher has a shitty internet and his screen is always blur. Other teachers disconnect often during the Class.
