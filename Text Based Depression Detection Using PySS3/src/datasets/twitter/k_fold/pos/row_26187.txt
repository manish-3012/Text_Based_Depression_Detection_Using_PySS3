How do you speak to people??? So my friends found my crush and are now saying that I have 3 weeks to talk to him until they talk to him for me. I dont want that to happen but I have no clue how to talk to people, especially since heâ€™s not the most approachable guy?? I dunno that sounded mean. But I really dont know how to talk to him and I dont want my friends doing it for me as god knows what theyâ€™d say. 

My original plan was to dm him on insta about his clothing company and ask how he started it and when itâ€™ll start back up due to covid, but idk how to bring that to an actual conversation. Help...
