My parents don't allow me to watch ASMR. (THIS FAMILY RULE MIGHT CHANGE)

They said that if they found me watching it, they'd get angry.

While my dad doesn't understand why it's useful, my mom thinks it's addicting. My mom was referring to it's addictiveness the same way she refers to video games, which she says are like heroin.

The last thing I wanna do is stop watching ASMR. I might need to leave this community just in case my parents find out.
