I hate this reality. Everybody gives you a set of peramitors that you have to follow. I get the big ones like Don't rape, murder, steal, bla bla bla. But I don't get the smaller ones like don't cuss at your parents, don't talk to loudly in public, and many more. And when you break one of these peramitors, you're an outcast, a criminal, or a delinquent like me. I just want to go into a dark room and shut everyone and everything out, leave this reality behind and start a new one in my head that i control. One where i can make the rules and decide what goes and doesn't. One where humans, animal, and monsters alike can run around in a field of wheat or snow, and not have to worry about a man walking up to them and blowing their brains out. I'm tired of my family, even though they aren't toxic. I hate the rules they have for me, them talking to me, and them caring about me. Don't they realize that the second i turn 18, I'm not gonna give a shit about them? Why care about me if I'm not your kid? Why tell me all these fantasies that when we grow up, we can maintain our friendships and have a great life emotionally, and financially? Thats all fucking bullshit. The second you hit highschool, your friends don't serve a purpose. At least thats the way I see it. They are only people who slow you down. Your always told love is something you would do anything for. You'd kill for it, you'd give up your hopes and dreams for it. But why? Why get a girlfriend for 2 months who wants me to stay home when i would rather be a pilot for the USAF, and happily die for my country? Fuck this reality. If only I could replace it.
