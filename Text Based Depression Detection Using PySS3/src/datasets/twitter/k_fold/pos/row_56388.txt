Man Iâ€™m just dead inside I donâ€™t know itâ€™s just my world has crashed more so than usual these past few days and Iâ€™m just so done with this. School just fucking piles on and literally no one cares because itâ€™s the new normal. I just want to not feel so guilty about wasting time anymore

That is all. Have a good one yâ€™all
