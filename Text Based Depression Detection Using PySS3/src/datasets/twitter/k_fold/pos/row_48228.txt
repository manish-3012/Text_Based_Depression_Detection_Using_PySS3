I need some advice So there's this girl I really like since my last semester she's incredibly smart, funny, way too cute to be described and a bunch of other things.

Anyway so lately with all this among us boom we started playing together because we've been friends since before quarantine and my cousin and my best friend both say that she likes me but I have zero clue because Im too stupid to take hints so here are the facts

1. She really likes playing with me.
2. She broke up with her boyfriend 2 weeks after meeting me.
3. I fall under her "type"
4. She sees me as funny, smart, and a good friend.
5. She is interested in my music taste  going as far as to asking for some of my favorite songs.
6. I always say love you to all my female friends when we end a call and recently she has  started saying it back.

Sorry if there are some typos english is my second language anyway can someone help me
