Is the advice "work on yourself" good for finding a relationship? I've done this. I forgot about putting myself out there and only did what I wanted to do. I still went out plenty and enjoyed myself but I didn't actually try to get in a relationship and was really relaxed.

Over lockdown and the past couple of months I've been getting close to this girl as a friend but only recently started seeing her as potentially more. We became friends when I was focusing on myself so I thought "Hey, maybe this is what people meant".

I asked her out and she rejected me. Does it work to focus on yourself and just "Let it happen naturally"? Is it better to actively try?
