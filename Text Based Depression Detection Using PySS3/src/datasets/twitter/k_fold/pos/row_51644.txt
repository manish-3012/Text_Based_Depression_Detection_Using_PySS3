Teen boys who are insecure are like always the cute ones Like the skinny ones and they think it's bad cause people body shamed them

Except there's nothing wrong with their body at all, it's super cute and they're way better than ripped guys with abs anyway

They just look so cuddleable and cute and usually they are into some thing like nerdy stuff / games / anime and I just want to hear them talk about whatever they like because it's so cute

Yeah I really want a boyfriend like that
