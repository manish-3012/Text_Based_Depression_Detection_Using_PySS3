My mom just pulled the argument of â€œif you have nothing to hide you shouldnâ€™t worryâ€ This was in response to my complaints about installing an app on my laptop that would track what I did on it. Here is the conversation as follows. Sorry if it isnâ€™t formatted right Iâ€™m on mobile. 
Me: â€œI donâ€™t think you should be putting something that tracks what I do on my laptop. Taking my video games away should be enoughâ€

Mom: â€œif you have nothing to hide you shouldnâ€™t worry about it. Besides Iâ€™m way behind their parents on this. Every parent should do something like this.â€

Me: â€œit shouldnâ€™t be a race to invade someoneâ€™s privacy. You shouldnâ€™t do it just because other parents areâ€

Mom: â€œyou shouldnâ€™t have privacy. Your only 16. And I donâ€™t like the direction your going. You need this. Iâ€™m doing this for YOU.â€

Me: â€œwhat do you mean I donâ€™t need privacyâ€

Mom: â€œI mean teens arenâ€™t built to handle computers o they shouldnâ€™t use them anyways. But since you need them for school Iâ€™ll have to settle for this. You shouldnâ€™t be searching anything bad. Your only 16.â€

She then left my room. What the fuck should I do.
