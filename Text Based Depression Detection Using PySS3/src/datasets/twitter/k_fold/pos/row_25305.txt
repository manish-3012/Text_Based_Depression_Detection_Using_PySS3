I just got called she and I fucking loved it I was having trouble with zoom in one of my classes, and after like 10 minutes of messing with stuff I finally got in.

My pro on zoom is some pink aesthetic shit of Zero Two (a girl) and I've barely ever spoken in this class.

When I finally got into the zoom the teacher said "There she is" and my heart took a leap. I honestly never cared about my pronouns because I've been fine with being called a man but holy shit that felt good. I might have to make this a regular occurrence .

Just a little thing I thought I would share with y'all, I feel so happy now :}
