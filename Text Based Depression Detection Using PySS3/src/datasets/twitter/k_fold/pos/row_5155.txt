Posting lyrics I like day idc Now there's too many people that I have done wrong  
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me  
Along for me  
(One, two, three, and)  
Think I'm dreamin'  
This isn't real  
'Cause you leave in a month  
And I'm fiending for something to feel  
When you hold me  
Know you know me down to my core  
This is the calm before the storm  
Mentioned that someone else gon' need you more  
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong  
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me  
Along for me  
(Oh, oh)  
Who are you?  
And I fell apart in that bed  
What we built isn't me  
Won't put it back together again  
I can't take back what I said  
I just look through those messages  
I left on read

Oh, and I took you to rosier  
'Cause I thought we could cope  
We got out on the ocean  
I fell out my boat  
And you calmed me back down  
And you gave me some hope  
And I tossed that away for a seratone  
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong  
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me  
Along with me  
(Oh, oh)  
No commitments  
I'm going to hell, you're going to heaven  
It doesn't negate our holy connection  
And next time I fly too close to the sun  
I'm not gonna run, this shit was for fun  
I left home now I'm fucked up  
Realized how much I loved you  
Whole god damn life, been a suckup  
Now I'm just tryna get my luck up  
All the pain went when you kissed me  
We were ten toes up now I'm six feet down  
Moved on, you don't need me now  
Now I gotta figure me out (ya!)  
No, I gotta figure me out (oh-ooh, yeah, uh)  
Bitch, I'm up next  
Fuckboy ain't a threat  
Put a price on my head  
Won't sell my soul for a check  
That's on god, that's on sound  
You won't ever see me 'round  
I'll be cookin' up some shit that'll probably get me out this town  
So far, are these visual things the only affect you find?
