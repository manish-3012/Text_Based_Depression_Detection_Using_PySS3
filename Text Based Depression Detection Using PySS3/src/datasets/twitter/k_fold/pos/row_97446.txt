its the last year of highschool, should i confess to my crush of 4 years.. we've bought couple tickets for prom together because couple tickets has a discount of 2 usd.. we don't really talk much because she is the shy type and i don't really know how to start up a convo.. she knows that i have a huge crush on her since 13 years old (we're 17 now) but im afraid during prom night when we enter the ballroom it would be awkward.. what do u guys think
