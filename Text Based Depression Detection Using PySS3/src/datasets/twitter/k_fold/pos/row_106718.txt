When you finally get those a.d.d pills? Im 17 and i really needed medication for my a.d.d attention deficit disorder. I couldnâ€™t focus on a single thing for more than 5 minutes including video game. And Thursday i finally got medication i hope it works. I couldâ€™ve honors been one if the best students in my school but me not focusing in class and not doing homework because of my a.d.d really destroyed that chance.
