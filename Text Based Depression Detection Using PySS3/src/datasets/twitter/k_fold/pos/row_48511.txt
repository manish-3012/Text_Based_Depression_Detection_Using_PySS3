you ever think about how the male version of your "I'm not like other girls" phase is thinking that reddit is the only worthwile social media platform? ok I doubt it's only male people who do this, in fact most of these just overlap with I'm not like other girls tendancies. like, they all think that everyone that isn't in their neiche is a cookie cutter person with like 1 emotion and 2 phrases. they feel the need to trash other peoples prefrences to promote their own. and they act like they need to shove down your throats that they're so quirky for not caring about things they think most people care about. if you can't tell, I find them very annoying
