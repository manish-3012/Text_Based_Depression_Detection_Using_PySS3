I am really dumb I have a friend called Caitlin, Iâ€™ve been friends with her all through upper school and college, we got so close we became best friends but Iâ€™m not going to lie I do have a bit of a crush on her. Anyway Iâ€™ve been calling her like once a week just to have a chat and I mentioned a girl I was talking too, and Cait said something along the lines of â€œIâ€™m surprised, usually you have to have it spelt out for you to realise they have a crush on you! Iâ€™d know!â€ And we just laughed it off, but know Iâ€™ve thought about it Iâ€™ve just realised what she couldâ€™ve meant!
