Whatâ€™s worst then being rejected is your crush lying that they like you. Basically a few moths back I told my crush I liked her. She said she liked me back and we could get ice cream together and what not. 

Then she decided to tell me that she only told be she liked me was because no one else liked me and it was out of pity. That is 100% worse than being rejected ðŸ˜ž
