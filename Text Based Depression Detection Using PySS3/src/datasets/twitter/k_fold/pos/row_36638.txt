I remember the time that my school did D.A.R.E (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), here's some bullshit that they said. It was a Muslim school called a Madrasah. Most of what they said was right, but they also said that drugs cause gays or will turn you into an LGBTQ+, and marijuana will kill you and a gateway drug. The true gateway drug is smoking tobacco and bruh in my country 34% of the population is a smoker, even the children are smoking that is older than 7 or 8.
