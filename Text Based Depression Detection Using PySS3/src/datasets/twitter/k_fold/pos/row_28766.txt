I want to go back to when orange and black meant halloween. I know I'm probably gonna get some hate from the "Super straight" community, but I don't care. This is the same thing as when straight people wanted a parade. No you don't get a parade or a flag. Being straight isn't a struggle, you don't get looked down on for being straight. You don't get bullied because you're straight. And it's disgusting that you had to invent a whole sexuality because you don't wanna date a trans person, I'm not saying that you should have to. If you find out that someone is trans and you decide that you're not comfortable dating them then fine, but you're hurting the whole trans community.
