Who the fuck thought it was a smart idea to open up school again? To the person who thought opening up school again was a smart idea, YOU ARE DUMBER THAN A BOX OF ROCKS. YOU DO REALIZE THAT MANY WILL LOSE THEIR LOVED ONES THANKS TO YOUR DUMB ASS, RIGHT?

Plus WHY IS MY SCHOOL HANDLING IT THE WAY IT IS? I LOVED THE WAY MY TEACHERS WOULD HAND OUT WORK WEEKLY AND NOT DAILY. IT MADE ME NOT WANNA RAM MY HEAD INTO THE NEAREST WALL. ALSO WHY THE HELL IS MY SCHOOL TAKING 75 PERCENT OF OUR GRADES OFF FOR EVERY PIECE OF WORK? ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE US SICK? I GET IT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PUNISH CHEATERS BUT 

1: THERES PEOPLE WHO WILL CHOOSE TO STAY HOME TO NOT GET SICK FROM CORONA

2: YOU CAN'T STOP PEOPLE FROM CHEATING

3: BY TAKING 75% OF THE GRADE OFF FOR PEOPLE WHO DO SCHOOL AT HOME, YOU'RE ACTIVELY TRYING TO SPREAD THE CORONA VIRUS, AND SOME HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH ENOUGH TRAUMA THANKS TO CORONA

FUCK YOU SCHOOL.
