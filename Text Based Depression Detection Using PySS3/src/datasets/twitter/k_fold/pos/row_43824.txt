My teacher forgot to mute his mic during our class and we heard things we weren't supposed to hear It's not the first time he forgot to mute his mic, but this time we heard some interesting things. During the class, he got a phone call and he answered it. Next thing you know, he's chatting in fluent Spanish, interchanging with English every now and then. Listening to the conversation, with our basic knowledge of Spanish after being through high school, he was talking about someone's medical issues. Poor guy seemed like he was hospitalized with an STD and sir was acting as a translator to give information. The conversation went on for a few minutes, while we blew up our class chat reacting to his conversation. After he finished, he continued his lecture then paused when he noticed our silence. "Wait... you guys heard all that?" Of course we did. He gave an explanation of the situation, which we DID NOT need to know more details about. About 8 more minutes pass after he continues his lecture and he paused again. "Wait, this is being recorded? I should have muted my mic. Is there any way to edit it? Can I cut that piece out of the recording?" Nope. He didn't want to lose his job but there was useful information in the lecture. We all vowed to keep our mouths shut and that the recording would be deleted. He stopped the recording and started fresh in the middle of his presentation. I couldn't stop laughing, to say the least
