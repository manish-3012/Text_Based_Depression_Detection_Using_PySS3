I still hate myself (day2) I have to be up in a bit less than 6 hours and while it's better than the 4-5 hours of sleep I got last night, I still feel terrible

My lack of sel control makes me feel like garbage... I was fully aware of how late it was for the past 3 hours, yet despite that I willingly chose not to even prepare for sleep

And I'm still procrastinating sleep by typing this... I feel awful
