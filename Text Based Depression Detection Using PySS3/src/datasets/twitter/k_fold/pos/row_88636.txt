Yk whats not a vibe? Wanting to join VC's with your friends all the time but you can't cause either your parents are around or you're in too much of a fucked mood to communicate via voice. So you kinda just gotta watch em be in VC

Eh as much as I'm complaining I get to talk to them and they're real cool people so that's something, I'm not the worst off

But honestly, I'd feel a little better if I weren't alone lol, anyone else got this issue?
