I just want to feel like someone cares for me All of my â€œfriendsâ€ donâ€™t text me and if I donâ€™t say hi to them most of them donâ€™t notice me and I think they made a group chat without me and my family just leaves me alone unless they need my help with something I just want someone to at least pretend they like me
