Honestly just fuck Covid Bit of a story here, but I just wanted to say it. All my life Iâ€™ve wanted to travel around. A good way to do this was to get into my schools Chinese exchange program. Only thing is it was really hard to get into. They take 1 person from each Chinese class, so you had to really try to get into it with lots of work and you even had to interview to get into it. I worked hard all throughout middle school to get good enough grades and work in Chinese class to get in.

 I finally got in my freshman year, but the trip was scheduled for April 2020. So needless to say it got cancelled. I was sad, but they said that next year weâ€™d have a chance to go. Well I got lucky and got in. They just announced that this years trip was cancelled. This sucks so much. We wonâ€™t have another chance to go. My dreams are shattered. Idk what to do. My family canâ€™t really afford to send me to China for 2 months, so I guess thatâ€™s it. Sorry for the rant. I just needed to tell someone
