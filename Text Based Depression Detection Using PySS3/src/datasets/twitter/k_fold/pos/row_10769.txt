my exams are tomorrow. Im super scared I've prepared. Not as much as I would like to , but enough. I know I'll pass, but I'm more scared of what my mum will say. She always says  I failed my GCSEs in grade 10, but I passed with a distinction, averaging 85 % . Anything below B is a fail in her eyes. I could use a couple of kind words. And some advice I guess. Im tempted to cheat, and I can. I dont want to , because I know someday I'll feel guilty about it. Theres already a lot on my chest. I dont want anymore.
