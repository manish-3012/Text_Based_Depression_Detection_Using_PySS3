I kinda miss old cod lobbies in a weird way There was a chaotic beauty to them. As a kid, it was so fascinating seeing all the insulting words in existence. There was a sense of competition when you were insulted and such. There still is those kind of lobbies, especially in SnD but the mics aren't so shitty ðŸ˜”. I've legit only had 3 lobbies out of SnD with trash talk. Maybe it's because I have a lowish KD of 0.99. On the other hand, I'm kinda glad they're gone because they did turn some people pretty toxic
