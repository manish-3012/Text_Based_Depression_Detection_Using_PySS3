AAAAAAAAA why is ADHD so rough Itâ€™s literally like, the hyperfixating, the extreme procrastination if I donâ€™t take my medicine, the fucking brain donâ€™t work. And on top of all that the Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria is just fuckibg sucks. Why did nobody prepare me for this? Doctor just gave me pills and said â€œhey little boy you wonâ€™t be distracted in school if you take theseâ€. He didnâ€™t say â€œhey you will develop an intense fear of rejection that will turn your personality into that of a shitty people pleaser, too afraid to stand up for themselvesâ€. I didnâ€™t even know what neurodivergent meant until a year ago!
