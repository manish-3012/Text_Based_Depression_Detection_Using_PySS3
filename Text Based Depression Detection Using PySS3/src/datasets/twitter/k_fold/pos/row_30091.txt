For the first time in my life everything is going good. Was gonna make this post earlier but I had exams which stressed me out sm but they got cancelled so yay! 

Things that are going right: 
I have a gf and weâ€™ve been dating for 4 months now :D

Exams got cancelled 

I finally feel like Iâ€™m a part of my friends group. Every morning itâ€™s like , hey wanna play this wanna go here etc 

Things that are going wrong

Itâ€™s all just hell after this. I have 1 month  to do whatever I want but itâ€™s just hell after this
