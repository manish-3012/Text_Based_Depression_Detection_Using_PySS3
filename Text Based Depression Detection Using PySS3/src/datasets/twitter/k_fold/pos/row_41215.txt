I think there is something wrong with me... So for the last few weeks I feel really tried and I struggle to get out of bed everyday. I stopped attending my online classes and just gave up on most of them. I haven't spoken to any of my friends in a month and I have completely stopped talking to my parents as well, despite living in the same house.

I have no idea about what's wrong with me and I might have only felt this way once or twice before. 

I feel like I am going through a major slump and I should just give up and sleep for eternity. 

Sometimes I wish I could cry, but it doesn't come out, ever. Sometimes I inflict physical pain so that I can start crying. I just want to feel something again. I want to feel happy, I want to laugh but I can't. I dont know why but I feel like I dont deserve to be happy. 

I want to be able to work again, just do something and be someone. I want to go out and breathe fresh air but something inside of me stops me from going out. Ever time I get ready to go out I feel like I might not come back home alive. 

I stare at the wall for hours together not thinking about anything. I feel like I should be reaching out for help or something but there's no one close to me who I could bother with my troubles.

I also have become very impulsive for some reason. Just the other, I woke up randomly at 3am and climbed my wardrobe and jumped from the top of it and broke a tile. I get jitters and I run around the house for 30mins non stop or just learn a new ice skating program just to replicate it in my room.

I wish I could be happy again....
