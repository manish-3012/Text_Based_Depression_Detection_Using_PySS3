i donâ€™t know if itâ€™s just my anxiety talking but i think i lost my dad my dad usually texts/calls us every so often ever since my parents got divorced some years ago, last message I got from him was in February on my birthday, and Iâ€™ve been calling and texting him for a few days now and havenâ€™t had a single response. i know he was an alcoholic and life wasnâ€™t going his way, especially when he was driving and got into a crash that caused my grandpa to almost lose is arm. i really donâ€™t know what to do, I donâ€™t have my license so I canâ€™t go visit him alone, my brother is always busy and my mom is too. im just really starting to worry.
