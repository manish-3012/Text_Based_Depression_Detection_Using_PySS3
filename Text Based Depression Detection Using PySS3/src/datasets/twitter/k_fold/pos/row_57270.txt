I hate driving, period It stresses me out so much. Im worried about pissing other people off and I try to drive cautiously.

Just today, I was driving my Mom's truck (thing is really huge) and almost drove out infront of a car, which the driver of it sent me a death glare. I wanted to crawl under the dashboard and hide cus I felt like an asshole.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk ðŸ’…
