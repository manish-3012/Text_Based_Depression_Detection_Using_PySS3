Aha I love my friends /j my best friend blocked me on everything and won't tell me why. he told me I need to wait *at least* two weeks before he'll talk to me again so that's great. he was my everything, he was the most important person to me, he knows everything about me and now he's doing this. it infuriates me, but I know I'll probably forgive him. I can't tell him any thing rn and it makes me so sad. we have a common interest of BotW and ik when I play I won't be able to tell him about my progress, and I can't talk to him in the middle of the night anymore. so yah I love life /s
