Why does My hair have to be so annyoying I just yesterday night before bed brushed the hell out of it making sure i got out all the tangles but then once i woke up i had like 4 New big tangled spots Which were a pain to get undone. Between the time of brushing hair and waking up i had done nothing except sleep, Itâ€™s so annoying.
