This is for my crush Riley. Hi, I know you had reddit and used it a lot so I thought you would see if you don't then, I'll just tell you in person I guess but afraid it will take time and if you suicide before this I, I just don't know. 

Those eyes are like glimmering stars of the night sky, lost in them like time has stopped, my heart set like the sun into your arms which presented by the horizon, that one name I know near and dear, it's sad to see you go, you will fade into the distance or do you want fall with me calmly like snow.

I love you Riley, don't leave me please. You saved me from suicide and I love you because of that.
