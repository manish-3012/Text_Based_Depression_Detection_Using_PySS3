I cut out every one of my friends of over 3 years on Sunday They were being toxic shits bullying kids for playing fortnite and others for not sharing their exact opinion. I dont know how I put up with this for 3 years, but I'm glad their gone. The only downside is that I have freaking no one to talk to now
