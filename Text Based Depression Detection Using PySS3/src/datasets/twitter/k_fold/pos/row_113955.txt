Apparently a saying Iâ€™ve been using just doesnâ€™t exist??? So thereâ€™s this saying, â€œWaxing the midnight candleâ€, it means staying up late, right? I searched it up everywhere and it just doesnâ€™t exist?? Have I tapped into a different timeline??? Is there a different version of it that is more mainstream??? Am I just going insane???
