I need help I was in a discord call with my irl friend  playing arsenal in roblox (haha no its not cringy) and whilst we were playing he tells me about this online friend from Belgium that apparently has been going through alot of bullshit. Now usually when i play gun games i tend to turn into a prick of a bastard, but considering the situation i decide to speak to his online friend from belgium. 

We decide to make a group chat for the three of us just to try and see what we could do to help him, and turns out he was autistic who has been struggling with depression and mental health problems. That hit me.

I decide to add him on discord because thats the type of idiot i am so he accepts the friend request. I slowly ask him questions about what trouble he was going though, (he needs time to translate)  and turns out his life was pretty shitty. He was beaten up by shitty bastards due to his autism, and it goes to the point where he is so depressed that he is in the verge of SUICIDE. I try to tell him to talk about it to his parents, bu he says that he doesnt want to because he is scared that his parents will end up 'dead like in the bullying movies'. He's also scared that he will make his parents sad and traumatized.

Rn i did make him feel at his comfort zone, making sure he has my reassurance and my friend's , but i have this feeling things might not go well sooner or later. Im no psychologist but i really want to help the poor guy. 

Im kind of confused on what to do in dealing with situations like these so I'm asking this sub reddit cos i fel ike this could be the best place for teenage advice. thanks
