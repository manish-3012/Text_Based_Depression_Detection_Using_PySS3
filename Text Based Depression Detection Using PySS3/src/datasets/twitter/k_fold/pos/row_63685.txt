Just broke up with my first boyfriendâ€¦ 
I was in da phone wid him when walking to school nd He offered to send me money so I could have some breakfast but I didnâ€™t feel comfortable about taking his money he earned from working. But he didnâ€™t like the fact that I wasnâ€™t gonna eat so I tried to ease his mind about it and said I could just take money from my friend who I later told him was gay. 

He didnâ€™t like the fact that I would accept money from other guys instead of my own boyfriend. Prior to this he would only respond with one word sentence which is what he does when heâ€™s pissed or upset and wouldnâ€™t acknowledge how I felt overwhelmed with his jealousy so I said if we canâ€™t work this out that I couldnâ€™t do this anymore. 

He then said that me accepting money from other guys and not him was apparently fucked up. Iâ€™m pretty sure I did what I could but in the end I couldnâ€™t get through to him but at times I feel like an asshole. 

I honestly felt like I was the only one trying to Salvage what we had and even said I didnâ€™t wanna break up and apologised but in the end I got frustrated and he used that against me.  

Iâ€™ve never broken up with someone before and the pain is fresh any advice is welcomed.
