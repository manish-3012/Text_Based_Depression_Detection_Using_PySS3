I feel like running away right now Im trying to be productive and confident as much as I can, but its so hard and Im not seeing results. I asked my crush out on a date and she said no, I missed an assignment even though I scheduled to do it on time cause I missed something in class, I tried to draw more since I usually only practice drawing like once a week but I completely failed like 3 drawings in a row, and I died on my cross country run yesterday and was way behind everyone. Basically I tried working super hard these last 2 weeks but I still just completely failed at everything. Now Im sad and unmotivated, so I wasn't very productive today at all and missed my workout and some homework. I cant do anything even when Im trying my best and staying positive so whats the point
