Cool running shoes? Hello teens! 

A question I'm hoping you can help me with - I've signed up with a local organization to buy gifts for some homeless folks in my area. The deal is, you know the person's age, gender, and three items from their wish list.

I've signed up for a 14 year old girl, and she wants running shows (I know her size). But I'm an old lady of 37, I don't know what the teens are into these days. 

Anyone got any links to some cool sneakers that she'd be into?

TIA!
