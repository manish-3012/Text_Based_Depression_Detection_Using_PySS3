Day 2: No Nut November [Day 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jm8ahe/day_1_no_nut_november/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Today was a pretty good day, I am busy with studying for an important final exam. Also I have dance lessons every Monday, we are practicing for a school event which takes place in February. The problem is that my pair during the dance is a beautiful girl, which makes things harder, but friends and classmates are behind my back. Stay strong guys
