Shitty poem I just wrote. Probably the worst one I've posted here lol  Hold on for ten days,

Thatâ€™s the best they can say.

Ten days till salvation

Or a lifelong damnation.

My mind says the latter,

And my gut does agree,

If Iâ€™m wrong, then Iâ€™m flattered,

And itâ€™d sure set me free.

&amp;#x200B;

It started in May,

Of the year that came prior,

My one great mistake

That will haunt me to my grave.

I guess closure will come,

And Iâ€™ll see the non-sun,

Either way I am changed,

I know life is a gun.
