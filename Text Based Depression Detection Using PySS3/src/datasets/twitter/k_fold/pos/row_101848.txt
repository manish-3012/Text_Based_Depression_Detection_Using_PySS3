I went for a long ass walk to make myself more familiar with my neighborhood and shit. Well i met a nice stray cat that approached me, and i have some bad experiences with wild animals so I was hesitant. But it started doing that headbutt-against-your-leg thing that cats do. And it let me pet it and everything, pretty cool 10/10 will give it food tomorrow
