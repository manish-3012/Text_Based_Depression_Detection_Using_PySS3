Need some ideas for this book I'm writing! I have to write a book about fractured identity and I need help on how I can create a resolution that links to a journey of a new sense of self. So far the book is about a father who hid his daughter from the government systems, meaning they have no trace of who this girl is. The government figures out the father's secret and kills him. The girl is now confused and doesn't know who she is in society because she's been isolated her whole life. I have to incorporate self-discovery into the story but I don't know what to put. Anybody have any ideas pls
