My girlfriend just broke up with me. Weâ€™ve only been together for a month but... man it hurts. We met online. She lives in the same country as me but a different state. Her parents found out about us and have made her break up with me. I donâ€™t know how to feel. I feel so empty. I loved her so much. I never told my parents either, my mom didnâ€™t even know I was bi until today. I told her out of impulse because nothing really mattered to me. I donâ€™t have a response. Iâ€™ve messaged my girlfriend about it and havenâ€™t gotten a response. Iâ€™m just in this waiting game. Her dad said we could still talk and possibly get back together when weâ€™re older but... it just hurts. Her mom almost kicked her out. I feel like such an idiot because I knew deep down this would happen one day.. but I didnâ€™t expect it so soon. I donâ€™t know what to do now. Iâ€™m so lost. I loved her so much, she was my first ever girlfriend and she made me feel so happy and I felt like for once in my life I could be myself.. Maybe some guidance from people my age can help.. I know we could get back together but by the time weâ€™d be allowed to, would we even be close?
