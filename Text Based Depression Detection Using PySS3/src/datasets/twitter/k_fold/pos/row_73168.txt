I JUST GOT A 8 FOR MY BIG SWEDISH TEST! WOOOOHOOOO it might not sound like it is a good number but it is for me. I nearly failed swedish but now I got motivation to study swedish and I am sky rocketing
And I read 1-2 hour everyday for two weeks for the test.
Btw my number for it was 5
I am just so happy that my work is finally baying off.
