HALP ME PLEASE holy shit bro let me level with you

i know this girl from elementary kind of (now in 11th grade, we still go to same school)

we never really hung out much, more of a friend of a friend

but now i have a crush on her and have for a while

like i said, i dont really know her, so i want to ask to be friends but i feel like it would be super obvious what i was trying to do if i just said "HEY WANNA BE FRIENDS"

what do i do tho? like i ask her to hang out, what? idk what to even do tbh
