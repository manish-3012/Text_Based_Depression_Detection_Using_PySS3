Idk why but ive lowkey been not eating at all these past few weeks. I have always been underweight but in the past month I've lost 10 pounds.  130 to 120.  My stomach hurts because of the acids but I'm not hungry so I don't eat.  It isn't that im self conscious or anything I love me im just never hungry.  Idk why I'm posting this but meh fuck it.
