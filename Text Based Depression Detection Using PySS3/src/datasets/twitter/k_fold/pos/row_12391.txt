I once pretended to be asleep for 7 hours on a dirty toilet floor at my school  

When I was 15 years old I was in the last year of middle school. Now I was a bit of a weird kid so I was in special ed. Luckily I wasn't that weird, so some of my classes took place at the main school with the "normal" kids.

Now usually I took the classes at the main school along with one of my friends from the special ed class, and we usually go over to the main school together. But then one day he decides to just go over to the main school without me because fuck me I guess. And of course that very day the class took place in another room than usual, and I didn't know that. So instead of asking people where the fuck my class is like a normal person would do, I, in all my gloryful social ineptitude, decide to hide in the nearest toilet and lock myself in there. I send a snap to my friend asking where he is, but of course, no answer. So I decide to wait on the toilet until he answers. Which he doesn't. At all. So I end up sitting on a nasty, dirty, piss and shit stained, STD-riddled toilet floor for 7 hours until the school closes. There was also a motion sensor light in the toilet and I was terrified that I was gonna get caught so I sat there totally still without moving a muscle for 7 hours. I obviously tried to fall asleep but surprisingly enough it's not that easy to fall asleep on a 0.5 m\^2 nasty, dirty, piss and shit stained, STD-riddled toilet floor. After the longest 7 hours of my life I snuck out and went home with debilitating pain in my entire body. My backpack with my computer and all my other stuff was inside my special ed class, and I was of course afraid to show my face to anyone that day, so I just went home without my stuff.
