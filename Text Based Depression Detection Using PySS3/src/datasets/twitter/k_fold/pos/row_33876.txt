Something I want to get off my mind You know when you break up with someone... and well you still happen to talk to them because youâ€™ve both been through some shit together and youâ€™re really close friends despite the fact that you used to date them and youâ€™ve come to the mutual understanding and standpoint with them. 

And youâ€™re so used to being the one making them happy and all of that and they eventually find someone else who makes them smile and itâ€™s bittersweet because youâ€™re really happy for them and youâ€™ve moved on to someone else who makes you happy and youâ€™re also happy that theyâ€™ve moved on but youâ€™re also just kind of sad that youâ€™re no longer that person to them. 

I just... itâ€™s a crazy world and itâ€™s been on my head lately. And I know I could come to this community to get it out.
