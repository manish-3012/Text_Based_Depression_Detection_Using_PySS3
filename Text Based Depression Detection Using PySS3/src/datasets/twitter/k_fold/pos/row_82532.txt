Can't stop thinking about her Ever since a few weeks ago I can't get her out of my head. I really wanna make a move but if you look at some of my previous posts she and I are in a thought spot right now. I don't even have any reason to believe she likes me back. She just broke up with a guy she'd been dating for a year and she's already going after another guy but she doesn't want to ask him out yet cause she's giving herself time. I forgot to mention this guy is a legal adult (21) and she is still underage (17). I'm gonna see her again on Monday and I really wanna tell her I like her but I feel like I shouldn't. It would be so nice, though, to be with her and kiss her and hold her in my arms/be held in her arms. Not necessarily looking for advice but I just need somewhere to say it cause I feel like I can't tell my family or friends about it. If things get less complicated then I'm gonna say something immediately but in the meantime I'm just stuck and it sucks.
