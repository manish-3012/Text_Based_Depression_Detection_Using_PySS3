Does anyone else feel like the internet just isnâ€™t fun anymore? Like I miss the days were everyone was just saying and posting goofy shit with no ulterior motives. Back when it felt like every youtuber and tiktok creator was just a dude with a camera and a dream. 

Also I think memeâ€™s really arenâ€™t that funny anymore. That may just be a symptom of maturing though.
