I have come to a conclusion from my previous post on this sub. Equality and Open-mindedness will never truly exist. It is wishful thinking and it is not up for debate. Our generation, actual teenagers of course, are supposedly the most actively open-minded, progressive and diverse generation to date and yet it is still a joke. I am not only talking to you all, but myself at some points. If open-mindedness ever ACTUALLY happens, it will surely be far into the future as we all have a long way to go.
