Do any of yâ€™all have tips for going to sleep? Lately I have been struggling a lot to go to sleep because of stress with school and also for some reason my brain thinks itâ€™s a good idea to make me sad as soon as I hit the pillow. I havenâ€™t slept properly for 4 days and Iâ€™m starting to get darks circles because of it. I need help.

Edit: and donâ€™t say â€œjust close your eyesâ€ â€œor just go to sleepâ€ the reason I made this post is because any time I try to go to bed I get sad or I just have nightmares. Seems like my brain is always finding a reason for me to not sleep properly.
