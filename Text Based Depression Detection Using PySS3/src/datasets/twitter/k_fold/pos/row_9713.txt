Is it weird if I start initiating conversations with an old friend more often again? they would check up on me from time to time and in fact we just gamed together just now but i lowkey want to talk to them everyday again? i just don't know how to do it without making me look like i'm clingy

oh and we didn't end on bad terms, we just drifted off due to life and all that
