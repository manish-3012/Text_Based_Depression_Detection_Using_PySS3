I'm considering asking my crush out for Valentines Day I'm considering asking her out. I don't know if I should, Mainly because I don't really know her very well, I'm not all that attractive, and she has expressed that she is not interested in me before. I feel like she will only date me because I've been in a pretty bad place right now. I don't really want to make things awkward between us or ruin mine or other's friendships. I think i'll just sit alone sad on Valentines Day instead :/
