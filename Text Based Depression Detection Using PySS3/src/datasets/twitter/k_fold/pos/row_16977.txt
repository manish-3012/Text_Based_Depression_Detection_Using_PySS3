Everyone else Iâ€™ve heard from has more drama in their life It seems that everyone I see online and irl have more drama in their life. I havenâ€™t had any girlfriends nor any mental problems nor any big problems of any sort. I have nothing happening in my life but it seems everyone I talk to is depressed or has relationship problems (or both). Maybe my bland energy attracts interesting people idk.
