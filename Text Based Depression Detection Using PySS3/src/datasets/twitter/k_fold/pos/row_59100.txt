Okay this girl likes me... now what... So this girl i've been on and off friends with since freshmen year (now juniors) apparently has a crush on me (according to her friend).

This is very awesome cause i was damn near infatuated with her freshmen year and I since got over her and she likes me?? And she literally one of the prettiest girls i've ever met and i'm not exaggerating just because i like her,, which makes this whole so much more weird to me cause like,, why??

Now i started texting her today and now it's just convo but where do i go from here? We both like each other evidently but i'm lost because i haven't done this in so long.

She loves to ice skate so maybe i'll take her there? and she can absolutely embarrass me lmao
