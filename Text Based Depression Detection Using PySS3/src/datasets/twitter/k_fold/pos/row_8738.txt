This is fucking bullshit and my teacher is a dumbass. So we still have actual school where I live. This girl was sick and 2 of her 5 siblings go to our school. She came to school the next day, and left early because she didn't feel well. She did it again. Then she came to school the next day and was there the whole day. We told her "maybe you should get tested for COVID". She got SO mad and the teacher YELLED AT US BECAUSE "It WaSn'T oUr BuSiNeSs". ***SHE'S IN OUR CLASS I SIT NEXT TO HER FOR FUCK SAKE!!! I DON'T WANT COVID!!!!***
