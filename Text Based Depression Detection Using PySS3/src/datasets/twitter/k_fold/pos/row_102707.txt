Man what a fucking ride itâ€™s been. I canâ€™t exactly remember the dates but at the very least Iâ€™ve been queer for a year now. Itâ€™s been half a year since I came out to my brother as non-binary. Idk just crazy to think about. Iâ€™ve come pretty fucking far. Done a lot of coping. I guess hurray? Idk this ainâ€™t a special day Iâ€™m just feeling reflective tonight.
