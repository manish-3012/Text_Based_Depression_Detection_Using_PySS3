Honest question for everyone: do you guys still care about topics like climate change and BLM? Last year everyone seemed so worried about climate change and enthusiastic about making a change. People talked about it often and everything. But this year Iâ€™m hearing almost no noise about it. And I know that corona has mostly overshadowed it for this part of this year, but Iâ€™m like even before the virus hit I feel like no one was talking about it.

Same thing with BLM, everyone was talking about it and then the next month, the noise cut down from about 100% to 50%. 

And I mean absolutely no judgment when I ask this, Iâ€™m genuinely curious, but is it just a trend for you guys?
