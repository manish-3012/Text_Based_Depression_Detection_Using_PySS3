Shown up my son's friends This happened like a year ago but it still bugs me... And I know I'm not a teenager but I'd like some kids perspective on it.

So my son is a big pro wrestling fan. Thatâ€™s all well and good, but one night he had his friends over (also into this "sport" they see on tv) and they had some fun facing off against each other. This is also fine, but then someone came up with the brilliant idea that I should be their final opponent after their matches.

Everybody thought this was a great idea, cheering me on. Stupidly enough I agreed, thinking theyâ€™re 11-12 and Iâ€™m a grown woman, how hard can it be rightâ€¦ Well it was HARD. I had my ass handed to me more times than I can count, these kids were freaking strong and one after another they kicked my ass! It was fun at first but... Eventually I had to tell them I was going easy on them because theyâ€™re kids to save face, but I really wasnâ€™t. I doubt they believed me anyway. At least they had to go home eventually... How can they be so strong at this age?
