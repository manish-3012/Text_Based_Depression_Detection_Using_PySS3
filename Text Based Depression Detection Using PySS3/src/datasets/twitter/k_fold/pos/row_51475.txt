I still wonder why did people suddenly switch opinions on minecraft and Fortnite As everyone knows they swapped roles and now my minecraft awesome fn bad but it was at its peak when FN lost it's reputation S5 came out with no complaints except two rare items,4new awesome POI's,the first two vehicles,two new weapons and it was easy there were not,a lot of pros.they did lots of awesome stuff but gets bashed and minecraft just came back from the dead for nostalgia reasons


Moral of the story is that the minecraft bee update sucks
