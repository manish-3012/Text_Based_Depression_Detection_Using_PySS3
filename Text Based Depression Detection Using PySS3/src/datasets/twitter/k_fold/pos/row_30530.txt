Me review on deltarune: chapter one. [SPOILERS] Ok I just played the entirety of deltarune on my nintendo switch today. Here is my review. Ok so I LOVED it. It isn't as good as undertale but then again...I don't think anything toby can make will be as good as undertale. The new options for fighting like magic, defend, etc. Plus it's really cool how it hints at undertale in it. There I one big problem with the fighting tho....ITS WAYYYY TO EASY!!! Like in undertale itself there was legitimate FIGHTS in it. Like the random encounters could sometimes be a pain in the ass. Yet in this game I only died once and that's cause I was still learning how crap worked. Lancers (think that the name) dad wasn't even that hard. So toby in the next chapter PLEASE MAKE IT HARDER!!! Also I feel like they should add a few Easter eggs too. But everything else was good... except...WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT ENDING! Like I be watching the credits and then frickin Kris rips out his heart and troughs it across the room. However I think that will be revealed in the next chapter. Everything else tho is great. Last thing, wheres frisk? Like where Is he after all this crap? I just wanna know that. Overall that was a very fun game (well chapter.) That i really enjoyed. 8/10 would recommend.
