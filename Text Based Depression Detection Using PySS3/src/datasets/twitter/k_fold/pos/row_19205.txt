Do people think i talk to other people There was this girl who apparently liked me. so she had one of her friends come to me and try to get me to download snapchat and i refused and after a while a classmate gave my number to her and she messaged me being friendly and all that but i don't think she realized how obvious it was that she liked me because she was the only girl that send messages to me....
