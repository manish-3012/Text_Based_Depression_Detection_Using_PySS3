Caffeine withdrawal So Iâ€™m pretty sure the reason Iâ€™ve had bad headaches and Iâ€™ve been so sleep today and yesterday is bc I havenâ€™t had coffee. Honestly I got these coffee beans a week ago and I heard they go bad a week after you open the bag so I was trying to get it finished so I donâ€™t waste any beans. Now Iâ€™m paying the price. I donâ€™t wanna give up caffeine entirely but I hate how it feels to suddenly stop. No wonder people get so addicted to it. I used to think people exaggerate how tired they feel without it but once you stop it makes you more tired than you were before you started. The only way to get rid of the headaches and sleepiness instantly is to go back to having caffeine. Itâ€™s basically and endless cycle. I really wanna have more rn but Iâ€™m not sure what to do so this doesnâ€™t happen again. Also Iâ€™m probably gonna need a smaller bag of coffee beans because thatâ€™s way too much for one person.
