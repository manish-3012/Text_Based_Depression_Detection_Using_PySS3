Pressing I find with society Why tf can't boys wear makeup? Whether or not ur straight or gay has nothing to do with it. I'm a straight mf and I wanna just put on sum nail polish like black, but if I go to school I'll prolly get detention, and my family will prolly assume I'm gay. Like society puts pressure on u to conform to the norm of this jacked mf that's outdoorsy or sum BS like that. Why tf can't I just do whatever tf I want, like nigga this has nun to do wit u. FFS
