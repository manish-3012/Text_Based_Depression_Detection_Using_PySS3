I'm probably gonna get sent to hell for this, but FUCK IT! So, I moved the scale in my bathroom into the scale in my parent's bathroom. The reason why is because every fucking time I go to sleep I always have to hear the following: (Note, footsteps are annoyingly loud, so whenever I put "footsteps." it's the annoyingly loud version even when it says so.)

(Annoyingly loud footsteps.) (door opening followed by more footsteps.) (scale beep.) (more footsteps followed by a door closing.) (footsteps then door closing.)

So, my plan to get sent to hell is record what happens for every. Damn. Night. My parents denied this ever happening, but either they're lying or I'm hearing something. And I'm pretty sure if there's a pattern, I'm not hearing anything. Later, I'll bring it up again, and show the recording. And, no, I can't say I edited the file. Reason 1: I have NO clue of any software for sound editing. 2: My aids PC can't handle anything without fucking it up due to how shit it is. So, as a result, I'm either gonna be told "I'm wrong." or get fucking yelled at just because I don't wanna hear annoying ass foot steps and a beep before I sleep. Wish me luck.
