It's a black-top blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled! Damn. Last friday night Yeah, we danced on tabletops  
And we took too many shots  
Think we kissed, but I forgot  
Last Friday night  
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards  
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard  
Last Friday night  
We went streaking in the park  
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a mÃ©nage Ã  trois  
Last Friday night  
Yeah, I think we broke the law  
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh whoa

But this Friday night, do it all again  
This Friday night, do it all again

Trying to connect the dots  
Don't know what to tell my boss  
Think the city towed my car  
Chandelier is on the floor  
Ripped my favorite party dress  
Warrant's out for my arrest  
Think I need a ginger ale  
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night ended up online  
I'm screwed, oh well  
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled  
Damn

T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F  
(Let's do this shit like every weekend)  
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
