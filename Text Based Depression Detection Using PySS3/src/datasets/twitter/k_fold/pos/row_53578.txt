I Just entered a meeting with 120 people and the teachers did not talk the entire time What the fuck did you make me stay in front of a computer for 2 hours for ? I hate how my school had the whole summer to organise stuff but hasn't changed shit except for where we enter, they even had a budget form the government and all. I am sure somebody is gonna catch Corona, because a teacher opened the camera and they were in one of my classes and nothing had changed, no distancing,no nothing. (I'm not from the US btw)
