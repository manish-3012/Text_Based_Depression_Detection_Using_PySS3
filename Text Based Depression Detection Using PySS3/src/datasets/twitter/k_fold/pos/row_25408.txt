Iâ€™m having trouble working up the courage to tell my parents I want to start dating So my parents rarely bring up the topic of dating and weâ€™ve never really discussed when Iâ€™d be allowed to start. Iâ€™m really nervous about addressing this with them and I donâ€™t know why. Does anyone know what might help?
