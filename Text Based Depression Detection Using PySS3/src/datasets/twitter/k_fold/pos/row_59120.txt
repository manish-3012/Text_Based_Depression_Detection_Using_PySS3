what's the first thing you do as soon as you get up? the moment I get up, I try to find my glasses and then go through the notifications and texts I got over night and then just waste like 20-30 mins lying in my bed w my phone. then drink water, brush my teeth and freshen up a bit

I usually shower after breakfast or lunch ðŸ˜³
