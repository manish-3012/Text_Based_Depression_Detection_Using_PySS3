Hello, I'm Irish and I am to understand that this SubReddit is mostly American, so I hope I can get an answer for a question I have about the United States. I have always wondered why the all the States have such strange names, like "Ohio" and "Michigan". Can anybody tell me why? 

Thanks in advance.
