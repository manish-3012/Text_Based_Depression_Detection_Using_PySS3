You know when I look at myself on my camera or the mirror, I always tell my self... That I look the boy version of April Ludgate. And you know what? That's not a bad thing. Kinda appreciate it actually. Ludgate is one of the best characters in Parks and rec, so it's pretty great that I look like the guy version of April.
