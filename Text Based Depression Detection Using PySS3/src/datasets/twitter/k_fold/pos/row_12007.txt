I smoked weed at 13, and it was probably one of the biggest mistakes ive ever made. 
The biggest mistake of my life. I feel ruined and scared of anyone else finding out. I only did it twice, because I thought it was cool and it made me cooler. I regret it with every ounce of my being and I hate being known as one of â€œthoseâ€ people. I just turned 14 and I want to cry every time i think about it. i know its barely going to affect me in the future, but i am not going to let this ruin my future and that is why iâ€™ve stopped. I cant stop thinking about it though, I feel sick when ever I think about it. The thing is everyones treating me like a complete buzzkill now bc Ive sworn to myself im not going down that path, even though my best friend wont even tell me things about this anymore. I also stopped because my parents do so much for me and I donâ€™t even want to come close to disappointing them. Im currently doing extremely well in school, and i am not about to give all of that up. I feel so guilty and tbh it just feels good to let it out.
