Dad forces me to do things I donâ€™t want to My father encourages me to do activities like sports and play instruments and Iâ€™m a pretty active person so of course I will take his suggestion. After about 2-3 weeks of me doing this activity (Iâ€™ll use an example, skateboarding) he forces me to do things outside of my comfort zone like dropping into a halfpipe or something like that when i just started skating. This really makes hobbies hard for me since my dad controls every aspect of what I do. Iâ€™m asking for help on how I can passively change this as confrontation hasnâ€™t worked in the past. Thankyou
