I think I messed up my first impression with my crush today Okay I was riding my bike to go and see my crush for the first time. The wind was blowing my hair around like crazy and it ruined my hair. Iâ€™m scared that my crush will think Iâ€™m ugly and wonâ€™t consider dating me because the first impression was bad (also I didnâ€™t make her laugh at all today)
