There is a big threat to humanity that no one is talking about. Have you guys ever heard of the immortal jelly fish. Well if you havenâ€™t, theyâ€™re basically are what they sound like, immortal jelly fish. You might be thinking â€œImmortal jelly fish? That sounds pretty neeto :) â€œ. NO! Do you know what this means??? That means that they can multiply easily. Soon, the world will be overpopulated with these jellyfish. After they take over the oceans, they would want to expand and colonize land. Due to them being able to live basically forever, they have more time to expand their intelligence. We need to stop this while we can. I say pollute be ocean to kill these fuckers off.
