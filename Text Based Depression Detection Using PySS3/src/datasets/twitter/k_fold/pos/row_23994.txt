This is not okay For reference I am a 14 year old non-binary person (male in sex). Hereâ€™s the story: I go to an art class on Saturdayâ€™s and itâ€™s so fucking disgusting because my male friends have decided itâ€™s funny to shove a pencil through the chairs (because they have holes in them) up someoneâ€™s ass. To their slight credit they donâ€™t do it to people they donâ€™t know but apparently itâ€™s not an uncommon thing at my school and a few schools in my area and some people do it to random people but in every situation the victim is male and itâ€™s not fucking funny. This has happened to me countless times on weekends and in school and I canâ€™t fucking believe how big assholes some people are. The fact that it is only male victims from what Iâ€™ve seen is a clear example of the harassment double standards. 

Iâ€™m going to sleep Iâ€™ll reply to things in a few hours thanks.
