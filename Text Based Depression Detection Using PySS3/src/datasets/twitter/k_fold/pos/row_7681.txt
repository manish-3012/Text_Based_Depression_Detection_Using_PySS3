My principal is so touchy, its weird. Like, he is ***not*** creepy or weird. Honestly a great dude, he's been there for a really long time and everyone loves him. But he is way too *touchy* imo, like when someone walks past he grabs their arm a little bit. Just above the elbow. Or one time he patted the top of my head as we finished a conversation. He doesn't make me feel uncomfortable, but its hella weird. I'm not use to those casually gestures. I think its an old person thing because my nanny does stuff like that too, but I don't think of it as weird.
