I just wanna go on cute dates man I need some wholesome moments Iâ€™m tempted to redownload dating apps but I mustnâ€™t again (yet, unless I wanna try to find the guy in one of my classes) 

I wanna go on a picnic or a little walk or a little museum viewing 

I hate how everything is â€œhang outâ€ and not specific dates Iâ€™m too much of a hopeless romantic:(((
