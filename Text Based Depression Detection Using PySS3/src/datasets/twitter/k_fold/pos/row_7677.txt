I'm not ok I don't want to say why, I don't really know myself, I don't want solutions or help or loving messages or anything, I really couldn't care, Its just nice knowing that your message is being heard, this whole R U OK bs feels like a shallow imitation of actually trying to help, it feels like someone waving their hands at the surface whole I'm drowning deep below and I just want to say that, no, I am not ok I haven't been ok for 5 years.
