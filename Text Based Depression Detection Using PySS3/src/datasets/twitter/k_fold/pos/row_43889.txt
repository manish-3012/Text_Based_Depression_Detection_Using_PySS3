TFW you realise your favourite cartoon character isnâ€™t real I went to Disneyland and went to meet Rapunzel.   
  
But when she posed for a photo with me, she screamed and I looked at her.   
That wasnâ€™t Rapunzel, it was some actress whose real hair was brown and was grabbing her wig off the ground and frantically trying to put it on before I noticed, but I did.  
  
So I ate my cyanide birthday cake which I intended to keep for the day I got dumped.   
Itâ€™s sad I had to eat it in advance, because I was saving it for that day.
