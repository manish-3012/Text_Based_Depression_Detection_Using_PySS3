Why high school art class is bad Art class in elementary and middle school was my favorite subject, but high school art class is trash. I know I'm not alone here, and I find that the reason why is in elementary/middle school art classes they basically give you materials and tell you to do whatever you want. In high school they try to teach you one specific method of drawing one specific thing and that just doesn't work for a lot of people.

Everybody has a unique art style. Good or bad, everyone is different. For me, I prefer to draw with markers in a comic book art style and I only draw when I find something I'm passionate about drawing.
In high school drawing class, they had us doing self porttaits with charcoal. For one thing, I'm ugly as hell. I look like Gollum from lord of the rings. For another, why? Who wants to draw a self portrait? I wanna draw Jesus with a katana riding a shark, god dammit.

I'm short, there's virtually no freedom in high school art classes to have fun. I ended up failing drawing last year because I drew Megatron instead of a glass bottle. Go figure.
