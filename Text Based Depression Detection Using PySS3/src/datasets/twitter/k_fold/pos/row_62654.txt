I am not sure what to do. I have been sleeping a lot more than usual. I went from the regular eight hours - to sleeping for about twenty. This has happened over the last few months. I will sleep for twenty - wake up for four - than go back to bed. 

My room is in the basement. I dread going upstairs. My family is upstairs. All they do is complain, to to drag me down, and force me to rely on them. 

I cannot have a conversation without my mom complaining. She cannot go two minutes without swearing. She cannot go six minutes without complaint about something. Itâ€™s not even about us anymore. My sister is starting to pick up these habits. 

Itâ€™s hard for me to do anything. They always want to do everything for me - and then punish me when I donâ€™t. I had to beg to do my own laundry. What kid wants to do laundry? I know how to cook, but whenever I make anything, I get in sh##. Whatâ€™s a fella to do?

I want to get a job. I canâ€™t for two reasons. I donâ€™t have my drivers. Iâ€™m ready for it - I have my learners, just the car I want to take, the windshield is broken, and we do not have the money to repair it. My dad hasnâ€™t worked in months. They are blowing through savings. He doesnâ€™t want me to work as it makes him look bad - but he has not had any interest to get a job. I cannot get anything/or do anything. I would work for my money, but cannot. 

I havenâ€™t had an interest in relationships. I used to. Now I could give less of a ####. My friends are always talking about girls. I just couldnâ€™t care less. I donâ€™t have an interest to date. I liked this one girl for years, and I did everything to â€œimpressâ€ her, but alas, Iâ€™m still too much of a pussy to do anything. I started eating better, I started working out, I stopped gaming, but I still donâ€™t feel good enough. To be honest I think I am bi, but cannot do anything with that as my parents would shoot me.

I donâ€™t have that good of a relationship with my friends. Iâ€™m really good friends with this one person - we all used to be friends - but now - people only hang around me/talk to me if he is around. One of my good friends, Iâ€™m actually better friends with his younger brother now (one year difference)

I donâ€™t know. Whatâ€™s a fella to do? I might go back to bed. I started playing games again. I wake up, I eat dinner, I have a shower, play games a bit on PS4 with friends (the same people) then go back to bed after brushing my teeth i take excellent care of my teeth btw

What should I do? Iâ€™m bored ðŸ˜
