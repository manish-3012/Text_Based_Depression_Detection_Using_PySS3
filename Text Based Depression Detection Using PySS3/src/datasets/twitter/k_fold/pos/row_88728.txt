Have you ever just randomly decided that your bored enough to become a super villain? Maybe it's just me but after a long day of working I just stare at the ceiling and think "wouldn't it be cool if I took over the world". I'm not sure why exactly this is a recurring thought I have. Even today when I was stressing out because of college applications I was all like "if it doesn't work out, i guess world domination is still on the table". At first I was wondering why my brain just went to the dark side instead of thinking about if I was a superhero or something but then on reflection I realised that being a traditional superhero would be really pointless, Anti heroes are an ok grey area though. Yeah, I dont know where my brain drifts to sometimes. It's a confusing mess up there a lot of the time.
