today I finally broke up with my cheating, lying, manipulative, and mean girlfriend. I told my dad all about and he talked to me and said the decision is mine, tearing eyed , I nodded yes and sent the message, she then said â€œbut I thought we loved each otherâ€¦â€ it was hard to weâ€™ve been together since September 19th 2019 so over a year. Itâ€™s been a crazy year and today is gonna be a crazy day. Itâ€™s hard to think of her as... well not a girlfriend lmao. Iâ€™d say I made the right call. People change i understand but she was so much nicer and stuff when we first met. But now sheâ€™s become so mean and shit. Even cheating on me. But itâ€™s over now. Thank you for reading.
