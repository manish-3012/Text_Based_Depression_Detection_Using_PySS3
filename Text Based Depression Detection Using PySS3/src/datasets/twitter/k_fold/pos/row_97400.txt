I need some advice One of my good friends (lets call him Jefferey) has a sister (lets call her Bee). Me and Bee both like each other and are in a relationship, but I don't think my friend Jefferey really approves or is ok with the relationship between me and Bee. I can tell that something is bothering him but whenever I go up to talk to him and ask him what is wrong he completely ignores me. I don't know what to do because Jefferey has started getting toxic to our friend group and is overall annoying and he won't listen to what I have to say. Do any of you know what I should do?
