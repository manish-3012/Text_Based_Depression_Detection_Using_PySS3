Shouting on the internet is not the answer. Look I don't really care what side of the political spectrum you fall into, but it's really disheartening to see people blindly attacking eachother on the sub (and others ofc). Instead of saying blanket statements calling everyone on the other side idiots or sheep how about we approach this from a mature angle.
Most of us are young people (obviously) but we are supposed to be the future leaders of whatever country we reside in. So why not be better than those that came before us and have so clearly failed? Why not be polite and listen to the concerns of the "other side"? 
I have a feeling that if we actually talk about things we will realize that we aren't so different, and at the end of the day we all just might be on the same side. 

So I ask you, let's have a conversation, let's come to a consensus despite our differences. It is my view that if we want to see any change in our world it should all start with discourse. 

And most of all, be kind.
