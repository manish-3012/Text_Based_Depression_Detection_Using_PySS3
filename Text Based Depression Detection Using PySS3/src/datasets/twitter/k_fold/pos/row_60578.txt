Fuck Chemistry Chemistry can honestly go fuck itself into a hole and die. Why the fuck am I required to learn useless shit that I'll forgot the minute the class ends that achieves nothing but making me HATE chemistry and making me miserable for 4 months?

Is it because we need more Chemists? Because good job, now anyone who couldve been a Chemist fucking hates chemistry! Is it because we'll need this in the modern world? Fuck no, because why the fuck would I need to know Stoichimoetey in my modern fucking day life.

If Chemistry was an optional class that would make sense, but instead it's a god damn requirement? I would bet money half the people keeping it a requirement don't even remember how to fucking do Chemistry...
