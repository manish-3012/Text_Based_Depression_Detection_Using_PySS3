I have a problem that may or may not be bad Idk why but I started to dislike all food except sweet things. My parents tried to take them away but I just stopped eating in general because normal food started to disgust me.

I still eat lunch with my parents and stuff but I feel really sick after eating, It also happens with sweets but less. I don't think its an ED because I eat what I want but It could be a problem lmao.
