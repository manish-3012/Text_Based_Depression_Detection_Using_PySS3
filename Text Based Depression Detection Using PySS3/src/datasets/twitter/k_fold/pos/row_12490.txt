I just want to rant about my boyfriend Okay, so I'm in love with the dude.

He puts up with me when I have mental breakdowns and I spam him. 

When I have my 'cuteness overloads' (as he calls them) he's so sweet and calls me adorable

He's such a softie and he always makes me laugh 

He compliments me and calls me adorable even when I am anything but

He see's me as soon as I wake up and look like shit and still thinks I'm pretty (this just makes me feel so good) 

Had to deal with me googling how to flirt because I got so embarrassed and didn't judge me

Panicked when he made me cry and I started laughing at him

Deals with me flirting with him and panicking

Deals with me crying over books or really random stuff

Plus, he deals with my random outbursts. 

So, I just am in love with him.
