A reminder Please for gods sake don't casually joke about suicide, about depression when you aren't dealing with it

Don't say you have anxiety or OCD just because you get nervous sometimes and like a tidy room, you ruin the chances of those actually struggling being believed.

I'm fucking tired of seeing everyone joke about these things and using words in the wrong context, so please don't.

Also drink some water
