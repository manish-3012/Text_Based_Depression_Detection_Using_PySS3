What are some of the songs you listen to most often One of my favorite things to experience is listening to a song for the first time so I decided why not make a reddit post asking for people's favorite songs. I'll probably make all of these into a playlist to vibe to for a while depending on how many I get. I don't care what music it is wether it be bad parodys or heavy metal, just whatever you like. You could give one song or 10, whatever you feel like giving. Sorry for wasting your time somewhat with this unnecessary long post, although your on reddit so your already wasting your time to a degree anyways
