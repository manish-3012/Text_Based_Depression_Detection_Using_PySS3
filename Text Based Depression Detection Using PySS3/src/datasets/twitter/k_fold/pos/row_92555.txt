I had an epiphany I hate being around my family. I will be happy at school and being productive and the second I get home I just feel this wave of stress come over me. The main contributor to this is my dad because he doesn't understand that's its not 1989 anymore and that I have no friends that live near me. He doesn't understand that I might read more than anyone else in my family because of amount of articles I read on the internet, but apparently those don't count even though while I'm reading those articles I'm actually not only learning about that topic I'm also learning about righting (I want to be a journalist). But my dad isn't the only one who has been making my life hell, because my family in general kind of unbearable. They just don't understand what privacy is and don't care what other people think. It's just hard to live with them.
