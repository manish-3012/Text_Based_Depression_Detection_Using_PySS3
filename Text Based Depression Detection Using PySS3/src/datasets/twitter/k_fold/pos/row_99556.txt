Have you all heard of that racer who became a pornstar and then she just went back to racing, like nothing happened? Let Me Tell You More About It! Yo anyone have any website or something to pirate music? Just curious, because I could try and ask my parents to buy some tracks for me but it's no fun that way.

Need some advice in this, as I've never done this before, and neither have my friends. We usually only pirate games so it would be fun to try something new.

Are there any similarities in pirating games and music. Are there any important differences? Please, do tell!

Also the title is technically true, I think I've seen that before here on Reddit. But it's most definitely inaccurate, that's for sure.
