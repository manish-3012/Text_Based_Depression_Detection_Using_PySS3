Kid in my class thinks her life is a movie Ok, so, I saw a different post on this sub talking about a cringey kid so I thought I would share a cringey kid from my grade. She literally thinks she's in some sort of sitcom. A teacher could say something that's barely a joke and this chick will BUST laughing. It makes everything that's actually funny just plain awkward. She talks as though she's in a highschool musical audition, and everytime someone says something dark, she'll try to go off on them. It doesn't help that she can't say her "R's", but I don't hold her accountable for that since she can't help it. But she somehow makes EVERY situation more awkward than it needs to be. And she's still kinda stuck on the "girls rule, boy drool" elementary schooler phase. It's annoying but everyone in our grade is too nice to tell her.
