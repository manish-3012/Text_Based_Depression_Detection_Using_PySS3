Anyone else feel anxious driving? I'm 17 and I have a huge anxiety of driving. I don't know what it is. A part of me is scared of getting in a crash. I don't want to lose my life or cause a major injury to myself or any passenger. Does anyone have any tips for overcoming these fears? I really want to get driving but I can't bring myself to do it.
