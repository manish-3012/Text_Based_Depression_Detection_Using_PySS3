I have a question about my boyfriend So I noticed my bf follows a meme page on Instagram and most of their post are not even memes, theyre just pictures of half naked girls. I told him it makes me uncomfortable and heâ€™s not really taking me seriously , am I being over the top or am I being reasonable? 
Thank you hehe
