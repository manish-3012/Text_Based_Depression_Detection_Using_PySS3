YOU GUYS WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TODAY FML So I was in a Zoom meeting attending lecture. It was a really boring lecture and no one was paying attention. Since we're not compelled to keep video chat on so sir didn't knew it either. He asked us a question and waited for someone to answer it. Nobody did. It happened once again a few minutes later. Then our Prof. says, from next time we're supposed to keep our video chat on so that he could see who's paying attention and who isn't. My friend then messaged me on private Zoom chat that most of the students are attending lectures without taking a shower or anything and if he saw us like that he's gonna be shocked af. I laughed and replied Same, I'm in bathroom shitting rn XD. But instead of sending it to him, I SENT IT TO PROF. And yes he read it and I was told to leave the meeting. Then he sent that image on our class gc and told me never to send such messages again. Now that fucker is ignoring all of my apologies
