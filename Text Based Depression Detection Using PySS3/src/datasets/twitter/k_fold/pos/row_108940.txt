WB doesn't care if you don't like Amber Heard Ok, this whole celebrity drama is driving me mad. I get that Depp has been abused etc., but do people honestly think that a million of them signing a petiton to remove Amber Heard is going to have impact on the decisions of a multibillion company? Because if so, they are stupid. Honestly, this just screams of naÃ¯vitÃ©. As for those suggesting to boycot the movie if Amber doesn't get fired, A.No significant amount of peopel will do that anyway and B. Even if the movie fails, WB will just forget about the character and work on other movies. So to summurize, we cam do nothing to affect WB and pople should stop wailing about it on the internet. 
Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

P. S. No, I'm not an Amber Heard simp, I get she's the abuser
