The r/teenagers TYPE BEAT community project! hello everyone, it's ya boi....skinny penis-

nahh nah nah, jokes aside. This place has been one of my favorite subs just because it feels like just a bunch of people, not this like fucking elite shitty "redditor" society (sometimes it is tho ngl) and i wanted to do something for the hilarious meme makers, the people sharing their creative talents, the people letting each other know it's all gonna be OK, its all pretty heartwarming at the end of the day when you factor out the bs and trolls. 

as someone who's been really enhancing my production, i wanted to do something for the sub, and something pretty cool. 

A public sample pool!

essentially, go comment a track you would love to see sampled in a beat. whether it's an old R&amp;B song, a Legend of Zelda song, a Marvel fighting skit, i'll do my best to check it out and see if I should use or incorporate it.  I'm planning a beat switch in it too so if you see me confirming a sample in the comments that's way different then your recommendation don't fret! 

So go! Leave an idea, question, hate message, anything!!! see ya!
