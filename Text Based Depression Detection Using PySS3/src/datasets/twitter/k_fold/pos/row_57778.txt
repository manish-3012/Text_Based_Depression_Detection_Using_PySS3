Man, fuck my 'friends' part 2 If you haven't already, go and read my other post that has the title Man, fuck my 'friends', so you now what's going on.


At last, while I was arguing with them finally another friend was like " he just didn't go out one fucking time stop already it's not nice".
While I'm happy for that, bc some other things happened too they said that we would all meet up on the weekend. One of my 'friends' said that he didn't want any friendships to be destroyed but like 10 minutes after in a group call he was saying that I said things that I didn't and he was making fun of me.
You don't want any friendships to be ruined but then you proceed to be an asshole, yeah ok
