Be Careful Iâ€™ve been struggling with my pornography addiction. I havenâ€™t been able to go a day without it. I want to quit, and Iâ€™m trying my best.

Be careful out there. I know many of you will ignore this, but moderation is key. Porn, drugs, etc. are all very slippery slopes, and you only realize your addicted when it is to late.

No one told me that porn was something I could get addicted to. Iâ€™m pretty sure that said that it was healthy (they probably meant in moderation), but it is addicting.
