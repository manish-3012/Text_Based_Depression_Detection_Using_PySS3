Why tf does cherry limeade have to be so good? Like DAMN, we pick some up at the store, I drink it all in like 2-3 days, I go into withdrawal where all I can think about is how nothing compares to cherry limeade, then I forget about it until we pick more cherry limeade up the next week at the store and the cycle starts all over again.
