Forgive me if I sound very weird, but does anyone have a time on the clock?? Like a time that's 'cursed'?? Every now and then, I look at the time on the clock. I seem to have a 'cursed' time, which is 9:12, AM or PM. I don't know why. I look at the time at random and the time is 9:12. It's crazy because 9:12 is on the clock twice per day, AM and PM. I must be insane.

I made this post just now because a few minutes ago my mom just asked me the time and I said with surprise 9:12 PM. Does anyone else have a 'cursed' time like I do, or am I just some crazy ass motherfucker??
