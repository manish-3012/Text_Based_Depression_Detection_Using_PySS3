My girlfriends parents donâ€™t like me They used to until I asked my girlfriend if she could not talk to a guy cause he is really mean and also her ex and so I didnâ€™t feel comfortable with them being friends cause it was affecting her mental health, but her extreme controlling parents decided that Iâ€™m banned from talking to her because they call me controlling when they are the most controlling people Iâ€™ve ever met and like both me and her donâ€™t want to leave each other but I donâ€™t really know what to do cause I wish I could apologize to her parents even though they were eavesdropping on us but I just donâ€™t want them to hate me and I donâ€™t want to lose this girl. I just donâ€™t feel great right now so I could use some encouragement or advice if anybody has any. Thanks in advance yâ€™all.
