I don't know why people complain about other people's physical preferences. Like if you're a guy and you don't like chubby girls (I'm chubby myself, so no fatphobia here), cool. That's your preference. I don't know why people get mad about that. And if you're a girl and you don't like short guys, cool. That's your preference. I don't know why people spend time complaining about these things when they could just go find someone that DOES appreciate them. It's kinda dumb.
