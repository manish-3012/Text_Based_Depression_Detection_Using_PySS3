wtf the moon is orange so... its 5am, just got out of the bathroom. went to grab a snack from the kitchen, wich is separated from my house, and then boom. a completely clean sky with only the moon in a deep orange tint, staring back at me with a shineless glow. that shit scared me. only didnt took a photo cuz my phone's cam is shitty.
