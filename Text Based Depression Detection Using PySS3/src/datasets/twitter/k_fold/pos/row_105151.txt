my dreams are full of what's not real There's banging on the wall  
It's 5 a.m., I've got no sleep at all  
Just thoughts of how  
I might struggle through tomorrow  
Too much time in one day  
Too much time to occupy  
With boring thoughts  
And boring moods  
And boring bedtimes  
Won't tell a single soul that my soul's gone  
It's hard to write this song  
It's all a joke
