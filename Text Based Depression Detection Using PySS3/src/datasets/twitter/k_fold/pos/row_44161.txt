Iâ€™ve been thinking about this and havenâ€™t told anyone about their reaction to when I told them. If weâ€™re friends, please donâ€™t read this. Thanks. 

Also ps, donâ€™t ask me if I want help. 

Why was that their reaction to what I told them? Why did they say a â€œleast you know nowâ€? Of course I knew. Of course I fucking knew. You didnâ€™t even try to make me feel better or anything. I know thatâ€™s not your job, I know that, but we were friends, and after that happened, Iâ€™d just expect a friend to try to get me to feel better. You acted like I was overreacting. I said I wasnâ€™t going to school tomorrow and you acted like I was being overdramatic. One of the first things you said was (put simply) â€œwhy would he want photos of you there isnâ€™t much there, right?â€ Im sorry I donâ€™t know what was going on in the pedophiles head. Why would you say that? Iâ€™ve not stopped thinking about that. Also, I donâ€™t think you knew that I hadnâ€™t sent anybody any pictures before him. I was planning on waiting until I wasnâ€™t a fucking kid. 

I hope to god you donâ€™t see this, I would feel terrible and chances are, you wonâ€™t.
