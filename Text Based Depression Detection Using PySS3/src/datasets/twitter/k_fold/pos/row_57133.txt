I just found a friend from discord from months ago! I'm so happy! This has made my day 100 times better! I almost didn't recognize them but I saw their post while sorting through new advertising free art, and I decided I was gonna pop in. Turns out that it was a friend on discord that I had lost contact with at least three months ago! Yay!!!
