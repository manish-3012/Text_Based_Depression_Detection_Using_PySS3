I feel like I missed out on some major teen things. Like I watch these movies and shows about what teens are like apparently and they all party and drink and have friends. I donâ€™t have a friend group. I donâ€™t really have friends. Ive never been to a party. I donâ€™t really like alcohol or anything like that. Never had a proper boyfriend. Iâ€™ve never had a sleepover. Iâ€™ve never hung out with friends because once again I donâ€™t have them. You ever watch a movie and thereâ€™s that one nerdy girl with braces that stays home and studies on Friday nights. Yeah that girl is me. Idk, I just feel like I kinda missed out on being a teenager and it kinda sucks. I donâ€™t have cool stories to tell or any real memories worth remembering.
