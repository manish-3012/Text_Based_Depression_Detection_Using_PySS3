We need world peace, and it shouldn't be that hard to get. If individual countries would forget their own "self-interest", then we would be able to get along with each other. It's so frustrating that there are so many man made issues in the world, such as political oppression, economic disparity, and discrimination. We, as the teenagers of the world, should resolve to work towards a more cooperative human future.
