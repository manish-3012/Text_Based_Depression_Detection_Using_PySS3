How should I talk to my parents and tell them that I think I have anxiety? I have a previous post explaining how I think I could have anxiety if you want to read that, but tl;dr: I started to feel anxious around last summer, it has seemed to have only gotten worse over the almost half year since then, and I canâ€™t tel for sure if I even have it. 

Iâ€™ve taken a few online tests and they all say it could be moderate anxiety but I donâ€™t know if I trust myself to say for sure that I do. But I want to tell my parents anyway so that maybe I can get some help. 

My amazing gf has been there to support me for months now and sheâ€™s the one who convinced me to tell them, and she uses Reddit so if youâ€™re reading this, thank you and I love you! (She knows who she is lol)

The problem is I donâ€™t know the right time or the right way to tell them. I came clean to them about a porn addiction a few weeks ago and my father didnâ€™t really seem to understand, and when I told them I hated myself his response was â€œI donâ€™t think you need to go that farâ€, so Iâ€™m not sure if I should just tell my mom and let them talk or what. 

Iâ€™d love to hear any advice or answer any questions about things I certainly left out.
