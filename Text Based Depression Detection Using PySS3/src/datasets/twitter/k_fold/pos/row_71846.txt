If you were to rob a bank what vehicle(s) would you use Your vehicles are, off-road, truck, hidden speed, joe shmo, and anything else. For off-road I would go with the Jeep Wrangler 392 because HEMI! And the Dodge TRX because it's awesome. For trucks it would be the second gen Ford SVT Lighting for supercharged POWER! And handling capabilities, but I would also go with the Ram SRT-10 because it had the V-10 from the viper and set the world fastest production truck record for speed(158 MPH). Fourth gen Ford Taurus Sho, 365 horsepower twin turbocharged all wheel drive power, my uncle drove it at the for Ford oval ring and he said it was bada**. Chevy  SS because 415 horsepower from a 6.2L V8, rear wheel drive and 6-speed manual, what more could you need. Chevy Cobalt SS TC since it set a production front wheel drive cars at the nurburgring. Pontiac GTO because 5.7L V8. For joe shmo, crown vic. Now for some honorable mentions, GMC syclone/Typhoon since it beat a Ferrari to 0-60. Chevy 454 SS because Chevy big block. Pontiac Bonnevile SSei, it's supercharged engine has enough power to be fast but not enough to go under speed. Buick Regal GS, because supercharged. I'm sure I'm for getting some but I would love to hear your picks
