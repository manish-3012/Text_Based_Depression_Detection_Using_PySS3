The condom pokeball has been found I have a plastic pokeball that opens up when you press the center of it, and its the thing that I store condoms in. I have it hidden away in a very high shelf in my closet. Its so high up that you can't even see the pokeball from just standing under it, and seeing as I'm taller than my mom, and I have trouble reaching it, I thought thered be no way it would ever be found...

Fast forward to Christmas eve night, my dad is driving me back home to my moms, and I go upstairs to see that my mom had cleaned my room for me as like an early chirstmas present. It didn't occur to me that the pokeball could be compromised until Christmas morning when I woke up and had my terrifying revelation. I ran over to check on it, and sure enough it was wide open with the condoms all there, some had even spilled out. My mom hasnt brought it up, and I hope to God she doesn't.
