Blocked a person from my secondary school Basically, i met this friend in my final year, me and him were on.. reasonable terms. Like, we weren't amazing friends, but we were sorta.. say hi to each other in the hallway friends. He was an incredibly weird kid. He used to hiss at people, talk about his sonic OC loudly, etc. Also, he had no educational goals at all. He said he hated school all the time, sad that he never got good grades, but he never revised. 

Me and him used to be reasonable, but soon i just kinda got sick of him, he constantly complained to me about how bad his life was, literally every conversation had to be about him. 

I was sick of him. So, i cut contact with him after we left school, i regret it slightly because i feel like a dickhead, but i enjoy the peace of him not spamming me with shitty memes. 

(I did forget to block his old acccount, that i thought he didn't use, so i got a message from him saying "why did you block me" but i blocked that too.) 

i hope he has a good life, but i really just can't see us being friends outside of school. I feel like an awful person about it sometimes, but i just want to get this off my chest.
