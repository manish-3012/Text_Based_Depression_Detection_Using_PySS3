Just had my first d&amp;d session today The half-orc fighter is trying to act like a bard the rouge was belligerently drunk the dryad understands nothing and my ranger can't act normally 

In the introduction the half-orc f*ked the rouge my ranger silence a whole bar screaming WHO THE HELL IS TALKING ABOUT THE VOICES and the half orc replied by breaking the door of the room he was in


Then I rolled a nat 20 during my first attack during my first battle and split a flying sword

Oh we also call our group the forest inquisition
