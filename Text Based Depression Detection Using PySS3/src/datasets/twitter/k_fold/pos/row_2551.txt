Girls are confusing Like the girls is Iâ€™m talking with is pretty busy but when we try to hang out but something comes up she tries to reschedule. 

And when we first started talking she became my #2 bf on snap in like a week so we snapped a lot. And I asked if she would want to try and date even though we got a busy schedule (I asked Wednesday this week).

But now we never snap I suggested that we maybe ft, she didnâ€™t respond and Iâ€™m just so confused and I donâ€™t want to confront her about it cause I donâ€™t want to come of as the unconfident guy whoâ€™s like clingy

So what should I try?
