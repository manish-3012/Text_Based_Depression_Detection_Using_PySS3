Hey. I have a question. Years into the future when being gay or queer is normal, are like pride parades and stuff like that, are they going to stop? Because they are suppose to celebrate self acceptance, legal rights, and pride for your sexuality right? 

Is there going to be a time in the future where celebrating that your gay is going to be treated the same as celebrating that your straight? There's no straight pride because they aren't being targeted and aren't oppressed right? So in the future would having pride parades be weird since it would probably be accepted in the future?

Im sorry if this doesn't make sense. Im trying to write what Im thinking but I don't know if I put ot the right way.
