Ned help escaping going to the beach whiles at my grandma's So basically I am at my grandma's, she lives near a beach that my mom really likes but I don't like beaches and don't judge please, everyone and their own likes and dislikes. I need to know a good way to escape, I tried bargening, being sick and even be annoying but nothing. Any help?
