I feel like absolute garbage right now. I am in the JROTC program in my school, and am also in the drill team. Within the drill team Iâ€™m on the sabre team. I just got to practice a while ago and find out I got removed from the routine. I spent the entire drill year working on that routine, only to get replaced BY THE SORRIEST EXCUSE OF A HUMAN BEING IVE EVER SEEN!!!! This hoe of a cadet ruined one of my favorite things in school. The worst part is, my sergeant told my commander to remove me. MY SERGEANT!! I am now sitting in a storage closet bawling my eyes out.
