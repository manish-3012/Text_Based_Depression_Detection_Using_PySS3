Remembering embarrassing things: Log 2 It was my sisterâ€™s 16th birthday and we were going to a Kali Uchis concert on schoool night with her friends. There was a free meet and greet beforehand. One of her friends couldnâ€™t make it so I was to stand in line with the missing friendâ€™s notebook to get it signed. Itâ€™s my turn and Kali fucking Uchis asks me for my name. I say MY name. And she begins writing. So Iâ€™m like- â€œoH, this is for another personâ€ and she asked for the name so I spell out the name and by the end of the signing all three of our names are on the notebook, with â€œtogether foreverâ€ and a bunch of hearts. I take the notebook and skidaddle outta there.

TLDR: I filled in for my sisterâ€™s friend to get their notebook signed at a meet and greet with Kali Uchis, said my own name, she began writing it, had to correct her. Theme of the story: I never fail to fuck up ðŸ¥²
