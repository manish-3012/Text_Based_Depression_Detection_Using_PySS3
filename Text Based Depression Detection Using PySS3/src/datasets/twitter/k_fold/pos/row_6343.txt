I need an advice Sooo i know this girl for a while and i really like her. We spent a lot of time together and i think she kinda likes me too, we talk a lot, she gifted me one of her rings (i wasnt even asking for it).
So i decided to be a little closer with her and when we were sitting on a bench i moved really close to her and she did the same thing. So i need an advice: should i try to hold her hand, and if you think so - how should i do it. Like i said, i think she likes me too but im too afraid to mess up.
