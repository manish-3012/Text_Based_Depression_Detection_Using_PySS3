Panicing over school I'm starting school tommorow. I am scared shitless. I haven't done anything over the quarantine and have done only 2 homeworks, both because the work was really stressing me out. I have no idea what I should do. I'm gonna try and go to sleep but I'm too anxious.
I'm absolutely doomed.
