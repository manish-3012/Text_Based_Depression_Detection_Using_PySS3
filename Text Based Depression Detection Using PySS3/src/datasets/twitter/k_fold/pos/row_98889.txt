I Have A Crush On My Ex From 3 Years Ago. 3 And A Half Years Ago, She Asked Me Out (She Was 12 And I Was 11). I Said Yes But Then She Went To A Different School Not That Far Away But Since We Practically Didn't See Each Other, She BRoke Up With Me. Fast Forward To Last Year, We Start Hanging Out Again Because We Go To The Same High School (I Don't Have Middle School Were I Live). Then This Year, We Still Hang Out And Then I Realised "Oh Shit, I Have A Crush On Her" (I'm Now 13 And She's 14)
