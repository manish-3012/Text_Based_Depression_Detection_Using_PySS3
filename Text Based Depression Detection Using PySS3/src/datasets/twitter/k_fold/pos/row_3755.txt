somethings I just donâ€™t get now I donâ€™t think the republicans should be trying to get into wherever the senate is but why is this all over the news? I get itâ€™s bad and should be on the news but when BLM burnt down whole cities it was barely on the news. now I donâ€™t completely agree with Republicans doing what they are doing but this is showing how biased the media is. yes this is a big deal and it is getting a big deal made out of but when other leftist type protests happened that became violent news channels pretty much ignored it. downvote me idgaf but Iâ€™m right
