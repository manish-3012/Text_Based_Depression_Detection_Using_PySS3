I might have to do a school project on a mobile game. Alright so I have to make a how to video for my class on something I'm good at and I'm not trying to sound like I'm depressed when I say I'm not really that good at anything. The only things I can think of is gaming and since I really only play games with guns and this is for school, I might do it on a mobile game. Please please give me suggestions cause I'm not turning in a project on "Dragon ball z dokkan battle" and being happy with it.
