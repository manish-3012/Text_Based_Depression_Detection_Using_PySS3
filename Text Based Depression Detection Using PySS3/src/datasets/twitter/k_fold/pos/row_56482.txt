A Japanese person messaged me on twitter asking me to be friends For one, why me of all people, of the 80 accounts I follow 2 are Japanese and I never interact with them

For two, idk what to do because on one hand they seem nice but I also don't usually like making friends on social media like that. It could also be spam but there's no indication of that.
