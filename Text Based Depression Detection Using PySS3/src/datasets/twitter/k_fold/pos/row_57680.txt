Two Sams walk into a classroom (story) TLDR: &gt;!My classmate is also named Sam, and he answered twice when the teacher called on everyone asking for personal fun facts, so now the teacher thinks I love tennis.!&lt;

I have another Sam in my history class, and his last name comes before mine. The teacher (lets say Mr. T) coached the golf team I was on last year so he kinda knows me, but being a redditor and all I am a socially awkward fuck. Mr. T was going around asking each student for a fun fact about themself, so I assumed the other Sam would answer before me since it was alphabetical, just like attendance. The other Sam was on the same wavelength being kinda like me socially, though we arenâ€™t good friends. 

Mr. T calls on Sam, so the other Sam unmutes and says he likes tennis, and names some random tennis player. Mr. T seems impressed with his knowledge and continues calling on students. The whole time Iâ€™m running through what Iâ€™m gonna say in my head, stressing and sweating about it. 

Then, he calls out the other Samâ€™s last name. I freeze, wondering if I should correct Mr. T and say my fun fact or keep my mouth shut. I decide the latter, not wanting to talk or deal with internet latency. The other Sam unmutes and says he already answered, but the call kinda breaks up and Mr. T repeats his question, asking for a fun fact. The other Sam gives up and says how he likes snowboarding. 

The calling continues. After he finishes calling on everyone, the bell rings and we hang up. Great. I have successfully avoided speaking in class resulting in my teacher thinking I am a tennis nerd. Now Iâ€™m gonna have to correct him randomly in the upcoming months if he asks about my tennis career that I donâ€™t have. Fuck.
At least I know to respond if he calls on Sam...
