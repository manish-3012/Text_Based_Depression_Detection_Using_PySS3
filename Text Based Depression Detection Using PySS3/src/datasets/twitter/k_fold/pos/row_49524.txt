I'm going to confess to my crush in a few hours I'm fucking terrified.

It's a mutual friends birthday today and we're celebrating after school today, as it ends early. There's going to be a bit of alcohol involved, to hopefully make it easier for me to cope.

Her and I have already been planning to go eat out today, so I'm gonna do it then.

Wish me luck everyone!
