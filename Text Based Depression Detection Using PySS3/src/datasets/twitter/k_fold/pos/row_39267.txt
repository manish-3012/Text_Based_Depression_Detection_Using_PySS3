How to motivate lose some weight over extended periods of time? Hey I have tried losing weight on several occasions, exercise, cutting unhealthy crap, jogging, etc... but I have accomplished nothing. I am medically overweight (not obese, just overweight) but I am sick of this. I donâ€™t have a extremely unhealthy lifestyle. I donâ€™t even eat a lot (to be fair, what I eat is mostly trash because thatâ€™s what my parents eat) and I walk usually about an hour a day. Any tips? And please, for the love of all that is holy, donâ€™t give me any of that â€œlove yourselfâ€ shit. Iâ€™m fat. Please just give me some help.
