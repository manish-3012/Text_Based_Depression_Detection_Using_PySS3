How do you respond to â€œheyâ€ on sc I just added a guy whoâ€™s like a friend of a friend and he just sent â€œheyâ€ without anything else.

Iâ€™m probably over thinking this but Iâ€™d feel bad if he felt bad to be left on opened but I donâ€™t know him too well 

And also heâ€™s probably not hitting on me bc we barely know each other and I havenâ€™t posted anything on my story
