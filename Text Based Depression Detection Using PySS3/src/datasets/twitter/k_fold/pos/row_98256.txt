A TIP FOR ANY PARENTS/FUTER PARENTS Do NOT tell your kid that they are a good singer if they are not actually. this could result in them believing they are, and joining a school talent show, resulting in them getting bullied for their voice.

instead, tell them to practice or show their voice on video so they can estimate them self instead up putting them self up there.
