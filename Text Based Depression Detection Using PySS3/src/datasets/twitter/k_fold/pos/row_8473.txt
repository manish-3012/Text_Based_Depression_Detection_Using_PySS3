Right now my nephew is full on crying. Because he wanted to bite me and I wouldn't let him, he said he'll bite me and at first I thought he was joking and went along with it. NOT FUN. He clamped on the side of my palm/ hand with force that I didn't know 4 year olds have. And wouldn't let go. Like for a whole 20 seconds I had to tickle his armpits hard to make him let go lol if I can post pics I'd show the bite mark lil dude left, biting the F outta me lol. For the  Next 10 minutes he ran after me. Trying to bite me. Full on baby zombie mode. Very cute and a lil scary cuz Halloween. But yea. Hes actually after me. Like hell bent on getting a piece of meat off me. I'm on the sofa. He gets yelled at. Starts whining and *hops on the sofa still listening to his mom* complains a little and moves behind me. Idk if he lunged at me first or if I jumped off the sofa first but legit seemed like it happened at the same time. He went for neck lol. His mom yells at him. He starts crying. I go pick him up to comfort him cuz.... Ya know.  he's crying.  As soon as it hits me. This ðŸ’ goes for my jugular, ur not as quick little grasshopper.
