My friend group is the most chaotic thing to exist. Like we where all going for icecream and it breaks into utter chaos. We end up going back to our school to hang out and then end up like 30 minutes from our houses just because we where so deep into a conversation. Then we go and call our exes cunts when we see them walking all while making jokes about stuff like the giant horse. conch. What a day.
