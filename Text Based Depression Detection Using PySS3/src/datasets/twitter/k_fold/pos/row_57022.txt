I feel bad for all the people that have looked up to me Iâ€™ve literally disappointed so many people. Like they see me and get to know my good side and start look up to me, and eventually I slip up and they see my real motivations behind actions, or my goals, and how much of a shitty person I actually am

Like I had a best friend who always looked up to me, and we had been friends for a year, and I always have him girl advice, and eventually he landed this 10/10 girl, and I fucking stole her without realizing, I was friends with her and something happened, but over a few months I accidentally split them apart, and got with her, and even lost my virginity to her

I felt so fucking bad because he looked up to me so much, and I betrayed him, sometimes I realize how fucking terrible I am. And hell I barely dated her for 3 months, I ended a couple year long friendship for a 3 month relationship 

Wow

Ignore this please ðŸ˜ƒ
