My friend attemped suicide last night I was taking my online classes and I noticed a hangouts message from a friend of mine since we were kids and he told me he was going to hang himself and that he wanted to thank me for being his friend. 

I was so scared my hands were shaking I could barely even write. I just kept looking at the picture of the noose over and over feeling sick. Eventually I just left my zoom call and went and told my parents. 

They sorted everything out and heâ€™s okay now but please if any of you are considering ever taking your life donâ€™t. Please. 

His one text caused me so much pain and trauma. I cried for almost an hour because of it. I didnâ€™t know if he was dead or alive or dying as I was sitting there. 

Please just appreciate yourself. Donâ€™t do this. You think youâ€™re getting rid of the pain but really youâ€™re just passing it on to others. Please stay safe and donâ€™t try anything dumb in a rush of emotions. You donâ€™t know how much you can hurt people even when youâ€™re dead.
