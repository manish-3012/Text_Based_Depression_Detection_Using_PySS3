Is it normal to leave absolutely EVERYTHING till last minute? My procrastination levels are so high itâ€™s really bringing down my grades. I feel like almost everyone procrastinates work but idk I get to the point where I leave it till the last 30 minutes to get an essay done and then I remember that the teacher normally asks for homework after the class, so I procrastinate more and leave the essay for future me to do secretly in the lesson. I also procrastinate watching my fave shows, buying something I need online, showering. I even procrastinate things like getting up from a chair. Iâ€™ll sit there for a while and in my head Iâ€™ll be yelling at myself to get up while I sit there, not moving because I know I can have a few more seconds of sitting down before I have to get up. 
As some background, Iâ€™ve never seen a doctor about mental health so I havenâ€™t been diagnosed with anything. Iâ€™m honestly too scared to because this might be a thing that happens to everyone and Iâ€™m just being dramatic yk? Does anyone else experience this? Did you find a reason behind this and how are you managing it?
