Just a rant about getting teary eyed when feeling helpless I really hate how I get immediately teary eyed when I feel slightly helpless, its been going on for years now and no matter how much I try I just cant get rid of the habit.

Earlier, I couldnt hear anything my teacher was saying cause zoom kinda sucks on my tablet, and I wanted to cry in frustration. That was just a minor inconvenience.

Sometimes it feels so nice to just be able to turn of the waterworks in my eyes and do the rational thing instead of hopelessly panicking.
