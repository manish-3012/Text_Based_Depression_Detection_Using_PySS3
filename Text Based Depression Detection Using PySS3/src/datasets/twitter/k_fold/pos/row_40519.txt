Reviewing every Dutch episode of Pat and Mat #1 So in the dutch version they have voices and I don't think they have that in other countries

In the first episode they both don't have their hats and they talk very weirdly (especially Mat), other than that it's a classic but is tbh not good at all. They spill some water and they try to cut an egg but they fail miserably.

Overall rating: 6/10
