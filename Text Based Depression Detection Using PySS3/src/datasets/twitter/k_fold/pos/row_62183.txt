Seniority fucking sucks So today I found out that Iâ€™m not the starting kicker on the football team because Iâ€™m a sophomore and the other kickerâ€™s a junior. Iâ€™m easily kicking 40-45 yarders and heâ€™s the same and kick off wise weâ€™re even, but the only reason heâ€™s starting over me is because heâ€™s older. This is some bullshit. Iâ€™m already getting looks from colleges and heâ€™s being looked at by no one. Fucking stupid.
