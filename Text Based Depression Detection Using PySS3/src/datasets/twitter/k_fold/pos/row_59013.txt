I want to start a twitch stream to help raise money, but I have no idea how to get set up. I am trying to raise some money to buy some ancient artifacts, Iâ€™m a history buff. I set up a GoFundMe but Iâ€™m trash at trying to get people to give. I think this is the next best thing that I can do. Any and all advise would be awesome!
