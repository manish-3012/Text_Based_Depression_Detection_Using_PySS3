I have a not so common school problem I have a form of cystitis that has been going for a long period of time. Thanks to lockdown and summer vacation I mostly recovered. Only when I was in anxious situation that feeling, that urge to go to the bathroom triggered. I didn't mind it, but school started. I can't stay even 5 minutes in the class. I have been taking meds for a month now, feeling better. I am very afraid of it repeating. I have new classmates, what if they laugh or get angry at me for disturbing the lesson.? What if my old colleagues will do the same? I can't concentrate, I can't listen, am like bricked. I should study as I am in 10th grade and exams are near. Maybe you could tell me guys what's wrong, because I couldn't figure it out since it all started, 6 months ago...
