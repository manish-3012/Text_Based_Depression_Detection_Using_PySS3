How do you people make it to hot with text posts? With images and videos I feel it's much easier, but with text posts, how do you do it? I've only seen one text post which was in hot, which I genuinely thought deserved to be there. It was a post about a guy saying he was horny and then fucking and cuming in a block of cheese. It's also much harder to do funny shitposts with text.
