a girl sat on my lap in late 6th grade, a girl transferred to my school, lets call her Lara. it was very clear she was a bit older and very mature (tall, kinda busty if thatâ€™s the right word). she dove into the middle school dating game and literally â€œwent outâ€ with every single boy in the 6th grade. now this is when we started diving into the concept of sex and that kind of thing. there were rumors circling that whoever dated her got to â€œdo itâ€. me being a naive 12 year old i didnâ€™t know what they were talking about. now i was in 6th grade choir because it was easy and i was exploring interests. we had to sit close together in chorus because every class was jammed together and we had to share seats. one of her friends sat next to me and the girl goes â€œhey Lara come sit over hereâ€ and iâ€™m thinking â€œthereâ€™s not enough room.â€ she goes over, seeing thereâ€™s no room, so the girl goes â€œjust sit on my lap itâ€™s fineâ€ and iâ€™m like ok problem solved. she sits, but **half her ass is on my lap**. SO IM SITTING THERE, HALF A GIRLS ASS ON MY LAP, RED AS A BEET. the class was full of girls and they were laughing hysterically. i was downright embarrassed, but now i look back on it and iâ€™m like â€œdamn a girl sat on meâ€.

TL;DR A girl sat on my lap and people laughed
