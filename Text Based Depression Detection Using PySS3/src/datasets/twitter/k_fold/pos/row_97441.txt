I just want to stop school I am exhausted, I know that I can't stop school but I am tired, I'm trying, I work all day and I still have bad grade I ear my classmate talking to each over "I din't study","I just read once" and they all have good grade, it's not fucking fare, I try my best to do my homeworks and learn my lesson but I still have one of the worst grade in my class (and the actual worst grade in german, fuck) and I'm just exhausted.

I will not stop scholl, I don't want to end up with a shorty job but I'm just so anxious about my grade, how the fuck am I suppose to graduate high school, and what about college
