I don't know if I'll last the year34m US resident living with Ulcerative Colitis here. The overwhelming nightmare that is our president, combined with the growing possibility of losing my healthcare terrifies me. Oh and it's a fucking election year.

I'm due for colonoscopy this year, and all I can think is "please let it be cancer." I can't stand living in a country where nearly half the population wants to kill the healthcare system that enables me to afford my medication that keeps me alive. 

I don't feel like anyone really understands how painful this anxiety really is. I'm honestly not bothered by an early death at this point, if only so I don't have to watch this world get even more fucked by the day.

I'm not going to kill myself tonight. I don't know if I'll ever kill myself. But I would gladly go to the nearest state with a right-to-die law on the books if I were to get a terminal diagnosis. Need help.
