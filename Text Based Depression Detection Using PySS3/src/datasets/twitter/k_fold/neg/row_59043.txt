Does anybody else just know they will die by suicide but arenâ€™t rushing to it?Itâ€™s so weird. I feel like I just KNOW I will kill myself at one point but I just donâ€™t know when. Iâ€™m 21 and still in college but Iâ€™ve felt this for awhile. I have been depressed my whole life. I used to be a sad kid and I didnâ€™t know why. My home life was good and I would say, I am a very normal person, but  Iâ€™ve always felt this bad. When I was 14 I tried to kill myself twice. Iâ€™ve refused pills my whole life, even after being hospitalized because I canâ€™t imagine my brain any different. I was born sad. Iâ€™ve traveled to many different countries, I have a supportive and well off family, I have a wonderful boyfriend but I still donâ€™t feel good. I never feel good. I never have but I feel like I canâ€™t do anything because I DO have  those things. I feel if I ever went to talk to somebody they would say â€œyou have a great life, why are you sadâ€ and that makes me feel guilty. Iâ€™ve never even had anybody around me die before. I donâ€™t know grief, heartache, being poor so why am I like not his? Why am I empty even thought I gave everything? Wasted life
