FUCK I'm depressed right nowMy life isn't great, by any means.  I'm struggling to get by, yada yada yada.  But I'm usually a bright-eyed optimist, glass half full, no worries kind of prick.  I'm living my dream in the city where I've always wanted to be.  However, My problem is lifelong and recurring perpetually.  I've lost a lot a lot of friends and family.  Sigh.  I hate to say it, but this was the one; something I WILL NEVER get over.  I'll just goddamn come out and say it.  FUCK.  My best friend fucking committed suicide and its not something I can explain away.  I can't tell people and make them understand how deep a hurt that is!  It was totally complicated and a fuck of a LONG time ago, but even still the simplest, most insignificant bullshit will still set me off.  I'm crying, no, weeping and gnashing my teeth and tearing my hair out RIGHT NOW.  This was so fucking long ago, how have I not dealt with this enough to fucking control myself?
