I wish I could die and nobody remembers me.I donâ€™t want anyone to come to my funeral. I donâ€™t even want my photos to be displayed. I would actually go through with it if it didnâ€™t hurt my family, the fact that they will have to walk in to find my lifeless body is what makes me want to stay alive, I donâ€™t want them to cry over me. Iâ€™m so sorry mom and dad, Iâ€™m a terrible daughter.
