i feel likemy life is going back to shit. i was living the dream. i gained back my self love, my true self, after going through some funk. i spent time with my favorite people, called friends everday, tried new things. i was working on myself. then i met this girl who, in the short span of five fucking days, ruined me. my best friend of 2 years. gone. i cant talk to friends anymore. every second is spent talking to her. im scared she'll kill herself if i break up with her. i feel like shit because part of me feels like im trying to be a victim. i feel like im wrongly painting her as a bad guy. i feel stupid for getting so stressed about this. one problem hits and the rest i've yet to even think about haunt me. now its not just one problem stressing me but them all. i wasnt even stressed about anything before. i feel horrible. i feel stupid.
