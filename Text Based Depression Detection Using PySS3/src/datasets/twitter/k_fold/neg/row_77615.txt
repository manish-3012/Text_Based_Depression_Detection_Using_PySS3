I'm so tired of hurting peopleI'm tired of hurting the people I love. My friends and family have given me so much support over the years, but as of recent they've become fed up with my callous and cold attitude that has developed because of my depression and anger issues. I've said and done horrible things to them over and over and they're sick of it. I've apologized to all of them the best I know how, but they really don't want anything to do with me. I've tried so hard to change, but it feels like I'm fighting a losing battle. I've thought about suicide in the past, but I've never considered it this heavily because now I'm all alone and it's my own damn fault. 
I know if I were to die by my own hands it would end up hurting them again, but at least it'd be the last time I would hurt anyone....
