Ex killed herself after we broke up.We had been arguing a lot and I told her if it doesn't stop were done. Well it didn't stop it was almost daily so I had enough and told her I'm done. I tell her not to come over she does anyways long story short she locks me out then let's me back in 20 mins later and just takes off without saying a word. I'm just assuming ok she's fine she's accepted the breakup. She comes back 20 minutes later and I hear a pop go off outside and fear the worst. She had shot herself in the head in my front yard directly facing the front door. I run out and hold her head and stare into her suffering dying eyes.... I feel like a piece of shit and wish it would've happened differently but my real question is why did she do it where I had to see? Did she want it to mess with my head like it is? Or did she just want to see how my face looked? Did she want to hurt me emotionally by making me watch her die? If I was gonna kill myself because of a break up I would go somewhere nice and peaceful to die not just at my exes front yard....I'm messed up and can't stop thinking about her and wish it would've gone differently. I don't wanna date her because all the fighting but I don't want her dead but can't do anything about that now......
