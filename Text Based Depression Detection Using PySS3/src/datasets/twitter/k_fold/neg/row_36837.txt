I'm honestly kind of done with lifeI'm turning 19 soon and I feel so useless and I haven't accomplished anything. I spent most of my summer applying for jobs and none of them got back to me. I'm not even sure if I want to continue with my major mostly because I don't care. I don't care about anything. It's all pointless. My boyfriend has been trying to keep me afloat but I don't want to drag him down with me. He's the only one who truly cares and I should be desperately trying to hold on to that but I'm not because what's the point? I feel like I'm only living for him just because I don't want to make him sad but that's stupid. I went through so much shit and I just want it all to stop. I've given up on trying to find meaning to life and I'm just going through each day feeling either numb or angry. I don't know what to do anymore. I just made this post because this is the lowest I've ever felt and I don't want to bother the few people I can talk to about this since they have bigger things to worry about....
