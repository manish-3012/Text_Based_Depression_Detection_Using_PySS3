Everyone will be better off without meI donâ€™t contribute anything to anyone Iâ€™m basically a nuisance to everyone I know. The girl I love hates me and will never come back into my life and Iâ€™m a constant disappointment to my family. My friends avoid me and my job sucks ass. Iâ€™m supposed to be having fun in college but itâ€™s impossible when youâ€™re a loser. I have no future and I just want all the pain to end
