I canâ€™t do it anymoreI canâ€™t stop crying my stomach hurts and I feel like shit. I havenâ€™t felt like killing myself in a while but the feeling is back again and Iâ€™m trying my best to fight it I ended up having a panic attack tonight and I canâ€™t control my feelings. I havenâ€™t thought about cutting myself either but now I actually want to I need a way of getting my emotions out and the only thing I can think of is cutting myself I feel like I need to hurt myself to get my emotions out. I just canâ€™t deal with this anymore these mental breakdowns have been going on for a week and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore I just donâ€™t. I take my medication and I make sure to take it daily but I feel like it doesnâ€™t help during the night. I guess after being â€œhappy.â€ Because of my fluoxetine my body feels exhausted and it feels like it needs to break down because itâ€™s been working so hard to keep itself positive. I canâ€™t do it anymore I canâ€™t keep living like this I donâ€™t know why this happens I canâ€™t keep crying every night I canâ€™t keep fucking doing this.
