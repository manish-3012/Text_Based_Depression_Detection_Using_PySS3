Wanted to kill myself but didnâ€™t today.Today at work I was put on cutting duty for brick. Today was really high paced, and it seemed like th cuts were being Holland left and right and sideways and around in circles at me. Mentally Iâ€™m not the most stable as a person and I can only handle so much fast paced working and demands before I get too stressed. Needless to say all the stress as of late and today really got to me. 
Iâ€™m a very paranoid person as well and i struggle with mental illness. I began to think they were just doing it to wear me out and make me quit, and they knew me deepest secrets and hated me because of them. 

With it all piling up on me, standing at the saw with the brick on the table and a box cutter (for some reason there was no chalk) to etch cutting lines in the brick. I started to somewhat hyper ventilate, tremble. My nerves skyrocketed and I started to tear up and choke. My inner being was screaming to kill myself, and to just cut and cut and cut, just violently start running laps on my wrist and throat. I got all choked up and got lost in my head. All I could think about was how good it wouldâ€™ve been to just off myself in front of my coworkers. To not feel stressed anymore, and to break away. I just wanted to end it man. 

In all honesty holding that knife and halfway crying is the closest Iâ€™ve ever came to killing myself. But I chickened out again. I just donâ€™t have the audacity to do it.  Gosh dang I hate being alive. I feel like Mr.Meeseeks. Existence is definitely pain man. I just hate being alive, and everything is just so bland and repetitive to the point that it all becomes annoying. Idk, Iâ€™m just annoyed that life sucks this bad and has no color to it. It just seems so meaningless. 

Turns out, they had me on the saw because I was a lot better than the guy they had on and I was the only one available who could keep up with the demand and do a decent job. I almost killed myself for nothing.
