My brother recently posted on hereMy brother. Cody. uses the name valdorterra on here and I've gone through his phone because my mother was to broken down to do really anything. He's took his life last night and I'm not sure what else to say. It's strange that he confided in an online social media network rather than his own family. I miss him and I hope he knows that. Thanks for listening
