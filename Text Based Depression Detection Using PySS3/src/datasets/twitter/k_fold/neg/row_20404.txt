Suicide seems like the logical thing to doI know the cause of the strong suicidal thoughts. I started taking a mood stabilizer a few days ago and this is a potential side effect. However, the thoughts are so strong and my life situation is very quickly becoming even shittier that the thoughts are becoming more convincing.

I can't find a job and within 2.5 months I will run out of money. Can't pay my portion of the rent or for my meds. I recently got even ghosted for a job interview which I didn't know was possible. I'm under-qualified for my career, and for the lower-tier jobs I'm way too over-qualified. In an interview one of them even said why am I applying for this job with all my education and experience. I still live at home but my mother is earning low-income and we both agreed that at my age (27) I need to at least have some financial responsibility.

I had to quit my old job a while back due to my mental health so I tried applying for disability. My psychiatrist who would sign the forms says that just because I can't do this job doesn't mean I can't do all jobs. She'll obviously mention that on my file when I apply for it so I won't get it. Welfare is not an option as they would consider my mother's income.

I have already accepted that I will die a virgin without any friends, but I at least wanted a life... like a stable career or something. Looks like I'm not even worth that.

I have attempted suicide last year. Everyone in my immediate family has in the past too so I'm sure they'll understand why I am planning on doing it.
