It's not that I can't, I just don't want toIt's not that I can't get through this tough patch, I don't want to.

Why would I? Its only gonna get harder from this point on. And even if it does get better for a while it won't last because nothing ever does. So why would I want to? And that statement applies to everything.

I don't want to do anything, eat, drink, sleep, go out. Forcing myself to do those things is getting harder each day. I just want to stop existing

And yet I have kids and I'm expected to just keep calm and carry on in true Brit fashion. And I can't. I don't want to. Part of me wants to ship them off to their dad's because I don't have the wherewithal to look after myself, and im auto parenting right now. Part of me wants their dad to have them so I can go throw myself off a building. But I can't. Because they'll hate me when they're older. I'll be the reason theyll be messed up, and I can't do that either. So I'm stuck in this stupid limbo, where I can't kill myself and I don't want to live either.
