I would kill myself if I couldTLDR: Iâ€™ve won the lottery of life but I donâ€™t want to live anymore 

I canâ€™t stand living anymore. It is simply too hard and painful. I canâ€™t see a future worth living for, life is so meaningless and pointless. Rationally, I have a life worth living for. I won the lottery of the family to be born into, Iâ€™m studying engineering at a top university in London and on track for a first, I have a prestigious year long internship and I have amazing friends around me. But the thought of having to live another day is so agonisingly painful. I canâ€™t find any reason not to kill myself anymore. I donâ€™t care that if I die the people I care about and people that care about me will be in a lot of emotional pain. I mean itâ€™s like ripping off a band aid, the pain will go away eventually and I will be forgotten. 

Nothing in life is enjoyable anymore. I just want to end it. I just want to vanish off the face of the earth. 

But I just donâ€™t dare to actually act on it. Just some part of me wants to be alive. Maybe it is just a primal instinct.
