Well...I haven't attempted yet.I'm still here. Still incredibly suicidal. Ready to kill myself. Crying constantly. I'm ready to die...but I keep pussying out. I put 30 Wellbutrin XL 150 mg tablets in my hands, every night I'm at my house in my bed. I want to die. I hate fucking living. 

My mom is coming in from Arkansas on Wednesday. Normally I would be so happy...but literally I want to kill myself. I'm incredibly suicidal. I don't want to live anymore. I want to die. I know my mom couldn't deal with me being gone..but she would rather me not in constant pain. 

What can I fight for? I have nothing to fight for anymore.
