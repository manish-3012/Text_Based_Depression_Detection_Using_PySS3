I want to give up before tomorrow. (The Self-pity train is now arriving at Self Hatred Station)Every single second Iâ€™m breathing Iâ€™m doing the wrong thing. Every day that I wake up Iâ€™m ruining the lives of everyone around me. Iâ€™m a fuckup who canâ€™t get better. I have no right to be here. No one likes me or wants me to be around anymore. Itâ€™ll be a relief for everybody when Iâ€™m gone. If I donâ€™t have it in me to kill myself, I should at least disappear into the night and stop burdening the people I love. Iâ€™m just a loser. 

Iâ€™ll probably delete this later. I probably donâ€™t have it in me to do anything. Sorry for acting so pathetic.
