Please help my sister.She posted this today: http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1c5b51/stop_putting_children_on_pharma_how_it_has_ruined/
I have not left her side since but she won't tell me how she is planning to do it or when. I really love her and would be devastated but I can't seem to get through to her.
She is on Reddit monitoring that thread now any encouraging comments would be amazing. I am at a loss at what to do and don't know where else to turn to.
