This world needs youThis world is ruled by narcissistic bastards. People who can't feel the pain of others. I think people on the verge of suicide are the opposite. We're the ones who internalize the pain, and see no point in this world. How insignificant. But I think we have a gift. This empathy. And the world needs more empathy. One day you will be able to share your gift with someone going through hell, and tell them, to stay, and make someone's life a little better. One day at a time. Breathe.
