I don't like livingI'm a 23 year old guy and I don't think I can keep going. I still live with my mom, I've never moved out. I've never had a girlfriend never kissed a girl or anything. I have no friends and when I say that I mean I have 2 friends my whole life. And those friends where just friends of my family really. I haven't had a friend since I was about 16-18 years old. I I've been diagnosed with social anxiety, ADD, manic depressive disorder, and bipolar. I've been on and off so many meds and nothing really helped me. I got fired from my job 7months ago. I just feel so empty I cant get outa bed, I can't eat, I can't shower. I just don't care to live anymore. Everything just feels so dark, I get so depressed my body just feels weak. Even if there was something I wanted to do I just can't get my body to let me. Ive really lost all desire to do anything. I don't see anyway out of this phycologists and there drugs don't help. Just feels like theres no end in sight and this isn't a life I wanna live.
