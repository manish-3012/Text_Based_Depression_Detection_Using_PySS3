I don't think I cant wait for DBT, I dont know how much longer I have leftI feel empty and useless. im a 22 year old loser with nothing to his name. I have attempted and failed twice but i'm positive soon i'll commit. The only reason I haven't ended it yet is my amazing girlfriend. She is the most supportive person in the world and one of the only people that truly cares. I have borderline personality disorder and am on a 9-10 month waiting list for dilectical behavioural therapy, the problem is I dont know if I have that much time left. I am truly exhausted and I hate everything about myself. My girlfriend is the last thing standing in the way of me killing myself and I'm pretty much just waiting for her to dump me because of how unberable I am. I cant wait to end it, no more trips to the hospital, no more therapy, no more drug/alcohol abuse and no more anxeity ridden sleepless nights. The last minutes of my life will hopefully be the happiest
