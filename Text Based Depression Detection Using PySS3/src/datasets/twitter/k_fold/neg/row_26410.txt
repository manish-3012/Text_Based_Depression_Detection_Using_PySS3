I need some companyI have long term depression and anxiety and panic disorder. 

I have tried to take my life before, failed and was going to try again over christmas when I was alone but didn't because of my cat. I channelled those emotions into a tattoo for her.

Currently I'm going through a medication change, my meds stopped being so effective and made me go from slender to obese over 3 years. 

I also just found out I have an auto immune back disorder which is why im always sore and sick.

Right now, with these swaps and everything I just want to die. I dont think I could go through with it and abandon my cat like she was before she was adopted. but i want to so bad.

I just want to cry and talk to someone and figure everything out.

I want to take too many pills, not enough to kill me but to make me sleep until its all over
