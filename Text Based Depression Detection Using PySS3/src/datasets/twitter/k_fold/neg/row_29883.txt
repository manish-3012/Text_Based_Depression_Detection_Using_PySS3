Every once in a while I start to feel this way againI get extremely depressed, I have been diagnosed with depression and I was on medication around 7 months ago. I stopped it all, I never wanted their "help" anyway, fucking face it cause they don't give a damn. No one does, not even my family. I have lost touch with all my friends. I have an SO at the moment. Not even he can make me stop thinking like this, I'm so selfish. We're always arguing these days anyway, he'll be better off without me. I end up losing everyone, everyone. I might as well cut myself out too. 

There are times where I feel like I'm making so much progress in life, I've got far and I did it by myself, I didn't need help. I was "happy" for a while or I just started to believe my lies. I'd have energy so much energy I wouldn't sleep for days. Now I don't sleep at night, I sleep during the days. Everything is so up and down, one second I got things and the next second I'm dropping everything. My head is a mess, everything, every little detail is so loud. I'm surrounded by hate, arguments, hypocrisy, judgement and abuse. I'm so emotionally tired, I'm starting to feel ill again. 
I really want to die. I wanna get out. I don't want to be here anymore, but I said I wouldn't try it again, that last time was a "mistake", but only because I failed. I don't have anything, my life is only actually beginning, I haven't seen the world and I haven't even met that many people. But through all this, I'm not sure if I ever want to find out if there are other nicer, better things out there. This misery, this illness, the constant pain, it won't leave me alone. 
I don't really need advice, or sympathy... But if there is any advice then please help me.
