HelpI should probably start this off by saying that I suffer from severe depression, panic attacks, self harm and suicidal tendencies. I've been trying to get better lately, I've been trying to work and make some money to be able to be as self sufficient as possible, because being useless and always in my house makes me even more depressed. I had a very important job interview and I did pretty well. They were happy with the results, told me they were preparing my contract, and then out of nowhere they told me they weren't gonna get me. I really needed the money and most of all I really needed to do something, to be active. I feel like I'm gonna spiral down all over again. I can't afford a therapist and I know, I can just feel it in my guts, I'm gonna have a breakdown soon.
