Why is it so hard to get help?I've ultimately decided to struggle against committing suicide for my family's sake even if it's unfair to expect me to keep living it would stop a cycle of trauma that would be inevitable after my suicide. Problem is people suck and I'm convinced most are incapable of giving a single fuck. Hotlines? They're downright insulting. I'm from the US and they're honestly useless here. You'd be better off calling an ambulance yourself or going to the hospital. Speaking of hospitals... The ones where I live locally are a hazard to their mental patients and I'd have to move states if I wanted a ward stay that could at least provide basic things like clean clothes and warm showers.

Oh wait, I can't move because it's illegal to do so thanks to my disabilities. I'd have to convince my guardian otherwise who thinks there's nothing wrong with the wards in our area. Alright, fine, this makes things difficult but for a brief time I convinced myself I just had to be extra proactive with recovery so then I wouldn't have to depend on a ward. 

Of course, that bubble was popped after finding out what it actually takes to recover; which is finding meaning among a community. I can't make a meaningful relationship with a friend that doesn't feel one sided let alone the distant dream of not being alienated among fellow human beings. At this point it's like demanding the near impossible and I can only imagine how much worse it is for people who get denied healthcare coverage. I honestly should give up and try to make my death look like an accident instead of waiting until I have a complete mental breakdown.
