Im so tiredI risk sounding spoiled because I live in a nice house with nice things and a family that only sometimes loves me. But I want to end it. Iâ€™m constantly telling myself things will get better but I have no idea if it will. In the past year I have wrote 4 fake toaster bath notes in my diary in one day and that was the day my mother decided to snoop in my room. She found it and read the whole thing. For the next month she was constantly looking for reassurance that I Â«Â didnâ€™t hate herÂ Â» as the notes said I did. I do. But she doesnâ€™t know that. She took me to three therapists and INSISTED she stayed in the room while I spoke. I tried to tell her that I couldnâ€™t speak this way but the tears kept comming out and and Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t. Iâ€™m bisexual. And I wanted to have a proper coming out but since it was written in my diary she knows about that too.  Over the past three months Iâ€™ve felt not only lonely but extremely anxious and depressed. I donâ€™t want to bother my friends or best friend because I fear it would turn her away. I have diabetes and itâ€™s just another thing Iâ€™m constantly self conscious about and I feel it makes other people think of me as less of a person. The sensors and needles constantly on my body are so ugly and I hate them so much. I want to just tear them off and never look at them again. Iâ€™ve thought about insuline Od-ing for a while now but never had the courage to do it. My ex got a Â«Â perfectÂ Â» girlfriend and it makes me feel unworthy because I still have feelings for him aswell. I feel fat even thought but BMI is in a normal range and ugly because I donâ€™t wear makeup because of sensitive skin.  I try to tell my parents Iâ€™m just tired but even though itâ€™s  true they refuse to believe me and always try to force me to talk about my problems and if I donâ€™t they get mad at me for being disrespectful.  I need help and this is my last option.
