Dear /r/SuicideWatch, I just spent the worst night ever. How do people cope with shit like this?**Last night:**


So I've just started a PhD, and last night I went out with a few colleagues, I didn't really know them yet. At some point, this girl I've been sleeping with for two weeks (we've talked online a lot every day for like a month beforehand), tells me she's in the city, so I tell her to come. We didn't really go out together apparently, but according to her we were sex-friends in an exclusive way (not sleeping with other people), or something. Because that's what she wanted. I didn't want to explain that to my coworkers, so I just told them we went out together, and told her so, and that she couldn't flirt, she was okay with that. When she arrives, some other PhD student who's been there for like 2 years starts flirting with her like crazy, talking to her about everything, trying to oppose me about everything and making it look like they agree about something and not me, even touching her arm etc., and she plays his game. When I say something she even goes against me and defends him. So I told her we should leave, we did, we had an argument, I went back home, and she went back to see that guy. WTF?

I talked with one of the guy from the party afterwards, he was dumbstruck, told me he had never seen such a thing, that the guy was a total asshole etc. I perfectly knew this wasn't the most trustful girl in the world (and I'm not used to that, I've always had very long relationships), but I mean seriously? How can someone be so slutty? And have no respect whatsoever for someone you've talked with all the time for one month and a half and spent several nights with?

The real issue here is not the girl, I don't really give a shit about her, it's how to deal with the guy. I'll have to work with him, our lab only has small teams, and seriously, I have no idea how to react. I'm even thinking about giving up my PhD. What should I do?

**Quick context:**


I'm 26, I've been depressed as fuck for at least 8 years (for several reasons), to the point that it made me lose a lot of friends, that I gave up on my studies 2 years ago after a breakup and ended up spending 8 months locked up at my place last year. Before that, even though I was depressed as fuck and I think I pissed a lot of people off, I still managed to study well (I had 2 bachelor's degrees and an engineer's degree, always very good grades), and I had several long term relationships. Since I had graduated in engineering because I gave up on research due to my depression (this is a bit complicated, but I won't explain how the French system works), and since I really felt like I screwed my life up, I started a research Master's degree last year. I ended up being ranked first, got a scholarship for a PhD, everything I wanted. I also had a girl for 6 months until two months ago we had an argument and she left telling me I was crazy, which completely destroyed me. That's probably why I ended up with this other girl. :(

So, wtf, of all the rather long-term relationships I've had before (4 years, 2 years, 8 months), I've never had to cope with shit like that, what the hell is going on? I'm really trying my best to try to live on, but it's getting harder every time.
