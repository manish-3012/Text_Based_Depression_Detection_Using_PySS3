I have some questions about getting help(Note: It's been a long time since I've posted anything on reddit so like sorry if I'm doing this wrong and my writing might be weird because of an overall difficulty expressing things lmao) 

Anyway 
I don't think I have any plans to "do it"...but the ideations are Big.
Do I go the ER? I'm scared to because I work at the hospital and so does my dad. He's there right now and really angry at me for declining when I was called in. I think he'd just get angrier. I'm also afraid of getting fired or anything and I don't really know how anything about that works. 
Would it be "safer" if I just wait until Thursday when I have therapy? And just tell my therapist?

Usually when I just wait it goes away and I even kinda forget about it. I'm just not sure this time. I haven't felt it this badly since high school. Currently no irl friends are really talking to me much since I had like a hypo manic episode a few months ago. My family just gets angrier and angrier with me. I'm so anxious I feel dizzy and sick but I don't know like anything right now
