I feel like I'm going all Leaving Las Vegas [adult content warning]I feel like I'm going all Leaving Las Vegas since I decided to commit suicide.

I quit my job, I'm pawning my valuables, I'm donating heaps to Goodwill, I'm spending all my free time with my family, outdoors and doing things I enjoy, I had unprotected sex with a guy I liked (it was AMAZING, I have zero regrets there) and now I'm pregnant.

The funny thing is, I always said I'd kill myself if I ever got pregnant. And the freak occurrence of getting pregnant after having unprotected sex ONE time even though he pulled out is, to me, like another cosmic sign that this is the right choice for me.

But I'm so much happier since I decided to commit suicide. I feel like I'm finally living my life -- without fear, anxiety or regret.
