I sexually assaulted my friend and now I'm planning on killing myselfEarlier this week me and a few friends got drunk. Before my other 2 friends had just started to drink, I was already quite inebriated. I started to ask them sexual questions, and one friend said "I'm down to do anything, as soon as I'm shit faced." Drunk me considered this consent. 10 minutes later when they were finally shit faced, I began to finger my friend and move their hand to my crotch. Before this happened I asked "is this ok." It lasted for about 10 seconds before they got up and went to go vomit. A few days later and my friends inform me that the friend I did that to is considering it sexual assault and that I violated our trust and that they can't sleep at night and that they are feeling traumatized because of it. I honestly did not know that that was what had happened that night. He does not consider what he said, "I'm down to do anything, as soon as I'm shit faced." as consent. I don't know what to do. Everyone in that friend group has been told and now they have all cut me out of their lives. Before I was cut off, I was told that "they can take this to court." Even though they gave consent before he had just started to drink. I feel horribly guilty for my actions but at the same time I don't feel like I did wrong as my friend gave consent BEFORE they got inebriated. I'm planning on killing myself if I have to spend time in jail. If that happens my life is ruined. I don't even know. Does it matter that they gave consent before they got drunk? Or should I just end it all for the guilt of my actions
