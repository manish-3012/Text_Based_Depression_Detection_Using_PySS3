Isn't suicide really the easy way out?Seriously, could one of you guys explain in detail why suicide is so bad? Isn't it my own right? I didn't want to be born the way I currently am. It's like blaming your pet for dying while also crying for it. But you're the one who bought it out of its free will. I mean, I love  the family I'm born in, they're supportive, but my whole life has been shit from the day I've been born. I didn't ask for any of this, so isn't it basically my right to suicide? How is it so selfish?
