I feel like it's time to go.I don't really know how to do this, but. I'm a father of two, formerly married. Life kind of fell apart two years ago, lost my job and failed at my own business, had to move. Since then, been dealing with clinical depression and I've been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I've been undergoing therapy for my children, and had been for my wife's sake before... well. Now, she's decided it's over, I've had to move in with my parents, and... I just feel done. People tell me to rebuild, and I put on the happy mask for my kids and go to appointments so no one gets scared, avoid going back to the psych ward. But I just feel like I've done what I could, and now I'm pointless. Served my purpose and I'm broken now... time to be thrown away. I'm sorry to rant. I know I need help. Just don't know what to do... what's the point?
