First times thinking about suicide recentlyBeen on antidepressants for half a year now - things have only gotten worse since taking them. Recently started thinking about what the repercussions of suicide would be, and what would happen after i die. How would I do it? Whatâ€™s the quickest, most efficient way thatâ€™s least painful? I donâ€™t even wanna act like Iâ€™ve got some huge sob story and my life has been doomed from the start. Iâ€™m just sick of hating myself and wanting to be somebody else. Iâ€™m tired of waking up and wanting to go back to sleep, even though Iâ€™m not tired. I wanna just sit in a metal box and stare at a wall for a long while. I wanna just stop existing for a little while. Iâ€™m so burnt out. Not even from school. Iâ€™m burnt out from life. The nice thing about it all, though, is that I kinda like the power of not caring anymore. Iâ€™m about to graduate high school and go to my dream college, and all I can help but think about is how much I donâ€™t care about my future anymore. I donâ€™t care about the consequences of my life anymore. Itâ€™s nice to not care about all the little things that used to make me hate myself. Now when I screw things up, instead of feeling like crap, and just think about how it wonâ€™t matter in the long run since there wonâ€™t be a long run. A part of me hopes things get worse so I can just off myself and not have to care anymore, so my fuck-ups stop having power over my mentally ill brain.
