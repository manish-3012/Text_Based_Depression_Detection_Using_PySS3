It's like I don't even want to get better..Well that's it, I'm booked to see a therapist tomorrow. After years of self harm and constant self loathing with suicidal thoughts thrown in the mix, My mum has convinced me to go and meet a person. Bear in mind my mum doesn't even know about the self harm or suicidal thoughts, So it must be pretty bad from her perspective not knowing about those. I have no idea what it's gonna be like and I'm not looking forward to it at all, I'll just end up getting really anxious and wont know what to say. It's always been something I've tried to avoid, It's why I stay at home and play computer games all day and have never even kissed a girl, It's not that I don't enjoy playing games, I just absolutely hate the constant feeling of judgement when I step out the door. I feel like any wrong move I make, if I slip on the pavement and trip, that everyone is watching and laughing.

 A friend even offered to organize it and me go with him a few months back, But I just ended up telling him that it wasn't a big deal and lied to make it sound not as bad as it really is. I guess the therapist can help in some way, I have no clue how this kinda thing works. I guess I'm just posting here again to kinda see if anyone can give me an honest opinion of what therapy is/was like for them.
Thanks.
