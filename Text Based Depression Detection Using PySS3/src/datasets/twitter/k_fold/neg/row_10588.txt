Is anyone else tired of living, but afraid to die?I don't want to be here anymore. I wish I never existed, was never born, or could just somehow become dead without having to experience dying. I'm terrified of the act of death but I just can't keep living. 

Mostly I'm afraid if I try, I won't succeed and I'll be stuck living with the consequences of an attempt. 

I hate my life. I hate myself. I hate my fear. I wish I didn't exist. There is literally not a single point to why I should still be alive. Every. Fucking. Day. Is. Misery. 

I am truly worthless. To everyone. I'm a waste of space and life. I mean nothing to anyone. And I don't know how to even keep trying.
