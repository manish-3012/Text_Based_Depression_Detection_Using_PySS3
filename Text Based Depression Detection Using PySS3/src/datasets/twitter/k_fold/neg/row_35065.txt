My life has stalledI'm 33 years old in couple of weeks, and that's depressing me. Not the age itself, but the fact that my life has stalled. I've been in the same situation for a good 7 or 8 years. Living with a flatmate I have little in common with; or approaches to life share little common ground 


My career has gone nowhere. The only thing I'm half decent at it's illustration and animation, but the freelance nature of that career combined with my absolute incompetence when it comes networking and sourcing work means that I'm pretty much only earning the equivalent of minimum wage, so I can't afford a place of my own and I can't afford to make the changes I want to make. 

So I'm unhappy. And have been unhappy and dissatisfied for years. My attempts to advance my career have ended with failure and I just feel like giving up. But I don't feel capable of doing anything else. 

I started having suicidal ideation a few years ago. When I was 30, in fact. I vowed at the time to kill myself when I was 40 unless my I could improve my life. I chose 40 as by then my young nieces will have grown up.

I don't want to upset my family at all, but the thought of continuing with my sad existence until I die naturally seems incredibly bleak.

So that vow kept owing back into my head with alarming regularity. I've looked into methods and I'm pretty sure how I'd want to go now. 

Every year I hope something will change, but literally nothing improves. I feel totally incapable of making any progress now, as my past efforts lead nowhere. 

So all that's left is to count the years. Maybe when I get there I'll change my mind, but right now the thought of a definite end point is almost reassuring.
