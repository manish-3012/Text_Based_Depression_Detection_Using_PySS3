i just need somewhere to rant to i guessI hate talking about things, I never make posts like this. I tried once a long time ago, got some really good advice so i figured I'd try again. I fucked up.  i've made so many mistakes in my life that I don't know if ill be able to redeem myself. I don't see myself having a future that is even anywhere close to meaningful. I got discharged from the military because im a weak fuck who had a mental breakdown. i looked like a complete fucking idiot. since then my life has been a living hell of therapists, pills, psychiatrists, no one listening to me about said things and i just dont think i can do it anymore. I plan on doing an outpatient behavioral study or whatever the fuck its called, basically partial hospitalization. hopefully that can calm me down for a few weeks. if not then i dont have much hope for any upcoming weeks.

i fucked up with my relationship, i dont think things will ever be the same. Ive been miserable but i love them so much its made it so hard to leave. I  did, but i know if given the chance ill become complacent again and be in the same spot. i want to make things right because im a disgusting terrible excuse of a human but i just dont kn mow how. is there even a point in fixing things? Due to that ive lost my best friend, whos i just started talking to again. I wish i never reached out and fixed things, it would be so much easier right now.

i know my problems are trivial and im not good at explaining things. im sorry that this all sounds so stupid. i guess i just wanted someone real to listen to me one last time that wasnt a therapist being paid to care. im probably too much of a wimp to even kill myself, every attempt in the past has ended that way. i dont know what to do, im so tired of being paranoid and anxious and just miserable with my life. im sorry.
