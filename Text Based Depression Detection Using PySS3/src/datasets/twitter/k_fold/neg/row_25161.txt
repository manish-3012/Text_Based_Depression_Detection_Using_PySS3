Life Sentence. I'm 17 years old and extremely suicidal. I've never had a great, easy, or awesome life in the matter. I have no talents and I'm not smart, attractive, or anything regarded highly of something. I will never be successful once I grow up in the sense of being rich, respected and so forth.

This whole world is sick and twisted, and all of these certain rules are manipulated and created by rich individuals so that everything works out for them. I'm tired to trying to work hard for something when I know I won't get what I truly want. The only successful people anyway are the ones who go to the nation's top schools, companies, and so forth. I will not be having any of those opportunities. 

I'm going to commit suicide by getting myself a life sentence in prison by fabricating a whole massacre at the local public high school of which I attend. No one will get hurt, but I just need a good scare and resistance. This is my final rant at the entire world, and this post is basically a middle finger to all of those small numbered individuals once I do this. 

So, hopefully the police find this post when I'm taken into custody and for arraignment so they can get a clear visual of who they are indicting to prison for life. I'm just going to gather an arsenal of weapons and prepare myself to do this. Goodbye cruel world.
