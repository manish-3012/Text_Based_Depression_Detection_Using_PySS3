Can't find a reason to keep goingI don't know why I feel so crushed right now. But I can't even bring myself to get out of bed. I'm in a dead-end job that stresses me out but I can't leave because it's for family. My boyfriend is an idiot and has no control over his life, which adds more stress on mine. 

I have anxiety and depression (diagnosed) and right now I just feel really vulnerable. I have an easy way of making it all end just sitting in the next room. 

I don't think anyone would really miss me. Sure my family would mourn me for a few years and my friends may be sad for a few months but it wouldn't really impact anyone in the long run. I've worried for the first 27 years of my life and now I'm just tired of worrying. I want it to stop. Pills haven't worked. Therapy hasn't worked. What other options do I have?
