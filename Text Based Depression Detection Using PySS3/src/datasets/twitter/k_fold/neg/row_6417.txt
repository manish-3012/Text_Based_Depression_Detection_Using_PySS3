just waiting for the day i gain some couragelonely. ive pushed everyone away, pushed the one person who genuinely had any interest in me away, and i have nothing. woe is me, i guess. i did all of this to myself though, if i wasnâ€™t so depressed and sad maybe others would actually look forward to talking to me. but i am, and i ainâ€™t like them. and nobody wants a sad, abusive pos bringing them down. so whatâ€™s better than to cut ties with everyone, run away, and die? woo.
