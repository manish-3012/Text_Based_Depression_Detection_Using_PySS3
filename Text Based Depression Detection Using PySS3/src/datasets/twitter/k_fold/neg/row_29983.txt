My last standAfter a series of recent failures and victories I decided that I'm going to try to fix my life for and not hit 10 years of wanting to kill myself. I will try my hardest for this next year to become happy and get friends and become a person worthy of the love I'm told(but don't believe) I have from my coworker. I'm going to try my hardest in school and for my person this upcoming year. And if I don't win I'll kill myself knowing I tried my hardest to change this. I want to be happy I don't want to die pathetically. I don't care if life doesn't matter. I'll give it meaning. I won't let this be another little tiny boost of determination that I let fade away. I'll get better I know I will. I want to love myself and this world I live in. I won't ignore the people around me any longer I want to make them happy to. If you're going through troubles please try your hardest to improve yourself. I'll talk to you if you need encouragement I want to try to get everyone to work for a better self.(I wasn't sure if I should post here or not but I was pretty active here so I figured I should)

Sorry about sorta venting but I had to. Wish me luck.
