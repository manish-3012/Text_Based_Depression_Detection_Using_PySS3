How can I fight my dreams?Okay so since a couple of days ago, I started dreaming about dying and suicide once again. The last 2 times I had those dreams, I fell down this black hole within days to the point where I almost killed myself. I feel like it's all coming back again and I'm scared about what's ahead. It's all I can think about and that's probably making my dreams even worse. Anybody that has advice or something?,
