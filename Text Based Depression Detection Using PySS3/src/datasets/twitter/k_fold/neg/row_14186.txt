state testing todaystate testing today. not today but tomorrow. I know nothing since i didn't go to school for five months because bullying. So i transferred to an online school. First thing I had to do was 40 lessons, and each lesson gets added on for all my core classes. I couldn't do 40
lessons until march. i hate it i thought school would be better but all i do it sit in the same room playing xbox then doing two lessons that i have to skip through so my grade can go up
