21 year old NEET with several issues.I am a 21 year old male. I struggle with depression, social anxiety, low self-esteem, daily suicidal thoughts. I am financially dependent on my parents. I don't have a job or go to school. I don't have many friends. Never had a girlfriend. My family doesn't love me. I hate feeling worthless and unwanted. I hate feeling like a disgrace. I know what my dad says about me. I fucked up my driving test because I got too nervous. I fucked up my job interviews. Now I'm too scared to even apply anymore. I should've asked for help before my issues got this worse. I struggle even talking to my parents because I know they'll pass it off. They always have whenever I had a problem. Everything I do I fuck up. I hate feeling rejected. I hate waking up everyday feeling like I'm nothing. I always wished I had never been born when I was a kid. Now, I just want to end it.
