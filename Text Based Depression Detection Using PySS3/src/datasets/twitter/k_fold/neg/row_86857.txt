been running on empty for monthsiâ€™m so fucking tired. been feeling actively suicidal since june, hospitalized twice, both partial and i didnâ€™t let it interfere with school at all. my eating disorder has come back, worse than ever. iâ€™ve been struggling with this very on and off- iâ€™ll restrict to 800-1.2k calories a day for about a week or two, then cycle back to normal eating for another two or so weeks. i havenâ€™t told anybody this, but it was so bad back in june that i asked my anorexic friends to encourage me to eat less in an attempt to help me starve, which they did. i start crying randomly at least once a day, sometimes with my boyfriend or mom, and every time i see my therapist. when i say i never used to cry in front of people, i mean NEVER. not once in my two years of the same therapist and only once during my two week partial hospitalization. in addition to that i cry every night and actively have to try not to kill myself or tell my mom how i feel- she told me if i havenâ€™t gotten better (which i havenâ€™t) she will send me to a clinic in boston (i live in california) because sheâ€™s sick of me not getting better. i am convinced my boyfriend will break up with me or cheat on me for no good reason every day, so much i have nightmares about it. i know itâ€™s not healthy, but heâ€™s literally the only positive thing in my life right now so if i lose him i will be devastated. iâ€™ve been sick for the past two weeks, but i havenâ€™t been able to miss class because i hate my grades. iâ€™ve just started a job in a law firm with hours only during the week, with an absolute minimum of 10 hours a week. i will get home at 6pm-9pm from now on. i am so fucking tired. i donâ€™t know what to do. there is no break or end in sight unless i kill myself. i feel exhausted and helpless. i cant get help because theyâ€™ll send me inpatient, then partial inpatient, then iop, which all will take more than a month to cycle through- i donâ€™t have that time. it will kill my relationship and grades. all i have left is to kill myself. iâ€™m so tired. sorry and thank you if you read all of this, i really appreciate it. just needed it to be out there.
