Spouse feeling disconnectedHi again folks. I need some advice. My spouse is seeing a psychologist regularly, and has a scheduled psychiatrist appointment. The psychologist diagnosed my spouse with depression, bipolar, and ptsd The psychologist organised with a GP to get my spouse on some basic meds. But despite the tranquilizers and the stabilizers my spouse still feels like their reality is the nightmares, being tired, and being scared. All the things they do to distract themselves doesn't feel real.

I have long since taken to locking up all risk items in our house, sharp objects, possible poisons, dangerous medication.

Our trust puts me in a position where my spouse will tell me if things get bad enough to warrant hospitalization. Something my spouse dreads and has made me promise never to do.

My spouse is currently asking me to check with our medical what would be covered in that eventuality.

I'll be perfectly honest. I do not know what to do. I am making sure that provisions will be made should my spouse be hospitalized. I have made an effort to remove all risk items, but I don't underestimate my spouse's ingenuity, nor her current state of sleep deprived desperation.

What do I do?
