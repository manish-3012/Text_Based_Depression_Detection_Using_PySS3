Been lonely for years. Never felt love before. After feeling it once. I wanna die.21m. Never had anyone show me interest. Suddenly out of nowhere a bright girl shows up. Talking randomly doesnt stop. Im stoked. Somebody is really interested in me? Damn. Is this what i need? I obviously fall really quick. She claims to love me. She cheats on me. I've already had trust issues before. I feel like absolute fucking dirt. Worthless. Weak fucking idiot. I just wish i had the courage to end this dreadful existance. Every fucking experience in my life is a dissapointment. Shit education aswell so i'll work this low wage job till death. No motivation to change anything for the better. I really fail to see the point anymore. I cant enjoy anything. I HAVENT ENJOYED ANYTHING FOR FUCKING YEARS. God if i just wasnt such a fucking pussy i'd jump off a bridge right now.
