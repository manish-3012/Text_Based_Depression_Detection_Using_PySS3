ghosted a few people. feeling that the time is near...as soon as everyone forgets me for good.so, i haven't texted anyone on Facebook, my messages, or anything special like that. i just wanna have people forget me. i want people to not notice i even died. i have no intention to stick around any longer. my fiancÃ© knows i'm suicidal, a few people are suspecting that i am, parents think i'm okay/happy. my extended family is in the dark as well(they never pay attention to me at all...none of my family does, really).
i feel like i'm okay to go. i want to get married, and maybe it'll be okay to, but i don't want him coming home to blood everywhere and seeing my dead body lying in bed, or have him try to wake me up to no avail...i just want to leave. by myself, in peace. nobody cared to do anything with me.
nobody cared to even hang out. i'm an empath, and all i could feel them feeling is obligated to hang out with me. they're disappointed in me for something but i'm unsure what it is? maybe it'll be better if i was dead. my nevada friend texted me at 8am asking if i was okay. not okay at all. never going to be okay. i can cover it up really well, but when i show someone how i feel inside, they disappear. the only way i'll be okay is if i'm dead. i wish i could die.
