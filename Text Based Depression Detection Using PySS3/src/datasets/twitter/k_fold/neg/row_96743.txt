I am irreparably, irredeemably broken, and I will be for the rest of my life.Ever since I was a child, I was problematic and caused grief to my teachers. I would have these tantrums over small things and I didn't know why. Looking back, these tantrums were for attention. I never got enough attention, even though my family provided enough. Maybe they share some of the blame but I don't want to blame, it's all on me. Was I born like that? If so, what right do I have to exist? 

What I saw from TV or motivational speakers and the like was that anything was possible, and I should be myself. But my younger self was resistant to that idea. I saw my real self as overly emotional and craving attention, frustrating my teachers, taking attention from everyone else to me. Why would I ever want to be the real me? All "being myself" caused was misery to others. And I realized that.

Maybe it was all a phase, I thought. But it wasn't. It never was. I still feel like that child is inside me, and though I want it to be gone, though I've learned to hide away my emotions, to build walls behind me and the rest of the world, that child will never go away. It still demands something, attention probably, I can never be truly sure. It's like I teleport back to the mindset I had a child, even when I think I've outgrown it. It'll never go away, will it?

I've always wanted to be normal. They said anything was possible. But I can't change, it's impossible. This will always be inside of me no matter how much I try to stifle it. I recognize it, I sympathize with it, so why won't it go away? Why do I still feel so emotional? I don't want emotions, I never asked for this.

I would rather be dead than spend the rest of my life like this
