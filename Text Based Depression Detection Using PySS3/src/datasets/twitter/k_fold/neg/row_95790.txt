Should I try to kill myself FOR REAL according to my cruel ultimatum?I mean, yeah its like heavily depends on how my future will look like anyways, whether I do it or not, but I don't know if I should follow this ultimatum still, shit might hit the fan and yeah, I guess I'll just do it if that will happen (I hope that it won't of course).
