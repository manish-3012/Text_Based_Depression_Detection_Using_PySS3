Now that I have a practical method, I might do itI don't know why im posting here, ive tried 3-4 times in the past because of people from other subreddits saying I should. Anyway, the main thing stopping me has been the lack of a practical method since I don't have a gun and other methods have a high chance of pain/not working. But I was talking to someone today and they mentioned a method, a practical one that I could totally do, I was happy when he said it. For the first time I have a way, painless and high success chance, and somehow I had never seen it online. Its brilliant, and because of that I feel like I would actually go through with it, is it bad that I am smirking with happiness just thinking about it?
