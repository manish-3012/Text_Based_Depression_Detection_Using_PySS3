It'll all be over soonEvery day I wake up to wish I was dead, I'm failing my classes and I'm a burden on my family. My sister would never care, my parents would get over me, so what's the point? I'm giving myself 30 days to live because I'm seeing family the week before thanksgiving. I'll either OD on pills I can get in the house or slit my wrist. I wish I could be happy, I wish I wasn't such a baby, hell this could all just be fake because I'm 13 what REAL stress could I possibly have? I wanted someone by me before I go like a girlfriend or boyfriend but at this point, I'm an unloveable mess. I doubt anyone I can reach out to could back me out at this point. I've tried 3 times and the next one will be my fourth. I want to leave home and be happy again but I'm 13 so I can't legally do that. Besides I'm just playing the victim card, my parents aren't bad people, every time I want to leave home I have to tell myself that. Go ahead shame me, I'm too young, I'm selfish, I'm just being a baby, or maybe how being asexual has nothing to do with me wanting to die, and I'm just a little snowflake. I'll laugh at you all in hell anyways.
