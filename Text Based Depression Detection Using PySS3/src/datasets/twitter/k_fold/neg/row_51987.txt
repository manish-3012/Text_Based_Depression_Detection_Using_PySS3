I feel like I will be alone until the day I kill myself I am 28 I have never really had friends, a few online that I have played video games with for a long time but I dont think I have ever had a real life friend outside of dogs. With no friends I have obviously never had a girl friend, I thought for a long time that it would get better after high school but it just didnt. One of the main reason I feel I will never have a girl friend is I have no career of any kind, I havnt lived with my parents in a long time, like 3-4 years but I survive just by working for a few dollars more then min wage at a hardware store. I have no ambition to speak of what so ever no career that I want to pursue nothing that I think I would be capable of. For a long time I was happy enough to be left alone to sit alone in my room and watch TV series, play video games, paint miniatures are the other sterotype loser failure kind of pass times, but at this point I am getting so lonely and I have no hope that its going to get any better, I dont even believe that I am capable of getting any better. I have spent about 15 years of my life thinking about suicide I think about it everyday... one day...
