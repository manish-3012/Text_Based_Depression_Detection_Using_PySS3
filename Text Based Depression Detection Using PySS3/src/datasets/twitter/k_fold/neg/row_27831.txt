Low againI've been cutting for almost an hour and I keep wanting to go deeper. To embrace death, after all it hurts anyway, why not do it all the way? I'm done with failed attempts, I'm done with the shrinks pushing pills down my throat, I'm done with being the slut, and I'm done with being alone. I can't focus anymore, my studies are going down the drain, and I have no easy escape. I need to get out and it just... there's no hope for me.
