What's the point in going on if the world feels like it's ending around me?Yeah, this is slightly political. I'm sorry. But reading all these things about predicting the Earth's future has just made me...lose hope, I guess. What's the difference in dying now and dying once humanity has fucked everything up? Less suffering now? I'm sorry if this doesn't belong/gets removed. I don't mean any trouble.
