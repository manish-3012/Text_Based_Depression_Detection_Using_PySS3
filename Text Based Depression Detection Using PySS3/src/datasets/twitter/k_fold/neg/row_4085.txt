I want to live but it's won't leave... I don't know, I don't want to die but every moment I live I just want to end it all. I can't even escape this while awake or asleep. I want This to end, I have failed several attempts and I don't want to die.

I have no friends, no job, nothing because I always want to kill myself. I can't see a point in living. I can't live like this and I don't know how much longer I can fight this.
