19 years old and Iâ€™m ready to dieThe only thing Iâ€™ll miss out on in the future is an entire lifetime of misery and suffering. I have no ambitions in my life other than wanting to commit suicide.  I have achieved literally nothing in my short life and this will continue to happen if I donâ€™t kill myself. I am a waste of oxygen at this point and I should be erased.

Suicide is my only goal in life. Nothing feels fulfilling and everything that was once enjoyable to me has now been tainted by the fact that I will always be miserable as long as I stay alive.
