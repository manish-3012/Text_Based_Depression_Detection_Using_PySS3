What's the point in trying to reach out for help if no one is obligated to help you?I know people have their own issues to deal with, but I always hear, "No one owes you anything." Or, " No one is obligated to help you." Okay? If no one is obligated to help then why can't I just kill myself in peace then? 

I'm not asking for everyone in the World to stop what their doing and help me all I want is for people to show some empathy just for a second. You don't have to say,"It will get better." I don't want fake positivity I just want some empathy and when I used to reach out to people all I would get is people manipulating calling me selfish and getting an attitude when I would complain. I can't even vent. I'm all by myself, no friends and no family and all I've been wanting to do is end my life.
