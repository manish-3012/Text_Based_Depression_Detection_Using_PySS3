I donâ€™t understandI donâ€™t understand why my parents keep saying Iâ€™m â€œjust lazyâ€ and â€œlameâ€ when they know I have chronic depression, when they know I have horrible anxiety, when they know Iâ€™ve tried killing myself. Why canâ€™t they just understand that Iâ€™m not lazy, Iâ€™m fucking wishing I was dead.
