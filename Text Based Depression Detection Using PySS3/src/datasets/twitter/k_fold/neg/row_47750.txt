I think I shouldI'm so tired. I feel like I struggle so much and it goes nowhere. I've been trying to do DBT (I have trauma diagnoses) but nothing ever pays off. I live with my boyfriend and he treats me like I should just be better and it makes me feel so worthless. The person who loves me most in the world also has me as second place to video games and maybe I just deserve it at this point. I've started cutting myself again and think about suicide most days. I have dreams about it. Today I've started to make a plan to end it all but I want to be sure it works; No half-assed attempt, I don't want to end up in a hospital with people guilting me for feeling the way I do.

The only thing I know is that I don't deserve love. That's all I've ever known. Maybe it's actually kinder to the people I love - even if it isn't reciprocated - to remove myself from the equation. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

I'm not even entirely sure why I'm posting here. I'm just so lonely. I want it to stop.
