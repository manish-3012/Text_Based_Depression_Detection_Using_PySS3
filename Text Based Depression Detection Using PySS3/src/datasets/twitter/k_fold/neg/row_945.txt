why the fuck do i keep thinking/dreaming about anxieties, fears, and other shit i dont want to think aboutI fucking swear to god im gonna take the other end of a hammer and sink it right into my fucking face i need release from this fucking torture

I feel like i have no control of my thoughts my brain just does whatever the fuck it wants and it wants to fucking hurt me. I keep thinking of these fears and anxieties that are so bad that I actually believe they are real when they are not. I keep grounding myself and i still cannot fucking realize that its just my head getting to me but i still CANNOT FUCKING UNDERSTAND. Then comes the intrusive thoughts that stay in my head for the rest of eternity and never go away. The only reason why i cut is because of this shit, i cant fucking get away from it and its making me go insane. It haunts my dreams to no end, within the past 5 days my dreams have all been the same awful shit. Now i cant even feel safe from my thoughts while sleeping.

What the fuck is happening to me
