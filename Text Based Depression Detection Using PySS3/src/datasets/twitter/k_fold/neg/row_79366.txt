Thinking about ending it all, because I love myself, but not my lifeI donâ€™t have low self esteem.  I donâ€™t hate the person who I am.  I just donâ€™t want to continue this life anymore.  I hate my family.  I hate my â€œfriendsâ€.  Iâ€™ve always felt this way, ever since I was I child.  

I always thought that once I got older this feeling would go away, but it hasnâ€™t.  Iâ€™m tired of being full of hatred, resentment, anguish, and every other negative emotion you can think of.  

To be honest, I really donâ€™t give a fuck who Iâ€™d hurt if I actually go through with this, because Iâ€™m doing it for myself.  I honestly view this as doing a compassionate thing for myself.  The cruel thing to do would continue living a life that I donâ€™t want to live anymore.
