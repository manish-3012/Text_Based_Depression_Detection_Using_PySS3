I'm tiredMuch older than most here it seems. I just want to disappear. Like in go to sleep and be gone. I don't think anyone would notice for weeks if not months. I'm not close to anyone. I have a daughter though who's in college and I don't want to cause her pain. I could care little about anyone else. I'm not worth anyone's time or effort. I'm a hermit these days. Isn't this the next step?
