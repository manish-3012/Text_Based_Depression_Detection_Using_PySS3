In four years time...In about four years, all my debts will be paid off. We will be back at a point where we could live off of a single income again. That's why I have to wait four years. 

I already know how I will do it. There will be no mess, no one will have the image of my lifeless body etched into their mind. I will simply disappear and let the void take me. 

Four years... that seems like a long ways away, but I've been suffering for over 30 years. Four years is nothing compared to that. I doubt anything will change in four years.
