Suicide is starting to seem like the only option for me now.I did it, I tried giving life a chance and you know what?? Life got worse, I should have just cut my losses when I had the chance.

I ask myself all the time, why do I exist?? I feel aimless, unloved, uncared for. If Iâ€™m supposed to live for myself, then to that I say Iâ€™d honestly just rather die. People donâ€™t get to just tell me to keep trying and to stay alive and then ignore me, fuck off. Iâ€™m just kinda tired of everyoneâ€™s shit. And the people I want to surround myself with, I canâ€™t.

Iâ€™m trapped, thereâ€™s nothing I can do. I can try the next few months finding a job, raising money and then miraculously making enough money to move back to where Iâ€™m from only to stress about finding a new job and maintaining that, or I can just kill myself and not worry about any of that. Next time my entire family is out of the house Iâ€™m gonna do it. Iâ€™m tired of failing at everything, would it be so wrong to throw in the towel??

Itâ€™s over, itâ€™s finally happened, my spirit is broken. Iâ€™ve been alone my whole life, Iâ€™ve never once succeeded in anything, maybe Iâ€™ll succeed in death
