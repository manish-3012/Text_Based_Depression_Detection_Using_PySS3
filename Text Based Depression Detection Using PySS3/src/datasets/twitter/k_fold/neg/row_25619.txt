Drafting my noteI'm about done here, its time for me to punch out. No friends, no career and no passion for anything. I moved from Texas to my hometown in Wisconsin because it was the last place I actually remember being happy but I've been here for a year now and nothing has changed. It's been so long now that I've felt like an entirely useless waste of space. My family doesn't even care about me anymore but I still want to write something to my mom just so she hears it from me and not a phone call by the police. I just want to apologize for all the time and money wasted on me, I turned out to be such a disappointment and I just want to be gone. I'm saving up for a neat looking revolver so I can at least go out with a bang. I just don't know what to put in the text to my mom,I mean how can I just say that I give up, that the world wins, that they were right about me
