Iâ€™m killing myself on MondayIâ€™m going to stay home from work and do it early in the morning. Iâ€™ve been wanting to die every single day for years. Iâ€™m sorry to my family and friends. But Iâ€™m suffocating now and I know I wonâ€™t be loved by someone else cause how fucked up my brain is. It wouldnâ€™t even be fair to someone so I just couldnâ€™t even give them a chance. Cause once they find out everything thatâ€™s happened to me and whatâ€™s wrong with me, theyâ€™d probably wish they hadnâ€™t talk to me in the first place. Not only that but recently my ex texted me. Basically he wanted to get back together, I declined and blocked him. Now heâ€™s spamming me with these random numbers. Saying that heâ€™s the only person who could love me and that I should be lucky he even still wants me. Heâ€™s probably right.
