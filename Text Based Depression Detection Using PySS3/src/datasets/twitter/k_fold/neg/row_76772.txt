Iâ€™m losing hope and want it to endMy parents have just been screaming again and fought really bad again, this was like the 3rd time this week and i want to die more than ever, i just feel so empty, out of options, helpless and pathetic. I hate when i start to feel hopeful and then just lose all hope i just want to die and for this pain to end
