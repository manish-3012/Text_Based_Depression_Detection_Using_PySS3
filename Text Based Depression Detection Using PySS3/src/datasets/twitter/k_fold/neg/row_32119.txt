Not Good At *ANYTHING* Should I Just Kill Myself?Seriously everything I fucking try I fail at, whether it's life knowledge/skills and understanding the world to learning various topics - Even fucking video games, All I ever want is to be good at something - *ANYTHING*? Why the fuck is life so unfair I can't do anything right. Everyone else is better, more efficient or more effective than me and I have seemingly the worst luck ever imaginable.

Clearly I'm not meant to succeed no matter how hard I fucking try, Even in a psychological sense I'm very far from "Neurotypical" and I've had to deal with this my entire life, All it seems as though I've been living without any compass or navigation? After all this time I'm just so fucking tired of this, Everyone else seems to instinctively know how to succeed and improve in this world? Why can't I be like them? The hand I have been dealt is devastating, Doesn't matter what the fuck I do - Or what mindset I try to put myself into things always seem to go fucking WRONG, Regardless of how kind or genuine I am no one truly cares or likes me and more often than not I fall to ridicule.

And not only this but I don't even have anyone to talk to - Even people/family who seem to care at first get tired of me and have even deleted me off their contacts (Not that I'm rude, insensitive or annoying or anything, but I am extremely reclusive), Deep down I feel that I could succeed if I knew or had some sort of direction or pointer, But I also have a fear with regards to relying on others, What does it fucking matter anyway? Am I just a fucking moron? Why shouldn't I kill myself? Nothing matters at all anymore to me, Doesn't matter how hard I try to lift myself up or improve, Every day is a fucking waste of life and I hate it so much.
