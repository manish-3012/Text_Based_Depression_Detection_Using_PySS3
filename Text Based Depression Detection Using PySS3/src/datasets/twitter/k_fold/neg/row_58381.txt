I am convinced I have some mild form of schizophrenia or OCD but it is masked by addiction.things don't exist unless I know about them. If I know about them, I am actually the reason they exist. 

It is kinda hard to explain. 

anxiety and depression all my life.

I am convinced that if I kill myself, my life starts over.
I will have some bad dreams and be standing on a porch in the spring, in Denver colorado in 1970.

there is something wrong with me but nothing violent. 

i dunno what is going on. Saw a psychiatrist and she said I was drunk. ( little bit more tactful ). 

but man to actually believe suicide is a reset switch....  I believe it.  I really believe it. 

but what if I am wrong?  :(
