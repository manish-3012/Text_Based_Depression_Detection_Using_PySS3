I feel so guilty that I can't help you all.Low key throw away. I love you all so much and feel destroyed when I read a post and just don't know what to comment. Sometimes I just think to myself, "holy shit I'd fucking kill myself too" 

I just want all this to end. I want you all to just be ok. Just be happy. I've had people tell me if it hurts so bad then don't come here. But it hurts worse when I'm away. I just need the suicide to stop. I talk with people and then they say they're going to do it, and I reply back just a little too late. It weighs heavy. My mind is going a million miles a minute and I just want a hug, and someone to say everything's going to be ok. But I know it won't. If you're thinking about doing it. Please don't. That's all I can come up with anymore. People care. You may not care that a random stranger cares. You may think I'll forget you. But I won't ever forget you Elliot. I'll never forget you either John. Or Elizabeth. Or Jane. Or Reece. Or will. Or any of you. I'm sorry I couldn't save you. And I'm sorry I can't save you all. Or any of you apparently. I think I do more harm then good. And that kills me so much.



Edit: I don't even reply anymore because I'm afraid of doing more harm then good. All I can do is offer a friend. Someone to talk to. Vent with. Yet people need more and deserve more than just that.
