12 years old and suicidalDepressed... I Want To Kill Myself?
Dear Reader, 

Today I just feel depressed. Should I shoot myself in the head, inject antibiotics during sleep, or any other quick and painless deaths?
I donâ€™t know. I really donâ€™t feel like listening to people say I shouldnâ€™t die, itâ€™s worthless. No one cares if Iâ€™m bleeding, crying, orâ€¦ killed. So why would I continue this 100 year free life trial from God when I am already suffering? Every night, I cry during my sleep, and when I really canâ€™t sleep, I sometimes sing myself to sleep the saddest song I could ever think of. I am not Emo or anything, I just feel depressed a lot. When I was 4-5 years old, I held a pair of adult scissors to my neck and said I would kill myself because I had no friends. Since then, my mother has been comforting me my whole life. She is always trying so hard to keep me happy, with a kiss on the forehead every night so I donâ€™t have trouble sleeping or cry. My stepdad is a big problem in my life. Its like another Cinderella story all over again. He is so strict, and when he gets mad at work, he would find a way to blame it on me. He would always get frustrated everyday, and cuss in his office whenever I heard him at home. I am only twelve years old right now, and whenever I empty the dishes, I always look at the knife in my hands and what to do. My mother told me if I died, she would cry everyday until she did too. A tear runs down my face every time I think about it.
I donâ€™t know what to do.
