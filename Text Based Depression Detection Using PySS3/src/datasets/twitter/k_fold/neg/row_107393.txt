Death and dyingIâ€™ve never been scared to die before because Iâ€™ve never given it much thought, but in my insignificant time on this planet I havenâ€™t accomplished much. If we are only able to go through our memories after death I feel as if thatâ€™s an even bigger let down than life. I donâ€™t believe in heaven, but I donâ€™t know that I believe in nothingness, either. I guess nothingness would be the preferred choice. Today has been especially suffocating, sorry if this is just a pointless post.
