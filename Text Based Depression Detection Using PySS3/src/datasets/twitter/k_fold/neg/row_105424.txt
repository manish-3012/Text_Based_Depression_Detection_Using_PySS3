everyday I get closer to ending itThe entire road of my life has been jagged rocks, as anyone's. I have a supportive family, yet I talk to them about it, they preach about how scared they are of me dying than actually helping me. I still don't have a *real* girlfriend, I've had online girlfriends but they didn't work out, mostly because I realized how pathetic it was. Then I realized how pathetic video games are, and how pathetic I am for being a slave to entertainment, when all I want is a relationship; yet no one talks on the bus. No one talks to me at school. All I get is resentful stares, like I should be dead. Maybe they're right. I'm so introverted and pathetic I might aswell just get into WoW and find a house with a basement.. probably just rent the basement, though. No way will I make enough money for a whole house. I'm only good in liberal arts, that's no way to get money. How am I supposed to live when my back hurts all the time, mind numbed by pain killers? How am I supposed to live when the only girl that cared about me was a childhood friend, and then never contacted me again? How am I supposed to live when all I have to rely on is venting on the internet to a bunch of equally sad peoples? How am I supposed to live when every girl I've asked out said, no, they'd rather be friends. I know why, I'm a little heavier than other guys. That's no problem, right? I could just lose it. How am I supposed to live when my mind is clouded with new ideas how to end it, new scenarios to plan to manipulate people into accidently killing me, strategic plans to make it look like an accident so I can seem like a hero in death, and not a tragedy. (none of you will actually read this because I'm not a female so you whiteknights can't hop on the "easy" train) How am I supposed to live when I want to scream at the top of my lungs to every person on earth that I want to kill myself, as if a desperate cry for help? It's been done before, it'll happen again. Funny thing is, when people romanticize "saving people" with major depression and the like, they won't go up to bat when there's someone right in front of them. I hear the same things over and over and over again, and for 5 years I've listened to those things. At first, the first 2 years worked well. Now, I'm on new meds, they adjusted well, and now I'm worse off than ever. Maybe it's a sign? Maybe I'm meant to end it, so I can inspire my brother- rather, so I can inspire my town. I'm a straight A student, but people at school only talk to me so they can get a better grade. I'm nothing but the nerd they use then throw away. I have so much feelings in my head- they're radiating to my chest. I've always been the outcast, I don't want to be. I don't want to conform, though. I've conformed before and that got me made fun of, now that I stand my ground, I get death stares, as if a threat and they're not brave enough to say what they want to say. Not enough people who are ready to challenge their own thoughts and opinions, not enough people who are open minded to music. But there's plenty of apartments, malls, and tacky restaurants! With a shitty public transport system to boot, so enjoy that! Oh, you don't have any money? Well just go to the rec center, they have foosball and billiards and a Wii! Wow! You can also skate around with your rad friends, brah!

I guess what I'm trying to say is,
I've become a clichÃ©.
