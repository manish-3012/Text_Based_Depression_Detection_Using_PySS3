I told my parents Iâ€™m going to kill myself and they just wished me the bestAs I was walking out of the door my mum said she hopes thatâ€™ll now make me happy. 

Nobody tried to stop me or check if I would be okay.

Iâ€™ve told them I feel suicidal about 3 times before, and theyâ€™ve pretty much brushed it off like itâ€™s just attention seeking.

Now idk about you but I think thatâ€™s pretty fcuked up. 

Of course your child is seeking attention they want to fcuking die because they cannot take life anymore. 

Iâ€™m just so sick of everything. I feel like I have no one I can turn to. 

My ex left me, I have no real friends and now my family have turned their back on me.

I just canâ€™t take this anymore.
