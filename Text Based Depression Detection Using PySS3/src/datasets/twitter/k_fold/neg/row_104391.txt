My whole life has gone to shit and I can't do this anymore.* I am in complete mental breakdown and can't bear to talk to anyone
* I'm losing all my memory and skills
* I wanna fucking kill myself
* Worst of all, I'm fucking 16 and wanna die
* What the fuck is wrong with me??????

I can't live with myself anymore. I'm actually gonna do this. I went from a guy with so much potential to this miserable piece of shit that has to go to this reddit thread to seek for help. I talked to counsellor and parents about it and I wished I hadn't. I'm so fucking paranoid............

Idk what to do
