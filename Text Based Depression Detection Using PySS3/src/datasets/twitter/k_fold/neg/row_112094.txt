i want to give up so badlychrist, covid has certainly made my life difficult with school. i am a pretty good student under normal, regular terms as i get good grades and do somewhat well. but something about working from home has absolutely destroyed everything in me. i canâ€™t focus and the voice inside me telling iâ€™m not good enough is just so loud and i feel absolutely zero motivation to keep going. i am beyond behind and everyone has given me shallow advice that does absolutely nothing to encourage me, and my parents as well have started to threaten me if i donâ€™t get this done, even if they say iâ€™m doing fine.  i get so many mixed signals. i just am so overwhelmed and along and ive tried to reach out and nothing. i donâ€™t have a plan exactly but i have an idea and i think i might just od when my parents go to sleep. i donâ€™t know if i will because i have absolutely no guts and will probably just cry all night because ill have to wake up to another day of this bullshit.
