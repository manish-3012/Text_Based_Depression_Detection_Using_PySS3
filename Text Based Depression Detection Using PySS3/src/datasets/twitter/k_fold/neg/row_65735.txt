None of my problems are temporaryThey say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but none of my problems are actually temporary. 

I have no family because they abused me. My foster family never liked me and made me feel bad for being mentally ill. I donâ€™t have any friends or family for real support to help me through my mental illness. Iâ€™ve been bullied by basically everyone I encounter. No one respects me.

my teeth are so fucked up. My jaw is misaligned and if I donâ€™t get ugly metal braces my jaw will collapse. Invisalign is too expensive and wonâ€™t straighten out my jaw. Iâ€™m in my early 20s. Iâ€™m too old to have braces. On top of that Iâ€™m short and skinny with a baby face. Everyone makes fun of how young I look and will treat me like an infant circus freak. If I get braces I will have to quit my job working at a bar because I know everyone will make fun of me for looking so young. Matter of fact, I feel like no one will give me any opportunities because of how I look and I will never be able to go outside again. I already face so much shit for how I look. 

everyone my age is graduating and I fucked up college really badly. I donâ€™t know what I want to do for a career and I feel like I fucked up too bad to ever recover. I should be finishing this year. Iâ€™m a huge loser. I can never sleep at a normal time or wake up before like 2pm. 

I hate life so much. Thereâ€™s zero reason for me to be alive. Everyone tells me it only gets worst and Iâ€™ve been abused and suicidal my whole life. I just want to not exist.
