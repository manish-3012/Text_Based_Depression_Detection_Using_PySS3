I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m worth it anymoreHello other human taking the time to read this. I am currently in a feeling of dread. I had a horrible flashback to my childhood and Iâ€™m thinking, is it even worth being alive at this point? Like itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m going to go far in life. So I donâ€™t know I feel like this pretty often, almost gone though with it a couple of times. I miss my old life, before all this shit came tumbling down, but even then my old life wasnâ€™t much better I was just free. And I lived with people who I actually enjoyed being around. I think the reason Iâ€™m writing this is because I want a platform to get all my thoughts out on something. If you stayed here though the end thank you for your time
