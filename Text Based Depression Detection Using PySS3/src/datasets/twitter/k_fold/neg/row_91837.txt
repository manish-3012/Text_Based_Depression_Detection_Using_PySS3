I don't know where to go or what to do. I can't even see myself 5 years from now.Let's make it quick. I'm almost 20. I've been verbally abused for a good chunk of my life, as well as bullied. I can't afford a therapist, or anything for that matter, because my only hope for money is social security. And because of that I can't escape. Every day feels like a burden. It's a miracle I've even held out this long.
