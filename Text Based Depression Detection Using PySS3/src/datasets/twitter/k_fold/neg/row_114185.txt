Should I open myself to my parents?I've been feeling low since i was 14. Now im 21. And its just getting harder for me. I started to consider suicide. I was always suicidal, but now im thinking it for real.

I'm not good with my parents. I dont know how they gonna react. I gave them hints about my depression in the past and my mom was like "Oh you just need to find purpose of your life.".

I live in different city for college and will visit them next week. I dont know if i should talk to them.
