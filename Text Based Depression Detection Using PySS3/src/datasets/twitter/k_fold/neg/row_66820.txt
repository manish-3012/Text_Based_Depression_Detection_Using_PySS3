I feel like suicide is inevitable. Is there anything I can do to fix my life?I'm 27 and trapped in a shitty job in a shitty city, partly due to my family and partly due to the fact that I was unable to pass job interviews while I was unemployed.

My dad is manipulative and got me a car seemingly so he could use it as leverage on me. If I'm not doing what he wants, he just reminds me he's sacrificing everything to make payments on the car for me. I was going to just give it back, but the transmission broke while I was going to a job interview out of state, and I was on the hook for the entire cost since he didn't want to pay for it.

He is very emotionally invested in the job he got me since he has friends there. I need to give 110% while he constantly polices me or he's going to look bad.

My problem is always going to be earning enough acceptance from other people to make money. I can live with being alone and single forever, but I can't live with doing a shitty job on top of that. I'd rather just kill myself than be stuck doing something horrible just to perpetuate a meaningless existence.

I've just taken off in the past on long road trips. If I do that now, I can expect to have the police called on me for something. My dad claimed someone stole my old car and took me hostage (all bs) and then when the police stopped me over that, they found a frivolous reason to give me a $100 ticket. One headlight being dimmer than the other. My dad has a drinking and gambling problem so of course he didn't cover the ticket he caused.
