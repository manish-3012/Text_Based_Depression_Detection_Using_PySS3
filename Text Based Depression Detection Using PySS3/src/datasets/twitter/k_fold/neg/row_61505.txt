I hate myself for telling my parents Iâ€™m suicidal. They took away all my pills and razors, I just went out and bought more razors anyways but fuck I wish I still had my pills. Iâ€™ve gotten drunk and high every night since I told them.I hate being another millennial that failed living on their own and moving back in to my parents basement. I hate life. I hate that I canâ€™t keep a job for more then a month, Iâ€™ve had 9 so far this year. I hate the pressure they put on me to go to college. I nearly lasted a semester before dropping out. I just wish I could die in an accident. I actively put myself into situations that might cause one. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can last. I would love to be able to die not in my parents home so they donâ€™t find me but fuck who knows what will happen.
