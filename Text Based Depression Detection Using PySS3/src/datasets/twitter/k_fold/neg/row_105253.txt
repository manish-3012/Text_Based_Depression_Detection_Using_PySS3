Did a couple of productive things after weeks of doing nothing, feel even more depressedI feel like Iâ€™m never gonna get out of this. Today I thought things were turning around and got some things done straightening up the house. But then the depression cane back and I havenâ€™t done anything else. 
 
This always happens. Iâ€™ll have a glimmer of hope and then it just goes away or I guess gets drowned out by depression. 

I canâ€™t live like this. Like I literally canâ€™t function anymore.
