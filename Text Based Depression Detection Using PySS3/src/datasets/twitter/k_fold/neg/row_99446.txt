Why not post?I am currently sitting in my room going through a new bottle of bourbon, i'm 23 and have started cutting again, the details of what led me hear are very complicated and long winded, i just hade a confrontation with my father which got physical, i didn't retaliate but he felt the need to escalate it to the point he did for whatever reason.
Last year i put a timer on myself that i would end it by the end of said year, one thing led to another and my father offered to house me(previously very abusive) and allow me to pursue a job I had in mind in Sydney Australia, as time went on the abuse grew to what it used to be, he now calls my work insulting me and it's become a big issue, i'm not stuck here with a job that's bound to fail despite everyone there singing my praises and fighting over me to be placed in their section.
It's gotten to the point where I can't push it away, and I want to live up to my previous promise to myself to end it, i have it all here, my note, weapon etc. if anyone wants to throw me a bone i have yet to think off feel free, im up for random stupid acts before i do it, even considered starting a stream of me doing stupid life endangering stuff because... why not?
