I know I can be happy I just don'tI struggle with some serious self destructiveness in that I know I should try and be more positive and find reasons to keep on going but when I try to I hold myself back.
I'm not really sure why but I think it might either be because I feel I don't deserve it, or because being slightly suicidal at all times is what's familiar.
I know being positive and embracing myself as a person would help and I think I know how to do it but I just don't.
It's the same with trying to open up I know I could do it and talk to people sometimes even with small things but I always stop myself last second. I even noticed myself becoming uncomfortable when someone tried to steer the conversation towards me. I way prefer talking about the other person and hearing their troubles.
Maybe the issue is I really don't know how to open up and be happy but sometimes I find myself slightly oversharing and instantly regretting it. So I don't know what the issue is.
