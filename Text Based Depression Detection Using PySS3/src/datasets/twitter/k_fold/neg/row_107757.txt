my mom wants me to kill myselfi donâ€™t know what i did to make her hate me so much. maybe itâ€™s because she wanted something different. my dads dead and my grandma moved away i canâ€™t go anywhere and she just keeps pushing me i want her to hurt i want her to feel the way i feel and maybe my death will teach her a lesson. i donâ€™t know what to do iâ€™m so tired theres nothing i can do. i was so close to doing it last night. i never meant to live this long i told myself i wouldnâ€™t live past 16 and im 18 now. iâ€™ve shut the whole world out i have one friend and three family members that care about me and a cat i tried to kill myseif on the first day of high school and lost everything i started online school and dropped out at 15 i couldnâ€™t handle it anymore because of my anxiety and i couldnâ€™t focus on anything and i failed 9th grade and gave up. iâ€™ll never be able to get a job or even handle it. i canâ€™t even be sober for one day iâ€™ve ruined myself and my body i probably wouldnâ€™t even make it past 30 itâ€™s impossible for me to survive in a world like this everyone is against me i hate myself and the way i feel i wish i could just be different. she told me she wished it worked when i tried to kill myself the first time. i was only 14 and she said that to me and sheâ€™s told me to kill myself multiple times since then. i donâ€™t know if she just says it in the heat of the moment to hurt me or if she really means it. i just donâ€™t understand what i did to make her hate me. sheâ€™s an alcoholic and a junkie addicted to suboxone like a fucking idiot and my dad died from alcoholism and i donâ€™t want to see the same thing happen to her. i think itâ€™s better this way i just canâ€™t fucking keep doing this every day.
