My whole life has been one big negativeEvery memory I have. All I remember is the negative. Even good times with friends, there was always a negative part about it. I turn 21 in April. My fucking life man. Iâ€™ve done absolutely nothing meaningful with my life. Iâ€™ve had moments of big motivation but it always ends in failure. A recurring thought In my head is my life was meant to end via suicide. No matter what, no matter how much support. It was meant to end via suicide. Even if I get support and stuff. I feel like I was placed as a pawn to show my community that with depression and substance abuse, it goes beyond support. No one truly understands mental illness yet. You guys, my family. They donâ€™t understand us truly. Itâ€™s always â€œgoto therapy, AA, pillsâ€ they still donâ€™t get it yet. 

Maybe Iâ€™ll be the turning point? Probably not. Iâ€™ll probably just become another stat in Canadaâ€™s yearly suicide rate. 

Edit: I honestly donâ€™t even know how fucking old I am. :,(. My memory is fading. Forgetting who I am. Hopefully Iâ€™ll just forget enough where I donâ€™t remember my pain.
