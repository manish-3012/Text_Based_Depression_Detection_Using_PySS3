I am good at nothing, why to live?I am good at nothing, I have tried everything. I have no luck in life. I have tried playing guitar, trying learning programming, tried painting, tried  scoring good. I have no fucking luck, I want to kill someone or get killed. I have no no luck, I can't learn anything. My brain is too small, why to live?
