I really wish my life didnâ€™t have to go this way and I have no other option than suicideMan, shits fucked up im gonna be 18 in a month and I want to die. But Iâ€™ve got actual problems. I remember when I was soo happy at 16, then I get diagnosed with a neuromuscular disease at 17. Depression, crying, suicidal actions, complete mute. I used to be so happy and talkative. I donâ€™t even look people in the eye anymore. I donâ€™t talk even with my family. I have no happiness whatsoever

I donâ€™t wanna live and continue to lose muscle and be crippled. My feet are just bone now and itâ€™s spreading. My legs are getting weak. My dad is talking about buying me a car but what if I canâ€™t drive? Itâ€™s so much pressure on my shoulders. Iâ€™ll never have a chance to get a girlfriend cause of this, Iâ€™ll be too embarrassed. 

My dad talking about if there wasnâ€™t covid Iâ€™d be on a flight to California for my birthday. Great, because I canâ€™t experience life anymore because Iâ€™ve gotta commit suicide. My muscles/nerves are a ticking time bomb. 

Iâ€™m scared to tell my dad to stop his plans in buying these stuff and setting my life to live a good life since Iâ€™m gonna commit suicide in the next few years. Itâ€™s so shitty.
