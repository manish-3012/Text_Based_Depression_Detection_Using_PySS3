Not good with titlesI was cheated on and told that i was useless and told was an awful person by those close to me. I've been left alone and severely depressed. I built the strength it took to go to ans get help and am now on drugs that restrict a lot of basic movement and thinking. I feel like a vegetable and can't get any better. Everywhere i go, all those who wronged me are there, mocking me and making my depression even worse than it already is. I've tried to find ways to get help or find other ways to go about my life, but i either don't have the money and the power to do so. I've been so extremely depressed for over 2 months now and i am seriously doubting I'll make it to my next birthday. it's so scary and cruel and i need someone badly.
