I'm so donei need to end it but i can't find my belt. Did my mum hide it from me? If that's the case, why and why isn't she helping me if she hid it to prevent me comitting suicide?

 i hate everything. I'm frustrated, tired, i can't focus on anyhting, nothing that i used to enjoy makes me feel better anymore.

 I'm really consideriing killing myself but i'm a coward, i'm afraid of pain and afraid of hurting my sweet and caring boyfriend. I do my best to live, for him. He's the only one that i love. It might sound stupid, but it's a long distance relationship that we have. He's very supportive and everytime he notices that i'm not feeling very well, he wants to listen to me talk about it. It's literally the sweetest thing someone can do for me, but i can't talk about my pain with him. Since we live so far away from each other, he suffers a lot because he can't be here with me to take care of me. If i talk about it with him, he gets really really sad and hearing crying because he's sorry that he can't really do anything to make me feel better, breaks my heart. I can't stand it.

i'm sorry, my love.
