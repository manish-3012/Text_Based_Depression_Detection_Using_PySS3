How do I tell them I want to kill myself?I've had a good chance to tell someone I'm suicidal, but I didn't. I don't know why. How could I tell someone this? How will I ever get such a good experience again? 

I can't go back to school Monday, that is what's causing my pain. I need a solution quick... please.
