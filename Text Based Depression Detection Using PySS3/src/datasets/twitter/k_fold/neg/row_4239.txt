I would like someone to talk toOn the surface, I live a great life. I am a 17 year old Austrian guy, come from a well to do family, go to a good school and get decent grades. I am well liked, but known to be more of a quiet and not so social guy, but incredibly intelligent and I seem to get along with everyone. I have my hobbies: hiking, mountain biking and building Lego sail boats and would be considered far above average attractiveness in terms of my physical appearance by most people.

The problem is that on the inside I am a wreck. It's hard to even describe how I really am on the inside. Recently I have contemplated suicide a couple of times. I get anxious and paranoid in social settings, I don't feel strong emotional bonds to anyone and spend more time in my head creating idealized versions of my life and the people around me, than I do in real life. Because of this I feel as though I have nobody to talk to because nobody who knows me would believe me. I have tried talking to people in my class, however they only see my outside. I am terrified of failure and even my own thoughts sometimes. I am manipulative and a compulsive liar, but nobody sees it. I would do anything to look good and the lengths I have gone to do so, have always horrified me in hindsight.

My outlook on the future is also depressing, as I see no point in working hard and getting good grades in school, to get into a university to study for 3 years, and then to work and be miserable for 40 years to make money to survive and then live out the rest if my life as an old man, with no use for any money I end up making.

I also daydream and fantasize a lot about how I would like to live, but know that I will never be able to achieve my ideals. In short, I just want to chat to someone who doesn't know me, but am to scared to do it face to face. Maybe that will stop me from getting suicidal thoughts.
