Here we are again.Yesterday I was really considering suicide, but instead I posted to a Star Wars Leaks sub about my problem and how Star Wars is basically what stopped me from going through with it because I NEED to see The Force Awakens. Everybody was so supportive. I got over 200 people writing to me and telling me everything will be fine and I felt so happy afterwards, but tonight I feel empty again. I'm only 23 and I just feel so empty. I feel like the biggest cunt in the world because all those people reached out to me and I feel I'm letting them down by feeling like this again. I just don't know what to do. Even the thought of getting to see a new Star Wars isn't reassuring anymore. I'm in my friend's house right now. He's changed his life so much this year, he lost 9stone, found himself his first proper girlfriend and I'm so proud of him, but I feel like I'm pissing on his parade with how I've been lately. He doesn't realize that 5 feet from him, is a friend who wants to walk up to the park and not come back. I feel so alone. You don't know true hatred till you hate yourself, I believe that.
