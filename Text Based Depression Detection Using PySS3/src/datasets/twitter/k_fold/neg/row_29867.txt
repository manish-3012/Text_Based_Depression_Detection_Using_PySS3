It's hopelessI'm about to lose my job, it seems.

I feel like I'm about to vomit and cry and I'm only going in because I have to keep the job. I should care more about getting paid but that's not even on my mind anymore. I guess I'm used to getting screwed on that end too.

If I lose my job, I probably lose my chance at TMS and any hope of any remission of this depression ever.

Like why am I still fighting? Why even drag this out?

Realistically I shouldn't be going into work because my means of suicide this round is bloody right there but,

Oh well.

I always seem to wake up tomorrow, so what's gonna change this time?
