couldnt think about a non cheesy title so have thisHi, I donâ€™t know why Im writing this maybe just to see what people outside think.

Iâ€™m 19 years old, I got two siblings a big sister and a young brother and two parents and Im getting along with all of them really well they love me and I love them, I got friends and friends Im more close with and they are there for me whenever I need them to, my job is exactly what I wanted it to be, my parents and I are financially ok, I got everything I want and more, I came out to everyone as homosexual without even one person saying anything bad about it, I never suffered a loss, I donâ€™t know what else good in my life to mention but Im pretty sure you get the idea.

I got all that, all those good things about my life, some would say my lifeâ€™s perfect, I would say theyâ€™re perfect, and I am still suicidal. 
Why?
Why on earth should I be suicidal when I got all that?

There is one thing in my life that makes me feel that and it is the fact I am without a partner.
It makes me feel way too sad about it, makes me feel like nothing else matters, like non of the things above matter, which is not true I know all of these matter way more than finding a partner but I donâ€™t feel it.

It took me 5 years to â€˜acceptâ€™ or at least being opened up enough to talk about my sexuality and come out.
During those five years I shut myself I didnâ€™t let anyone know anything about me, the only things I said were either lies or stories about things I did with other people. 0 conversations about how I feel about anything, I even lied about my music taste.
During these five years I was introduced to self harm, I used to cut myself at first because I thought people would see and realize something was wrong about me but with time self harm made me feel momentarily better every time I felt bad. I had many thoughts about suicide, two suicide attempts were interrupted by people without them knowing I was trying to commit suicide. But all that is irrelevant I just said that so youâ€™ll get the idea of how I got to self harming.
After I came out I thought I felt better and thought Ill be opened about everything but I was not opened about my suicidal thoughts and my self harming they never left me till this day I am self harming and having suicidal thoughts.
I am seeing a psychologist once in every two or three weeks which is what I can get from my job. Iâ€™ve been seeing her over a year now and I have not felt any difference, it feel like weâ€™re using a plaster on a broken arm. I feel like weâ€™re working about everything around the problem and not the problem itself. She told me whatâ€™s her plan to make me feel better and it made sense to me, but its not working.

I just wanted to see what other people who are not familiar with me think about my situation. Iâ€™d appreciate honesty even if it isnâ€™t pretty. 

Thank you for your time if you read this.
