She didn't seem to care much. Long post.I began dating a girl I met on here a week and a half ago but we broke up because I'm a unlovable, unlikable, undeserving, piece of shit, good for nothing person. I let my problems get in the way of the best thing to happen to me and now I don't know what to do. I broke up with her for many reasons but the top two reasons were because of my hatred for myself and that I don't deserve her and I never will. The second reason was to see if she actually cared enough to try to stay together. It was going amazingly well for a week but a couple days ago we told each other that we loved one another and my anxiety and depression just went into overdrive after that. Ik that most of u will say that what we had wasn't love, it probably wasn't even a relationship but I truly believe it was love, for me at least. At the end when I was talking about breaking up, she just seemed to not really care, she treated me like a stranger on the internet and not the boyfriend she supposedly loved. I don't know anymore. I'm a horrible and selfish person and I know it. She stopped me from killing my self but now it looks like I'm back to where I started.
