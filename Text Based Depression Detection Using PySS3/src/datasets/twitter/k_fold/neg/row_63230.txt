idk what to doMy life is going down hill. I don't know what to do. No one gives a shit about me and the last time i tried to reach out for help and call a prevention hotline, i got locked up in a psychiatric ward with a bunch of teenage girls (im a male). I'm so fucking depressed and I don't feel like I can go on in life. I just want to be wanted and loved. I feel like a drain on society. I started taking some meds but they didnt help at all. I might go jump off a bridge. There is no hope. All i can do is piss all my friends off and be a burdon on everyone around me.
