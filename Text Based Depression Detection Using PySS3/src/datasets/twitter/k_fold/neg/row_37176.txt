Do you have anything to say to someone who has suicidal thoughts about being circumcisedI know there are other pleasures in life to live for, such as food, looking at cute faces, the potential pleasure of social interactoin, curiosity pleasure of learning science, seeing what the 2050s will be like, etc. So im not gonna do it, but i still have mental pain every time i look at altered-from-nature penis, like holy shit this is my only reality and i'm frickin stuck and there's no escape

But i am so frickin fixated on the fact that circumcision robbed me of sexual pleasure, one of the best things about being a human. Nature gave us the gift of being able to experience pleasure/bliss as a motivator to achieve biological goals, instead of us just being robots who automatically have sex without any feeling, and I cant experience that to the fullest. it would've been so easy for my parents to just tell the doctor not to do it. My only existence has been altered from nature, natural human body is beautiful and it just had to be altered, i cannot believe this happened to me. Humans are supposed to derive happiness/confidence from pride of their genitals, optimism due to ability to engage in pleasurable nature act. I am doing foreskin restoratoin, which provides psychological relief but it still takes many years to complete. 

Jews invented circumcision as a covenant to sacrifice sexual pleasure to show devotion to god or something like that.
