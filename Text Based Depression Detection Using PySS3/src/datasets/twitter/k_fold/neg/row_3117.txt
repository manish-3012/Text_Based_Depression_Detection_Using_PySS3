My wife hates my familyI love my wife and my baby girl so much, my daughter is my pride and joy. But I feel like I can't provide anything for them. I work a dead end job and I never finished school. Even though I went from part time to full time everything is getting taken on taxes anyways so it's like I didn't even get a promotion. We don't have a house or an apartment we stay with her folks. The reason we stay with her folks is because she refused to step foot in mine. She's never liked my mom or dad, and my two younger brothers are on the spectrum ( one is autistic and the other has ADHD)

Today my mother returned from a month long trip and I asked my wife if she wanted to go visit with me. She rejected my plans and instead told me to pick up our daughter and take her with me to my mother's house. My wife informed me that I could keep the baby for the night and she would pick her up in the morning. Except not one hour later my wife shows up and saw my mom holding my daughter and my wife got mad. She grabbed the baby put her in the car and was about to drive away. My wife didn't ask me if I wanted to go or to say bye to my own baby. She started her car and was about to leave. I stopped her by holding the door. She proceeded to accuse me of not taking care of my own daughter, that I had probably just locked myself in my room and left the baby with my mother. I told her that she was being ridiculous and that my mother deserves to hold her granddaughter as much as her mom holds her.

After about 1 hour of talking she drives away and I struggle to see what I'm even alive for. I can't choose my wife and child over my mother and brothers especially since my grandfather passed away just 3 days ago.
