I'm feeling a bizarre peace. Hard to explain, but I could quietly kill myself now.Just die, die in peace, without remorse, without despair. It's as if I've accepted that things have no way for me. As hard as I try, they will never be the way I want. So ... I was able to accept, and I'm very happy, for the first time in all these years I was able to accept that there is no way and I need to die. I'm feeling fulfilled and at peace, I just need to kill myself finally, finally be free. I have sought this freedom for many years, all my life. I'll finally be free, I'm feeling so alive now
