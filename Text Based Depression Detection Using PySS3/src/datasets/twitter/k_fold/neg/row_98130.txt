2nd time postingHi everyone. This is my second time posting and Iâ€™m honestly surprised Iâ€™m even here to make it. Itâ€™s my 20th birthday today. I have a severe case of strep throat. Today I woke up feeling better than I had in a few days. Less achy and sore. My mom was wonderful and make me my favorite breakfast and the Chiefs won. I still feel empty. I went to watch Netflix in the other room and my mom makes a comment about putting my dog down. I visit my grandma and grandpa because theyâ€™re my favorite people on earth. I help her write an email and I feel needed but still so empty. I love her. I stay so late at her house that I canâ€™t make it to my home at college so I have to create an outfit for dinner in what I have at home and I donâ€™t like it. I have to do my hair and makeup with whatâ€™s there too. I came home in a hurry after I got found out I was sick. My mom and dad leave before me to get a table at the restaurant for all of us. Iâ€™m running very late. I get in my car to find my gas light is on because, even though I just got it this week, thereâ€™s a problem and my dad needed to look at it. So my mom drove it to and from work and for any errands she needs. I have to fill it up at the scary gas station and get stared down by a scary man. But Iâ€™m not scared. Iâ€™m hoping heâ€™ll do something bad. I drive all the way to my college town and pick up my two friends. One of whom is very sweet and says â€œoh I totally understand why youâ€™re lateâ€ and the other continues to make comments about me being incapable of being on time to anything. We go to dinner and I try to talk but in crowds I shut down. Nothing I have to say is worth anything anyway. My friends talk more to each other than me. After we all leave my friends continue to talk to each other more and more. They even decide to take the dog on a walk without me because theyâ€™ve my throat hurts and I wouldnâ€™t want to come. They yell up at me that I need to move my car for a neighbor and I leave. They do not text me. They do not call. They do not ask where I went or why I went there. I finally text one of them to explain and she responds with sheâ€™s sorry but she stays. I continue to explain and she continues to stay where she is. On my birthday with a friend I introduced her to. I finally explode in a long winded text about how itâ€™s happened to me many times that I introduce friends and then get kicked out. I tell her that her â€œI love youâ€ and her â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€ doesnâ€™t mean anything because sheâ€™s still doing the thing sheâ€™s â€œsorryâ€ for. I am now selfish because I donâ€™t want them to hang out without me. I texted my mom about this. She hasnâ€™t respond. All of this proves to me I have no one. My grandma couldnâ€™t wait to talk about my cousins. Or my brotherâ€™s girlfriend. Or why donâ€™t I have a boyfriend. I chose the restaurant because my friend is celiac and she can eat their food. But I am a doormat. I do not matter. I am empty. There are moments when a flame flickers inside me but not for long before someone or something puts it out. I am 20. I have fought for 20 years. I do not want to fight for 20 more. Or 10 more. Or even another day. Iâ€™ve made it to 20 and I can say it really doesnâ€™t get better.
