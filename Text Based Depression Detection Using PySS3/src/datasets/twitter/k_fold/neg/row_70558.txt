Feel nothing at allI feel stupid and worthless and put on an act for everyone. I fell for someone I barely knew and thought it would work but it didnâ€™t. I feel betrayed by life and Iâ€™m in my 30s never been in love. This guy was my last chance and his grief over a death changed him and pulled him from me and now he wonâ€™t talk to me. It went from amazing to awful. I know itâ€™s selfish to be sad about losing someone I barely knew when his world turned upside down but I guess Iâ€™m selfish. 

I seriously cannot see a way out of this. Iâ€™ve been depressed before for like three weeks at a time but this has been three months now. Iâ€™ve lost all motivation and donâ€™t believe in God anymore and honestly just donâ€™t care. 

Not looking for advice just venting. I wish I had the balls to kill myself.
