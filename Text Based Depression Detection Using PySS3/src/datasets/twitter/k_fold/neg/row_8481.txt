I'm worthless to this worldI am worth shit to this world. I feel so rejected and hated by everyone. I can tell that I'm different and a step behind. Everyone else seems to understand to a degree what's happening and have some goals to work towards but I just don't. 

I spend most of my down time writing music but other than that I have nothing. The music being a career would bring me some self worth and sense of achievement but it hurts to know that it's not in the cards for me.

What hurts the absolute worst though is the rejection. I've always known I was different. Hell, just this weekend I felt the most rejection I've felt in a while. I was hanging out with my younger sister and some friends not too far from my older sister's house. 

We decided to drive by (separate cars, btw) and have our older sister bring our 7month old niece out so we could see them. She brings our niece out to my younger sister's car and then just goes back inside without even a wave or look in my direction. She knew I was there too. That shit hurts. Apparently a wave hello is too much to ask. There's always joking that I'm the uncle that's a "bad influence" and I take it in stride but to see it reinforced this weekend by not being able to say hello to my niece just really hurt and beat me down even further.

TL;DR- I've seen several instances that reinforce my view that I'm worthless to the world and that barely anyone gives a shit about me. I'm even pushing people away at this point because they're going to hurt me eventually.
