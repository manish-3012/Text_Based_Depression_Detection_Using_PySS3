Isnâ€™t suicide considered self defense because youre killing the person whoâ€™s trying to kill you?I donâ€™t understand why suicide is such a bad thing... I mean I do, but at this point it seems like my only option. Iâ€™ve been off my medication since the summer and I just canâ€™t do this shit anymore. Lmao. Being on medication took the edge off and made it a bit more bearable, but also being on medication made me think I was delusional. It creates a false reality that makes you think youâ€™re getting better when in reality youâ€™re still the same fucked up person. Maybe I need to be on meds. I agree. But at this point Iâ€™m relishing in these suicidal thoughts. It gives me hope that one day Iâ€™ll actually end my life
