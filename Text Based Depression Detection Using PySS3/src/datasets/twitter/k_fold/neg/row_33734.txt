What should I do when I feel so tired of this life?First I want to say I really really donâ€™t know how to explain my feelings and what words to use. Suddenly I started feeling weird and I donâ€™t even know how to describe it. So Iâ€™m sorry if what you read doesnâ€™t make any sense.
For past 2 years Iâ€™ve been living the same life. Everyday is same as the day before. The only difference is more problems are being added to my life with no way I can deal with.
After 4 years, for the first time I took 2 days off for my self and went to a resort with my girlfriend. I didnâ€™t think about any of the problems I had and only enjoyed my time with the person I love the most.
Yesterday was the last day and I came back to my home with my family (parents, grandparents and uncles. We all live together). Today I started having this weird feeling like Iâ€™m tired of everything and everyone. I hate this life and I rather donâ€™t live in it anymore. I feel like there is something heavy in my chest and I donâ€™t know how to get rid of it. Itâ€™s like nothing changes whether i exist or not and in no way Iâ€™m any help to anyone. I donâ€™t know what to do with my life anymore.
