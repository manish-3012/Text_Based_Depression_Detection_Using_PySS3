Just can't let goI wanna start off by saying that i never really had this type of "very close" person in my life other than my mother. She thinks that meds will help in every single problem and i really do love her to death, but she truly is not helping at this point. And i know that for a fact.  (So let's get into this)   So i met this beautiful person like couple months ago, and we became so close. And i honestly felt like she was really the one i could always lean on, and talk to. But then things got different and we started fighting constantly, of course it made me sad that it might just end like this and it did. But then i started to accept the fact that she is now gone and that it would be better off that way. However these last couple of days have been sad, awful. It's like i'm trying to do things that make me happy but nothing helps. it's like i'm trying to forget her and her narcissistic personality. *Yes i truly mean that*, but in some weird way i really do miss her a lot, but i don't want to go back to that life, where she would be a part of my life. Reading this stuff that i wrote, and i know some of you might find this ridiculous/odd. But it really is a strange feeling. :/ Any help is truly appreciated. &lt;3
