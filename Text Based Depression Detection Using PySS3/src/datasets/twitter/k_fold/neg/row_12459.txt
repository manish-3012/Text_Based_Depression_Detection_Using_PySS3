Accomplice or accessory to sexual assault by deception when I was 16. I'm now 29 and have been suicidal on and off since then and have been spiraling but don't know the best way forward.I've been thinking about this for almost half of my life but have never written it down. I'll break it into a few parts. 

&amp;#x200B;

\--What happened--

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 16 and still completely inexperienced with sex and relationships i was at a bush/forest party where everyone was camping for the night. There was a girl there who was a little older than me and was sexually adventurous and enjoyed trying to flirt and have sex with inexperienced guys. She was interested in me and I didnt know what to do. At this party she invited me into a tent with a few other guys in it where some group sex was going to take place. I agreed to go even though I was scared and uncomfortable. I lost my nerve and left the tent without participating and my friends and I decided to "swap me out" with another guy. So we traded shirts. This other guy went into the tent and received a brief handjob and was found out and she kicked him out of the tent. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt terrible after when i realized who i actually was if i was capable of that. I didn't do it out of any form of lust or sexual desire just pure fear of being seen as a coward or pathetic virgin. I could give you all sorts of excuses about how this behavior was "normal" in my friend group and all the despicable shit my friends did, or how i saw it as a comedy bit it movies, but none of that changes what I did. 

She knows what I did but i never talked to her about it. Ive talked to her a handful of times since then but have never apologized.

\--Current problem --

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that what i did was illegal and that it was a terrible thing to do but i cant change what i've done.  Ive hurt someone that was nice enough to be attracted to me, and there's nothing I can do to erase my actions. I considered suicide multiple times and engaged in reckless behavior on motorcycles and at work hoping to get into accidents. I walked bridges and fantasized about driving my car into things. The reason I never went through with it is part cowardice and part fear of what would happen to my family if I committed suicide. 

My mom is chronically depressed and turns out was abused as a child and has told me since, that her biggest fear is that she'd pass on her depression to me and my brother.  We've had a few suicides in the family i've seen how they aren't really clean ends to things.

 I'm also worried how she'd take her son becoming a perpetrator of sexual crimes given her history. I'm trying to be the best person i can be, I don't hang around with any of those people anymore, and have never been involved in anything else remotely similar to this, but it doesn't help me get out of these cycles of guilt and I don't know if it should. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the last 5 or 6 years i get caught in loops trying to think of a path forward that hurts the least amount of people.  

&amp;#x200B;

Path 1. 

I commit suicide.  

This proves that I feel remorse and decreases the chances my family finds out which would hurt especially my mother and could possibly end her life which would hurt the family, all of whom shouldn't be responsible for my actions.

&amp;#x200B;

Path 2. 

I apologize to the girl. 

Ive considered this for a long time but have read and think i agree with that the victims of sexual assault don't like to be bothered, especially if i have my own motivations for an apology. I'm also worried that this might cause her to out me to my family which is completely within her right. But i struggle with thinking about the pain in my family that would cause and how it still wouldn't change what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Path 3. 

My family eventually finds out. 

This is fairly possible but if my family found out I don't think i could bear to stay alive. which would mean my mom might commit suicide and family would be hurt even more than Path 1 

&amp;#x200B;

Path 4. 

 No one ever finds out. 

This seems possible. But i dont think I'd be able to live in this state indefinitely. At some point if something doesnt happen I wont be able to take it anymore. Another problem with this path is I dont know if i can live my life alone with this guilt. I've had a couple serious relationships but I start getting ashamed and panicky when they progress because i think i dont deserve to have them. And even if someone could accept what ive done, how could i raise kids without being a hypocrite?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I just keep getting stuck in these loops, and I think i deserve it. But i don't know what option will cause the least misery to the people around me. Should i just try to bear down and live a solitary life so that i don't have to put my family through any more suicides and hope that they never find out? Or should I just end it now?
