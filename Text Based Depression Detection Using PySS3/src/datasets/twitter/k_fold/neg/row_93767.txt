The reason to keep living left meI had cancer as a kid and those memories did always haunt me. I was about to kill myself and met this girl online. We liked each other's humor and everything, we didn't even really knew how we looked like. But after some weeks of daily chatting and doing that also through the nights, so for hours and hours, we had feelings for each other. 

She lives far away, so first we couldn't see each other. My mom suddenly asked some months later, on a hot summer day:"do you want to drive to  [city where she lives], then you can also see your girlfriend"

So we drove there, slept in the car just so I can see her for a week. 

The year after I went there by bus, a 14 hour ride, and stayed for 3 weeks at a friend in made there.

This year I was there and did an apprenticeship in the same daycare center as her. I loved the work with the children and that she was also there. That gave me some family vibes.

Some things happened and now she left me. 
She wanted to decide if we maybe get back together but she decided it would be better if not.

She left me just some weeks before I would've moved there and would've been with her.

So now I'm back with all that pain from the past and this just adds to it. 
I cried for a hour and feel like shit. 

I'm currently at my mom's place, so I decided to smoke a bit pot and now went downstairs and started to drink some beer. At least now I don't feel as much like shit.

I've thought about killing myself the whole time. How to do it and where. I'm thinking about several ways. Hanging myself, jumping in front of a vehicle or train, let myself fall on a knife with my chest/heart, steal a small plane and at least have a flight before heading into the ground or just going outside and freezing to death over night. 

It's not only like it's an option, but as if I need to do it. As if I finally have to end it. My whole life feels like I wasn't meant to survive cancer and now I'm punished my whole life for that. 

I just don't know how to keep going, now that my last bit of motivation, my last bit of hope is gone.
I simply feel like I have to give up. That nothing will ever change to something good. 
I feel like being to weak to carry on.
