I have no reason to be sad and that just makes it worse.For a while now i have been feeling worthless and have just had no will to live really. But i can't figure out what is making me feel this way, I see other people who have been through way worse than i have and it makes me think that im just being overdramatic which makes it worse because I get angry at myself for feeling the way I do. 

This has also made it hard to talk to people about how i am feeling because i dont want to bother other people with something that is just a waste of their time.
