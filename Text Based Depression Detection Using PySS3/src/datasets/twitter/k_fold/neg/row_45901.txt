Genuinely searching for a reason to hold on toYesterday was my birthday and midnight marks a new year. I didn't want to make it to a new year in either sense. I don't have the energy to explain all the trauma and horrible things to happen that have brought me to this point and I don't want to hear "it gets better" or any shit about time. I've struggled with this for 4 years and it only gets worse. I've done countless types of therapy, medication, exercise, yoga, meditation, journaling, socializing...I've tried it endlessly and nothing helps. I've lost every single thing I've cared about. I've tried to find something to hold on to. Something to fight for. A reason to live. I've tried but nothing matters to me. I've stopped caring about all my hobbies and passions and dreams. I've begged loved ones and counselors to help me, to give me a reason to live, and nobody will. Does anybody that can actually relate have any advice or a reason that might actually matter to me?
