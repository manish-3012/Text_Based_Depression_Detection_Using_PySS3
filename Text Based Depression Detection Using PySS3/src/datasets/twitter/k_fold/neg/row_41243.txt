I Want to Never Wake Up AgainHey everyone in reddit cyber land.  You don't know me and I don't know you.  I'm 26/f from the southern US.  I am attractive I guess.  I don't think I have any redeeming qualities.  I think people who commit suicide go to hell; so I have never done it.  However, I am praying to God that he will take me in my sleep.  I have a beautiful daughter and a nice life.  But I am in emotional pain all the time.  I spend 75% of my day crying.  I hate myself and my life.  I think I am the most worthless person that has ever existed.  I just don't want to live anymore.  I have no friends.  I have a boy friend, but he doesn't get me.  He just gets frustrated with me like everyone else.  I've tried to dump him, but he keeps saying that I'm breaking his heart so we get back together.  I hate living.  There is no amount of "you have good things in your life and people who love you" that will make me want to continue to live.  I really really want to die.
