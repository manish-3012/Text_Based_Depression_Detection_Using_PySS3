I'm picturing what happens after my suicideI've struggeled this whole past year to keep breathing and getting trough the semester but my teacher just emailed me saying I'm flunking her class. I'm freaking out. I get one last chance to pass next week but I don't think I can do it and I'm freaking out.

This is the first year I've actually thought about killing myself, in a literal sense, not just in a jokingly distancing kind of way. Every second I spend thinking about it I know I normalize it more and more and I come one step closer to actually doing it. I'm going over all the things I would have to do beforehand. Write my family notes, plan my funeral, clean up my room, quit my job, notify my school. I'm going over the scenarios in my head. My parents finding me. My funeral. My friends reading their notes. My sister finding out. My teacher telling the class. 

It hust hurts so much. Maybe flunking seems like a trivial things but its the grand whole of it, you know. And it wont stop hurting. It this is the life I'm given I don't want it and I know that makes me an ungrateful piece of shit but it hurts so much.

I just needed to vent. I just need someone to here me. You dont have to help or anything. Just read and reply something, anything. I'm sorry if this triggers you or makes you feel worse.
