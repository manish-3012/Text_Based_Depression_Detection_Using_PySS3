I'm sorryIt seems like every girl I meet is just bound to let me down.  I've been dating this girl for a couple of months and I invited her out for my best friend's birthday.  First she invites her friend last minute and then she expects me to drive 30 min out of the way to pick her up.

As soon as we get to the venue, she's out with her friend trying to hook her friend up with random guys.  Eventually, my friends tell me "hey man, she's been with that girl all night and talking to random guys, you should say something." Eventually I did and I confronted her because I invited her to hang out with her and introduce her to my friends. She gets defensive and tells me it's not a big deal.  I then leave the venue and grab a ride home.

If anyone is reading this, thank you, you truly have made my night.  If I sound needy, let me know. I guess I'm using this as a means to vent and I am sort of drunk right now.  Thanks for reading.
