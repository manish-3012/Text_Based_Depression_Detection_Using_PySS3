I haven't done anything, but I've come to a decision.I've decided that if I were to ever actually go through with committing suicide, I would want it to be livestreamed, or recorded in some form of video.  I know that it's been done before, but I figure that if some sick arse finds it entertaining then that's at least one person entertained and not annoyed at my existence.  My existence, or lack thereof, would not be an inconvenience to them, or something to be ignored, it would be something for them to revel in.  I figure that's something.
