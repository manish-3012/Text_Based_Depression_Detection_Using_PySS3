I think I found a creative way to dieHey,
My name is Kyia. Iâ€™m a highschool student, age 14. I guess Iâ€™m a curious person and have never really been scared of death.. Iâ€™m in this situation where I really donâ€™t know what to do.. Iâ€™m confused..  I feel strange.. but I canâ€™t cry.. Iâ€™ve never had friends.. at a young age I moved counties and got bullied a lot. 3 years back, I moved here. Before that, I was so alone.. so so alone.. Iâ€™m scared of ever feeling that way again.. but here.. the friends I made are against me.. the teachers are sick of my problems.. my parents are annoyed.. but I think the worst is..that itâ€™s not even about friends anymore.. I realized that Iâ€™m a failure.. Iâ€™m sick with not only myself, but people aswell.. how cruel they can be.. how fake.. I donâ€™t fit here.. i canâ€™t hurt people like they do and not feel bad about it.. Iâ€™ve always loved making people laugh.. even with a severe lack of self confidence, Iâ€™d still be the class clown just to see people smile.. It made me feel... useful for once.. but Iâ€™ve lost that feeling..

I dont think anything can help anymore, so I thought what the point was.. why live? I hate it here. I hate living. But I donâ€™t wanna make it obvious that I killed myself. So I think Iâ€™m gonna make myself anemic and gradually die of heart failure. But Iâ€™m still kinda curious.. how long would that take? Can someone please tell me, Iâ€™m curious. 

But I guess itâ€™s a different form of self harm.. makes me feel better.. Iâ€™ve actually started eating as little iron as possible so that nobody would really notice since I go on extreme diets a lot.  Hopefully this is quick. If itâ€™s not.. I canâ€™t..  you see, nobody really cares. Maybe ur family and friends do,  unless you have no friends and ur family is always annoyed at u.
