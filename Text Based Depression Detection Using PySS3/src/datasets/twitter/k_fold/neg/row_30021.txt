A cycle of suicidal thoughts and bipolar maniaIf it wouldn't dampen the souls of my few fellow brothers and family I can surely say my time here would be done. There's been too much to happen in this life. The trauma, while maybe it can be temporality mitigated, it always surfaces to the top. Every day is pain.

Everyday is agony. The ups and down, cycle like the pistons in an engine. One second rising with a false euphoria, and the next crashing down below the harrowing depression. It'll never be undone, and despite my efforts i'm drained. What's that old saying, oh, yeah, "Sick and tired of being sick and tired." I get to some people I may seem young, but on the inside i feel the negativity and darkness swell. Memories, as vivid as current day are solidified.

 Im broken, and  despite how much I try, I cannot knock the feeling that my day is surely approaching.
