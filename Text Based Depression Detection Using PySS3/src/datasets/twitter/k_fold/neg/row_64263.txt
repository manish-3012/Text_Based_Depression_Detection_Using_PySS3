Making a suicide planI just ruined my relationship with the only person in this world besides family who I love because Iâ€™m a horrible, weak, insecure person and I let my anxious compulsions take over.  I hurt her, and I broke her trust.  I donâ€™t deserve her, but I cannot live without her.  Iâ€™ve decided I donâ€™t deserve to live.  I just made a list of all the things I need to do before I kill myself.  Itâ€™s fairly short, because Iâ€™m only 18 and am still just in college, so I think I can get it all done tomorrow.  Unless something drastically changes, Iâ€™m killing myself then.  I would tell her, but I donâ€™t want her to think Iâ€™m trying to manipulate her into forgiving me.  I want her forgiveness more than anything on this earth, but Iâ€™m terrible, and I do not deserve it, or her.  Life is pointless without love, and I donâ€™t deserve love, so itâ€™s time for me to die.  Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™ll hang myself, but I donâ€™t know where to hang from.  Slitting my wrists would be very hard to hide if my attempt fails, but it might be the easiest way to get the job done.
