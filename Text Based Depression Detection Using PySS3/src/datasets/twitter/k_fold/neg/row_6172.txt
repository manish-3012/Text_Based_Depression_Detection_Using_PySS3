I'll never be happy in this body.I'm trans (ftm) and I know I'll never be happy with myself. My entire family disowned me when I made the choice to transition. I have no friends. The only person in my life is my boyfriend. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I don't want to cause him pain. He's in enough pain himself, being trans as well. I've been on testosterone a year now, after having to wait 18 years because my family wouldn't let me and I was homeless for a while and living in hotels. The changes are nice, but they aren't enough to satisfy me. I have a large chest that is going to take so much money to remove. It'll be years before I can get top surgery. I can't wait that long anymore. I've already waited so long for everything else. Even if I did get it, my chest is too large to get a subtle surgery, and I'll be stuck ith double incision scars the rest of my life. I won't be able to go shirtless without people realizing I'm trans. I'm in constant physical pain because my uterus is atrophying and full of cysts and I don't have the money to remove it, or any insurance. I'll never have a fully functioning dick. I'll never have XY chromosomes. I can't work out because all the gyms are closed, and they won't open any time soon. IIm 5'"I can't get a job. I have terrible mental illness and can't interact normally with other people. I don't have a car or a license. I don't know how to drive. I don't have enough money to take the bus to work. I am stuck here waiting, rotting. I can't wait any longer. I'm tired of this body.
