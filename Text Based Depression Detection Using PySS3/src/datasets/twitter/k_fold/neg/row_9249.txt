Failed attemptI'm so pathetic I even failed at this. I made two shallow cuts on my arm, barely drew blood. I was too chicken to slice through the vein, scared of the pain. Ended up in the ER, referred to a therapist. I will go later this week. But right now I just feel like crap. I just don't want to exist right now.
