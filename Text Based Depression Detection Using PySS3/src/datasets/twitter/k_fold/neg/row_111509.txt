I dont know why i decided to write thisI'm tired of feeling the way I do. I'm not the only person struggling, but Jesus Christ. Is it so hard to have one person in your life that can just give you some encouragement. 

Where do I start? My father doesn't have the ability to express his love and affection to his child. My mother died at 16. Grandfather died at 17. Grandma died a few months ago. Still recovering from a surgery. Got kicked out of my grandmothers house because my family wants to sell it. All of my friends have moved on in life. Cant find someone that i can talk to. Anxious and Depressed. Started drinking to help with my problems but we all know how that turns out. Living with my step dad. I know he doesnt really want me here. I dont know what to do. 

Jesus Christ is life so hard. I feel like im homeless too.
