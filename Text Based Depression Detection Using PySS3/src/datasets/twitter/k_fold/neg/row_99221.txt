SuicideI thought silica gel packets are poison but turns out  they're just a choking hazard I ate some thinking they were poisonous and would kill me but they didn't. Please suggest me a painless way to die I'm not an adult so I cannot get many things. I just feel like I will never amount to anything in life I've wasted my childhood I didn't plan for my future I didn't even make any friends I'm just a waste of skin. I'll have no future so there's no point in living. Is jumping around 35-40 feet enough to kill. I'm just pathetic.
