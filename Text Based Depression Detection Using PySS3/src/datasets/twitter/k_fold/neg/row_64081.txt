Should I tell him?I really want to trick my boyfriend into taking a video of me, tell him Iâ€™m going to do a trick and walk onto the road to get hit by a car. While looking directly at him. I hope to get severely injured, worse case scenario I die. I donâ€™t know why, but this is how I want to die. I want to tell my boyfriend about it but donâ€™t know how, Iâ€™m worried he might tell my parents or other adults. 

If youâ€™re wondering why I want him specifically, itâ€™s not because I hate him. Itâ€™s because I just want him to be the last person I smile at.

Should I tell him [boyfriend] how I feel?
