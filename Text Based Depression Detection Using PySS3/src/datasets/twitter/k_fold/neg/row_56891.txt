I am evil, and it hurtsThis is going to be disturbing. I'll keep it as short and concise as possible so as to avoid TL;DRs.

I'm 18, male, just finished my final school exams. With school and its distractions gone, I got the chance to tend to my old wounds.

I found out that I'm a narcissist, a (zoo-)sadist, and have strong psychopathic tendencies (up to 94% according to some tests).

- I suffered from RAD as a child (reactive attachment disorder) due to severe emotional abuse from my mother, but I've grown out of it for the most part. I don't have emotions anymore, no conscience, no sense of morality. No hate, no love, no empathy, no happiness.

- My mother kept switching between excessive affection and severe physical/verbal abuse. It was sickening to me. She broke my toys, two Playstations and my phone when she got angry at my father. She was turbulent, emotional and stubborn, never recognized her guilt from destroying me. When I tried to tell her how I felt, she verbally lashed out at me. I hated her, she may be the only person I ever felt strongly about.

- During my childhood, my parents often screamed at each other, I found that depressing and got angry at them. Just a few days ago, I prevented them from getting divorced, enduring my mother's emotional babbling and even making her laugh through cunning manipulation. My father is a true psychopath, he couldn't care less about her feelings and he seriously tormented her. I can't believe I could console her that easily, considering what he said to her, and I honestly can't wait to use my skills for personal gain later. I don't feel sorry for her at all, not just because of how she abused me but because I just can't.

- I take pleasure from torturing animals, mostly small rodents. As a child, I dreamed about squeezing or biting a mouse to death, slowly and painfully, or pulling/cutting its tail off.

- I lie to improve my social standing and influence over others, and I manipulate and deceive for feeling sorry for me and/or giving me money. I'm willing to go to any lengths necessary to get what I want, even if it means choking a dozen or even a million baby monkeys. I'd even enjoy it, a lot no less...

- I often brag about my intellect and my good marks, often deliberately degrading and humiliating others. I like shattering their delusions of morality and dismissing views based on empathetic double standards and other irrational nonsense that drives me insane. I feel like I have to punish these ignorant fools for their utter stupidity.

But then...

- After waking up, I feel very bad about wanting to torture helpless animals and enjoying their screams of agonizing pain. I know it isn't wrong just because I feel it is, but there is no consolation in the truth. I'd probably shoot myself each morning if I had a firearm.

- My antisocial behavior, my arrogance and insensitivity often get me in trouble with others. As a child, my mother used to beat me up for that. Today, I just don't fit in anywhere, and worse is I don't even want to fit in somewhere. I feel I'm better than others, and yet I somehow wish to be like them.

- I feel remorse for my inability to feel emotions, whether hearing a beautiful song or daydreaming about love. I could potentially torture, steal cripple, murder and rape for money or just for fun, and not feel bad about it.

In short, I am a psychopath trapped in a neurotypical's brain. It's so frustrating to live like this, wanting to do whatever I want but feeling intense, painful remorse after even thinking of it. I just have to give up on life, not necessarily for the sake of others (or maybe a little for the sake of the poor mice) but because of the sickening discrepancy between my conscious and my subconscious mind. If I had a free wish, I would like to get rid of my conscience, of all the painful guilt haunting me, I wish to become a true psychopath who doesn't feel remorse, guilt, or shame.

I think it is for the best to just kill myself. No therapist would ever agree to turn someone into a psychopath, and I highly doubt that works because of neural wiring etc.. And no therapist can turn me "good", either... I act evil of conviction - I do it because I know it's not wrong. But that doesn't stop the pain. It's like getting electrocuted whenever you think of a pink elephant... You just have to think of it, and it hurts. And there's nothing you can do. Suicide seems like the only solution... Unless somebody can help me?

Hello, world. Maybe you're off better without me, but I don't really care, to be honest. Life hurts, and I need a way out.
