i need to cry loudly.itâ€™s just building up inside me. i want to scream and just be able to let everything out but i canâ€™t. i want to be able to cry without being fucking judged by my mom. i want someone to just hold me and tell me itâ€™s going to be ok. but thatâ€™ll never fucking happen. itâ€™s never going to get better and iâ€™m never going to be able to get away from my house or my mom or my life. iâ€™m stuck here and i canâ€™t even cry about it.
