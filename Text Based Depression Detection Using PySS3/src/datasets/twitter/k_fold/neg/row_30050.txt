May 18thFor a while now i've been thinking about it. Thinking that nothing is going to get better. That I'll still get heartaches over the girl. Thinking that not even life matters or that people die everyday. That people die, get mourned over and move on. As much as I have a lot to thankful and grateful for at 21 years of living,  i'm not happy. I know sooner or later i'll plan to take my own life. Push everyone and everything away until that time comes. 


Selfish as it may be, I know i'm not a good person. 


I'm just tired...
Of dealing with people...
Loving people too much.
Being caught in others lives.
Dealing with the anxiety.
Fighting to understand this stupid world.
There is no hope for me.


This is probably I cry for help
Or just typing how I feel.
Or both. Either way....just...


I hope everyone is well.
Enjoy the fireworks.
