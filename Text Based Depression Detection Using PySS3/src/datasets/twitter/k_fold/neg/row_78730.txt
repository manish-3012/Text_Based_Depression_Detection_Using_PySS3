Need to do it tonightI've been lying to my parents. I've made them believe I'm going to graduate college. The ceremony is tomorrow. I need to kill myself tonight. My family have always had so high expectations of me. When I failed college I couldn't tell them the truth. One lie led to another. I am so guilty and ashamed of myself. I pushed my friends away. I feel so lonely. I am a loser in life. I hate myself. I need to kill myself tonight. I probably dont make much sense now. I am a failure. Why did I even start lying? I brought this on myself. Goodbye world.
