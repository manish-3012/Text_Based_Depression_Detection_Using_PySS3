I'm at a loss.I've honestly been trying to get my shit together.

I saw a therapist. No help.

I saw a doctor who perscribed medication. Some help, still feeling miserable.

I've tried excersize. I've tried drugs. I've tried no drugs. I've tried changing my settings, thinking maybe I was feeling trapped. I've tried cbt. I'm running out of options.

Basic story, I'm miserable working. I've never had a job I've enjoyed. To me, going to work is one of the worst things I can think of. I'm going to work until I retire or die, meaning I'll spend my whole life working, and as I'm unhappy working, I'll be unhappy the rest of my life. I've swapped jobs multiple times, and the things I have interest in doing are unachievable. I can't become a Rockstar, I'm just not good enough,  that's a fact.

So here I am. I begin wondering to myself, at what point is it selfish for the people around me to keep me around, as to avoid a bit of emotional turmoil.

Is it fair making me survive a life I don't want to live so that they may put off missing me until I die of natural causes or they do? How's that fair? If I kill myself you'll suffer 2 or 3 years tops. NROPS if you really like me. This doesn't equal my 50+ years of misery ahead. It just doesn't. 

This is what annoys me too, everyone thinks because I'm depressed I should be thinking "oh I'm useless to society the world would be better of without me" but I don't think that. I think if I was a normal motherfucker and not depressed I could live a good life. I have a good life. The only thing stopping me seems to be depression.

So tell me reddit, is there a point where it becomes selfish to keep a depressed individual around even if he worked hard and failed over and over again to deal with or fix his issues? 

When can I finally give up, close my eyes and have the first restful sleep I've ever had in my life? You know... the kind you don't wake up from.
