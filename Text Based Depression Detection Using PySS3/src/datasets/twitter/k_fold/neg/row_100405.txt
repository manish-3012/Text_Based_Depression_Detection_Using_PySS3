DesperateI have been battling a pretty decent list of mental health issues since â€˜07. Iâ€™ve known things werenâ€™t right since 6th grade. All through high school I utilized the school mental health counselor. I didnâ€™t start getting consistent metal health treatment til â€˜08. I have experienced an immense amount of trauma in varying degrees throughout my 39 years. Iâ€™ve been in the BSU 5 times now. I told my husband and a few close people that they didnâ€™t have to worry about an attempt until I found a way that was 100%. I donâ€™t want it to be a botched job with me ending up physically impaired and alive.  Well I finally found my way out and how Iâ€™d do it. Right now Iâ€™m trying to find a good enough reason not to. A conversation with my father yesterday, made it quite clear that a healthy adult relationship with he and my mother is impossible. I have worked and worked and worked at trying to manage my mental health. There have been times where Iâ€™ve seen three separate people in a month. I take my meds like Iâ€™m supposed to, I use a variety of healthy coping mechanisms.  It just doesnâ€™t seem to matter to most of my family and my husbandâ€™s. Iâ€™ve been on disability since I was 31 and that cripples me financially. We are stuck in a house we canâ€™t get out of because my husband doesnâ€™t make enough to get us in a better situation. I very desperately want to move to the other side of the country, but my husband laid out all the reasons itâ€™s impossible.   As I said, now Iâ€™m just trying to find good enough reasons, or a drastic change that could help my situation. If I canâ€™t, then Iâ€™ll start my plan.
