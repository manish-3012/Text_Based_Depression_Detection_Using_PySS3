Help deciding what to doMy wife recently passed away on 03-15-15.  She had a tough life being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. It took her ability to walk and ultimately took her life.  Despite that we were madly in love.  She always told me if anything happened to me she would kill herself.  There is no way she could live without me.  Now that she's gone I don't know how I can go on without her or if I even want to.  We were antisocial people but our companionship is what kept us sane.  There are people that I do truly care about me and my well being but she is the only one I want to be with.  Am I being to rash in considering suicide?
