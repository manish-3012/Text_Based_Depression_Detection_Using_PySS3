Nice to meet you allIâ€™ve just recently joined this beautiful community, and just like the rest of you, the only thing keeping me alive at this point is the fear of failing and dealing w the consequences of living after that and suicide memes. But, I always catch myself zoning out for 35-45 minutes at a time, absolutely fantasizing about how I plan to end my painful existence. I think it beautiful and horrific at the same time, and wonder with awe how I havenâ€™t committed knife-neck just yet. But, I just wanted to say greet you all, and for however much longer we all have left; Hello my brothers and sisters.
