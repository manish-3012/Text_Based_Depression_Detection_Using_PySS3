reducing the impact on my familyI've been suicidal for a very long time now (since ~12 years old, which is when I started hitting my head against walls as well), and at the rate my life is going I won't be alive this time next year. So my question is, when I DO finally snap and take the pills/pull the trigger/tie the rope. How do I make it easier on the people who care about me. Because to be honest they're the only reason that I've held on this long to begin with, I don't want them to be hurt because I couldn't handle being hurt.

So what do I do? How do i make them see that it's not their fault, or that I was just really really sad all the time, and needed to take a bit of a rest.
