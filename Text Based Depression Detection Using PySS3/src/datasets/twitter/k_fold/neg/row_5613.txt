Despite what the media says, depression is not treatable, and asking for help is pointless.Iâ€™ve seen over two dozen therapists and been on nearly every psychotropic medication out there. The meds range from useless to making things even worse. 

Similar for therapists. Iâ€™ve done CBT, DBT, ACT, psychodynamic, and all of the other acronyms. And itâ€™s all been either a waste of my time, or things actively get worse with therapy. Iâ€™ve given therapists feedback that my sessions make me suicidal and I either get â€œand how does that make you feel?â€ Or â€œyouâ€™re not working hard enough to make actual progress.â€ Iâ€™m telling the therapists EVERY FUCKING FEELING Iâ€™m having, but because I donâ€™t have any particular trauma for them to latch onto, they say Iâ€™m holding back and preventing the real work from being done. Iâ€™m not a textbook case if someone who needs an epiphany and then the suffering magically goes away. 

But really â€” I have no actual â€œreasonsâ€ to be depressed. I grew up with a living family. I have a doctorate. I have a unicorn amazing job. But I just get constant waves of very physical feelings of despair and hopelessness. My current therapist just says that Iâ€™m not in touch with my feelings, and until I get in touch with them and â€œreally experience and confront the pain,â€ Iâ€™ll never get better. I donâ€™t know what to fucking tell him anymore. 

Iâ€™m in my 40s and Iâ€™ve had there issues since around 10. Iâ€™ve tried to kill mystified twice before  in my teens and failed. I get treatment. I do all the â€œright things.â€  Medication and therapy. But it always comes back. Always. 

Im tired. I am sick of this. The actually fact is: for a giant portion of people with depression, they never get better. Ever. Yet the media and world lie to us with stupid cliches like suicide being a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Or they say depression is treatable (lies. They call it treatment resistant depression for a reason, and Iâ€™ve been on all of the treatments for TRD).

But for so many of us, IT IS A PERMANENT PROBLEM THAT REQUIRES A PERMANENT SOLUTION. 

I donâ€™t want to hurt people around me. Thatâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m alive. But when my mom does (in the next year or two), and I canâ€™t hurt her anymore, itâ€™s probably my time.
