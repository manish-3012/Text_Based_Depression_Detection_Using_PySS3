Why do i have to be such a ghost and such a failureLife is so fucking difficult, man. I feel like im living in a truman show where most people just pretend to be normal and shit. All as a way to torture me. Its all pretend anyways, not everyone is happy as they seem, but damn some people are good at faking it. Good at faking it so well it hurts me sometimes. Most of my family is sucessful, well educated, getting paid big bucks, in relationships, smart, attractive, etc.. But me? 

I almost never have energy, am usually dead inside except the odd time i'm lonely,angry,sad. Anything pleasurable makes me more miserable afterwards, weed,alcohol,fapping. I'm sober from all substances, basically raw dogging life. Pyschedelics fucked my head up good i'll give it that and its been over a year.

Every job fucking sucks. I'm a college dropout. I dont think i am HORRIBLE looking but no one has ever shown interest in me, because of my personality i bet. Its ironic because comedy makes me depressed, i will never be as interesting as most of those folks. very rarely i get matched on a dating app and im too shy and awkward to say anything. I just wanna be happy, man. the other stuff is just a bonus. But i feel so disabled and unable to do shit all. Only good thing i can do is exercise and be tough enough to not kill myself brutally
