I can never forgive myself for losing her.Honestly she was the best thing that could've ever happened to me. And I pushed her away. My mental illness pushed her away. Now shes gone. 4 months later. I can tell she moved on at this point. Completely ignores anything related about our relationship. No more drunk texts. Had to delete Facebook because seeing her and her friends and family members made me physically ill.

Only a matter of time before I have the courage to finally do it. I simply find no joy in anything anymore. I fucked up the only great thing that came into my life and I took it for granted.

No, I'm not doing therapy anymore. Tried multiple ones and got nowhere. I'm off antidepressants now because I went crazy after she left and my health failed immensely as well. Life hasn't gotten better at all. Like I'm being punished.
