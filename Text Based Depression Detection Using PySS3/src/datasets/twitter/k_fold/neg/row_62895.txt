Does it even get better?I've been searching for jobs. Everything turns me down.

I'm stuck in a rut. And a bad family situation. I don't have independence; my sisters control my life.

I can't afford to move because...well...I can't get a job. 

It's useless. I search, get hope, and fail. I'm so utterly incompetent and idiotic.

No one likes me.

Suicide isn't for me today, but definitely once I find a painless method. Cause I'm a coward. There's no point. Im never going to leave this bad situation and will eventually kill myself.
