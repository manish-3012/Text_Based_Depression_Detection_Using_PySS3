iâ€™m so close to just quittinglife as a whole is so fucking stupid and it sucks. forced to just suffer. and then the times i try to just leave itâ€™s like nah foo 25 gabys isnâ€™t enough try more see you tomorrow morning. nothing goes right and then whenever it does i always fuck it up. i canâ€™t even function as a normal human w/o drugs and it sucks, and whenever i try iâ€™m just a sad sack of shid. i meet someone whoâ€™s like me and acutally understands me, fuck it up dwell on  it for 2 months then repeat. i threw away like every â€˜friendâ€™ i had besides 1 or 2. and i donâ€™t know how to cope with anything so that doesnâ€™t help. my anxiety is terrible, to the point where i canâ€™t even function for hours or even talk and itâ€™s just annoying and iâ€™m sick of it all :/ itâ€™s pointless
