Why bother?Being alive kind of seems like a chore. The inside of my head feels like static. if I'm just going to be in bed all day what's the point? I wonder if i can give all my resources to someone else, I'm useless so theyd be able to use it better.

Suicide seems so messy though. I've decided to just stop eating and let it run its course but it's taking so long.

Oh, but I have some donuts in the freezer. I tried to eat one just now but it melted in the microwave. There's chocolate on my sheets now. I dont know why i'm really upset about that. Maybe I shouldn't have tried to eat?

Sorry. I must sound really stupid. Thanks for listening, I guess.
