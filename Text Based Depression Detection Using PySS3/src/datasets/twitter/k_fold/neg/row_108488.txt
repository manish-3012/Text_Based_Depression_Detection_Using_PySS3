Alright, here goes.Iâ€™m deep into psychology. What Iâ€™m experiencing is basically everything Iâ€™ve done in the past come back to bite my ass. Iâ€™m not an intellectual. Iâ€™m the dumbest smart kid youâ€™ll ever meet. But also probably one of the most fucked teens youâ€™ll ever hear of, kiddo. But thatâ€™s for later in this post. Iâ€™m essentially just lonely, since I have no one anymore. I, today, have lost my last will and motivation. Iâ€™ve lost everyone else because they got to close, so I had to cut it off before we both got broken. By this time, I was blinded by her genuine care. She doesnâ€™t even realize what sheâ€™s done. My best friend, heh. At a young age of 13, nihilism, pessimism and expecting the worse are virtually all I know anymore. Science is my resort to answer all things. For without logic, I believe there is nothing. And now that sheâ€™s gone, I feel a painful, yet inviting loneliness. My sense of humor is awful. The Vegas shooting? Itâ€™s not serious to me. Nothing is anymore. Losing her made me â€œfreeâ€. But freedom is a lot of things to different people. All freedom has been for me is sadness. Having literally no-one to go to anymore other than your shrink is painful. Never knowing your next move, making dangerous yet exhilarating gambles just to entertain yourself. I donâ€™t worry anymore, worrying is a waste of my time. I have myself to work on, not school. I canâ€™t go to my parents, theyâ€™d send me back to the mental hospital for sure. I laugh sometimes when I inflict pain on myself, or someone else inflicts it Upon my skin. The generic hallucinations every now and then, borderline schizo. Severely depressed, dangerous mix. But interesting, since my experiences are helpful for my interests in psychology and have prolonged many their life. When people have a problem, they come to crude olâ€™ sarcastic me. I carry their weight. This is my role, and I chose it. Once youâ€™ve found out your piece in the jigsaw, you canâ€™t cut off an edge and change it. Because thatâ€™s fucking with your life. I can use big words, so people trust me. But there were those few people who I had to screw with a fucking nail taped to my dick because I almost was broken down to the size of a neutron. But hey, thatâ€™s life. Sometimes a nail, sometimes a razor. Either way it cuts your wrists and their ass. But what about when you need to turn to someone? Go to someone who doesnâ€™t care. So I came here. That way you canâ€™t tell my parents that I am so fucked up I literally counter threats with threats, and threaten my own life. But itâ€™s fun, I guess. Just a broken soul looking to share his bullshit with someone.
