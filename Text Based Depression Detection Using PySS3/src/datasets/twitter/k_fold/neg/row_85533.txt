They reported me as a missing person!I thought you had to be missing for an x amount of time havenâ€™t even been gone for 24 hours and people already up my ass. I left the note saying what needed to be said but still geez. Anyway talked to one of their peoples and she told me sheâ€™s taken me off the list since I look like Iâ€™m stable and not in any type of danger or hurt. Now got the family bombarding me with calls and messages but honestly donâ€™t want to talk to anyone right now Iâ€™m just laying in bed in the hotel room. Havenâ€™t slept so going to try that after I finish writing this. 

Lots of mixed emotions going through my head right now. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m sure I want to go through with it but at the same time Iâ€™m not. Itâ€™s so annoying plus canâ€™t rent the car yet anyway since I completely forgot they only take credit card if youâ€™re out of state. So had to pay my card off last night now waiting for it to post so I can use it. So not really feeling like going out into the city so just going to lay here in bed. Fuck it not much different than what I was doing back home. Might go out for food though but good thing is I can last a while without food or liquid. But yeah thatâ€™s my update on my little adventure of wanting to die. Stay tuned folks for more updates!! ðŸ˜‚
