I've pretty much reached the end of the line [Schizoaffective]For years people have been telling shit about how it all gets better in time. I might have believed that a few years ago but not now. Not after so long. My friends don't really give a shit about me anymore and neither do my family so I really have nothing to lose. I'm so tired of trying to function. I'm tired of getting out of bed in the morning only to spend the whole day in pain, loathing myself and worrying about when my dad's finally going to give in to his threats and send me back to live with my mom. I'm tired of defending myself to people who tell me that I just don't try hard enough to be happy. Telling me that I'm just being lazy. I'm just tired of everything. I hate my life so much. I've pretty much got no future, I'm treatment resistant, and I'm just a very expensive child. And people keep telling me that I'm going crazy when in reality despite the hallucinations I'm extremely logical and I know the difference between reality and psychosis but people still treat me like a five year old anyway. I don't even know how to explain this in words, my thoughts are jumping around right now but I've waited for so fucking long. I made sure I waited till my brothers are old enough to take care of themselves because my dad's never home and now that I know my death isn't going to fuck up anyone else's life/source of income I'm ready to finally give up. I can't keep living in this much pain when I know it's only just going to keep happening over and over again. I just finished writing my suicide note and I've found a relatively painless method too so now all that's left is to actually do it after my dad goes to work tomorrow. I don't even know why I'm talking about this here tbh
