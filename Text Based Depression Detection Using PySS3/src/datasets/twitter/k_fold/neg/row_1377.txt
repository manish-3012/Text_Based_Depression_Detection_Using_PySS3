I dont know whats wrong with me dudeI feel like i have no right to feel the way i do. and i feel like a freak. some days ill feel amazing. and other days i wake up and im so sad i cant move. it feels so weird. days like that always suck and today was one of those days. i really just want to go outside and hang myself with the garden hose for my own sanity. my brain cant fucking figure out what it wants to feel and its so frustrating.
