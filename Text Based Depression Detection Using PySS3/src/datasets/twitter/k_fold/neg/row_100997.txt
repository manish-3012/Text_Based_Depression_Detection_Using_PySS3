I just did a thingI just tried to hang myself, the problem is that the stick on the tree broke off. I tried again and it broke off again so I went home.

Maybe it's a sign that I shouldn't kill myself? That's what I took it as. Dunno, feels surreal to have tried. Never thought it'd come to that really, get so bad.

Tonight I'm gonna get real help. I'll tell my mom and brother everything, from why I sleep all days, to that I cut myself to my drug habit to my suicide attempt.
I really hope all that will relieve some stress and anxiety off of me so that I can get some real help, real sleep and a real life.
