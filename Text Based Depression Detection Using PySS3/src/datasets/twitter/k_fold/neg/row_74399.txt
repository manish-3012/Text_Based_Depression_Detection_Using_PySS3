I am a murdererWhatâ€™s the point lately? I have been so depressed that I am not even getting out of bed and I am forgetting to do important things. So for about a week I didnâ€™t feed my 2 hamsters and 3 mice I forgot and I am a murderer and I hate myself I just want to die. It should have been me. They are sweet poor little creatures who cannot fend for themselves. They relied on me for everything how could I have forgotten them? I canâ€™t claim to love animals and then KILL my animals. I go lower and lower everyday I just want to sink done and die and now I have no reason to stay. I donâ€™t have any responsibilities anymore. I used to say â€œif it wasnâ€™t for my parents then I wouldâ€ but now even hough I try to think that I just canâ€™t. Being dead seems better. Maybe itâ€™s selfish but they will get over it.  I canâ€™t live for other people and I canâ€™t live with myself so I guess Iâ€™m done then. I want to die.
