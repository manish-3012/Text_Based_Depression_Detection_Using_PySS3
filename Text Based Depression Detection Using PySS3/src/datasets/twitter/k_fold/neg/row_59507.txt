No one cares if they fucking hurt meI feel so damn stupid. I'm just a teenager girl in her senior year and I know these are the times you find out who your true friends are blah blah blah. Not only did I find out who aren't my friends, I lost all of them. They gossiped about me and betrayed me. I have no fucking friends. I thought this guy was pretty serious about pursuing a relationship with me but it doesn't seem like it any more since he just ignores me for days on hands and sometimes doesn't reply to any thing I say. I feel like he's slowing distancing himself from me and I won't have anyone. Every one just wants to hurt me and see me bleed and laugh.
