I never fully recovered from being sexually assaultedIt was almost 3 years ago. When it happened I told almost no one, the ones who assaulted me were my 2 best friends and the only people I would have told anyways. The next summer my new best friend manipulated me into having sex with him (when I would say no he would constantly go "I'm so fat, I'm such an awful person, Why would you ever have sex with me"). Every person in my life who I have loved and trusted has left me and manipulated me up until last year. 

I met someone I loved more than I thought I could ever loved. But I'm so depressed and I can't control my actions any more. I snap at him and sometimes I'm just so cruel to him. I feel like even he would be better off with me gone. I never got the help I needed and now I'm 16, having struggled with cutting and a secret ED for 4 years of my life. I have no diagnoses for what's going on with me, though I desperately need to know. I know I'm depressed, but how exactly? Am I just depressed or am I bipolar? Some people have told me it seems like I may have bpd, is that true? Does it even matter at this point or is it too late? 

Every day it's getting too hard. I was assaulted too young to ever even develop a sense of who I was first. I haven't been able to look in the mirror and see myself since then, or even look inside myself and know who I am. Every day it feels like my self talk gets more negative, I cut more, I eat less, it feels like it's too late for me. I don't know what to do any more. (I'm sorry if what I said breaks any rules, I'm new here)
