Im really close to the edge and have been for some timeI've been struggling with sh and constant suicidal thoughts for about a week now. My mental state is out of wack, and ive been over thinking too much. About to lose my cat of 12 years. Constant dissociative episodes/hallucinations. Im not doing too great right now, but I guess im staying strong. Kind of hard though, with so many ways out planted in my house and oblivious family. I dont know what to do anymore. Guess this is just a rant. Hope everyone is doing okay tonight.
