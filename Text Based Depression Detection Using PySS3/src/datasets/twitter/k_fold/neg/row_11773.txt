Is it normal to want to stay depressedIâ€™ve been depressed for about a year now. Itâ€™s become my normal I guess. I really want to get better, I do. But thereâ€™s a part of me that kinda wants to stay this way. It probably sounds crazy I know but itâ€™s the truth. I feel a level of comfort and safety. 

And it has nothing to do with me wanting attention. Because I know some people might see it that way. Hardly anyone I know knows Iâ€™m depressed actually. Itâ€™s a weird feeling and Iâ€™m always torn about getting the help I know NEED or doing nothing about it and letting it get worse. Which is whatâ€™s been happening. 

I donâ€™t fully understand it but I just thought i would share Incase anyone else also feels this way. I guess itâ€™s almost like self harm in a way. Iâ€™m not physically being hurt by my actions, but Iâ€™m choosing to hurt myself by letting myself go untreated. And I know it ðŸ˜•
