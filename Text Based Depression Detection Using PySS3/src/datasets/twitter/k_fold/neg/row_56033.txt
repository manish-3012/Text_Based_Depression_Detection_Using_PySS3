Transgender Dysphoria Blues, pt 2About a year ago I posted that my wife and I are trying to start a family. Since I'm a trans woman and started hormone replacement therapy in 2015, I had to go off my hormones to try and start producing sperm again. With that brought on depression and dysphoria.

After being off my HRT for 10 months and fucking like rabbits with no results, I went to a couple of specialists and found out that I am not producing any sperm at all. It could be because of the hormones, or I could have just been sterile from the beginning. Who knows. 

I started hormones again back in August, and the last couple months have been a wild ride. I quit my job, my wife and I got married, and of course the pandemic has continued. We've been arguing a lot. She's bipolar and now also experiencing seasonal depression, and tonight told me that if she can't have a baby, she doesn't see the point in continuing life. We're almost out of money, I still haven't found a job, and we have 2 vials of sperm waiting from a sperm bank, and that's our last hope. Her family doesn't support our relationship (again, I'm trans and she's not, and her family are Baptists, while we've both converted to Judaism). So we have no one we can really turn to for actual support. 

At this point, IDK if it would be better for us to just separate and eventually go our own ways or for me to kill myself because I don't think I can take having another family leave me. She talked about killing herself and leaving me the house and her life insurance but my whole fucking life has shown me I'm worth nothing to anybody. I'm so fucking tired of being strong and keeping myself going, and she feels the same way. I emailed my rabbi for advice/help, and if he can't help I don't know what we're going to do. We might lose our house next month if the stimulus doesn't arrive in time, and I really don't want to be homeless again.

 I don't want to die but I don't want to live.
