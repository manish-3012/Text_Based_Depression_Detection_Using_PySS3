im going to kill myself on my birthdaymy birthdays coming up on the 21st and i've decided to kill myself. I've attempted before in the past, but to no prevail, so i'm hoping that the third time's a charm. My friends have all abandoned me and i just feel really lonely. There are other factors, but this particular one was the final push I guess. I just find it rather infuriating how a couple of my friends have chosen another person over me and are now just avoiding and rarely ever speaking to me. They act as if they're happier without me so I guess it wouldn't matter if i did. I just don't know why they chose her over me, and how one person in particular is refusing to have any form of conversation with me at all, especially since i was reasonably close to him. It's all just confusing and i feel so alone. I dont know how to properly articulate whats going on, but that's just the base i suppose. I don't know what i want out of this post, it'd be interesting to see the replies i guess. That is, if i even get any.
