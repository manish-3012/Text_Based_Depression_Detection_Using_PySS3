I just can't anymoreI feel like I have nothing to live for. I don't like talking to people I know in real life about this. They always say "Oh! Don't be silly! You have SO MUCH to live for!" Or "C'mon! You are stronger than this!" and I hate those conversations. I have three kids, but everything inside me tells me they'd be better off without me. My ex husband and his girlfriend are adequate enough. I don't have any actual friends. When the kids aren't here, I see nobody outside of my work. So, basically I stay alive so my kids don't have to be the poor kids whose mother killed herself? I don't see the purpose. They'll get over it. I got a puppy recently, mostly to help me feel less alone, but I find myself feeling sorry for him because he has to be around me. I really regret it. He deserves better. I don't think I'll be around much longer. My kids and this puppy deserve so much more. I need to rehome the puppy before I go. No one would come looking for me for a week. He would be all alone. I am such a broken person. I'm useless. Nobody needs me. I hate myself and I hate life. Thanks for reading.
