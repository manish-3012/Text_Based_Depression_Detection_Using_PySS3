Lack of empathy and nothing matters I've lost my dreams and goals and it won't ever matterI have no empathy wether it be the extinction of an animal or in church.
I feel as though we are slaves ie work all week just to be able to buy stupid shit that will mean nothing in 10 years.
No matter what we not leave a mark even if we do the world will just end one day.
Lifes have no meaning except the meaning we give it but i have none so it's meaningless to me.
I feel no emotion but I'm not numb it's more of a detachment of emotion.
Things that use to mean stuff to me I've lost I've lost my dream ive lost my vision my goals i have nothing left I'm empty.
I want to end it but i don't have the nerve to.
