I fucked upThis year I managed to wreck every single relationship (family, friends, acquaintances...) through either being too passive or pretending to be someone I am not. The one person I still think would talk with me I am too weak to reach out to. I had one major fuckup in February that I can never forgive myself for. How I handled the situation also cost me all my self respect. Last month I lost intrest in most things I used to enjoy, although right now I can still force myself to do some of those things, I either feel bad or nothing at all whilst doing them.

 I tried to kill myself last week but backed off a few hours in (I think because I didn't want hurt that one person). Sometimes I feel like reaching out, but I stop before actually trying. I am too embarrassed about this since I know that my life should be quite comfortable objectively speaking. I can't hold on to that anymore. I just want to return to how things used to be. Knowing that this isn't possible, I made plans to try and kill myself at new years. Doing that pacified me and is probably the reason why I feel like writing this. I came to see suicide as a way to repay all those people I have wronged and that makes me feel somewhat happy as well. I'm gonna do it the same way I tried to last time: by spending the night outside in a park, dosed up with light clothes (we usually have -3Â°C outisde this time of year). I guess I am posting this because I am still searching for reasons to live, maybe I just want some attention one last time, which would be really fucking pathetic.
