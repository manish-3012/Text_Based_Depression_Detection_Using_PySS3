How do you argue against Hume's view of suicide?"That Suicide may often be consistent with interest and with our duty to ourselves, no one can question, who allows, that age, sickness, or misfortune may render life a burthen, and make it worse even than annihilation. I believe that no man ever threw away life, while it was worth keeping. For such is our natural horror of death, that small motives will never be able to reconcile us to it. And thoâ€™ perhaps the situation of a manâ€™s health or fortune did not seem to require this remedy, we may at least be assured, that any one, who, without apparent reason, has had recourse to it, was curst with such an incurable depravity or gloominess of temper, as must poison all enjoyment, and render him equally miserable as if he had been loaded with the most grievous misfortunes."

My problem is always this: I see no reason that I must stay alive. So, really, is suicide that irrational? How do we prove it? How do I know the people who want me to stay alive aren't just self-serving megalomaniacs who assume I'm an object?
