I feel cold and hollow insideI've never written anything like this before. Everyone I know is getting married or in long term relationships. I can't seem to even garner any interest. The thought of never being with anyone again puts me in the deepest, darkest depression. I want to be with a beautiful woman but I feel like an utter failure. I'm just a friend with no intimacy. I feel like I'm always awkward and embarressing. Just want to end this waste of life. I really just want to die. I'll struggle along but I really want to stop.

I don't know why I'm typing this. Just to get it off my chest perhaps. Whatever...
