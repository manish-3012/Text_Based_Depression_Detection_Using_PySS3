hi.i'm back. i always delete my posts/threads a few days later, despite this being a throwaway, but i always come back.

i'm so tired. honestly, there's only one person who keeps me going at this point, and they're not someone i'll ever have the privilege of knowing very well. title ix restricts professors from befriending their students while they're students, and all. it's okay, really.

you know, guys. it's funny. i enjoy being alone, but i hate feeling lonely. i can't stand people, but i want them in my life. whenever i start getting close to someone, i just push them away. it's like a knee jerk reaction. i don't get it. i care so much about the well being of others -- i want the people around me and throughout the world to have a good day -- to the point where i'm heavily considering humanitarian work/journalism in human rights over the chemistry degree i've been working towards. but. i can't interact with people. for the most part, i feel like an observer. it's boring. it's lonely. i can't take it anymore.

i wanna die. really. every time i try to change, to step out of my comfort zone, i just wind up stressed &amp; uncomfortable &amp; feeling worse than before. i don't fit in with people, even though i like them so much. i'm practically ace. i don't consider myself to be a 'girl.' i'm not really girly. but i'm definitely not a boy, either. i just am. i exist. i don't want to exist.

it's really hard to describe how i feel on a day to day basis. complex.
