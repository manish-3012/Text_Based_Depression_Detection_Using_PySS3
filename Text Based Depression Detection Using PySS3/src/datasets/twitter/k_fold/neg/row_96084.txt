I don't know what else to do.I suppose I am writing this because I donâ€™t know what else to do. I kind of doubt anyone will read all this, but I figure I just need to get it off my chest. This will probably turn into a choppy, incoherent mess, so fair warning. I have been severely depressed and anxious for as long as I can remember, and now at 21, I am basically rotting away. Iâ€™ve lost all of the friends I had somehow managed to find. I absolutely eviscerated my relationship with a sweet, innocent girl. The woman I love wants nothing to do with me despite saying she shares those feelings (yeah right). I am just a fucking mess.

Iâ€™ve been a drug addict for a couple of years now, and ironically, these past few days are basically the only days where I have been sober. Iâ€™ve abused alcohol, weed, pain pills, benzos, psychedelics, cough syrup, you name it. Iâ€™ve avoided heroin because I know I will love it too much. I cannot stand being sober. It is nearly impossible just sitting here, rotting away in my messy room with bombs constantly going off in my head. My sleep is borderline non-existent. I wake up 20 times a night easily, and I cannot remember a day where I wasnâ€™t tired and lethargic (are those the same thing?). 

Iâ€™ve done horrible, fucked up things. Things I will not share today. As bad as that goes, I somehow still have boundaries that I would never, ever cross. Apparently there is some form of morals and emotion that I have, somewhere buried away. The regret hurts me every day, and although the occurrence of these thoughts have slowly been reducing over the past years, it is still a struggle. I am not the same person I once was. Yes, I am still depressed as fuck (and maybe even worse than I was) but I am no longer angry. I no longer contain ill will for others, or an overall resentment of life itself. Iâ€™ve become much more understanding of others and have recognized just how much someone can be struggling without you knowing. I never want to do a bad thing again.

I tried talking to a counselor when I was in school, and maybe it helped a bit, but it never solved my problems. Only I can solve my problems, and I am at the point where I donâ€™t know if I have that in me. I donâ€™t know if I have years of suffering left, if I could even imagine trying to live another 5+ years (let alone a lifetime) with the hopes that things could just maybe somehow get a little bit better. Speaking of school, I basically wasted my last two years and tens of thousands of dollars of my parentsâ€™ money. Dropped classes and failed others. Never went to class. Hell, I barely leave my room for weeks at a time. The only reason I have any chance at getting my degree is because I am decently intelligent. My hygiene has gone to utter shit, I barely eat or sleep or interact with anyone other than the occasional employee at the grocery store or mcdonaldâ€™s (if I somehow manage to make it there).

Iâ€™ve always had suicidal thoughts. I have a pretty vivid image of one of the first times I seriously considered it. It sunk in and has not left. My heart feels like itâ€™s getting colder and colder, turning to stone really. I think about the time I have wasted and the mistakes that I have made. I think about the likely reality where I never meet a woman that I actually connect with. I might not be the ugliest guy, but when I look in the mirror I see an ogre. Every irregularity I have is glaring and obvious to me, and frankly destroys what little semblance of confidence I might have had in getting a girl. Ironically, the only times I have been successful with women in my life was when I failed to realize how repulsive I actually am.

Recently, Iâ€™ve thought about just sticking my head into the grille of a car who is driving by, but I realize I cannot do that to another person. I know how easy it would be to just put some 00 through my skull, since there is no way I am going to fuck that up. I think about it quite often, and sometimes it is the only way I can get to sleep. It is almost like mental masturbation, just thinking about the peace, quiet and ultimate freedom I would finally have. No more loneliness or rejection or insecurities. No more depression. No more me.

The way I see my future, whether distorted or not, is years of loneliness, depression, and work. For what? To pay rent and buy food to keep living when living is the exact cause of my condition. I do blame myself and am aware that my actions are my own. I see myself as a mistake. A failed experiment (maybe we all are), and at the very least a defective human being. It kind of hurts to write that one. It kind of hurts to write all of this. Not that I feel much nowadays, and frankly the only emotion I do have is caused by withdrawal from years of poisoning my body. 
I can imagine a life where I am happy. I can see a life where things go my way (sometimes), where Iâ€™ve taken care of myself and people have actually started to care about me. Iâ€™ll have glimmers of hope thrown in there, but itâ€™s just more mental masturbation. A minor flare in the chest, the pilot light on love maybe isnâ€™t out yet. I really do not know. The really fucked up part is I know what I need to do to get there, but the truth is I donâ€™t know if I have it in me. I donâ€™t know if I even have the energy, and as I already mentioned, living for years more like this while grasping at dwindling hope seems all but futile.

If there is any silver lining in all of this, I am certain I hold the record for most times through The Office. So I have that going for me. Maybe put it on my tombstoneâ€¦but in reality I just want to be thrown in the trash. Or maybe I should be an organ donor. Is that an option for people who commit suicide?

I see the comment floating around here sometimes, that in writing this maybe there is a part of me that doesnâ€™t want to die. That still has some semblance of hope. Maybe youâ€™re right. The fact that my parents are still alive makes this decision an even tougher one, but I am just struggling hard to find any semblance of life left in me. Maybe itâ€™s dumb for me to be saying all of this at 21, I do not know. 

I am going to stop here as I feel sick. Thanks to anyone who actually drudged through my rambling.
