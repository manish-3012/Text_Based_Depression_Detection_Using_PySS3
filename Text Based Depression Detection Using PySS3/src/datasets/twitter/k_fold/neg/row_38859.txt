I can't find any sense of power in anything other than hitting myself.All of my situations are fucked. Every one of them is fucked. I hate the fact that I'm headed for nothing but a meaningless middle class civilian life, with no influence or meaning to anyone. I get so fucking angry about everything happening in the world around me and I don't want to be forced to play their rigged game. The only time I feel much authority over anything is my own body, smacking myself as hard as I possibly can over and over.

I've been suffering like this since I was born. It's been so so long like this and I want to cry out for help but I can't. I can't be honest with the people I know and even if I did cry out, no one would listen, just like it is now. I've been crying and screaming as loud as I can into my pillow for the last ten minutes. I'm a crying, screaming animal trapped in a cage, about to be processed into meat. Meat that won't even be enjoyed by anyone, just thrown away.
