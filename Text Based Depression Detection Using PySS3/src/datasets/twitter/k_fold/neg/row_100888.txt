Really need some helpSo  I have massive anxiety. Never did a thing about it. I am around 27-31  male. I can't even hold a conversation any more. I have no friends. I  worry about everything 24/7 non-stop. Due to my anxiety, I have never  had a girlfriend/relationship of any kind. Now with just losing my  high-paying job due to covid, I had to take a sales job I already hate. I  am the lowest I have ever been.

Are  the ways to get professionals emails? So I could email them my life  story, prior to meeting. Hope someone can point me in the right  direction. I am healthy physically (I think). Haven't seen a doctor in  years.
