Head self harmDoes anyone else smash or hit their head in when angry and hopeless? Sometimes I target the back of my neck to cause damage but the best result was a blocked nose and a mild concussion that made it hard for me to go sleep.

Just want to know if it's weird and I might be taking self harm too far. I can't control myself.
