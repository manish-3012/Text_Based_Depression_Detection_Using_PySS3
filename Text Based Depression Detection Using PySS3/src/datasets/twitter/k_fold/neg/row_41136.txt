My [25f] partner [28M] has a suicidal ex however they have a son togetherMe and my partner have been seeing each other for about 6 months now and due to Covid I have been living with him for 3 months. When his ex [24F] found out I was living with him she kicked off and said I wasnâ€™t allowed to be in the house when his son [3yo] comes round. Which is fair enough and I have done so as was asked. They were together 7 years and she Now sees him as a supporter in her life. Whenever she feels low she calls him. I expressed my concern about this and he said that if she just needs someone to rant to then he will be on the phone as heâ€™s worried that if heâ€™s not supportive she will stop him from seeing their son. Itâ€™s been two weeks since she found out I was living with him and has just phoned him to say that she has had a really bad weekend (suicidal thoughts) and to be fair sheâ€™s been trying to get all the help she can get. 

I am concerned for her and want whatâ€™s best for the child. Looking for suggestions on how to help her?
