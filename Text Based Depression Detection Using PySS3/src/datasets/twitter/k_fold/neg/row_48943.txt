whateverI want supposed to start studying like an hour ago but for some reason I just can't get myself to do so and it's making me feel so sad and angry with myself. I have very little time to study a lot of stuff because I procrastinated due 2 feeling like shit. I'm so tired of this, I don't want to fail, I want to continue to do well in school but I just can't. I don't have any energy or will left and I'm scared I will never get it back.
