I'm tired of where I live and it makes me not want toIll prolly delete this later after I get self conscious lol

The place I live in has gotten really violent. I've been followed home twice and physically attacked in the past 6 months, I have PTSD that's been getting worse because I'm fucking STUCK here, I hear gunshots so often outside of my window,  theres always articles about someone getting killed or shot at. 4th of july was a nightmarish game of "fireworks or bullets"? Learned fast tho 

I used to always feel unsafe at home and I thought I was past that and here I am again. It's so excruciating staying in the place where this all has happened, like I'm digging into a wound over and over 

I had a huge wave of panic wash over me recently because I heard quick footsteps behind me, but it was just a little kid running. I'm moving in like 2 weeks after months and months of waiting to a beautiful place in a safe neighborhood and I think I'll be okay because there HAS to be an end to this right? but I just am so overwhelmed and tired and sad and so angry, I'm having trouble with my friendships and they are all dissipating. I'm seeing a therapist and theres intensive therapy I can go to to supplement it but it has to happen after I move. 

Most of the people I talk to just dont get it or blow it off as dramatic so I just keep closing myself off and pushing everyone away, even the one who care and makes me feel safe and protected. I never feel safe. I feel like a burden and I like I'm rotting from the inside out because I keep saying "I'll be okay" or "you don't have to worry about me!" or cracking jokes or distracting myself and i really don't know if I will be. Im so tired of running away from my feelings but I also don't want to feel anything.

I feel so alone and tired. I honestly just want to die
