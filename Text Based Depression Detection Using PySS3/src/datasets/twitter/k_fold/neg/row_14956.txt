apology letterFor my friend, idk if I'll send it to her but idk where else to post this I guess. 

I'm sorry I still have feelings for you. 
I'm sorry that I'm codependent and clingy and I can't live without you. 
I'm sorry I ask for your attention all the time when you can't or don't want to give it. 
I'm sorry that I just can't be okay anymore. 
I'm sorry for every time I bugged you about your drinking. 
I'm sorry for being emotionally manipulative. 
I'm sorry for all the money and time and energy you spent on me. 

I'm sorry for just being a horrible person and anything I've done to fuck up your life. :(

I thought to email it to her but I might write it out on paper and see if I want to send. I just really feel so crazy and I think she's leaving me but I don't know. I'm sorry I can't explain more but I just wonder if this is worth sending, if I don't necessarily kill myself.
