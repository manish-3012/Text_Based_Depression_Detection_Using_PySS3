almost did it. againI read somewhere that there's an exact number of pills of a certain kind you should take when you want to kill yourself. After crying for about 4 hours straight, I contemplated doing it, but I wasn't able to take even half of It. Something stopped me. I am such a pussy.

Now I'm aching. My stomach hurts like hell. I'm fucking cold. 
But I guess I'll just sleep for a while. Try to, at least.

These recents suicides left me a bit shaken. I keep thinking it's just the beggining.

I wish I had someone to talk to.
