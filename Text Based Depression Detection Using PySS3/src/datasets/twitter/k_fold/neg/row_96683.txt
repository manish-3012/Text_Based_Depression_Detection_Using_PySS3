I really close to ending itI think I'm at a point where I'm just done. I tired to get better and I'm still hurting all the time. I've lived through enough good and bad for one lifetime. Im perfectly comfortable leaving right now. The only thing keeping me here is my family but every day I'm carrying less and less about what they think. If they really love me they'll let me die. Im just so fucking tired of trying and never getting better. I attempted about a month ago and ever since then I've been wishing I succeeded. I've been dealing for depression for as long as i can remember. I'm only 21 but I've spent my whole life like this. It feels like my body is shutting down. I can't keep living like this.
