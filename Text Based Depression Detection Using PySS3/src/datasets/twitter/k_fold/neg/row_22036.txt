Suicide attempt 3Tonight, I shall be ending my life after 13 and a half miserable years on this Earth. I hope there isnâ€™t an afterlife, simply because I donâ€™t want to be alive with my memories. I am so glad I have brought myself round to doing this again, and to end this suffering for good. I have tried everything to help, but I think this is the best solution. I have written my note and I am completely prepared. I thank you all for the help you have tried to give, but I really think this is for the best. Goodbye you fucking horrible existence.
