A mom who is so sad and hopelessI'm a mother. I'm supposed to be strong and be able to deal with everything and sometimes feel like I just can't anymore. My son has autism and sometimes I feel like I am failing him by being overwhelmed. My husband is so patient, but I seem to lack the ability to be so myself. Last night, when my little guy had a meltdown and wouldn't stop screaming, I just locked myself in the bathroom and cut myself over and over. My husband took my son upstairs and watched him while he finished his work since he works from home. I can't even take care of my child. I lay on the bathroom floor and just thought about how much better off they'd be without me. My husband can remarry, and my son won't have this pathetic anxiety ridden idiot for a mother.

I'm in therapy, and my therapist is good. But I'm scared if I tell her just how much I want to die I'll be committed. She knows that I think about it, but last night I was the closest I've ever been to actually doing it. I just feel so hopeless and like I don't contribute enough.

I'm sorry for this long post, but after spending a lot of time on here reading posts, I can't help but feel like all of you are the only ones who truly understand. My husband said if I did it, it would be the easy way out, since it's harder to work through the pain. He has no fucking clue what it's like to be in the heads of people who think like we do. Anyway, thanks for listening and letting me rant.
