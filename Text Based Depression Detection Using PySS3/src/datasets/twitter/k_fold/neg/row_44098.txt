I am a cowardI used to hold an unleaded gun up to my head and just pull the trigger over and over wishing I had the guts to put the bullets back in. Im only 20 but Iâ€™m a Trans kid and this life is so lonely. None of my family loves or talks to me. Everyone is ashamed of me because of either my skin color or my gender and I really really want to die. I have a gf right now but I dont want to hurt her and thats the only thing I have left to hold on to hut I feel so bad. I feel like such a burden and like I should just pretend to cheat on her so that she wont be hurt when I go. I just cant live here like this, everyone screaming that I shouldnt be this or that and I havent even gotten to enjoy life yet. I dont want this life, I try to be good and nice to people but they all hate me so much, why? Ive been raped, I been beat, Iâ€™ve been manipulated, Iâ€™ve been placed in group homes, ion know what else I need. Life is just so scary for me now but no one can tell cus Iâ€™m a 6â€™1+ black man. Everyone is afraid of me but I just want to be loved. I dont mean to scare people, I dont mean to make peoples lives harder. If I could just erase my existence off of the face of the earth with no trace then I would.
