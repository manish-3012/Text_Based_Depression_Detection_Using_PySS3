What's the pointI'll never be the pretty woman I want to be I'm trans my body is covered in hair my skin is gross I just hate being alive every moment is pain I just want it to end I'm tired of working so hard when other women just are I'm not a fighter I'm a coward I can't push myself to do anything that will be beneficial towards myself I lay in bed all day trying to get back to sleep I'm sick I'm in pain and no one can save me I just want to paint the wall with my brains a bullet in my head to end my pain.
