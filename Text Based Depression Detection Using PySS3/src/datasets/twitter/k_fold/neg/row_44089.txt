i have nothing to offeri'm 20 years old, couldn't hack community college, feel like i have no future. knocked up a girl and now have a 1 year old kid. what kind of role model am i? unemployed, girlfriend lives in someone elses house, works at a clothing store and thinks she will become a successful real estate agent in this economy with no experience. i dont have any goals, any skills, social life is non-existant, hide in my room in my dads house all day trying not to think about what the rest of my life will be like. did some research on helium hoods and now thinking about not sticking this one out. family loves me, girlfriend loves me but i cant function. they would be better off without me, they could move on from trying to fix me. therapist and medication aren't working - therapist tries to offer suggestions on how i can improve myself but i can't imagine being a normal person. i'm just unfit for this. medication does nothing - only deadens the emotion into a null. I don't cry anymore or have that hopeless look heavy limbs and slow movement so people think there is improvement but i feel the same - like there is no future for me. so thats it. suggestions on music to pass out to?
