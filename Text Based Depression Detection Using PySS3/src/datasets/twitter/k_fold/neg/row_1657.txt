Failed attempt, numb, confusedHi,

For a lot of reasons, I took a fairly large amount of benzos and alcohol last night - something i've been considering doing for a while - kind of expecting that I'd feel some sort of shock or panic after doing so as it was more than enough to be considered fatal. Basically I just felt numb at the time and in the end I just slept for about 16 hours and woke up feeling really dozy, unusual and a bit disappointed. 

Thing is, I could have taken more if I wanted to be absolutely certain that I'd die, but I was was equally quite annoyed that I didn't. I think perhaps the problem is that my life isn't terrible, other than some intolerable, progressively worsening medical conditions that I have. In fact, that's what's worse - all my friends &amp; family are progressing their lives and mine has been getting worse and more painful by the day for two years. I'm 25 can't stand to see everything I had slipping away, it's almost worse than the pain itself. I'm almost at the stage now where I can't walk properly and have constant nerve pain, having previously been very sporty and sociable etc etc.

I have no idea at all what to expect from writing this. I suppose I'm not desperate to die but equally I can not see the point of continuing to live.
