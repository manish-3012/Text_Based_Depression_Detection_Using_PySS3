Had enough, tonightâ€™s the night.Iâ€™m not going to go into what Iâ€™m going through but basically I canâ€™t function anymore. Iâ€™ve had 2 suicide attempts in the past, first when I was 14 I tried to hang myself and second a couple years ago overdosing on Zoloft. Iâ€™m going to try use the plastic bag method and take sleeping pills beforehand. I really hope it works bc I genuinely donâ€™t want to live another day.  Iâ€™m about to write letters to everyone now, I donâ€™t really want to but itâ€™s the least I owe people. I just hope it works.
