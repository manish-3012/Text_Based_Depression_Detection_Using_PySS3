Iâ€™m trying to hold on but itâ€™s hardCurrently, Iâ€™m laying in my dark room about 2 seconds ready to end it all. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression a while back and am on medication and Iâ€™m suicidal. Recently Iâ€™ve lost a lot of my childhood friends and no longer trust any of them. Iâ€™ve messed up so much in my life and made people upset and I feel like a burden and I just want it all to end. Iâ€™m tired of being a let down. Tired of being hurt. I just want to disappear and never exist. I want to stop feeling and stop everything. I have a loving boyfriend and have been with him almost 2 years (anniversary in October). Iâ€™ve embarrassed him and exposed him and I feel awful but heâ€™s so forgiving in loving but Iâ€™m beating myself up a lot. Iâ€™m just tired of being a mess up and want everything to stop. Sorry this is all over the place Iâ€™m venting.
