Fed up of trying to be happy.A few weeks ago I was feeling really depressed and suicidal, Iâ€™m in the UK so what Iâ€™m saying will probably resonate more with people from here. Iâ€™ve been under NHS mental health services now for a couple of year, suffered with Iâ€™d say clinical depression now since I was 13 Iâ€™m now 25. And I canâ€™t remember last time I had a happy spell in my life. The other week things got really bad was contemplating taking my own life, I didnâ€™t the crisis team got involved and saw them everyday for a week until was passed back over to my mental health worker. But have been told I donâ€™t have a medication review until early June so I donâ€™t have any medication for nearly a month I can definitely see myself deteriorating in that time. Iâ€™m just fed up with the pain and wondering if I should just end it as this government donâ€™t care or theâ€™d not of slashed funding over the year for mental health services, Iâ€™ve got a lot going on and scared about my future but the support services out there seem very few and far between. Not sure I can cope anymore Iâ€™m tired and just want the suffering to end.
