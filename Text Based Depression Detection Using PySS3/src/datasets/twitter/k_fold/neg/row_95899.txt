I decided when I'm finished writing I'm going to end itNo particular reason. I just don't enjoy being in this world. It's nice to come to terms with it finally; I find joy in being alive, it just doesn't seem like something worth going on for. So I've decided once I'm finished writing the novel I'm currently on, I'm just going to kill myself; maybe travel the world first to see the beauty of other countries, but after that I'm done.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this, maybe just for own general discussion on the issue? Does any one else feel like it's just not worth anymore based on the fact that getting up everyday in itself is a chore?
