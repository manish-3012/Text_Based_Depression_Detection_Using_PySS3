I feel like i have no option but to kill myself or disappear without a trace foreverMy life is an absolute fucking prison, it has ground to a halt, I am a pathetic people pleaser and I'm sick of the dysfunction in my family and the stifling mundanity of the shithole town I am in. I should just do myself in but I am afraid to

If I wasn't such an empath, I wouldn't feel horrible pangs of guilt about leaving my family and friends in the dust, they know i'm depressed but try and gaslight me into thinking everything is fine and that i'm just "having a moan".  If I didn't care about them so much (due to people pleasing) I would be living a carefree life in some other town where i could reinvent myself...or rather actually BE myself.

People don't like me being me, bottom line, they like the collective idea of who they THINK I am, rather than face reality.
