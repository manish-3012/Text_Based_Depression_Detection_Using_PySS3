What do I do?I'm at a small-town college. Coming here, I thought that it would be a happy experience for me. But now that I'm in my second year, I realize I'm starting to hate it. For the most part, people here are nice, but for some reason I can't connect to them. The people I do and can talk to seem to only want me around when they're drunk, but I already know that if and when I ever needed something from them they wouldn't call me back. I told one of them I was thinking of commiting suicide and he just walked away from me. No one's called me in a week, no one's spoken to me, no one sitting by me in class anymore. I hate this place so much I haven't even left my room in a week, and I can't go home because I'm too poor. I'm at my wit's end and I feel so trapped.
