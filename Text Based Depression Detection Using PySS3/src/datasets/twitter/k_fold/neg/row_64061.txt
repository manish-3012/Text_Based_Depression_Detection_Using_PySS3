I Hate HospitalsThey do absolutely nothing.

Iâ€™ve been to two good ones, but they are adolescent units. Iâ€™m a legal adult now so (obviously) I have to go to adult units.

The last one I was in, we sat and *colored* all day. Cuz, yâ€™know, thatâ€™s really gonna help me not be suicidal.

I think my mom is thinking of getting me evaluated. Which really sucks.

Iâ€™ll sit there for 3 days doing nothing, tell them Iâ€™m fine, then sign myself out. Waste of time and money.

Sigh...
