Is it really worth it any more?Life feels pointless. Has done for about a year and a half now. The feeling is always there. The urge is always there. Why am I here?

I'm tired and frustrated beyond belief. I'm 21 years old and have suffered with debilitating chronic pain for 13 years. It's been 13 years of this, and doctors still can't figure out what wrong with me.
I have exhausted every avenue available to me. I have run out of professionals to go to. 
My life has been nothing but one big ball of pain and a bunch of people fobbing me off.

I feel so alone. There is no one near me. I moved two months ago. I don't know anyone here. It's not like it matters. I feel alone where ever I go.

Everything I do leaves me in pain. I'm tired all the time. I haven't slept in two days. I can't sleep. Even sleeping pills aren't knocking me out. Why am I even bothering?

If I was an animal, they would have put me out of my misery years ago. 

Everyone keeps telling me "you're young! You haven't experienced life! You have so much to live for!"
It's BS. 18 years of psychological, physical and sexual abuse has been enough for me thank you very much.

Tbh I'm too scared to tell anyone irl what's going on for me. I could lose my accommodation. I'm on the path to a suicide attempt. Have been for months. Nothing immediately eminent.
Don't have the supplies.
My experience with the mental health teams, especially in regards to suicide attempts just makes me hope that I'm successful the next time.
I tried to kill myself last March. I still resent the fact that I wasn't successful.

There will be more attempts. Can state that as fact. Some more "real" than others- in the sense that I truly believed I will die and for one reason or another it hasn't worked.

I'm highly unlikely to survive until I'm 30. The fact I've even made it to 21 is something short of a miracle.
