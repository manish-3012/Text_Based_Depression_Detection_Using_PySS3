I've run out of options but at least I triedI've been struggling with BDD, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts for half my life now and every day is a fight against myself trying to come up with reasons to keep going. I'm tired of it and honestly feel like I've run out of reasons. 

My BDD has given me social anxiety so bad that I have a hard time even going outside, and keeping a job is pretty much impossible. I've tried and failed every time. Been in therapy for years trying to cope, tried every medication in existance, and I'm still back here.

Feels like I'm finally going to die any day now. For the longest time I haven't seen any other ending for me anyway so maybe it was bound to happen? If only I wasn't so scared of failing...
