Suicidal thoughts all the timeIâ€™ve always been suicidal since I was little, it just never really hit till I was in my teens (Iâ€™m 22 currently) and well letâ€™s just say ever since I graduated I never knew where I was going so now I work a dead end job that Iâ€™ve been at for almost 3 years (itâ€™ll be 3 years this coming January) and everyday itâ€™s just the same thing...nothing changes and I feel so different then my co workers with these thoughts of wanting to kill myself but yeah I didnâ€™t know if anyone else felt this way? Itâ€™s seriously an everyday thing for me to think whether Iâ€™m at work or home or even with friends
