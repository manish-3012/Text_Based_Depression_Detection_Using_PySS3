...I managed to drive away all my friends. I fucked up my marriage by having an affair with my best friend. Five years later my wife and I have tried counseling. She turned to pain pills and alcohol and is now a recovering addict. I have tried seven different antidepressants over the past ten years. They all cause me to not sleep and have horrific nightmares when I could sleep. The only thing that made me sleep was ambien. And I was not remembering driving to work. Or doing other things. It scared the fuck out of me. The docs stopped listening. The therapy turned into a recursive loop. 

I love my wife and kids. But I feel like my mood swings are more harm than anything.  

I have my good moments. But I can't seem to get anything right. I've been trying to buy myself a car for 10 years so we have more than one. But my wife blows all the money on fast food or other shit we don't need.  She will eat out before paying the electric or gas bills. 

I can't afford basic things for myself. I have a torn disk in my back, but after her 6 meds I can't afford mine. 

I want to love her, but I can't keep living this way. My mother in law threatened to never let me see the kids unsupervised when I had the affair. I love my kids. 

My mind is just going around in circles and I feel trapped. No matter what I fucking lose. 

I have three bottles of ambien and a bottle of vodka. I also took the cover off the breaker box. I'm sitting here staring at the mains wondering if its my only way out. 

I know I don't have the balls to do it. I can't let my kids find me this way. I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. All my friends left me. My mom died. I don't have anyone left. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense. I just typed out what came across my mind at the time. 

I don't need anyone to save me. I'm too much of a coward to do it. I just wish I felt like I had another way out of this.
