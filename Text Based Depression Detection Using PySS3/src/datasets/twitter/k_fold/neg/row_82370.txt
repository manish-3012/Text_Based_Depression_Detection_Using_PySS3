Wait and seeToday I had a job interview, the first of my life. It was in group and getting such a job would help me in a lot of ways, including a way to keep going to treatment.

I feel like I fucked it, I feel bad, and that I shouldn't have hopes anymore. Yet I don't want to, so I can only wait.

I made more progress this month than in a previous year, and I feel terrible, killing myself is real tempting.

I want to wait, all I want is to give good news to those I care about, to those who try and help. God help me.
