11 daysThis summer I, 19 y/o uni student, came to the conclusion that I want to end my life. I also set a date for myself, new years eve. I couldn't do it last new years eve, the whole thing wasn't fleshed out and kinda rushed and then I just couldn't do it. This year, I want to. I'm coming to terms with dying. It only takes me a couple of moments to be brave. One last time at least. This is the only time in my life where I have to get things done right. If I mess up, I'm in trouble, that kinda scares me.

Sadly, I can not share this with anyone in my life, except for the great friends I have made on the internet. My family has a strong distaste for me, I don't have any friends. I am quite alone, considering that I don't think internet friends substitute for friends that you actually hang out with.

So one might be wondering why I am posting this. Valid question, the last few days have been very surreal. The Amazon packets with the ingredients to my demise arrived today, that made me feel strange deep down. Like a punch in the guts, when I opened the box. I'm debating with myself if I really want to do this. I have promised myself that I will do it this new years eve, and nothing has changed, in fact things got considerably worse even. I always told myself that if a miracle happens and my life makes a total 180 I wont do it, but nothing of that sort has happened. My family cut all contacts, so did my former friends. Ill be alone both on christmas and on my birthday (25th) because I'm not welcomed at home anymore. I'm stuck in my apartment in a town where I know nobody 2h away from home. 

I will hate myself for the rest of my life if I can't do it on new years eve.
