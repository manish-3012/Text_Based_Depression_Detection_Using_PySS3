Love to you all this ChristmasI know this can be a really hard day, and I wanted to send love to you all. As someone who has battled terrible anxiety and depression, I can relate to a lot of your words. I found hope and my wish today is that you can too. You are important, you are worthy, you have special things to offer to the world, your past does not have to define you or your future. â¤ï¸
