I've been way too paranoid and sickOn Monday I was thrown in a hospital ER room for high suicide risk. After like 3ish hours I was discharged for not having signs of depressive symptoms (don't ask me I'm not the doctor). But I was panicking because I am very afraid of hospitals and was told for most of that time I was getting hospitalized. Now I'm even more paranoid to open up to getting help. Also they told me that my antidepressants definitely was making my mood worse, so I stopped taking it. Well now I'm really sick and scared to say anything. What do I even do at this point.
