The police stopped me because I look 12. I'm 26. I've never felt so low in my entire life.edit: I'm ok. Still feel like shit. Thought it would be better in the morning, it's not.

-------

The military base has a curfew of 8:00pm and I was walking outside at night. A police cruiser flags me and the officers make me show ID because they said I look 12. Afterwards they laugh and say "well shit, look on the bright side, at least kids clothes are cheaper than adult ones". Then they leave.

It's not the first time something like this happened, my entire life I've been walked all over and treated like a monkey just because of how I look. People push me aside on the street. Bartenders don't serve me for 20 minutes.

It also explains my lack of dating life. No wonder women are so repelled by the very sight of me. Getting with me would feel like raping a toddler.

I can either live this way my whole life, or check out now. All I know is I don't want to live past tonight, I'm sitting here trying not to cry like the prepubescent manbaby I am.
