I said about a year ago if things didn't get better I'd just kill myselfIdk things haven't really gotten any better if anything they're worse cause my family knows everything going on and my dad doesnt really believe it. Only things keeping me here are my ldr gf and the fact that my family would cry knowing I was dead and my mom would take it out on herself. People like my therapist keep saying shit like theres more to life or theres happiness in blah blah blah but so far I've yet to see it. All I know is if my gf does die(which she wants to) I'll really feel like dying as well and idk if my family would be enough to keep me from it
