hopeless.everyone seems to be concerned about being a burden to their loved ones...that seems to be whatâ€™s stopping them from killing themselves. 

I donâ€™t care about hurting anyone. I mean, I have family, sure. But for some reason hurting them doesnâ€™t sadden me the least bit. Iâ€™ve never been close to my family. I was raised to show no emotion, to be cold and distant. My mother was emotionally and physically abusive growing up, iâ€™m 24 now and never had a good relationship with her. I have siblings and grandparents...people iâ€™m related to by blood who I have fond feelings for and would probably be hurt by this....but theyâ€™re feelings donâ€™t matter as much to me as my own. 

Iâ€™ve been in a lot of pain for a long time...iâ€™ve been hurt and wronged by people who I thought loved me...and these days instead of trying to fix my life, I conjure up ways to die that wonâ€™t be too painful. All I can think about is dying. I hate myself and I donâ€™t know why. I donâ€™t know anything, really. Except that everything hurts.
