Why me. Why anybody.While reading some posts, I began daydreaming of suicide. Hell, I began holding my breath to see how long I would suffer before it ended. I canâ€™t do it today, since it is my dads birthday. Havenâ€™t said anything to him yet, I donâ€™t know why. Makes me feel even worse though. Never knew that at such a young age I would be having these thoughts, but here I am. Today would be a great day to end it, but I canâ€™t because of my dads birthday. It would tear him to pieces. It would tear my 6 year old brother to pieces. It would tear my already depressed mother apart. It would tear my friends apart. My teachers. 

It feels selfish, but is it?
