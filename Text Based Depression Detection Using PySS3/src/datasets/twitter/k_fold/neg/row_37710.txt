I can't stand it anymore.I'm useless, I'm good at nothing, I have literaly no friend and talking to people scares me so much. I think about killing myself everyday and it is unbearable now. I spend my free time doing nothing and now I'm failling College because of my laziness and I'll probably go nowhere in life because of it. I have no reason to live anymore, I am just a waste of money and time for my parents. 
Sorry for wasting your time, I needed to get that off my chest.
