If you knew my intrusive thoughts, you'd want me dead too.I've posted on here too many times. 

I've come to terms that I will have disgusting, horrible intrusive thoughts for the rest of my natural life. I've come to terms that this illness will never go away. 

Last year I started having intrusive thoughts. And it is of the worst possible scenario. It's POCD. If you don't know what it is, please google it. Because I don't want to even...say it. I don't like saying it. Saying the word makes me cry. So I don't want to say it here. I believe that I am...a horrible person. And I'm scared that I am. Every day. 

I was sent to the psych ward. And it did nothing. They sedated me and I slept through most of my time there. I went without eating for weeks. I was nasueous from the thoughts in my head. Exhausted from the compulsions. The rumination. The fear. 

No, I can't tell a regular therapist. I've tried to three different therapists and all of them had the same kneejerk reaction. They tell me to visit an OCD specialist. There's a few in my hometown but I've called a few already and every single one of them are booked. I live five hours away from my hometown, so that's another problem. I could try online therapy...but...

But honestly? It won't do much. I know I'll live with these thoughts for the rest of my days. I will be mentally ill for the rest of my life. It has been 8 years of hoping. And I'm close to the finish line. 

If they knew my intrusive thoughts...or if you knew my intrusive thoughts or my past, you would want me dead too.
