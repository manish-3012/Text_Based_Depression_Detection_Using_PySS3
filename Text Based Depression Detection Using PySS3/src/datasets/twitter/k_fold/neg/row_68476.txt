Death is a chariot.Death is a chariot.
Whose horse reign asunder.
Life is fleeting.
As lightning before thunder.

Death is a temptation.
Where you give to the abyss.
Tears will not be shed.
For those who are not missed.

Death is a jester.
Who laughs while you cry.
Reaching out is trivial. 
When you only lust to die. 

Death is a summary. 
Of what you did not fear. 
Do not cry for me, sweetheart. 
Because I won't shed a tear.
