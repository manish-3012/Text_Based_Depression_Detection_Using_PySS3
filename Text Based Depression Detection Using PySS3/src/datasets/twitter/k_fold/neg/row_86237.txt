I hate living.So much. I hate living so much. Nothing ever goes right. I get yelled at for making one mistake. I get yelled at for talking. I'm getting yelled at by people who are supposed to love me. People who say they're supportive aren't. They look at me and tell me I'm overdramatic and selfish. I'm at my breaking point. I can't live anymore. I don't want to. Someone help me. Help me kill myself. I don't want to live. Don't give me that, "Call 911 or the suicide hotline," bullshit. I'm past that. I want to die. Now. Help me. I'm on vacation. Come find me and help put me out if my misery. I'm begging. I'll pay you. 

To my boyfriend, who is probably gonna see this, I love you. I'm sorry I can't be that perfect girlfriend you wanted. I'm sorry I don't wanna talk to you when I'm feeling like this. But I'm not sorry for being "selfish" because I asked to not talk to you tonight. Fuck off for saying I'm selfish when I'm trying to tell you I'm not okay and need alone time. No seriously. Fuck off. That's fucking rude. I have every right to be selfish when I feel like this.

To my parents, you can rot in hell for yelling at me for making mistakes. Fuck you for telling me I'm a mistake constantly.

To my sisters, yeah no bye.

To my friends, you can go have fun without me, because you already don't invite me out, and you only text me when you need something so... Bye.

And to whoever is out there reading this. Don't trust the people who say they're supportive. They're not. They will never try to understand you. They will never talk to you when you need it. They will never be supportive. This subreddit has gotten me through rough nights. Trust these people.
