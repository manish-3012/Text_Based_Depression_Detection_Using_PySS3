DoneI've had ideation for a couple weeks now and medication and counseling isn't helping. I've attempted suicide in the past and ended up hospitalized for 2 days before going to a psych hospital for almost 2 weeks. This was back in 2013 and the thoughts never really left, but they have been constant for the last 2 weeks.

Last night I received a letter that my landlord is selling his home and we need to move within 6 months. Our credit sucks, but my husband makes decent money now ($95k) but due to past circumstances, we have lots of debt. I contribute nothing to the family. I have degrees but can't find a job. Student loans are in deferment but will be about $1k/month . We don't have savings for first month and security on a new place, and can't get approved for a loan bc of credit. a mortgage would be less than our rent (1500/month). We have nobody to turn to and no options. 
I checked our life insurance policies fine print and because I've had it for more than 2 years, they do cover suicide. My family would receive $300k and my husband could get a home for our girls. I don't see any other options. I offer nothing to the house and my debt is overwhelming. I will forever be worth more dead that alive. 
I'm tired of being depressed and know there's eventually hope, but my life insurance policy ends in April. I feel such a time constraint to do this and don't have any other options.
