Feeling worthless and stuckI am stuck in a black hole.  I can't get a job, been out of work for about 2 years, have a kid, just got my heart broken. I feel completely alone.  Soul-crushing loneliness.  Men seem to think I am good enough to fuck or sext with but not good enough to actually love.  Ik know, I know, it's the ones I pick and the way I present myself myself. But a lot of my friends are married and they put up with a lot of shit from their partners.  So why can't someone love me enough to want to put up with my shit?  Why is it so hard for people to love me?  Even my family. I know I am kind and loyal and funny and I am always there for people. Ironically, I am frickin awesome at giving advice. People like to hit me up all the time to figure out what they should do about this or that. But when I am hurting, I always get the brush off.  "You can handle it, just keep going" keep going with what?  Every god damn thing is a struggle.  I have to fight for the scraps that I get. It's stupid. And I am tired of it. I am numb to my kid because....I don't even know why.  Because I am with him all the fucking time without a break and I have no life and talk to no one but him.  I swear, I have more days where I don't have one fucking conversation with a fucking grown-up. I feel like a fucking burden to everyone but thats how I treat my kid. So I'm a bad mom and a hypocrite.  I have more than enough pills to do it...I just don't want my son to be the one to find me. But fuck...not sure I can hold on..
