I want to end itI'm crying myself to sleep everyday for a few months now, I hate myself. I hate how I look how I talk how I walk how I breathe, I literally hate everything about myself.
My Stepdad is an alchocolic and its never quiet in my house since my mums argues with him a lot   she always complains how weak mentally she is but she forgets about me, I tried to tell her about it but she said that I should stop exaggerating. I have no reasons to live and because I'm younger people think all teens have fake depression. Nobody takes me seriously.
I never cried in front of anyone even my best friend. I don't want to make people worry about me but I just can't go on anymore alone...
I might do it soon.
