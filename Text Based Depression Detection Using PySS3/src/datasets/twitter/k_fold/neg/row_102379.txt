Fuck I hate myself so muchMy heart breaks everytime I see her picture. I ruined a relationship all because of my depression. I pushed away the only person who was different from everybody else, who wasnt afraid of being themselves. Someone who had their own problems, but I was too self absorbed to see past my own pain and misery. That's all I've been able to do is ruin relationships and push people away. I've noone to blame for my loneliness but myself. It hurts so much to realize that the greatest source of my pain has been myself. I can't wait until I attemtp suicide enough times that it actually works one of these time. Apparently I cant even kill myself right because it's taken 3 failed attempts so far
