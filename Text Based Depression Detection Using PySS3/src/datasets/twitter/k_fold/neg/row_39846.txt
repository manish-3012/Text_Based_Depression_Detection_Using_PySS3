i just spend my life on the computeri don't have that many real-life friends or family and the ones i do are always busy.  i have online friends but i feel detached when i can't see or touch them.  i'm trying to make new friends but it's hard.  okcupid and craigslist, kind of hit and miss.

it seems like whenever i get tired i just get suicidal.

it fucking sucks being on disability.  i don't know how to heal my mental and physical illnesses.  permanent solution to permanent problems?

but that doesn't even work b/c the 3x i offed myself i got sent back by entities on the other side.  so what's the point really.

so it's not my time yet, well when does it get to be my time? i'm tired of human form.  i just want to be in the non-physical realms.  Let me reincarnate in a better avatar and don't memory wipe me this time.  what the fuck?

gotta love it when kids start chanting in my head saying stuff like "cut myself until i bleed, a pool of blood is all i need" and "shoot myself in the head, pull the trigger, now i'm dead"  whatnot.  from the mouth of babes right?

i have more non physical friends than physical friends.  plus my dad just died a few weeks ago so it would be nice to join him.

i guess, if i can sleep, i'll wake up feeling better tomorrow.  til tomorrow night when i'll probably get feeling this way again.

every day is exactly the same. fucking mood swings.

i guess i have some stuff to live for but i have more than enough reasons to off myself too.
