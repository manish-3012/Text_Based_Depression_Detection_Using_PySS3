I finally found it.After years of hating myself these passed few months have been mostly progress. These last couple of weeks though I relapsed and starting having suicidal thoughts again. This weekend though I made some stupid decisions, but it ultimately lead to me having one of the best nights of my life and I finally came to a giant conclusion. This subreddit helped though. I wanted to put this here as a thank you.
