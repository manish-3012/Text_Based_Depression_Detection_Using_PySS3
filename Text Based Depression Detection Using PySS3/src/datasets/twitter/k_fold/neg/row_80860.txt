It seems Iâ€™m in a cycleStage 1: Mostly happy, energetic, exercising regularly (lasts from a day to a week)

Stage 2: Decrease in mood, weird feelings, very hormonal (lasts from an hour to about 3 days)

Stage 3: Depressed, but not suicidal, non energetic and tired, sleeping habits worsen (anywhere from a day to weeks at a time)

Stage 4: Suicidal. Constant suicidal thoughts and tendencies. No motivation, which leads to not doing work or chores and feeling worse. 

Stage 5: basically just stage 3 again 

Then it repeats.
