The end of an eraFor my whole life irony, depression, and loneliness has followed me. Iâ€™ve always tried to stay optimistic and positive but as time goes on it just seems to fade away. Iâ€™m 20 years old and I have absolutely nothing to look forward to. I have no girlfriend, talent, or self esteem. Everyday I wake up I am only happy for 5 minutes until I realize who I am...nobody. This self image I have of myself is not from bullying or from people opinions, because frankly their opinions donâ€™t matter. I always felt my life was doomed from the day I could walk. I always am polite and respectable and try to be a good moral citizen yet I always seem to contradict the morals I preach. I guess Iâ€™m here to possibly have an awakening. I just canâ€™t take the voices anymore in my head nor the sight of my flesh. My whole essence is tainted and useless. If I do go through with it. I want my family to know I love them and I wish nothing but the best and for the generous people on this forum who showed kindness and understanding thank you.
