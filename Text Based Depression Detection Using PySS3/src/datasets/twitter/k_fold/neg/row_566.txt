I donâ€™t have a job and canâ€™t keep one? My parents are at the point they want me out the house soon, but honestly I cant keep a job. I think the only way out of this is to kill myself somehow but I canâ€™t even do that.I donâ€™t know what to do anymore in life, I wake up everyday getting bitched at and doing nothing cause if you donâ€™t have a job you canâ€™t do anything.

I think about just killing myself almost everyday and ways I can so I donâ€™t have to work and live.

I just feel so fucking lost and donâ€™t know what to do..
