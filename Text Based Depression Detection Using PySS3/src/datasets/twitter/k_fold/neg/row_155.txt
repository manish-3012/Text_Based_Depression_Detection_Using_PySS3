I feel like everyone has given up on me, so why should I live anymore?Last week, I had a falling out with my girlfriend. I thought she was cheating, and in reality I was just way to suspicious and judgemental. She says we are fine, that it was an honest mistake, but she hasn't answered my calls or texts for a few days. My parents think I'm fucked up, that I have to steal from them. It's just small amounts of food, but they grounded me for a month. Now, I have to cancel all my plans and I'm too embarrassed to tell why. My bandmates have given up on me, they found someone better to replace me. My grades are falling fast. Is it better to just kill myself? I don't think anyone will care, and I won't have to face people anymore. I think I'm going to do it
