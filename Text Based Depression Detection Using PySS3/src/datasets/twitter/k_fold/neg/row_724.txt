I am Inadequate...I am not in desperate need of attention, I do not have a rope around my neck, and I am not looking for sympathy. So just a fair warning, If you do not want to waste time listening to my useless rambling, there are others in more dire need than I.

To begin.. There have been multiple cases throughout my life where I have thought to myself that suicide is the only option, never actually done it before. Most of this is due to my depression that I have experienced throughout my entire life, built on with stress, worries, ect, ect... Recently A lot of extra shit has caused me to start sinking deeper and deeper into my weak sorrow. 

I have my first ever finals coming up tomorrow. I am a freshman, and since 4th grade I have had nothing aside from As with a B on the side every now and then. This year though, I am struggling to maintain a B-C average. I have been sick and unable to study or focus on my finals for around a week or more, and I am almost sick to think about taking my finals knowing that  I will probably flunk them, bringing even more dissapointment onto my mother, more than usual.

I don't want to go to in dept about my pity as you all have more important things to do than listen to a 15 year old Freshman whine and complain about his life.. I am looking for anyone to talk to, just to help me out, and through all of whatever I am going through. And if you made it this far reading this, I applaud and thank you.
