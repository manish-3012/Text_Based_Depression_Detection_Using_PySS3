I didn't really know how to come right out and say, "I want to kill myself..." So... I keyboard vomited this instead.[I don't know that this is where I actually belong, because I'm still sort of new to reddit. So, like, someone just let me know if I should be somewhere else? And yeah, this is a little long.]
You know what's funny about my life? It's always felt like a series of "One More Day." 
When I was in middle school, it was just 'one more day' closer to summer, which meant the entire break at my grandmother's house. If I made it through the day, it was just 'one more day' off my tally. A whole summer where my parents couldn't tell me I was worthless, and then turn around and shower my sister with affection. A whole summer, where my step-dad's parents couldn't tell me I was "the spawn of the Devil." (Not kidding, this was honestly a thing my grandparents said to me, on several occasions, very honestly ((being god-fearing southern baptists)), starting about the time I turned 8. Because I was not a biological grandchild.)
I got to high school, and it was a never ending series of 'one more day' of responsibility, and then I could relax. (I never relaxed. I packed my schedule full every day, so I never had to acknowledge what I was avoiding. Which was the fact that I didn't feel happy, ever. And yes, I know, high school is prime time for teenage angst. But, I saw my friends go through the angsty phases, and I couldn't relate.) I couldn't connect to anything, and I desperately wanted to. Things that should of made me happy, just didn't. There was always a hollow feeling, like I should have been feeling *something*... but I never knew what it was. I learned to mimic my friends feelings. If they were happy, I was happy, and so forth. But it never felt genuine. I relied on their feelings as my own. And how odd a thing, to not know how to explain to anyone: I could feel so deeply with people, and yet feel nothing on my own.
When I turned 17, it was always about making it 'one more day' closer to 18. I could move out of my parent's house. My dad couldn't hit me anymore, and my mom couldn't tell me how much of an awful human being I was. I learned how to feel a little bit on my own, and I hated it. I decided feelings were bad, because most of the things I *could* feel, were bad. So I learned how to box them up. I only reflected the good feelings of the people around me. And I ended up with a boyfriend because of it?
I got out of the house, and it was a struggle of counting down 'one more day' until my boyfriend got back from Basic Training. He came home, and said the Army had changed him; said he didn't want me any more. Feelings still sucked. 
I could connect to people though. Sort of. Other people meant other feelings. Emotions that weren't my shitty ones. Empty spaces that almost didn't feel empty. Like clothes that almost fit.
Every day past that was 'one more day' of excuses to not look for an easy way out. 'One more day' of not wanting my sister to grow up alone. 'One more day' at work, to make enough money for school. 'One more day' of trying to figure out if I actually wanted to be married, or not. 'One more day' without my boys, while we were slugging through their deployments. 
When my grandda got sick, it was all about keeping him healthy 'one more day'. I was in a really dark place while he was sick. I kept a tally of my days, as much as I did his. "If he makes it one more day, so do I." When I met my last boyfriend (we'll call him Nerd), it was seeing his face first thing in the morning that made me want to see what 'one more day' would look like. 
And for one glorious year, I stopped thinking about 'one more day'. I stopped caring about making up reasons to try out 'one more day.' I was just living my life, taking care of my grandda, and dancing to no music in the kitchen, with Nerd, while we made pancakes. 
I felt things. Real things. My own things. I stopped putting bad feelings in boxes, to ~~explode~~ examine at a later date. I dealt with things as they came, smiled at nothing, and generally just let **life** happen. The thought hadn't crossed my mind in so long. It sucks to be back here. 
My grandda's gone. I lost him back in December, to cancer. I can't measure my days by being able to take care of him anymore. He was supposed to live. He was supposed to go on another cruise. He was supposed to see me get married. He was supposed to be able to retire properlyâ€¦ He was supposed to live. And he didnâ€™t. 
I failed. I left, to go on a stupid vacation, and he got sicker. I came back, and there was no recovery for him. It was too late. And I did that. I didnâ€™t push hard enough for the hospital to do more scans, and I let his cancer spread. My mom tasked me with taking care of him, and I couldnâ€™t. 
My grandda told me that I had found love and I should hold onto it forever, and I lost it. I failed. 
I left, and he asked for me, and I couldnâ€™t be here to keep him out of the hospital. I let my mother watch her father die. I did that. 
I asked for her to stay with me after he got out of the hospital, because I didnâ€™t think I could take care of him on my own anymore, even though I had been doing it for a year, by myself. I put my mother through that. I failed, and now I pay for it. 
I have lost everything that gave me joy over the past year, and I deserve it. 
Nerd dipped, not that I blame him. 
We talked about getting married, because the Army wanted to send him to Alaska. It was mentioned as a solution to the separation we were already facing. He said, "I didn't want to ask you like this." So, we decided to wait. 
They sent him to Texas instead, and he decided it just wasn't worth it, to try with me. Texas was supposed to be much more do-able, than Alaska. Texas was supposed to be easier to manage. Waiting was supposed to be smarter. But I guess absence doesn't really make the heart grow fonder. So with his orders for his first deployment, he got a new girlfriend. 
Now, I'm back to 'One more day'.
'One more day' because I'm selfish enough to be afraid no one would miss me. 
I'm scared that after the original shock wore off, no one would really care. 
All the way back to middle school, I have had the hardest time understanding why we do all this. Why we spend our life, cultivating all these things into it... just to have it all end. What is the point? And I know, that's all existential angst... But I catch myself thinking about it all the time. 
I have spent a long time trying to find something to live for. Something to survive for. Anything to fill the void and make it feel like doing anything mattersâ€¦  I donâ€™t feel anything except despair and despondency again. I mean, honestly, if we are all to die in the end, then why bother? If no one is truly who they say they are, and they are all going to leave in the endâ€¦
I donâ€™t want to fight and claw and hurt everyday, trying to make it through, just to die.
I donâ€™t want to get better, just to fall.
I donâ€™t want that. I don't **want** any of this.
I will not make it, because I do not want to.
And Iâ€™ve always been a sucker for ruining the ending.
But I am afraid. I'm afraid of what would happen to my sister, who has suffered so much loss in her short 17 years. I'm afraid of what would happen to my mother, who has just lost both of her parents, in less than two years, and is barely holding it together. I'm afraid of my roommates, thinking they failed me in some way, because they couldn't see what was happening. 
And yet, I think about it almost every day. 
It's my own voice, whispering how easy it would be. How quiet it would finally be. The fact that I can't feel any of my emotions properly, wouldn't matter any more. 
My mom would figure it out. My parents love my sister, and she's young, she would adjust. My roommates have each other (they're dating, which probably makes the whole being alone thing harder for me to deal with, but hey). There is not a single person who's world would stop spinning, for even a moment, without me. 
I wouldn't be tired all the time, I wouldn't have to fight with myself about getting out of bed. There would just be nothing. 
"But, what if..." a quieter voice always whispers.
What a funny thing, to keep living a life that you're not even sure you want to see another day of. What a ridiculous excuse, pulled out of the air by someone too afraid to give up something she hates.
