I need help and i dont have anyone to talk to.Hey reddit, a little back story first i guess. Im a freshman in college, never really had a girlfriend. Started having suicidal thoughts almost a year ago in high school.

My parents have been going through a divorce and it tearing me apart. Everything has just been getting worse since college started. I really liked this girl and we seemed to have something, we were flirting and sleeping together (just cuddling) and it was so nice. It was the first time in a while that i felt happy. But of course that came to an end, she didnt want a relationship and she seemed to be embarrassed by me. Were still friends and it kills me.

Im just having a complete breakdown right now, theres train tracks on campus and i just want to go lay on them. Ive sought help already, i go to the counseling center on campus but it doesnt help me. Ive tried almost everything (except actually meds) and i just cant find anything to make me happy.

   Please help me reddit, i dont know what to do and im really scared. I havent been this bad before.
