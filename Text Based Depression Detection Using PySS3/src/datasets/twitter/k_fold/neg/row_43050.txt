Is it common to feel this way?Here is the scoop. I don't have any "problems" like a relationship break-up or lack of money or something immediate like that. However, with the years (I'm in my early 20ties), I have come to realize how inadequate I am. I realize what work needs to be done to have a good career but my flesh just fails me. My brain can only focus on a single task for some hours and then it gets cloudy to get into dealing with upcoming tasks or many at once. After, I just can't bring myself to learn on my own after hours to be properly versed in my study subject. Then, my body is crap: I get tired after some time doing physical tasks especially if they are repetitive and that also drains me mentally (for whatever reason). It's like carrying weights on my limbs everywhere and having a suppressant embedded in my brain. I can't stand laziness in other people and yet here I am unable to do what needs to be done and that mortifies me. I am afraid I won't rise into the ranks of a company because of this. I won't be able to set up a successful start-up for the same reason. I haven't had a girlfriend and it looks like even if I did I may not be able to handle a relationship on top a day job. As I mentioned earlier I don't have problems *YET* but I see the writing on the wall. I have stayed alive long enough figuring my life will be good but I am getting more and more convinced that the problem is within and therefore I am leaning strongly towards committing suicide. Nonetheless, there is something I am curious about and that is whether other people also feel like this. Is there something I am missing or my assessment is right and should just go ahead?
