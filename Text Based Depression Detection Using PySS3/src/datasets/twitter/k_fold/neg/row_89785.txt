My friend is in the psych ward, what can i do to help?hey, so my friend (14) attempted suicide last night and had to go to hospital and get her stomach pumped, and in now in the process of being placed into a psych unit because this isnâ€™t her first hospital trip due to her mental health. iâ€™m wondering what i can do to help, and iâ€™m not sure how long sheâ€™ll be there for but after the quarantine is done i plan on visiting. i was wondering if sheâ€™s allowed a phone so i can text, do i need to write in the post? what can/canâ€™t i bring when i need to visit her? -for reference, iâ€™m from the UK and i assume sheâ€™ll be in a low security unit

thanksðŸ’Ÿ
