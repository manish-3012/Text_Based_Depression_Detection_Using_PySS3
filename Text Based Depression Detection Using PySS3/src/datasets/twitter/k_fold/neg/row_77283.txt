My life's empty and suicide is becoming an optionI've been thinking about killing myself since I was six. I'm now 21 and I've never tried it.

Over the years I got into the habit of not taking my feelings seriously. Every time I felt the urge to jump I'd just tell myself "not today" and move on. I was very sad at times, but my rational thoughts were stronger. I thought everything could get better some day.

In the past few weeks I noticed something inside of me is changing. I feel like my rational thoughts are gradually losing the battle. While I always wanted to kill myself, it's beginning to become a valid option.

I just feel like I got nobody. I have a couple of friends, but they don't know me. Nobody knows me. For them, I'm Mr. Funny Guy. I don't want to tell anyone how I feel because I don't want to stress them. I doubt anyone would understand anyway.

I feel alone and lost even when I'm around people. If I think of the future, there's no happiness. The only future I see is suicide, sooner or later. I just can't imagine me living a happy life. My life's a void of broken dreams, sadness and loneliness. I feel like I never had a childhood. 

Why can't I just be happy like the others? Will I ever be able to get rid of those thoughts and the sadness? I fear I won't because all this is too deeply embedded in my personality. But I don't want to live on this way.

I won't do it in the next few months. I just noticed I'm heading for the gutter and I wanted to get some advice before it's too late.
