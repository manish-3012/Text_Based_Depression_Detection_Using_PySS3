Cowards, uniteHi, I am a coward. I want to kill myself every day but somehow I'm still here. The stupidest stuff keeps me here, like deciding what the "last" things will beâ€”the last episode of my favorite TV show to watch, the last song I'll listen to, my last words to loved ones. It's a lot! I know that when I do finally do it it'll be totally impulsive and spur-of-the-moment. Anyway, I know I'm a fucking coward. Here for another day. Throw another shrimp on the barbie
