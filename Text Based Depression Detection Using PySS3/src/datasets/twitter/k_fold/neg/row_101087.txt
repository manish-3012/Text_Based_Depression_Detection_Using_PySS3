I can't keep trying to delay the inevitableI'm 22 now and I don't even see a way for me to reach 23 let alone 25. Sure, maybe I could beat this beast this time. But I don't think I could the next. All I would end up doing is dragging my mother further into debt and delaying what my fate is. I can't even think anymore; I can't concentrate long enough to cook, the only concentration I can spare is for how to end this. That, of course, works almost perfectly. But I can't figure out a timing; I don't want to hurt my family more than I have to but I also don't think I can make it to Christmas. Maybe to my grandparents' anniversary, but then is Thanksgiving too -- there's no time that won't ruin the memory of a time of year that's supposed to be treasured.
