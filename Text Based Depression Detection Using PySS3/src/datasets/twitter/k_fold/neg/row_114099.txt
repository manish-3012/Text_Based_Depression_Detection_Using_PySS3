Draining my days on artificial happinessI'm at the point where my life is a routine. Work a low paid job, come home lonely, look at facebook, youtube, instagram, feel that artificial happiness that I'm happy for these people but as soon as the tv is off or the laptop is closed or the app is closed, I look around and think to myself, I'm pretty fucking worthless. The quiet room pulsates around my lonely self. I usually spend my weekends curled up in a ball thinking about the potential things in life that I could do. 

One common one, is dreaming that I'm with the love of my life, travelling the world, looking at the views from a beautiful apartment, then I just use that as a "mission complete" logic and that I don't need to accomplish that in real life. I am rotting, almost at the point where I want to barricade the windows up to prevent humanity from contacting me. I'm 21, virgin, never kissed a girl and would probably never want to engage in sex or anything like that. I want to be a clean soul. But just my depression, anxiety has just completely taken over me as well as laziness and I'm just rotting my days after work sleeping in bed. I cannot do this anymore. Even tho it's been 3 years since I left highschool, this routine in my subconscious is very comforatble, but in reality, I'm feeling sick. Whenever I'd go out for a walk, I'd think of terrible things when I see humans walk around, laughter amongst couples going for walks. I feel like harming someone. That's when my evil side comes in.

I'd often treat myself to a cafe feeling quite happy that I'm still alone and I pay for my own stuff. I then see couples, at every single table, and theres one reserved for me. I'd hold on to this logic of being single and that I'm so safe alone. But I cannot. I see everyone just laughing, sharking kisses, I want to just shout that life is a lie and start bashing everyone. But it's all in my head. I sit down, breathe out and sip my coffee. A bunch of fucked up thoughts pass my head before I switch back to reality. And by fucked up I mean ways I want to die and people around me.

I don't know if I've been controlled by dark anxiety, or I'm just born with a fucking disease which makes me completely hate that fact that there's only one race and that's the human race.
