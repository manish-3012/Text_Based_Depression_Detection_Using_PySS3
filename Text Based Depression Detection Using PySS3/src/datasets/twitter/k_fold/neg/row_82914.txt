Eventually, after life kicks you down, and then won't let you get back up, you're left with very little choices. I've always thought about suicide. Not because I'm sad or depressed. But because I have never had good luck. Never given a break. So my time has come.**hello guys, this is andrews sister melisa. i dont know how many of u guys knew him but he wouldn't shut up about reddit so i came onto his account try to try to figure how why he'd do it? i use the site too, but hes like obsessed with it. he was such a sweet kid. hes my little bro.**

**i just wanted to let u folks know that andrew is alive but he is in intensive care. it looks bleak in my oinion because this is eactly how when my ex bf died in a wreck 2 years ago. i cant lose my baby brother this is the worst pain ive ever felt.**


Let this be a warning to other people contemplating suicide, if you have options **you have options**. My options have run out, basically. I can either pretend to be a mad man, and go all Walter White and strip down naked in public, and get locked in an insane asylum, or I can find some local dirt bag. A registered pedophile. A drug dealer. And murder them, and be put in jail for life. 

One thing for certain is that no matter how much I build my life up towards something good, it comes crashing down **100** percent of the time. 

I started as most do with 100. When I was 19 and my house was burned down, arson, because they got the wrong address (as I learned when they were arrested) my 100 was brought down to about 1. I slowly scraped and clawed to get my life at about a 15 or 20, when I was 27. 

Guess what happened? I'll give you a new, it wasn't good. So I was knocked down to almost complete 0. 

I've been teetering around 0 for the past 5 years, and now, the little I had is going to be done in 10 days. So for the first time in my life, I am done fighting. I am finally doing things on my own terms. 

This isn't a cry for help, because you can't stop the inevitable. Even if someone worked some hacker magic and found me, I would already long be dead. I bought myself what's called a "bundle" of heroin. I don't do heroin. But today I do. I am going to do the entire "bundle". All in one big fat line. Then I am going to lie down, clothes my eyes, and let sweet sleep take me over. 

It's already out in front of me, all set up. Line set up, and a plastic straw cut to snort it with. When I click that send button, I am immediately snorting that line. 

So why am I telling you this? Because maybe life just *isn't* worth living for all of us. The word is overpopulated as is, and a bunch of depressed people, reproducing with other depressed people just keeps the cycle going. I am ending the cycle here. At least for my namesake, the game is over. 

I wish those of you better off than I, a lot of luck. And I believe 99% of you will get through this and lead a happy life. My time has come, and it has gone. 

Today, I will die. Born October, 5th, 1985. Died February, 12th, 2018.

Mom, Melissa, Monica, Nathan, Dad and I guess Tommy. I love you all and this has nothing to do with you. Don't blame yourselves. This is the best option. 

Reddit, I loved you when I posted on my main account. Even if I was a cynical troll 99.9% of the time. You were a good distraction. 

Courtney, I'm sorry for what I did to you. 

AW and LG, you didn't deserve that. I hope if there is a God, he is watching over you. 

See ya!
