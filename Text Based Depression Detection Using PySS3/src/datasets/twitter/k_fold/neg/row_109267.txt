I'm lying on bed with a loaded gun lying beside meI'm just scared of the pain. It's the only reason I haven't ended my life yet. I have no reason to keep fighting. I'm so tired of life. I don't remember ever being happy. Even when I was a kid, I remember being always depressed and wondering what the fuck I was doing in life.

I'm 21. Living with my mentally abusive parents. I'm sure their toxicity is one of the major causes of my depression. Leaving this house and becoming independent was my main goal. I don't wanna be rich. I don't wanna find love. I don't wanna be better than anyone. I just wanna live a reasonable life where I can do whatever I want and not get extremely toxic criticism for doing so.

I don't know if I have what it takes to live a normal life anymore. It feels like the depression made me realize certain things about life that made it sound really stupid and pointless. I can't work or study anymore or even do things I used to enjoy. Eveything is pointless. Work is the only thing that can get me out of this house but I can't do that. I'm so tired and overwhelmed.

I have a lot of friends who care about me but none of them can really help me. I ask them what their reasons to live are and whatever they say seems stupid and superficial to me. I wish having friends who care about you was as good as it sounds. None of them really gets how you feel. They try to help based on their understanding but they have no clue how you're feeling and what you're thinking, only you do.

The only thing I need right now is a bullet in my head but I'm too scared to do that. What if I don't die and live the rest of my life with permanent brain damage or even paralyzed and not able to complete the job. What if I die a slow and painful death and it turns out that when someone passes out the pain doesn't end. I haven't talked to anyone who died of a bullet in his head, I have no idea what it is like.

I hesitated a lot to end it in the past because I didn't want my siblings to suffer because of it. However, that's not the case today. I'm merely scared to do it.

I can't stand life anymore. I don't get how people make it to their 30s and even 40s without killing themselves. I have no idea why homeless people or people with disabilities don't end their lives. Life isn't worth living even if you had a perfect life, let alone having a terrible one.

Happy people were born happy. They didn't work for that. I don't think one has the ability to change. You might be able to fake and become really good at faking it, but you can't change. I've been trying to be happy for 3 years and that's why I came to that conclusion.

Even if I don't end it now, I know I'll eventually do it. Maybe tomrrow or even next year. I know I won't adapt to life. It makes no sense.
