A coworker just told me he took a few dozen ibuprofen because he wants to end it all. What am I supposed to do?He is related to the higher ups in the company but something tells me running to tell them what he told me isn't the best approach. Then again I am not a counselor and I have problems of my own in life but I don't want anything bad to happen. What should I do?
