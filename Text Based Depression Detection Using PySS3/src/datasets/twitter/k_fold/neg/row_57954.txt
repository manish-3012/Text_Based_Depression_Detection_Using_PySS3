No Point In Living, If Life Is Full time WorkI just turned 20 and have been in the workforce for 3 or so years now.

i fucking hate it, as an understatement.

Modern day work is terribly unfufilling, and most days i literally have to force myself to go, and even when outside its a daily battle not too use another sick day, just to do something useful with my time.

growing up people are told they can achieve anything they would like by adulthood, all that i would like too do is travel the world and sight see, but to do so i would need to work away the majority of my life and get to old to enjoy it.

I truly and firmly believe there is more to life then working your life away in the good years until you are too old to enjoy it or want to enjoy it.

I work full time 40 hours a week with only minimalist expenses and still am just scrapping by, it is not worth it.

I wish in the end i could of been lucky enough to gain an inheritance or be an actor or just generally a trust fund kid so i could actually of enjoyed life. 

February 2nd Is The Day When I Will Happily Meet The End If Things Do Not Change Within The Time From Today To The 2nd.
