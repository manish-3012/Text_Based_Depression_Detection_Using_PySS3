I wish I could end my life...I am absolutely done with this now. My parents have already told me that I'm a disgrace, worthless, etc. I try to ignore it but they're always around me and will never stop reminding me how much of a burden and headache I am for them. They even told me that they wish that I was never born. 

I just wish I could end my life so I wouldnt have to deal with or think about this anymore.
