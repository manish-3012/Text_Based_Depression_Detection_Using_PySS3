What do I do? (Suicidal)I hate myself sometimes. I really do. I feel like Iâ€™m nobody. Iâ€™m one on 10 billion, dammit. Nobody other than close friends and family know me. Iâ€™m insignificant. I just donâ€™t Matter. For a long long time, I have felt happy when thinking of killing myself. It makes me feel like people will finally care. I will finally be loved and I will matter. People will finally know of my existence. I have the hotline on dial, so I will do that when this is posted. I just feel like Iâ€™d finally be loved by everyone when Iâ€™m gone. I want people to smile when they think of me. I feel like theyâ€™ll only care when Iâ€™m dead. I get picked on at school, and I feel like my bullies will finally be done harassing me and will feel sympathy if I do so. I just canâ€™t knowing my parents would be heartbroken, and my brothers, too. Every time the thought of death comes through my head, I get happy. I feel like Iâ€™d not be forgotten if I went out with a bang. Idk what to do, I just feel insignificant and bored. What do I do?
