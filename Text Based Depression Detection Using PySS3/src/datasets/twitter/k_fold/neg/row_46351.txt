Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m giving up on life. Thereâ€™s no reason for me to be here anymore. I canâ€™t make my boyfriend happy, I piss everyone off, and Iâ€™m nothing but a big disappointment. I want to get help because Iâ€™ve finally realized I need it, but at the same time just want to die in a hole somewhere. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve been fighting this battle for to long and have gotten no where. Iâ€™m nothing and will never be anything so whatâ€™s the point? Someone please save me from this thing thatâ€™s eating alive from the inside out.
