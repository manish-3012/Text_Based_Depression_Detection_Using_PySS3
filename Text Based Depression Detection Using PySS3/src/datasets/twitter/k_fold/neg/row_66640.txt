I hope they understandthe only time I feel relief is when I dream about killing myself. Iâ€™m so tired. I think everyone in my life can see how hard Iâ€™ve tried. I pray theyâ€™ll understand. I pray theyâ€™ll remember me for what I loved. my favorite songs, my favorite memories, every moment Iâ€™ve laughed, and every time Iâ€™ve ever smiled. thatâ€™s what I want to leave on this earth. I donâ€™t want to hurt anymore. I donâ€™t want any other soul to hurt from me again. thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so hard to do this. but to keep going is harder.
