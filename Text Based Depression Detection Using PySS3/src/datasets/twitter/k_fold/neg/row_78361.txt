It is matter of time until i kill myselfeveryday i feel the symptoms of death i feel a pain like a needle in my heart and chest extreme pain in the left side of my abdomen and an endless headache , i planned everything the gun and the place  but i am doing my research now to find where and which is the best way to shot , i will do it in a remote place so i will be marked as a "missing person" even if a miracle occurred and i didn't have to do it i don't know what to do with the rest of my life , i put i deadline i hope i meet it with courage and actually do it i will be found with a 7.56 cal bullet in my chest , i will use the van gogh way .
