No point in living anymoreMaybe someone here can convince me to not kill myself. Good luck. Posting with this account since theres at least one person in the real world who knows my real identity 

I've been separated from my wife for 10 months. The in laws hate me. Everything is "my fault." My wife doesnt want to live we and we haven't even hugged in 2 months, last kiss was in march. Since the quarantine really began she doesnt want to get in my car in case it has the virus and I'm not allowed in their house. In 2018 I went back to school to be able to get a degree and support a family without her needing to work outside the home. Now I've lost the motivation and ability to focus and dont think I'll be able to return. Since around march I've had a big decrease in my ability to enjoy things I used to like my "favorite" shows and games. This marriage was my first and it probably be my last even if I stay alive. I don't really have any friends. I've been living with my parents and sister but i dont feel any happiness at home. Usually my family is fighting about one thing or another. Before this relationship (counting dating, over 5 years) I had about 5 others. Everytime it was the girl to call it off. I honestly have no motivation to be alive anymore. I see no future for me with school, job, or family. When my last ex dumped me 8 years ago I was in the hospital for suicide threats for a few days and until a year ago I had thought that was all in the past. Everyday life gets worse and loses more meaning. Why stay alive in a miserable life like that? I need to end this misery.
