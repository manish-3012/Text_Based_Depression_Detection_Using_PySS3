I feel like God has put a curse on me.I have ASD. I have been dealt enough loneliness and heartache To last a lifetime. Ive done everything to try to make friends. At work, at school. I even joined a fraternity and I dont even have a connection with my big. I have been a burden on everyone. Im not saying that to be edgyâ€, but time and time again. I see the look on peopleâ€™s faces. The look in their eyes. They dont know what to do with me. 

I dont even feel like a person anymore. I feel like an object. A monster sometimes.

I try so hard. What on Earth have I done to deserve this... affliction.

Im so tired. Of being hurt. Heartbroken. I wish there was a cure. Really. But the more I stay here. The more I realize, that this is my life. And its always going to be. 

Im not going to hurt myself. But god. I wish I could be someone else. Anybody else but me.

Thanks for listening I guess :)
