a good fucking titleglad to say iâ€™ve made up my mind

iâ€™m tired of having to put up with tedious, useless schoolwork

i used to be in high honors but after all the drugs and realizing how pointless school and life in general is, iâ€™m failing

my mom yells at me every day if i get anything below and A, even though i can barely bring myself to get out of bed and shower. jm tryingf my best ty
mom. i really am. 

no friends, hobbies, talents, interests, except drugs. 

i experience derealization/dissociating/depersonalization constantly before but it got worse after drugs

my life has been genuinely terrible since iâ€™ve been born and iâ€™m sick of it 

iâ€™m not going to bother writing a thesisabout it bc i know nobody cares. they never do. but basically add chronic depression, inherited addiction, rape, and constant abuse and bad decisions

someone like me deserves to die.
