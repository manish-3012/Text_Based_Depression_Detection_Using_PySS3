why does reaching out to someone have to suck so bad? everyone i talk to about being sad honestly just doesnâ€™t seem to care?.

 my friends know all about my sadness yet get mad everytime i donâ€™t want to go somewhere. and my supposed bestfriend knows when iâ€™m sad yet still wants me to solve all her problems and respond to her questions like iâ€™m google. no one wants to let me vent despite me letting them ask me for advice and helping them through dark times all the time.

 every time i mention it to my mother she just plain ignores me. and i am definitely not the favourite child, so i do understand slightly. all that attention is on my brother. one time my mum was leaving to go for her routine visit to her â€œboyfriendâ€. and i couldnâ€™t help but cry looking at her, and she sat down with me for a moment, before telling me â€**are you just pretending to be sad so i wonâ€™t go?.**â€ she has seen all the cuts on my arm and her response was to scold me to never do it again. when i start arguing with her, which is quite frequent, i often break down in tears because thatâ€™s not how mother-daughter relationships should work. and whenever i mention my self-harm, she tells me she had it worse, and that she also harmed herself. but we are both depressed, so i canâ€™t be mad at her, or sad that she canâ€™t help me. my dad could honestly not care, as we only text, or on the rare occasions go out for breakfast with my brother, where i canâ€™t say anything in fear of being harassed that â€œi cant be sadâ€ at home from him, and most likely injured.

therapy is too costly, and i donâ€™t think my town or anywhere near me even does it. and my school counselors seem so, uninterested in everyone. and iâ€™m scared if i tell them that sometimes i think about ending it all, that they will call the police and send me hospital. why canâ€˜t it just be easy?.                    \[sorry for the long post :/\]
