UhWell April 23rd, 2019 almost 2 months ago I tried to commit suicide but obviously I survived and was in inpatient for almost 2 weeks. I'm seeing a therapist for support and stuff, but I'm having a problem. I'm going back down into a depressive episode, and it's only getting worse. I sometimes get a physical urge to either harm myself or kill myself. My suicidal thoughts have returned, and I want to bring it up with my therapist but I don't want to be sent to inpatient again :/ like I'm scared too.
