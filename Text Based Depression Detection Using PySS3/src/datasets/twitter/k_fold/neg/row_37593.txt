Just needing some adviceOkay I am 18 years old and a freshmen in college, I was raised in a middle class home with a good environment. This is where I'm struggling. Comparing me to some people on here is like a joke, they have lost everything meanwhile I am just being a whiner. I am in a far better situation, but I keep having suicidal thoughts. When I do I just hate myself because I know how well I have it. I ask myself "Why am I even complaining?" This only makes me hate myself because I see it as complete weakness. I don't think I have depression but these thoughts have been more common as I am getting older. I worry that one day I will do it. By that time I have wasted my families time and money. It's like being a pure liability. I expect to get responses that say, "find your passion in life" or "go for long walks to relax." But I'm just plain lazy, it's like I don't care about what might happen to me. It's like an investment almost, part of me wishes to give up and just be done while the other part of me wants to risk it. Doesn't want my families memory of me to be stained but I only feel I'm getting worse. I really don't know what to expect from the responses but this is the first time I've ever shown this in me. I don't think I could ever admit this to a group or anything. Hope this wasn't too confusing or anything, maybe I just needed to get it off my chest.
