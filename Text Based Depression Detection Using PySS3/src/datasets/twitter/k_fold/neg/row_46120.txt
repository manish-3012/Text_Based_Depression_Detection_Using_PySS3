severly depressed. living for nothingi live a very secluded life.  people dont like me or maybe i just dont belong around people.  I have nothing to look forward to other than death.  i know it sounds bad but i wish for something like cancer.  I know that is spineless and disrespectful to people who actually have it but i hope to feel something, anything.  maybe ill jump off abridge or something.
