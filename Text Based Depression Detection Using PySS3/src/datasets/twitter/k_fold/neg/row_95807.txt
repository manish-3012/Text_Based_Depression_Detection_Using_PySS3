I want to live more than I want to die, but only if I can live a different lifeI want to kill myself.
But I don't really. I just don't want to live this life anymore.
I want to live a different life. 
A life where my circumstances are different.
A life where my body doesn't ache no matter what I do.
A life where I don't have to wait with baited breath for the mail, for the $200 that is going to save my family from going hungry.
A life where I can rely on something, or someone.
A life where I can trust what I perceive to be true.
A life where I can trust my emotions.
A life where I can trust myself.
A life where my life doesn't hang in jeopardy of ending, or severely going downhill with just one crisis.
A life where I can work, and I am happy at my job.
A life where I can provide for my daughter.
A life where she doesn't have to know what poverty feels like, tastes like, sounds like.
A life where I don't ache for the suffering of others.
A life where I want to live.
A life where I flourish and grow, not degrade and die off.
