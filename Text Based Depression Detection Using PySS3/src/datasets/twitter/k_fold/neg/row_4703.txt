I tried to kill myself a few years backSorry for the grammar and everything. Im a lil drunk. I tried to hang myself a few years ago but failed somehow. Guess I was too young.  Now im 19, have access to guns and im fully capable of doing so. Ive been depressed as fuck for the past 9 months and have really be considering it. I don't really have anything to lose. I Just dont wanna make my mom and my dog sad. So many things have collectively been addinh up and im just over it. Fuck it. Might as well. Whose gonna miss me? My mom and my dog? Maybe. Fuck it.
