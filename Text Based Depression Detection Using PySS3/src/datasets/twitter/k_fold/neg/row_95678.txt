A rant about my minor inconveniencesI am a junior in college and I have no motivation, no direction and no idea what I want to do with my life. I have always been an average student, getting a mix of Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s and some Câ€™s. Iâ€™ve never considered myself super smart, or even very hard working. Iâ€™ve alway been average. My freshman year, I wanted to be a doctor, so I decided to be a BioChem Major, but I lacked a strong work ethic and struggled with understanding the concepts, so I almost flunked my first two terms with a 2.36 GPA. My second term got better with a 3.05 GPA but since then Iâ€™ve been averaging a 3.0 GPA, there isnâ€™t anyone to blame but myself. Right now I have a 3.12 GPA. Ive jumped from a science major to a psychology major to a business major, now Iâ€™ve settled with a international studies major with a concentration in business and a chinese major and a business minor, but I donâ€™t have a passion in business, I just chose it because of its potential career opportunities later in life. But who wants to hire a international studies major with a 3.1 GPA. I work a little at school and its ok but it leaves me with more feelings of exhaustion and misery. I donâ€™t really have friends in school, I always feel left out, like a tag along, I donâ€™t feel like I belong. My friends are all apart of dance group that Iâ€™m not apart of, I donâ€™t even know why they invite me to hang out. Mind you I am a big introvert and very shy and I get anxious around new people and basically anyone. So making friends is hard. I also have a fear of driving, which Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll never get over. I have my license, but Iâ€™m deeply afraid of getting into an accident. My parents never had time to teach me, so they put me through drivers ed. I also have a case of gum disease and cavaties, because of bad hygiene habits and falling asleep. I am trying to work on that right now, I use an electric toothbrush and waterpik, and make sure I get out of bed and brush my teeth before going to sleep. But breaking bad habits take time. I am also fat, because of laziness and eating my feelings. Iâ€™ve never had a boyfriend or girlfriend and fear that Iâ€™ll die alone. I fear that after I graduate I wonâ€™t find a job and I wonâ€™t be able to pay off my 70k dollars of student loan debt. sometimes I think if I just end it all, my problems would just go away. But I canâ€™t do that to my parents. If I kill myself, Iâ€™ll just be making it worse for my parents by forcing them to pay my student loans. I feel worthless, I hate myself. Everything is my fault. I have so many regrets. I want to rob a bank, pay off my loans, and leave this earth. Like sometimes Iâ€™m happy, but then I go back home and realize what my life has become. Then I overthink and hate myself for being overdramatic and these little things are easily fixable. But other times I feel hopeless, I feel like no one cares, I donâ€™t care. I am not looking for pity, I just needed to really say this. Even writing this I canâ€™t help but think about what others will say about this post. What they will say about me. I have complained too much, donâ€™t get me wrong I am so grateful for my life, Iâ€™m not poor, I am not homeless, I am not disabled or in a country where war and poverty is a norm. I have two parents who love and support me unconditionally and have provided me with so much. But thatâ€™s also a reason I feel like shiz, I feel like I am letting my parents down, I feel like a disappointment. I feel like I never should have been born.
