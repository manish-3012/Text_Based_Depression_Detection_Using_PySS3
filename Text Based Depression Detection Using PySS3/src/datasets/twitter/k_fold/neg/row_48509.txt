What's a quick way to off yourselfI keep having thoughts of regrets of what I could of done differently to avoid what has happened to me, I'm such a socially awkward piece of shit and I can't handle these thoughts I have. Throughout the day I'll have a bunch of depressed and suicidal thoughts and then a rush of happy thoughts for a short time then back to suicidal idk what to do. I'm tired of it and I think my life just keeps getting worse and worse.
