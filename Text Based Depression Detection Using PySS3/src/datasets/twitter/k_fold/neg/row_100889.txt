I have nothing going for me...Iâ€™m 19, enrolled in college but failing. Unsure what i want to do with my life, Iâ€™m so far behind in school thereâ€™s no coming back. I just got fired from my job, had a panic attack on the way, after really bad traffic and people driving like crazy. told them I would be late. They told me to just not come back. 
Just got hired for a new job, things were looking up. Went for ONE day, they said I wasnâ€™t fast enough. Didnâ€™t get fired, just demoted. Although I made it very clear in the interview process i did not have any prior experience in the field. The job is not worth the hassle now, as I only get paid $7/ hour as opposed to be hired for over $20/hr. Iâ€™m so numb.  No where to go from here.
