SuicideWhy does it feel like the only way? 
Itâ€™s not even a way! 

I get up, and I think about when Iâ€™m going to do it. 
I get a drink, I think about how Iâ€™m going to do it. 
I order the things Iâ€™m going to do it with... 
then I keep them in a safe, but then Iâ€™m so scared that Iâ€™ll fail so I order more. 
But then the thoughts on how fat I am get louder, so I take .. lax. 
I hold my safe key tighter. 
Sleep with blades under my pillow. 
When is this going to end? 
I canâ€™t keep living like this...
