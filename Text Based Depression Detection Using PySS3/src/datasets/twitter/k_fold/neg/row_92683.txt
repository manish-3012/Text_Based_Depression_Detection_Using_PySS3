I hate that I have to rely on technology to be not depressedThe tile just says it all. First of all I'm an introvert. I just got back home from a trip of 5 days with my family, which I have to go involuntarily with like 10 of my relatives, which I don't hate. It's kinda weird that I'm the only one using a phone a lot. They're not poor nor rich so they use pretty decent phones. I really noticed that they don't actually use their phones that much. It kinda pains me that I'm like a spoiled child who only relies on technology. They're not tech savvy so they don't use that much but it feels like I'm an outcast. I sometimes wanna just shut off my phone and enjoy the scenery. It just doesn't work for me because I'm always "sad". I just wanna be normal and enjoy scenes sometimes. I can't help but rely on tech to be happy. I wish I wouldn't just exist sometimes.
