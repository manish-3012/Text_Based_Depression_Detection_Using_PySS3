Thinking of ending it againI've lost all my friends because my shitty depressed self decided to finally push them all away because I don't deserve them. I've barely moved from my bed for the last few days and i've been doing nothing but sleep. Thinking of finding the tallest building in town and just hanging up there until I get the nerve to finally let myself fall. Sounds like moms going to be out for temp job sometime soon.... may do it while she's gone. She deserves so much better then me...
