I would would make a throwaway but I don't anyone will find this...J can't complain too much but I do. Today at dinner that my ex-fiancÃ©e (will explain) took me out to (will explain) I said something profound, at least to myself. 

"I'm being destroyed by apathy, driven by anxiety, and for depression everyday." 

I actually just lost someone, my cousin only a few years older than me, due to a bullet in his head that he placed there. Which made me to say another profound thing at this date of disaster.

"I really don't care about others or understand why I feel the ways I feel, I only last my grandma a few months ago and doesn't care but cried over my cousin when I never spoke to him" 

Which I've been thinking a lot about I have no friends (which I hate) and just moved starts away from all my family! I don't know if I love anyone, how can I when I constantly hate myself. I contemplate suicide a lot for stupid small things but for big things I usually just break down into an anxiety filled seizure or depression laced nap. I really just don't know what to think about life or myself or this cruddy situation.
