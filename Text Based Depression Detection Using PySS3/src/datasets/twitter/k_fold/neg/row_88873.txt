Being Treated for Depression + Anxiety. Still No Will to LiveLast month I finally worked up the courage to begin treatment for my depression and anxiety. I'm still in the process of figuring out what medications work for me, and it's been difficult. Even though I spend a lot less time crying than I did before, I still feel no will to live. I can't even function. I just don't even want to try anymore. No medication in this world can make me feel like I belong in this society. I'm so tired of talking to people (in person and over the phone) and I just want to isolate myself and disappear. I don't want to go back to work or start classes up again. I don't know why I'm even here. I feel absolutely worthless.
