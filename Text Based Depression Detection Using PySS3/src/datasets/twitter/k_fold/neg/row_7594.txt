I can't ever be happyI just give up...

Long story short..

For 6/7 years, i've been feeling really shit, to the point where I've planned and attempted suicide and done self harm.

I cant ever be happy. Only a few months ago, I had the biggest downfall in my life. I felt like I had no friends, nobody to talk to. I had nothing good going for me. Failure at college, people picking on me, no future. I had nothing.

I had much more problems too, which Id rather not talk about. ( sorry :/ )

Only recently, I got a girlfriend and as cringy as it sounds she makes me really happy. A few months before then, I had been dealing with suicidal thoughts, nightmares, panic attacks. You name it! And somehow this girl began to make me feel much better and forget how I felt before, but this one guy is trying to get with her and he doesn't like me. Ever since he found out about me and her, he's been trying to act like my friend to get closer to her. Its gotten to the point where i've felt really uncomfortable and started to question the relationship.
She makes me so happy and I just don't want to lose her to him. I've got a feeling I'm gonna lose her and already I can feel my emotions coming back. What do I do? I can't take it anymore.....ugh...

Im sorry for the post...just had to talk to someone &lt;3
