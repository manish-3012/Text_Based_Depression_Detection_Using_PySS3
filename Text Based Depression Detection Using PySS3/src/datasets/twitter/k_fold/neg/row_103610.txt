Update: the one thing I had motivating me to continue life is overPosted like a week ago. Basically I havenâ€™t been able to find a job related to the degree I just radiates with, and am living at home working a shit job. Bipolar and in an extremely depressed mood. Was doing long distance with my boyfriend, who I thought was the one.. literally wanted it all with him and Iâ€™m pretty hesitant with commitment. He randomly FaceTimed me today and broke up with me, out of the blue. I have been having the thought that if I didnâ€™t have him I might kill myself...and now it happened..... I donâ€™t feel suicidal in this very moment, but Iâ€™m scared that next time I do, I will act on it.


Iâ€™m scared.
