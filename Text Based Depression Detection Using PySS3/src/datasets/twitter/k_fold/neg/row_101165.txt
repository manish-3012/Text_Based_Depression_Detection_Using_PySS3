Gonna end it soon I thinkI just can't bear living this life, in this body, in this place. I'm scared, lonely and finished. I'm so done. I prayed for help, even though I'm not religious, because I got that desperate. Nothing happened, of course. When you truly realize that there is no hope and no deus ex machina in the real world, living becomes a hell.


There's a couple of things I wanna do first before I'm really gonna end it all. I have no clue what method I feel comfortable using. I sometimes am so depressed I get a rush to grab a knife from the kitchen and cut my neck open, but I can't.


I've had a decent life, just really short (I'm almost in my 20s). My life peaked very early, I guess. The way the world has changed has made it too difficult for me to function. Plus I hate my body, everything about me is messed up.


Fuck, I never thought it would come this far. My life could have been so much better and less dramatic under different circumstances. I'm just fed up now...


Need to go to work, soon, but I just had one of the biggest meltdowns ever. Still taste the salt of my tears in my mouth and my eyes very obviously give away I cried only moments ago.
