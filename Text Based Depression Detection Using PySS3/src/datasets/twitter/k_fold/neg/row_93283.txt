I did something bad and I canâ€™t stop feeling suicidalIâ€™m forcing my body not to go and do something stupid, my hearts racing a million times an hour and I just canâ€™t cope anymore.

Iâ€™m having a breakdown.

I lied about being an adult so I could get presents for my sister on Christmas, I then felt guilty and did the right thing and told the truth. My mums angry at me for telling the truth because now she has to pay possibly hundreds in presents and we canâ€™t even afford food. 

I feel like if I kill myself it will all stop and Iâ€™m right, Iâ€™m so close to just doing it. Nobody would want the money back anymore if a kid ended there life over it.. right? 

Iâ€™m holding myself down, tomorrow Iâ€™m going to the doctor and Iâ€™m going to try to convince them to put me into a mental hospital for a while, wish it could be tonight though because I doubt Iâ€™m gonna make it through the night and I just need someone to watch me all the time. 

Iâ€™d love some advice, someone to talk to or Someone to help me be safe either is welcome just please donâ€™t get angry at me, I canâ€™t cope anymore
