Age 15, currently struggling with inhalant addiction, ruined my social life, have no friends.Hi ...

Im 15. Grade nine had the most perfect girl. Only time I ever felt truly happy. Now going into grade 11 and have nobody, completely alone, do 5 cans of computer duster a day, and depressed as fuck. Why the fuck should I keep going? Inb4 u say go to rehab i already have. Shit did not help. Im done. Theres no hope for me. I plan on buying fenti-bars ( xanax laced w fentynal ) and prolly od'ing.
