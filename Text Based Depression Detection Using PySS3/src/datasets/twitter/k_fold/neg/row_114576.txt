Is suicide the path to a better life?I know it's weird, but I hear this voices telling me I have to jump from this ceiling into some hole in the ground to go where everyone else is already and that it is great there.
I keep trying to hold on to reality and logic but they're so constant that I'm beginning to feel they might be right and I'm just wasting someone else's time.
