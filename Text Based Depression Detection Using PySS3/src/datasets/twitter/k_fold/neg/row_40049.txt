I feel guilty for wanting to end it allMy life is not terrible. I have where to live and what to eat. My loving parents are still with me, both of them. I have caring husband. Some friends. Lovely cat. Recently I got the job I always wanted. Iâ€™ve never been physically abused.
All the bad things (there werenâ€™t many) in my life passed. And I thought at some point this awful feeling of worthiness will pass too.
But itâ€™s still there. Tiring me everyday. Hanging above my head almost every day. 
And every good thing that happens only reminds me of how ungrateful and selfish I am.

I didnâ€™t end my life earlier because I didnâ€™t want to upset my parents.
Now I donâ€™t want to upset my husband.
But the thought that keeps me awake at night is that sooner or later weâ€™ll have kids, and I donâ€™t want them to be scarred by my suicide.

I donâ€™t know why my stupid brain just wonâ€™t let me be and live life in peace, and I hate myself so much for all of this
