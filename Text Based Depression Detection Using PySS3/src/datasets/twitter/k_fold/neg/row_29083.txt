I'm drowning. A friend of mine wants to commit suicide.I've tried to kill my self three times when I was younger, so I've been there. I've also lost someone to suicide and I've never recovered from it, I still have nightmares and I totally screwed my life after the grief. I won't ever be the same.
Now a person that I care so much wants to kill themselves and I feel like I'm drowning. I'm trying to make them know I'm here, but it feels like it's not enough. 
I can't survive the same nightmare all over again. I didn't say this, but what I'd want to scream is "if you die you kill me".
