Suicidal IdeationI have wanted to kill myself for about 4 years. I have made two serious attempts within the past 3 years and survived.. I have since realized that it would put my parents through great distress. So, After 2 years of hospitalizations(both psychiatric and physical injury/illness), I have now decided at almost 20 years old to begin college, work, and continue with my life as a normal person would until both of my parents pass away. At that time, and only then, will I finally execute my plan; suicide. I will be making all the calculations as to what I must do to ensure the success of my plan when my time comes. I know this sounds psychotic.. but I promise I am no threat to anyone but myself, and I wish to be left to die at my own will, in peace.
