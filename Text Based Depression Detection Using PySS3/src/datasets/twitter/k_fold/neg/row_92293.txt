I ruined itI've just dug myself into such a massive hole and i couldn't be any more lower

I pushed away my closest and best friend and i can't fucking cope over what ive done. This dude meant the absolute world to me and we had a **HUGE** misunderstanding, one thing leads to another and hes not answering my texts. i sent him a dozen texts back saying how sorry i was but i get the feeling its only gonna get worse from here.

I fucking hate myself so fucking much, i had the perfect guy who understood me and my problems, loved me to shit and what the fuck do i do? Go and fuck it all up like a complete retard, just like everything else ive fucked up in my life. I just dunno anymore, i feel this is it for me. Nothing's worth it, lifes just not worth it. I'll be back to being a lonely miserable fuck and its all my fault. It's like life itself is screaming at me to end it because im just so fucking stupid.  God dammit, i doubt anybody will even care so tomorrow im gonna throw myself off a bridge into the river and end it. Im clearly not fit enough to be a human being. Can somebody please help me before the thought consumes my mind??????????
