Everyone I'm close to wants to die, tooEveryone I'm truly close to is just as suicidal as me

And its hell. Because if I want to die every second of every day, they do too. And that's terrifying. 

The only thing keeping me here is the fact that I love these people too much to leave them. And I'm sure they have no qualms leaving me to do this alone. The person I care about the most probably doesnt even want to be around me, so he wouldn't care if I would spiral without him. 

I just want to be there for them like they are for me. I want them to stay with me and idk how to do that. 

I can do my best to support them but in the end how far does that get me? I havent been able to be "there" enough to stop attempts in the past so what's different know? Nothing.

I feel so useless. I feel like they dont come to me when they need someone and I just want them to do that, because unlike most people it doesnt bring me down when they do. It makes me happy to know they trust me and they dont want to suffer alone. Some of them have therapists, yeah, but the ones I care about the most (theres 2) dont. And they're the worst off. 

I'm scared every day, especially when they repress their feelings or hold it all in. Because doing that is what brought me to my low point.

I'm just lost, I guess. If I lose any of them I dont know if I'll have the motivation to keep going either.
