I never learnI am not a smart guy I always do the same fucked up shit to myself over and over I know the drugs are dragging me down but I keep doing them on the weekends trying to escape who I have become there is only one person on this earth I care about yet all I want to do is die in a month on my birthday I know it would hurt him hell the two people I confind in say he would be lost without me and I believe it yet despite being considered this selfless person all I can think about is being selfish and ending my pain I have a job I enjoy going to and people who seem to care about me tho I only give a fuck about one person which is really fucked up and yet what I'm considering would scar all of them I intend to make it messy so when they find me they might finally understand how living in my personal hell really feels and not to be obnoxious but I'll end this quoting a meme that fits how I feel -it's going to be one of thos days the voices in my head are arguing my imaginary friend is running with scissors and at one point one of my personality wanders off- joker meme
