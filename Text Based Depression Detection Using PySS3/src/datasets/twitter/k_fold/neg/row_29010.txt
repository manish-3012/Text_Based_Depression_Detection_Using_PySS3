I don't knowI feel like such an incredible disappointment all the time. I have had chances at free schooling and just threw it all away because I couldn't find the motivation to ever get out of the bed in the morning. I keep drinking because it's the only thing that makes me feel like I can relate to anyone. My mother is concerned and I always feel bad for making her worry but it's all I can ever seem to do. I got a DUI and my first ever criminal offence a few weeks ago and ever since I've felt like even worse of a massive disappointment in all aspects of my life. I feel like all the time my best option, it not even the best option for me but for all the people I care about would be to just disappear or die and no longer be a burden. I'm just at such a loss for what I should be or do and I'm so sick of making people worry and be upset. I think I'm done. I don't know if this is real or if I just want to vent or what. Nothing makes sense and i just want it to be over.
