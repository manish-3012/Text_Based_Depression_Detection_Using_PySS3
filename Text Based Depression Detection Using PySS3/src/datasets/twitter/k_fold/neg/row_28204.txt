Canâ€™t take much moreIâ€™ve had a really bad couple of years. This year has been particularly hard. And now so many things are happening in my life. Things got crazy, really fast. And I just canâ€™t adapt to the changes. Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t have the energy or strength to deal with it. I wish there was an easy way out, as actually killing myself scares me. I wish there was a way that I could get it to happen and not even be conscious of it. Like die in my sleep or something. I mean I do drink pretty heavily almost every night. Sometimes Iâ€™ll take ibuprofen with it or acetaminophen. All it does I feel like is ruin my liver. Not gonna die in my sleep from it. And the alcohol really doesnâ€™t even help. It often just makes everything seem even more chaotic and harder to deal with. It also makes me feel like shit physically too. Idk. All I know is Iâ€™m tired of fighting it daily. Iâ€™m tired of trying to adapt to these crazy changes.
