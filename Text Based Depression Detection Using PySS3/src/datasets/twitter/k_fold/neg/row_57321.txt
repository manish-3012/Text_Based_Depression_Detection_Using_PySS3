I cant stand myselfI'm just human trash. I wish i wasn't so boring and quiet or annoying but i am. I'm actually a useless person. Even if i was worth a little bit that would be okay but i just am so worthless. I don't make anymore happy not even my family or close friends. I constantly need validation its crazy. I just hate myself so much. I just don't see the point in living, i have no purpose or goals. I feel like everyone hates me too. I feel alone but i never know how to explain it to people when they ask me whats wrong. I can't take the crying, overthinking, numbness and self hate anymore. I deserve to die.
