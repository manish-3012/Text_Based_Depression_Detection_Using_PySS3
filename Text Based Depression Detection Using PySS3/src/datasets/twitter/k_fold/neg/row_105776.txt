I just want to know that there a good people out thereI have a pretty bad lung disease that is going to end up killing me.. I got a message from this stranger. He went through my posts and saw I was sucidal and chronically ill... I guess I just need help knowing that there are still good people in the world... I got on my throwaway to make this post.. I blocked him on my other one but he made my anxiety so bad. He sent a long message telling me how to kill myself and that I would be doing the right thing ending my suffering. It just broke me and my mind is spinning out of control. I have bpd and my emotions feel more intense than the normal person... Idk this is probably dumb to post.. but I just want someone to tell me this world isn't that cold.
Edit: sorry for my title misspelling.. I'm just shaken up.
