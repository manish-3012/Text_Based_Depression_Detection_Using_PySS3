I feel like im only here for others enjoyment.Im the clown. The person that helps other people stay positive and shows them that they're amazing and beautiful, but it's not reciprocated. I ended therapy because it wasn't helping. I now have severe anxiety towards police because they were in my room at 2 am and drug me to the hospital. No friends want to hang out ever, or at least not with me. The one person i felt special and valuable towards makes me feel like shit now. Im back to spending hours alone in my room when im not working. I pay 33 percent in taxes so I can hardly even enjoy what I earn because of car insurance. The only time anyone texts me is if i text first or if they need something or are in trouble. I cut again. Only once this time. I said it was an accident and that my knife slipped. I don't even have pills to overdose anymore because i used them all to get high. Now that school is out, the two people who cared are no longer able to recognize it, and im too stubborn to ask for help. I just want to die, but i don't want to kill myself. I feel like an attention seeking whore. I fuck random tinder chicks to try and help numb the pain of rejection and despisement by the girl i love. I wish i could get my own place far away and just dissappear.
