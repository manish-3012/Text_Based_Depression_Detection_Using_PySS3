Who's got a gun?I was originally going to join the military to get access to guns and I don't want to go through all that shit now. Who's got a gun I can use right now? I'm playing the wrong game, I'm an animal in a society that thinks their way is the only way. I'm a free thinker in a society filled to the brim with wage slaves.
