life suckseverything in life seems to be kicking me in the teeth (even my own teeth, considering Iâ€™m too broke for braces). my boyfriend killed himself almost two months ago. iâ€™ve been away from him for school in a shitty redneck town, and was supposed to see him in July. even before he died i was having troubles wanting to live, he was my â€œlife jacketâ€. i know i was something similar to him but something mustâ€™ve snapped. i couldnâ€™t stop it. 
anyways, iâ€™m genuinely surprised iâ€™ve made it this far without offing myself. i had plans after the first week or so, once i wasnâ€™t in such a fog where i couldnâ€™t comprehend ANYTHING. iâ€™ve been staring to resent my family for making me feel like suicide would be selfish, and guilt tripping me into not doing it (usually unintentionally, i just know that my pain would be transferred to them, and theyâ€™ve talked about how if i died theyâ€™d be devastated). iâ€™d say the reasons i havenâ€™t so far yet are:
25% fear of failure (i planned on hanging, having brain damage would be worse than death) 
50% not wanting to hurt my family
25% hope
part of me has hope, but itâ€™s always squashed when huge grief waves come. i donâ€™t wanna live without him. i know that thereâ€™s a major possibility of doing it during a huge suicidal episode, which both comforts me and scares me. part of me is also super apathetic as to whether i live or die, because no matter when or how i die, iâ€™m still gonna end up in the exact same place. this makes me think â€œwhy not live out my life then?â€ but also â€œwhy not just end it all now? it doesnâ€™t matter.â€ my brain is fighting for and versus itself at the same time. 
i miss my baby. i miss loving and being loved but i donâ€™t want anybody else. 
on another note, iâ€™m moving back to our city and i feel guilty for leaving my mom. she keeps calling me selfish but i donâ€™t wanna stay in this shitty area. i miss living a life and having a chance, plus iâ€™m graduating soon so i want to go to a good school. but she doesnâ€™t see that being here is hell for me, on top of the shit that happened with my sweetie. ugh. i wish i could just drop dead. pass out and never wake up.  
anyways, yeah, life has been kicking me in the balls. if youâ€™ve made it this far, thanks for reading. just needed to vomit some words.
