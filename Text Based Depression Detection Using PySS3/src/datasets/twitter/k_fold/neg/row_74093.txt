My parents constantly argue...I haven't been suicidal in a while, I consider it on a daily basis usually, but not that I plan to do it yet.

A few months back I went through a really bad phase, I was being given out to constantly, friends kinda seperated from me, girlfriend left me for no reason, and my parents constantly argued and pulled me into it. My only coping mechanism back then was just cutting on choking myself, the thought of death and having peace at last really calmed me. I've attempted twice, but pussied out in the process, but im not sure weather that was a good thing or bad thing, since nothing improved since then.

My parents never really got along well, but what always bothered me was that I just have to hear them, every time, the walls are thin and there are little things I can do to drown the voices out. 

Luckily I developed a healthier coping mechanism, which is exercise, I've picked up running and I've been doing it for a few months back, I really enjoy it, but....im not necessarily afraid of relapsing into the suicidal phase again, as I just see death as an escape to peace, but...I dont want to get into that phase, I know it does me no good, but how can I prevent myself from going there if I have no friends to talk to, noone I trust, while constantly being in a toxic environment...

Its new years now, for me, my parents are currently arguing while im in bed "sleeping" for the past while now, and its just tiring, theres nothing I can do to make them stop, other than to wait it out, and then wait for them to start again the next day (or in a few days) again. During these times the only things I think about is killing myself, theres no better way for me to cope with this (Or self harm, I hope to not get there yet, while im still feeling sane).

Im typing this while it is late here, so apologies if I made any errors in my text. Thanks for hearing me out.
