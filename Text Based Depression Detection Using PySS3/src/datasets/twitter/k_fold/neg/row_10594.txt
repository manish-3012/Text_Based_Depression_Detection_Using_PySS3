Someone help pleaseItâ€™s just so bad thereâ€™s so many things wrong. Going into it all is just selfish and more of the problem. I just want to drive far away and end it. I canâ€™t live in this world with my personality and brain. I see others. I donâ€™t envy their looks. I envy how they do it. Sure  everyone might secretly have issues even if they seem happy. But at least they can seem happy. Atleast they can function in society. Everything I do Iâ€™m too awkward or I fuck it up because I second guess my self. I need help so badly but I canâ€™t find a way. This probably wonâ€™t get any comments but if you do read thanks for sitting through my poorly worded paragraph.
