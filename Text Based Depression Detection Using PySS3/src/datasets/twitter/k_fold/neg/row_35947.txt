I have stopped taking my antidepressants and i need help coping with the side effects. I have been on Paxil and likewise for 12 years. I decided to quit 2 weeks ago (cold turkey) and yes i have the zaps and uncontrollable crying, but I can deal with that. I however cannot deal with my anger. I am so pissed about how I let my family treat me this last decade. I usually never feel anger about anything. The only person i have been mad at in the last 12 years has been myself. I want to scream, punch holes in the walls and send irate emails. I just need someone to tell me that i will not be this uncontrollable forever. I honestly think i have developed no coping mechanism for anger whatsoever.

I would love to hear from someone who has gone through the same thing just to know that it can be done. 

edit-spelling and I have decide to go to a local group therapy, be back in a few hours.
