Stop Giving CondolencesStop giving condolences for accidents/murders/suicides on social media. I know that most of you want the attention and likes that your "condolences" makes you look like a good person. However, it looks gross when you didn't know the person, and neither do you really care about them. 

If you really want to give your condolences perhaps make a donation to the family affected? If the bread winner died those people are going to have financial issues etc. They could also have financial issues from just being unable to go to work while dealing with their loss. Your "condolences" do nothing for them, other than stroke your own ego and attention "who\*\*\*\*".
