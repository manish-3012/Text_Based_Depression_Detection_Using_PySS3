Sept 28thXanax, vodka, and I won't see you tonight pt 1. 

People care. 

But its how I feel. 

I feel worthless. I feel not enough.
I feel burdening. I feel like a failure.

They feel fine. They care. But I dont.  I dont want to live. I dont want to hurt when I wake up in the morning I dont want to feel the pain anymore. I cant handle this anymore...
