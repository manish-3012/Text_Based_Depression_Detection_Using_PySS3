Someone help me with the courage to kill myselfI feel so trapped. I don't want to hurt my family or my friends or girlfriend but I can't do this shit anymore. I'm so tired of this pain. I've got pills and alcohol. Someone please tell me that it's okay to want to die and to not want to suffer anymore. Tell me it's okay that I don't see any future for myself.
