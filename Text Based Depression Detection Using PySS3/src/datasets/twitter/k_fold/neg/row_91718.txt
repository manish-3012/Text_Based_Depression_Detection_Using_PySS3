one of my friends took around 10 advilâ€™s, a shot of dayquil, and a bunch of melatonin and passed out. She is around 5,5 and 120 pounds. she hasnâ€™t eaten much today and she also took 30 mg of prozac and some ritalin this morning (prescribed). will she die?

edit: this was last night, she woke up this morning and is a little shaky but seems fine overall 
if i had known she was doing this last night i wouldâ€™ve called an ambulance iâ€™m not stupid
