Why does no-one care..?I've tried to vent to people about these feelings to friends and family and everyone just seems to brush it off and just cut off communication with me. I feel utterly alone, my family kicked me out after I fought back when my step-father hit me. Now when I moved into my pregnant girlfriends house she muttered this last night "are you looking for another place" I was but it just broke my heart, if it wasn't for that baby id be on a tree somewhere already but Jesus christ this is horrendous.
