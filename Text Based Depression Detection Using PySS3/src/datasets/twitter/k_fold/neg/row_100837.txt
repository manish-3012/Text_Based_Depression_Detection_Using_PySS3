A dumb reason for dyingI'm extremely lonely. Especially in the last 6 months. I've contemplated suicide about 9 times (serious contemplation). I already have my suicide plan ready, and I'm waiting to be pushed over the edge. The reason I want to die is loneliness. I probably don't even have depression without loneliness, just some anxiety. There are almost no girls at my school that I'm interested in, and even worse, absolutely no girls are interested in me. I'm not particularly ugly, but I have no social skills, and social anxiety, which isn't attractive to any female. The only girl I like has recently started talking to another guy because I never took a fucking chance and approached her. I started thinking of ways to meet girls in my area around my age (15), but I gave up because I'm too fucking lazy. I don't want to die, but I'd rather die than live like this. Also, I only have two friends, and neither of them are emotional like me. Every time I try to call out for help to them, they take it as a joke, make fun of me, and call me "emo". My plan has been prepared for spring break, unless things get worse sooner.
