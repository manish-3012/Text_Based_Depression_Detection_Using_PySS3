cancer 'survivor', or lack therof.I had HIPEC surgery early last year, in an attempt to cure my stage4 colorectal. for the entire rest of the year, my life has been hell. Something like 8 months now, i've been in pain pretty much every day, as well as other pretty disgusting symptoms i won't bother going into. It's been feeding into what I already know is a problem with depression, and taken away any feelings of normalcy and happiness I have. Yes, I've tried seeing doctors about my issues. No, so far nothing has improved.

All the things i used to enjoy are completely hollow now, and I stopped caring whether or not I'm actually going to recover from this. I'm mentally zombified from everything at this point, and all I ever expect out of any day I wake up is dealing with the pain, juggling appointments that so far for months have been useless, and trying to do what used to be relaxing, entertaining, or exciting, only to have it turn out to be...well, void of any of that.

I'm even at the point now where I don't give enough of a shit to even make a throwaway account for this, like i've seen many do.

So, in the vein of someone who has lost the will to even try to be human anymore, feel free to ask me anything.
