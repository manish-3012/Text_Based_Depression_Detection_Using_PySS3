I really want to die but im also terrifiedI started being suicidal this year during quarantine and I've always been depressed. I never actually attempted but I've had several close calls. But tonight I just really want to die but yet that stupid part of me wants to live, maybe it's because I never truly got the chance to actually "live". I'm a 15 year old female and I can't stand staying at my house any longer but I also have nowhere else to go. I have no one to talk to and I just desperately want someone to reach out and tell me that it's okay. I want someone to know what I'm going through, just one person. No one in my life know anything about me and I hate the fact that I'm so alone. Even if I tried talking I know it won't help so I don't even bother. I want to live and experience things but I also want to die and give up. But the fact that I've been battling this alone for 6 years give me the strength to keep going on. I have no sense of direction and no solid goals. Sometimes I just want to run away and find someone that I can love and will love me for myself. But I know it will never happen and it will never be that easy. I just can't stand to stay at my house any longer. Everyday I wake up and I try so desperately to be happy, I really do but it's so goddamn hard. I just hope one day I can gather enough guts to actually end it once and for all.

thanks for reading this whoever you are.
