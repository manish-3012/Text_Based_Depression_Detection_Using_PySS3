Iâ€™ve lost the one person I love mostSheâ€™s moved on, she never loved me back but we were close friends and I fucked it up and pushed her away and now sheâ€™s happy and Iâ€™m fucking miserable. I donâ€™t want this feeling anymore, Iâ€™m going to end it. At least when Iâ€™m gone itâ€™ll mean I wonâ€™t be around to stress her out anymore.
