I dont know anymoreHonestly im just,


Honestly feeling suicidal again, I might aswell try to say my feelings on here, since the one person i trust with everything just ghosts me all the time. So much for being there for everyone as you said.

I just have these thoughts about if i do it, how long will it take for people to know I've done it? It's not like people come over and check on me, or say "hey you doing okay" or anyone in my family being of any ability to check lmao.

I don't know how death works or if death actually exists as a being, but I'd want to see how people would react, sad for one day then completely okay the next or will someone be actually caring and mourning.

It's not like i have anyone to catch me at the last moment, or to hold my hand and hold me close and tell me it's okay while i just breakdown or anything, all i have is just pixels on a screen and imaginary feelings i think people have of me lmao

I dont know if people actually care about me or just care for a few minutes then just forget 

I dont know what to fucking do right now everything's so dark and it's just closing in.
