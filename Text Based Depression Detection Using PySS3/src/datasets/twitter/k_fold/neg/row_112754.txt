Sorry, I need to vent some thoughtsI've been considering suicide for a while now, my parents leave me alone most of the time and when I'm alone I don't even bother eating, I've been cutting myself from time to time. I really have no one to talk about this (no friends) only my parents. My father told me some time ago that if I didn't appreciate life and take care of myself he wouldn't waste time on me, so I can't just tell him that I want to kill myself. My only choice is to face this alone, which was easy at first because I'm naturally a coward, and ending my own existence requires some courage. but the idea of suicide is becoming the slightly best option of two horrors. I really feel helpless, I wish I wasn't such a terrible person so that I could have some friends. I wish that I could say "this isn't my fault" but I can't. I have no problems, I am the problem. Simple as that. There's no illness to blame, no bully, no abusive parent, nothing. Just one problem, me, and as far as I can tell there's only one way to solve this problem
