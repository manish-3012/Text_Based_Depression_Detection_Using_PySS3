I don't want to be hurt by people anymore.... I am so lonely, broken and desperate. Contemplating suicide. I don't want to deal with anything else. I just want to die. I had a mental break down today and it got so bad that the only person in the world who actually listened to my problems told me to stop being a pussy. Well Sarah, I want to take your advice, and actually do it this time. I won't be a pussy anymore, right Sarah? Isn't that fucking right? 

Reddit, the thing is, I am scared to do it. I am so absolutely terrified. Save me....
