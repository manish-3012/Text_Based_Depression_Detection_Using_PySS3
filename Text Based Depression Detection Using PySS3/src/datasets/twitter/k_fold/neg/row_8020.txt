I'm just too confusedI'm a sophomore in high school. Every day I see people walking by, talking about what they want to do, after school, on the weekends, after college. I don't know what I want to do. I know deep down I'll never be able to make it in the real world. I'm not capable of loving someone, of raising a family, I don't deserve to be loved. My father keeps a pistol in his dresser to protect his family in case of burglary. I'm tempted to end my own life, just to end all the confusion, the pain of truly being alone forever, all gone in an instant.

I'm reaching out to you, reddit. please help me.
