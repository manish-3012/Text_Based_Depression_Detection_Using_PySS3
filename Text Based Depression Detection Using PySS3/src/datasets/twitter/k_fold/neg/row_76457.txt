Haven't left my house in over a month and I just want it to endThe only time the door to my apartment has even opened this past month is when I have groceries or food delivered.  No one has even noticed.  I've been drowning in how alone I am.  I can't find a point in anything.  I've even stopped watching tv.  I just lay here thinking about dying.  For hours upon hours I envision my death.  I just want to move from thinking about it to doing it but I'm too much of a coward.
