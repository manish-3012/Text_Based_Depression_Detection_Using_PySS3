i see no other optioni'm on academic probation. i'm stuck in 2 dead end jobs. i see no reason to be alive. i don't think i'm meant to live on earth. i hope i die in my sleep. i had a plan and a date set (may 1st) but things got better. now they're getting worse again and whenever i think they're better they just get worse and worse and worse. i'm struggling not to set another date. my birthday is june 27th and i want to do it before then, so my parents won't pretend to care about me on my bday and then after i do it. i hope i die in my sleep.
