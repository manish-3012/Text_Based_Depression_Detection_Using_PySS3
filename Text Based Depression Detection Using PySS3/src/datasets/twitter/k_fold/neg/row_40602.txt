I almost did it.I almost jumped in front of the train today on my way home but I didn't want to scar the operator.
 
Why is it so fucking hard to get a gun where I live? 
I don't want to involve other people in my suicide. I don't want people to witness me jumping off a roof, I don't want people to see me jump in front of a car or truck or train or whatever

I just want to get into my room, and shoot.
