I just donâ€™t want to do this anymoreI donâ€™t hate myself or my life. But itâ€™s gone on long enough and Iâ€™m just ready for it to be over. I donâ€™t have any more desires. So now I just want the suffering to end. Iâ€™m always lonely no matter who Iâ€™m with or where I go. I donâ€™t care about anything anymore. I just want to go away. But I canâ€™t.
