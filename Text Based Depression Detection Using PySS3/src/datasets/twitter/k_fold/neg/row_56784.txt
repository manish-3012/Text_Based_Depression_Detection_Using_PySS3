please read this so that i know at least one person hears me. hears my pain.april fifteenth twenty twenty
ew itâ€™s all terrible
me
you
the world 
weâ€™re all fucking terrible
but if youâ€™re sad just know
i no longer feel so fucking unwanted that i wonder how i even entered this world when so many people donâ€™t want me here
i no longer feel nothing but hate towards myself 
i never have to wonder when itâ€™ll get better
i never have to wake up again feeling nothing but fucking self disgust stress and hate
sadness is such a human emotion
itâ€™s a selfish emotion
i was born may 12th 2003
im 16, 17 in less than a month
i donâ€™t have a favorite place 
i have a favorite feeling though
what a shame that the only substances that make you feel something positive kill you and are frowned upon
the only reason iâ€™m including things about myself is because no one listens or they do they just forget because they have more important things to remember so if you ever feel like youâ€™re forgetting who i am here you go i guess
the most important thing to me is for people to understand that itâ€™s not fucking okay to let someone scream at the top of their fucking lungs for help and for you to block them out because itâ€™s too much for you to handle
would you rather deal with their death or just man the fuck up and listen to how they feel without making them feel like a worthless piece of shit who doesnâ€™t even deserve a minute of your time until they reach rock bottom and you act like â€œwtf im just trying to helpâ€ because no, no the fuck you arenâ€™t 
if you were trying to help you wouldâ€™ve listened to the times where they actually had enough willpower left to come to you.
what came with being honest was being an open book
i stopped being honest when people stopped listening
or whenever i got old enough to realize that they never really were.
im done because
i canâ€™t 
i canâ€™t spend one more second thinking about my future and how i feel obligated to make something of it just because iâ€™m sorta smart 
i canâ€™t have another breakdown and go to tell someone how iâ€™m feeling and see their head fall to their palm as they release a sigh after hearing two sentences of what i have to say 
i canâ€™t feel unwanted anymore
i canâ€™t have the third thought that comes to mind after i wake up be â€œwow iâ€™ve been trying to lose weight since fifth grade and iâ€™ve just gotten fatter and even less confidentâ€
i canâ€™t have another change that wasnâ€™t my choice 
i canâ€™t have another boy show me that i was nothing but a conquest to them
i canâ€™t deal with another person leaving
i canâ€™t.
what i needed
i needed weed
really bad
i needed to feel loved by the ones i loved
i needed to feel more than enough
i needed to be somebodies person; someoneâ€™s #1
thatâ€™s it im done 
i donâ€™t give enough shits to finish this thought.
bye?
