I'm tired of being painted as the villainI'm an 18 year old guy.  I can't do anything right.  I am constantly told by people, by society, by the media, etc., that I am a violent rapist and that I deserve to die.  I know that many people disagree with this, but the fact that this is considered relevant enough to be a popular narrative is sad, scary and depressing.  I'm tired of being the bad guy.  Who will they blame when I'm gone?
