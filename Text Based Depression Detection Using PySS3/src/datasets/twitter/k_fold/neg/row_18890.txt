Please let it be over this timeGoing to try again when I get home.  So far hanging hasn't been successful. I've tried over and over again but today I feel particularly driven to death. I can't live with myself given the things I've done. I sent a fucking love letter to my best friend when I was manic and he blocked me. Haha. I don't want to live in the world without him.  It fucking sucks and I'm responsible for driving him away. We could have been a dream. I didn't know what I was doing. Mania is fucking wild. I'm so embarrassed by all the "poetry" and "songs" that I was writing. I was a certified nutjob. Every day I dread waking up.
