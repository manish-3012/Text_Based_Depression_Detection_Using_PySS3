I planned months ago to kill myself today.I made a note, i had a plan, i was gonna overdose on painkillers since it was the only option I really had. I no longer want to.kill myself as much, but I still do in a way. I'm just thinking about my freind. I was gone, and she didn't have me anymore, she would feel so guilty and ashamed of herself. I couldn't do that to her, even if I wasn't here to care. I do still believe that i will die by suicide someday, i just don't think it'll be today. I'm scared of myself, i don't want to relapse my self harm tonight, I've been coming close every night. I'm clean over 15 days, i don't want to break the streak, but at the same time, i do.
