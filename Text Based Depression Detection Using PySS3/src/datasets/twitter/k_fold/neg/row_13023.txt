I'm killing myself Monday 5-5-20Its currently late Saturday. I've known since Thurdsay that on Monday I'm going to kill myself. I dont know if anyone will ever see this. I'm sorry. It is my hope that after I die I'll have some peace from my struggles. I hope that God hears my prayers for peace or a second chance.


 I'll miss the people I love. I'm sorry to my siblings and the lost years between us. I'm sorry I could never forgive my mother. I'm sorry Jamie for never making the right choices with you. I regret the pain I know will come to you after my death. Maybe we can meet in another time and place and our love would be easier. I leave with the hope that my pain will end. If there is no paradise I seek oblivion.
