I can't wait for the day when I can take my lifei'm tired of living, i'm tired of waking up day after day, with all the burden of the world on my shoulders. I am alive just to take care of my mother and my daughter, but when my mother dies and my daughter is of age I will say goodbye to this world. I will have the strength to hold on here just to ensure that my daughter can take care of herself and my mother is not alone because she already needs care .. I love my mother and my daughter so much, and it's only for them that I'm still here. But not even my love for my family takes away my daily death wishes, when I wake up, when I sleep, when I work, I'm on the auto pilot just waiting for everything to end.
