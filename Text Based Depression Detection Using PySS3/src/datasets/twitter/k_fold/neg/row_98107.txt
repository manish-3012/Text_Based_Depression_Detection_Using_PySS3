and so it goesI'm stuck here in this meat in an utterly meaningless existence with nothing to look forward to. Sleeping doesn't help because all I have is hideous nightmares, getting fucked up helps mildly for a few hours(but then I have to face the consequences of the stupid things I've said and done so it's not really worth it). I've lost the ability to make friends because the only thing I can talk or think about is how much I hate being alive. The only time I feel mildly okay is the two to three minutes of mild bliss I experience upon waking up because I usually forget that reality is going to come at me like a buzzard. Then I shift positions and it starts all over again.

My survival instinct has been a bitch to overcome. I've had a few pretty serious life-ending attempts that landed me in the hospital and I would never, ever want to live through that again(people shoving tubes down my throat, going into a coma where I could still hear everything around me but couldn't move or respond), so I'm scared to try again and not succeed. 

I've done all kinds of therapy, alternative and allopathic, I've been on basically every med and nothing helps. I've lived an insanely full life and done things that other people would probably love to do and I feel ungrateful that none of this has been enough to stop me from wanting to not be here. 

I just really don't want to do this anymore. There is nothing here for me, nothing anywhere for me. I'm not pissed or sad about it, I just wish I could overcome the part of my brain that says "you have to breathe, eat, sleep, and keep going because that's your goddamn job".
