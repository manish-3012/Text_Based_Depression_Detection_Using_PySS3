i feel as though i am out of options.this is my first post on reddit, so sorry if i mess up. 

but, i thought i could at least try to say something here.

my life feels like it has no meaning. things have been bad for me for a long time, but it's just gotten worse and worse over the years. i have high functioning autism, and don't make very good grades in school. school is very hard for me to deal with. i have extreme difficulty speaking, and have no friends whatsoever. i am often bullied because of my social ineptitude. but back in march, i got a girlfriend.. it took lots of courage for me to ask her out, but she said yes. the only thing is, she's alot smarter than me.. she's in alot of honors and AP classes, and she's also in marching band.

i'm very attached to her and i love her alot, but i can't help but feel like i'm a burden to her.. whenever i talk to her, i sometimes get upset and i impulsively ask her if i'm bothering her, if i'm being annoying, ect. and i'm terrified of ruining my relationship.

i feel like we're drifting apart, and there's nothing ii can do to stop it. it's my fault too.

things at home aren't any better. my mom is neglectful, and abusive.

i don't know what to do.
