Now more than everI've always been suicidal, but always also had something stand in the way.

For the past 2.5 years, that's been my boyfriend. I was working on my troubles with a psychiatrist, so it's not like I expected just to rely on him.

But he broke up with me. Because he's in love with someone else. I'm absolutely heartbroken. He was my world. He was everything. Nothing matters now. I really want to kill myself but I don't know how. No firearms in this country. I'm trying to Starve myself but the pain of losing him is too much.
