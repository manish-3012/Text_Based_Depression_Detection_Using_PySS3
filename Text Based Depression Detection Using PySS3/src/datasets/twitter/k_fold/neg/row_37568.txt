I'm not a fan of the human experience.I've attempted suicide a few times before, and have been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist for years. I hung myself in October following a sexual assault. Got really confused about my sexuality for a while. Still confused, still ashamed. I hate knowing people exist who would do that to another person.

I can't eat like a normal person. My weight keeps fluctuating between 90lbs and underweight to 190lbs and obese. Back and forth a dozen times, because i've been struggling with EDNOS for 6-7 years. I'm trying to stop counting calories so i can be normal, but i'm eating too much now and gaining again. 

I just got accepted into college but honestly i don't care... i'm so depressed i don't think i'll graduate high school on time. I can't look into the future to give me optimism because i know i'm going to kill myself as soon as i get the energy to do anything.

The only thing i can think of that i want to do is if i could sit alone in my bathroom and drink wine and do opiates but that's not a lifestyle that is realistic so i guess i'll just kill myself. 

I don't care about anything or anyone. I don't care if i hurt people. I just feel done.
