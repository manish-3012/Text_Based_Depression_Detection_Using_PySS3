My life currently is not worth livingI hate complaining. I know other people have it way worse than me. I wish I could make my mind understand this.

I just feel so miserable all the time. I hate my job. No matter what I do I never feel like I did a good enough job. I feel empty all the time. I donâ€™t make enough to live on my own, to at least justify being stressed all the time. I live with my parents, and I am saving for my own place, but I never seem to have enough money and in my city I cannot relocate, rent is through the roof. I live in a small country and cannot just leave town and start over. I wish I fucking could.

I feel like a failure. I am way behind in my job.  I have so many things I have still left to do. I never seem to catch up. Iâ€™m tired all the time. 

To make matters worse, I have an amazing boyfriend and he is getting tired of my shit. I am always in a bad mood, stressed, sad. He is getting tired and I cannot blame him. I want us to move into a place together and he keeps saying we donâ€™t make enough. We donâ€™t fucking make enough. I just want to live like an adult. Escape this toxic environment. Quit my job. And just start over. But I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t escape this. 

The problem is me. I make everything suck.
