Could someone email my mom and explain that I need to do this? At 35, this mental and physical pain is 24/7 and I'm on a dozen medicationsAlso cannabis oil is the only thing that works but it's illegal.

She needs to understand dying is the only way.  Even if I wasn't in constant pain, I still think the World is a horrible place.  I have no friends or purpose.  I'm only suffering.  I don't know how to get her used to accepting this.  I'm not going to go 35 more years getting slowly worse each year to where someone has to wipe myself for me.
