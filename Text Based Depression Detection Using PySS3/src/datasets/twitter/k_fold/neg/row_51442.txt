My husband tried to kill himself tonight. I'm scared and confused. Please help me help him. What hurts the most is his entire family blames me, including himself. Saying I was a trigger. We got into an argument, that happens. It was over something small, insignificant. His depression is what really turned him to drive home and down an entire bottle of aspirin. I'm just glad he's ok, and worried about the future. What do I do?
