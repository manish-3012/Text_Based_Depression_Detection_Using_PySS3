F*ck my lifeso, life's been rough, finally told my psychiatrist about how bad things have gotten, about cutting myself, and about how I was planning to kill myself. and this was two weeks ago, that i totally opened up. I promised her I wouldn't kill myself because I always wanted it to be an "accident" so I didn't put it on my family but, now, tonight I'm just done. I had a great trip planned this weekend with my best friend, I was gonna go visit a college about two hours from where I live and spend the night there, it's been planned for about a week and a half and it's all I've been looking forward to and it just got cancelled... and at this point honestly I think I'll go down on my own, stay Friday to Saturday, and just have a really solid last weekend and kill myself Saturday night.... I was gonna go down Friday afternoon ride mountain bikes, talk to there team to see if I could cycle collegiality for them and then meet a few friends on campus. Then spend the night in a hotel with my best friend and take a tour of the college on Saturday morning, meet up with my club team for someones birthday in the afternoon and just have a bunch of fun, but that's all gone so idk. Its all I had and its gone... I've been trying so long and I'm so tired, I've tried half heartily twice before but I think Saturday will be the day.
