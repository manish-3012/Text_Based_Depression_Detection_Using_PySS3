Iâ€™m 14 and I think I wanna die....idk how to start this. 
I guess itâ€™s not as important as everyone elseâ€™s stuff but I need to get it off my chest. 
 
Hi. My name is Rashaun. Iâ€™m 14 and I think I want to die.

I donâ€™t feel like I should be here. Growing up all of my siblings had always told me that I was a mistake. That they didnâ€™t love me, or that they didnâ€™t want me around. I always thought it was normal.... but then I met him. My best friend.... At least I thought he was. 

His family was different. I realised this when his mum didnâ€™t hit him like mine hit me. Or how he had a good relationship with his siblings. They were nice. And so I stayed. I was at their house almost every day. Iâ€™d beg to sleep overnight. Iâ€™d beg to just stay with them. This went on from the age of 7- 12... everything was good...But then I realised that I liked him.

 I liked him more than I should have and I knew that heâ€™d think I was weird. Heâ€™d think I was a freak. But I told him anyway. I know Iâ€™m stupid but I really should have seen it coming that time. 

I wish I hadnâ€™t told him. Maybe weâ€™d still be friends. Maybe Iâ€™d have become â€˜part of the familyâ€™ but no. I had to open my mouth and tell him in my stupid little voice that I was gay. Stupid me...why...no how could he ever love me?  Iâ€™m just a weird kid with no future.

Out of all of my siblings the one I envy the most is my older brother. He isnâ€™t the oldest though. Iâ€™m one of nine kids. Heâ€™s number 4 and Iâ€™m number 5. Only 2 years apart in age. 

He is like me. We look the same, sound the same and even dress the same..... but everyone treats him like a saint. Meanwhile Iâ€™m shoved into a corner. A mere shadow of by brother, who is always reminding me who I could never be.

I started cutting at a young age.  I was 13 when he had finally noticed. And you know what he said... â€˜do me a favour and cut deeper. â€˜ ......yeh. Ok... I never did cut deeper. Iâ€™m such a scaredy-cat. 

Iâ€™d I could do it then I would. Die I mean. I read in a book once that  â€˜people think the word scuicidal means that somebody wants to kill them selfâ€™s and they arenâ€™t afraid to do it.  But itâ€™s actually the opposite. They donâ€™t want to die and they are scared...but they feel like thereâ€™s no other optionâ€˜.

Iâ€™ve thougt about it. Every now and then I get a random thought about jumping in front of a car on the way home from school. Of how when Iâ€™m in the bath I should drown myself. Or how I should hang myself with the rope I found in the woods and took home just in case. 

But Iâ€™m scared. And I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s stopping me. Thatâ€™s all. Even if you donâ€™t reply. Thanks for reading I guess 

Yours sincerely 
Rashaun
