Holding OnHey Reddit,

I'm writing this from her phone/account, as we sit together in the Emergency Department, as my phone is dead; We were directed her by suicide hotlines and have been asked to wait in some dim, silent, sterile back room and wait for assessment. *Just ticked past midnight and 2 hours wait time.*

She's previously pushed me to sending the police to her place, when I've been out of state and she has started dropping dark bombs.

Now months later she has finally cracked and said she thinks this is her last week. That the only reason she is still here is because I'm holding on so tight.

I care about this girl and I'm not ready... the world's not ready to see her go.

Please write to her with kind and pure sentiments. I need reddit in a way a paid shrink can't deliver.
