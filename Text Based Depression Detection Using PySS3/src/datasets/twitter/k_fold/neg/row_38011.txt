it just makes sensei donâ€™t have anyone, i have no goals, i have no motivation to do anything, i have no talents or skills, i have no social skills whatsoever, i have nothing that makes me happy, i have no self esteem, and the list just goes on and on. i feel bad for the people who donâ€™t know me and try to help. it feels like nothing is working. i donâ€™t want to die, it sounds scary. i also donâ€™t want to live this horrible life and it just makes sense. i really have nothing and itâ€™s hard to see why this isnâ€™t the answer
