OverdoseRecently I just started taking a bunch of painkillers (9-10 tablets at once) everyday
But it seems to have no effect on me.
Doesnâ€™t make me sick
Or doesnâ€™t give me any sort of headache either.
I was clean for 4 years didnâ€™t have any scratch.
Now I started cutting myself again but just blood doesnâ€™t seem to help.
I donâ€™t know if this is even the right place to say this.
So I started hurting myself every possible way.
Taking overdose, canâ€™t get drugs cuz itâ€™s nearly impossible for me to get any cuz of corona virus.
Any idea why it seems to have no effect on me ?
