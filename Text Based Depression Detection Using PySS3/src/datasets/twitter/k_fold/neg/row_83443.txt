Fed up.I never thought I'd be posting on here. I've been contemplating on it for over a month now. I subscribed to reach out and help people. I've been off my medication for roughly a month (I've called in refills but they love to drag their feet) and I've informed the pharmacy I ran out weeks ago. I've been sober for 5, almost 6 months and I'm fucking miserable. I can't go a single day without the involuntary thoughts of using miscellaneous objects to take my own life. The moment I get a glimpse of a gun I think of how easy it would be. Sometimes, it's also been occurring more often recently, I have the desire to act on the compulsion. I'm running out quickly on the will to live and I have nobody I can talk to that I fully trust here. It's just becoming so difficult to even put forth the effort to breathe

My mind feels so scattered and I feel like I'm rotting on the inside
The only reason I'm posting this is because I know healthy me would want me to do so
