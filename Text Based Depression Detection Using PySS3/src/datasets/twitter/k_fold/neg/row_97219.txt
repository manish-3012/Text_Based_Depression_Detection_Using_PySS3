What's the point? (15M)This is my first time posting on Reddit and this is a throwaway account, so I apologise for any errors made and this will be a long post.

When I was younger, I always remembered my parents arguing. Whilst not abusive, my Dad grew up in a complicated family with a lot of siblings whose parents didn't pay much attention to him and his Dad wasn't the nicest, this led to him becoming enstranged and didn't see him until he died. Because of my Dad's line of work, he cannot seek therapy for this and my parents have been divorced as of Janurary. Everytime I try to talk to him about my problems he doesn't know how to deal with them. This has led me to have an unhappy upbringing and has also impacted my sister. 

As of the last few years, I have come to think of my life as meaningless and I have developed suicidal thoughts. I currently see an organisation but I was put into a group that didn't help me and counselling sessions always get switched or ended before they actually help. I have been patient but the pnly way out appears to be, A) Medication, or B) Suicide. Even after my death I doubt that I would be seen as anything more than a statistic ignored by them and not a wake up call to improve their service. 

At school people do seem to care about me a lot and a good amount seem to know my name. But I often question if anyone would actually miss me or if I would be forgotten. I only feel like people actually care enough to talk to me when I'm in one of my episodes because they enjoy having me around and feel like people only keep me around for their benefit because if these organisations did care they would give me medicine or they would just let me go. Along with a complicated situation with someone else and I just have no clue why I'm here or what to do. 

I don't know if anyone will really reply to this post or not but I don't know what else there is.
