I'm supposed to be helping people, but I'm brokenHi, hope you are all looking after yourself during this strange time. I haven't been, I've been looking after others instead.

I'm at breaking point and I'm not sure what to do. I'm too embarrassed to call any helpline or to talk to the people that I know. I have friends and a boyfriend but I've never felt so alone.

I've been a nurse for 3 months and 15 days now. University (UK) was hard. I'm a caring person but not very academic. My dyslexia makes my life difficult but I managed to pass and can now call myself a registered nurse. I thought I was doing okay and then covid 19 hit the world. 

I decided to specialise in palliative care for cancer patients so I was prepared for death. Since covid 19 was first diagnosed in my hospital it's been challenging to say the least. I no longer have a permanent ward. I've been moved for ward to ward, looking after people under every speciality. I've told relatives that their loved ones have tested positive, I've put positive patients into body bags, cared for pregnant ladies, alcoholic and those that have taken overdoses. I've given medication that I didn't truly understand, I just knew that I had to give to avoid death. All whilst living in a hotel to protect my household.

I've now reached my breaking point. I've asked for a few days off while I try and become stable but I'm struggling. I don't know if I'm able to care for others the way they deserve, the way I want to care for them. I don't know if I'm good enough. I don't know if I can handle the pressure anymore.

I know that every single person is finding lockdown hard. From those out of work, keyworkers, healthcare workers, everyone!

Why am I writing this? Part of me thinks it might help me, or anyone?


Keep safe, keep sane. Find something that you love and push for it. I've found that thing but it's killing me. I don't know if I would want to live if I can't be a nurse.
