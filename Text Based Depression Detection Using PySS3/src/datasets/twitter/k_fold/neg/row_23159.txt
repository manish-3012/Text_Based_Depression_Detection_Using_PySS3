Is quarantine the perfect opportunity?I know for a fact that I will not live past the age of 25 TOPS. However, I am very tempted to end my life early during this pandemic. I would slowly cut off contact with close friends and distance myself from my family to lessen impact. Not sure who I want to find me though, and Iâ€™m not sure how I want to do it yet. Every day is a painful struggle and please donâ€™t tell me it â€œgets better,â€ because I was blessed with my fathers crippling depression and my motherâ€™s extreme anxiety. Both of them are still fucking train wrecks. Meds donâ€™t work. Therapy doesnâ€™t work. This never ends. I just want to know if anyone else is thinking about it while weâ€™re stuck in quarantine.
