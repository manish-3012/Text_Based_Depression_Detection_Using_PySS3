Was close to suicide on Tuesday night.I ended up communicating what was going on to some family and my fiance took me to our local ER. After 7 hours there, the psych folks discharged me because they didn't have any beds. My therapist, who urged me to go to the ER in the first place, was incredibly concerned because she felt I needed to be admitted.

So I've been home from work (monitored) since then. Tried to see my GP yesterday and her assistant recommended admission as well. I talked with my therapist and she advised that admission seemed a little late at this point but if I started having any suicidal thoughts again, I was to immediately go to the ER.

So now I'm sitting here, thinking about everything that's happened and going back to work on Monday. My anxiety level has gone through the roof within a matter of minutes and I'm terrified of sitting alone at my desk all day, nothing to do, with my mind just wandering.

I'm terrified of telling anyone about this because I don't want to be admitted to a psych center. That's my biggest phobia.

Advice please? I work somewhere that is highly concerned with internet security so browsing the web, taking a book, playing on my phone, etc. is not allowed.
