What are the consequences of stabbing yourself?I really don't want to do this I have the best life you could ever want and I really mean that. But mental illness or whatever this thing is killing me, and I may soon just soon get in a rage at myself and stab myself multiple time's to prevent myself, which IDK if it will help, cause I feel like I'm nearing the end. For the last few nights, I've been losing myself further and sleeping with a knife. Why anyone would want to die in my situation is beyond me, I mean I know why but to everyone else it simply seems ridiculous to which I agree with. But mental illness, or whatever it is, it's not logical.

Also if I die, I'm really sorry to all of the people I hurt everyone online and IRL. I didn't mean it, it was most likely just getting caught up in a situation I wasn't supposed to be in and or I let my insecurity get the best of me and so sorry I was too defensive at times or put someone down unnecessarily. I'm really sorry. were all really dumb and we can all be insecure, but I'm sorry anyway.
