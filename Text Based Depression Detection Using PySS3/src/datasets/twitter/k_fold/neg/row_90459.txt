Edgar Allan Poe is all I feel I relate to right now. It's helping me to cope. Advice?It's not taking away the pain inside me, but it's helping me to know that it's not all that uncommon. It puts me in a better mood. Any similar poets to Poe that I should check out?

You've all been very decent in helping me when I am struggling. Thank you.
