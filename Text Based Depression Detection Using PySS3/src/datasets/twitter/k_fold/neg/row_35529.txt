I will never be anyoneI used to have dreams about living a successful life; working a successful, high paying job, marrying someone and starting a family. Sadly, this won't ever be true, i'm dumb, ugly and failing in school. I live in a small town and i'm the laughing stalk of it, so i rarely ever leave the house unless im forced too. But im stuck here none the less, destined to work a menial, dead end, 9 to 5 job until i decide to finally rope
