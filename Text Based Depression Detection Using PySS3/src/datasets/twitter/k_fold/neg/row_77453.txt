Mans search for meaning.This book is about the very much real man, Dr. Victor Frankl. He is a man who lost everything in the holocaust, including his lifes work in psychology at the time. In his book Mans Search for Meaning he describes a philosophy of understanding suffering even without pay off. He had no hope of ever getting out of the consintration camps. But he was still able to find meaning in even the most dreadful situation with no external reason to live. This book saved family members of mine and have turned there lives around. Alot of the nisiltic questions have answers as suprising as that sounds. Please just give it a try.
