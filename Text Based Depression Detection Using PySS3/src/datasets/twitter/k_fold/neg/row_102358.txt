x-post from r/depression - thinking of reporting childhood sexual abuseBasically when I was 8 my older brother molested me a few times a week for a few months. Also throughout my childhood he used to beat the shit out of me and make death threats. When he moved out, he changed. Now we're "good friends" and I forgive him.
But growing up my mom was also physically/emotionally abusive and I got the brunt of it, being the scapegoat of the family. I just feel like he and my mom got away with forever shattering my self-esteem and treating me less than human for years. I feel betrayed, hurt, worthless, sick, disgusted with myself. I have intrusive thoughts about this shit on a near daily basis and I'm 19 now.
On one hand, I feel like a terrible person for even thinking about reporting my brother since he's changed. But on the other hand part of me cannot be sure that he has not done this to other people because if someone is capable of doing this to their own little sister, who else could they have done this to? Plus a very selfish part of me wants someone to take personal responsibility, because all my fucking life people that were supposed to love me unconditionally and protect me, that I was supposed to be able to trust, have hurt me in ways that make me feel sick to my stomach. I just feel so broken, I just want to move on. Like, people in my family KNOW that the abuse happened but did nothing to stop it and were never there for me. My dad was angry at me and MOCKED me when i told him i didn't feel comfortable having my brother over to our house when the whole sexual abuse thing came up. He told me that I need to move on. I WANT to move on but it's. always. there. It won't go away, I have anxiety attacks when people physically get too close to me and I cry when I try to have sex. Seemingly mundane things that remind me of certain situations with my mom or my brother make me feel...weird. Like I space out and kind of get lost in my head and think about specific memories and feel a million miles away while also being hyperaware of my surroundings. I won't feel real. I feel numb and disconnected. I have nightmares sometimes.
I feel like it's bullshit that I have to deal with this yet they get to sleep comfortably at night. I want them to deal with what they've done. Yet I feel like a vindictive piece of shit for feeling this way and that it's hard because I've rationalized their behavior so much and feel empathy for them and do forgive them, but I have all this rage and anguish and no way to release it and it's just bottling up and I'm going to explode, there's no one left to hate but myself.
