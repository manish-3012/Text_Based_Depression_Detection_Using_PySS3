I can't do it anymore.Nothing has even happened. I don't have a reason to feel out of control. But I do and I can't fix it. I'm so sick of these med changes and useless therapy sessions. I'm done. Life isn't for me. I don't necessarily have a plan to necessarily end things tonight but I know I will soon. I can't live out of guilt forever. I've done everything I can to reach out. Not even the mental health evaluators here care. No medical professionals here care until you're dead.
