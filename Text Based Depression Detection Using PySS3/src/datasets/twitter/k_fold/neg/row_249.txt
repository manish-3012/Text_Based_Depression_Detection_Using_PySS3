Literally everythingWhy does everything trigger suicidal thoughts.  Every little thing. It also doesnt help that everyones main go to joke is that they want to kill themselves. Like just now for instance, my friend stating that they would like to kill themselves as we have math for 3 hours today. Everything is such bullshit.  

They need to make killing yourself easier. It takes too long to hang yourself and I pussy it too quickly. Fucking bullshit.
