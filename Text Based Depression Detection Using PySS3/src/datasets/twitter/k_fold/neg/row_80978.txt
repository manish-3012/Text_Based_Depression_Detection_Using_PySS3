Wake up every day hoping this has been a dreanI do this every day. I am sick. I think terminally sick but I can't get a diagnosis. My family thinks it's psychological because the labs come back normal. But I know there is something seriously wrong. My urine is always dark and cloudy, my kidneys occasionally hurt, back hurts, liver area hurts, skin is soooo dry, no energy, have so many neurological symptoms, muscles gone and so forth. 

The last time I went to the doctor was a month ago, because every time I go it's the same shit. Labs normal. No bacteria. Normal sized kidneys. Normal blood flow. Normal ECG. Normal metabolic and CBC panels. Normal CT scan.

Really, the only thing that is a little off is my vitamin D and blood sugar a bit high.

So I'm left here dying and no one can help me.  My dad is friendly and tries to stay optimistic. Mom doesn't say anything. Brother plays SC2 with me which I like. The wife and I go through arguing, crying and business as usual spells.

I just don't think there is any hope for me whatsoever. When I wake up, I hope this has all been some nightmare but  it's not. I'm probably making some world record for living with no renal function, but unfortunately no lab would back that up.

I've grown up loving science and all that jazz. Now, I see pathetic it can really be. Sometimes you have to have FAITH in an individual and diagnosed simply DIFFERENTIALLY. Labs work for 99% of people, but sometimes they are deceiving. It's like that one Forensic Files where EVERY organ is shutting down on a guy but all labs are normal.  Guess what? That poor guy had arsenic poisoning and it was found too late. But another example of labs not always being accurate,  despite EVERY organ dying.

So I have 2 choices. Suffer miserably every day until I do in fact end up in the ICU or kill myself. Which should I choose?
