I have 1 month as of todayDecided as of today I am going to give myself one month to live, and either God can kill me in that time or I will do it myself. I don't know what portion of my thoughts are coherent and I know I need help but history has repeated it so many times, I'm convinced that I have no purpose in the world except to cause harm to those around me, but I'm selfish so I try to create friendships, etc whenever I can and then fuck them up. Pretty sure some kind of divine intervention has it in for me at the moment (which I completely deserve), so if the universe doesn't get rid of me by the 8th of March I'm doing it myself.

I don't want anybody around me to know but I still want to talk about it somewhere, but I feel as though I'm not doing it for anybody's sympathy. Or maybe I am, cause as has been established I am a naturally selfish and evil person who manipulates people into feeling bad for me. But everyone talks about this stuff on here so I just want to get it out. 

Perhaps instead the universe will give me some sort of sign I should keep living but I doubt it. If I am going to be the toxic person in so many people's lives I don't deserve to be here anymore.
