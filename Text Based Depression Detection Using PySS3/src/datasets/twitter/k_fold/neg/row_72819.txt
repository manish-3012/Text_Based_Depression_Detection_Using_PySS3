Love doesn't exist in any way, shape, or form.Friend just disconnected on me while I was feeling worse than ever. Well, an online friend. This always happens. Nobody on this planet actually wants to deal with me. Everyone hates or is indifferent to me. I always give in more than I get. Nobody cares about my interests, my feelings, anything. I'm so tired of all this.
