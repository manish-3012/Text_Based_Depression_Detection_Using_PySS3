My first time posting.... Just really struggling a lot lately and I don't know what to doSuicidal and selfharm thoughts just keep popping up in my head and I don't know why my mood seems to be dropping significantly recently. It's getting harder and harder to cope and I feel so hopeless about my situation. It's just so tired to get on with living.
