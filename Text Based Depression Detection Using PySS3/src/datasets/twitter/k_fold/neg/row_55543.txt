I'm guving upI'm so lonely. I'm so tired. Everywhere I go I feel a disconnect. I feel space. Nobody cares, not enough to even speak to me. Friends I thought would be there for me don't even send a single text. I'm completely alone. I have nobody and nobody would miss me. So I have been thinking, almost every day, multiple times a day, that I should just do it. I find myself googling ways, begging to be hit by a car walking down the road. I want to die. I don't want this life anymore. I'm so tired now. I've prayed to god to let me go. To let me just fucking die. I want to fall asleep and never wake. I'm nearing my limit.
