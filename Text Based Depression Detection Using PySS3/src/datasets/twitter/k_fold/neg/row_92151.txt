Iâ€™m so tried of feeling like thisIâ€™m 18. and in my second year of college (UK). Iâ€™ve gone from severe self hatred at age 8 to attempting suicide numerous times from 11-16, as well as self harming from 14. I was diagnosed with a school phobia, home schooled and then got into college after some appealing.

I should be better now.

I understand the consequences that my suicide would have on those around me. My mum, my two younger sisters, my guinea pigs and my bird, my aunts and uncles, my classmates and teachers. Even if not that many people, if any, are interested in being friends with me, my death would still have an impact on them, however small. My mum and family would be devastated. No one else would be able to care for my pets the way I do, especially my bird who is a very high maintainable pet with enough intelligence to realise that Iâ€™m gone, even if itâ€™s just heading out for the day, and would definitely miss me.

I know all of this and yet I still desperately want to die. Iâ€™m *so* so tired of life, and I donâ€™t have the energy to carry on functionally as Iâ€™m supposed to. Passing my exams, getting a job, etc all seem like such impossible feats that the thought of them alone is enough to drain me.

My self harm relapses are getting worse, to the point where they are getting scary. Iâ€™m starting to loose my composure in public again, something which Iâ€™d thought I grew out of when I first left school.

Everything just continues to spiral out of control. What I thought was getting out of the woods was just a small clearing in the centre of a vast, dense forest. Thereâ€™s no light in sight and Iâ€™m just so tired.

Iâ€™ve been through so many councillors and therapists that only made my life worse. There were so many of them that I canâ€™t even remember all of their names or faces, just specific incidents with each one that stand out. "Professional help" has only ever made me worse but what else is there for me?

Iâ€™m sitting here now and Iâ€™m just ready for it all to end. Iâ€™m exhausted and somehow have to find the energy to live for everyone elseâ€™s sake.

This is a pointless rant.
