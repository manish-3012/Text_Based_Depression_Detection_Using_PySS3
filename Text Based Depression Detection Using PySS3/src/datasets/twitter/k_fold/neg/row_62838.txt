"Depressive Faggot"A term a Friend uses on me when I can't keep the positivity up. Honestly makes me pissed at all those who seem to be so happy with their fulfilled lives. Should I just fake being happy for them to stay in their illusion of a good world hah? I find it ironnical how their happiness is almost definitely caused by and the cause of others suffering. I really don't want to fight to be like them :(
