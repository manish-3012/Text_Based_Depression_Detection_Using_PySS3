(I hate myself too) I just dont see myself getting anywhere I had many plans for the future finish college get a job in cybersecurity find a girl get married and have a family. I dont see that happening i feel its too late for me in many aspects by the time I
finish college ill be 32 and alas too late to
even think about getting married jobwise people would want the younger generation to take over so my options there are pretty much null. Im a pretty lonely person and just want to end it all. I am tired of it all i just wanna sleep and die if i could. Been thinking of many ways for suicide overdose on luvox and cymbalta which are the two supposed pills that arent helping me, put a bullet in my head with my grampa s 6 shooter and just also thought about hanging. its still in the works on how im gonna do it. Just felt like telling you all here since none of my family members care and they just tell me to take my pills and be quiet. Either way just 
my thoughts. I am not trolling btw im writing this on my phone too so pleass excuse the grammar and spelling issues.
