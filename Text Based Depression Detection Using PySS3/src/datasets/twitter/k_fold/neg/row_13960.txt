I feel like my life is slowly spiraling out of control.I was laid off by my long term job a week ago. I barely have enough money to afford rent for the next two months. And that's not including living expenses. I've been searching for 4 months to try to find another job, and nothing is turning up. 

I live with two of my best friends, and they're constantly angry at me over one thing or another. And when I do try to please them, it's never up to their standards. 

I'm trying everything in the world to keep my new boyfriend happy. And while he says that he is, I can tell he isn't.

I used to cut, I haven't in 4 years. Every day lately the urge keeps getting stronger and stronger. With an emotionally abusive past, where I was told repeatedly by my mother and her boyfriends that I'm never good enough, and will never amount to anything. Well it just seems even more truthful than before. 

Usually I'm able to hold my head high, and tell myself that life will get better, but right now it seems like each step i take is just into quicksand, and I'm just falling deeper and deeper into lifes trap.
