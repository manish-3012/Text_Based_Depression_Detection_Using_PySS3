Someone I don't know on twitter said shes thinking about killing herself and no one will miss her. How can I help without seeming creepy?Im an adult male and she is a teen girl ive never met, but this showed up on my feed.

"Like. I'm planning on offing myself. I realized no one will miss me. So. That's a thing"

Can anyone help me help her?
