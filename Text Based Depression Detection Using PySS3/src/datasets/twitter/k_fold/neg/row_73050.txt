Thinking of suicide so much todayI've had enough. 5 years of struggling with depression and nothing seems to get better. I'm a joke. I'm a disappointment on my family and my friends don't even invite me out. I guess I'm just a horrible person who doesn't deserve to live. The world would be better off without me, I don't have any importance here. I can't wait to end all of the pain.
