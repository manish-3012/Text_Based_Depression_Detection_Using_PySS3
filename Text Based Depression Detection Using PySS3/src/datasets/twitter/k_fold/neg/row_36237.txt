Really need some advice without judgement. Took an overdose 24 hours ago now scaredThe feeling of wanting to die has passed and now Iâ€™m just scared. I took around about 20-25 100mg sertraline tablets, vomited 2 hours later. All yesterday I was shaking, hot, sweating and nauseous. I managed to eat. Today Iâ€™ve woken up still nauseous with pain down my sides and back, a very high temperature and sweating and I just feel out of it. What do I do? Thereâ€™s no point going to hospital, Iâ€™ve metabolised it now.
