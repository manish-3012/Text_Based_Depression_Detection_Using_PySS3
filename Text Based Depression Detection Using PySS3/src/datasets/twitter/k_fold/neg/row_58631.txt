My brother, clonazepam and I just want to kill myselfThis Saturday, my father, who may have cancer, took seventy drops of clonazepam (or, at least, claimed to have) and called someone and this someone called my brother. My brother hating my mother, called the police and reported my mother for kidnapping and mistreatment. Well, he also texted me saying that now we would learn what suffering was. I think we all know what suffering is. The police came. They were gone. I wanted to throw myself out of the window; I still want to, actually. The police returned with my brother. My brother and mother had a fight. I told the police that my father was here willingly. My brother texted me saying "Forget me, u /souththroaway" and blocked me. I had trusted him. I had told him about my suicidal thoughts.

Now I feel even more suicidal. I want to kill myself. I see no reason in life. People tell me I have a bright future; bright future where? I read War and Peace, I can comment on the Mexican PRI, and I have a dozen traumas. This does not ammount to a bright future anywhere. I feel more lonely than ever. I am not loved and probably never will be loved. Those I trusted (like my brother or some girl from Punjab) ended up leaving me and hurting me. I'm on treatment - I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder - but nothing seems to improve. I just want to die. Death is a good escape from a father who might be a pedo, from a life without love and affection, and from a speech problem. I'm afraid my brother will come back with the police and that day will happen again.
