I feel like I'm going crazyI feel like there is something inside me that is trying to get me to kill myself. When I think about it it started off with it starting to make me super anxious and depressed about everything always in a negative mood thinking in a negative way with no confidence and I  was often on the edge fighting for my life. Now it's turned all around and tried a different approach. It has been getting better making me feel so good and more confident and start to truly believe in things and now I have convinced myself in killing myself and I'm not sad about it not angry at anyone  I feel fully accepting of this and it seems like the right decision.
