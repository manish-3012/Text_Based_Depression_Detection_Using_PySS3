Opening up to people is a fucking waste of time and energy.No one fucking listens. All people give you is a stupid catch phrase. I literally listed all the fucking reasons why I hate myself and all i got was "just love yourself". Wow, thanks. That really helps me solve my issue. Maybe give me actual advice? Not a shitty catch phrase that makes me not want to talk to you. 

And no one listens or understands. I say "oh I hate x about myself because of x and y" and so on, and all people do is try to rebuttal everything to make me feel better. I understand you're trying to make me feel better about it, but it's not working. I just want someone to be there and understand where I'm coming from and not invalidate everything. No one fucking gets it. Some specific things about me is an absolute waste of time because it doesn't get through no ones head. 

I can't talk to anyone about anything anymore. It's a waste of time. I want to either kill myself literally or fake my death and move to the middle of no where with no internet connection and not one person. I'm sick of everything. 

I'm never opening up to anyone again. I wish I knew this earlier. 

I want to hang myself. Get drunk, smoke weed, go to the middle of nowhere and hang myself. I literally have no one and will never have anyone. I'm going to keep my feelings bottled up inside for the rest of my life and you know what? I'm not going to regret it because its only going to lead up to good.
