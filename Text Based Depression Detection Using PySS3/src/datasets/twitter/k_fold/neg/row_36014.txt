really, fellow humans?so, the past few days have been hell. Counting my pills and doing the math to see if I have enough to go with the liquor on hand. Got a PM from someone, and thought to myself, "someone actually gives a shit what happens to me!" Turns out, their mom died, dad left, grandma died, dog is dying, living on the streets with a disease I've never heard of...SEND MONEY!!! Fucking kick me when I'm down...and this is why I'm having some difficulty caring about hanging around. Bastards.
