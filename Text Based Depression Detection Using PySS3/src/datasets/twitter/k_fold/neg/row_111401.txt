hate the holidaysbit of a rough spot. holidays are bad. Person I love is away with their family.   
My family is why the holidays are hard.   
Home, Ma, Mother, 'A Mother's Love', Brother, Family, Christmas, Easter, Holidays.   
all these things. are triggers.    
I am going to be OK.   
I am going to order some pizza, and watch Dr. Who. and I am going to be OK.   
right?  
right. Gonna be fine. just. don't do...   
No Permanent solutions to Temporary Problems. This too shall pass.  
I don't feel I can talk to my friends, so I am talking to strangers.  
Gonna be fine. Just order some food and watch TV; for a few more days, until my love gets back, and then things will be better. 
   
What sort of pizza, and what Dr. who episodes - should i watch?
