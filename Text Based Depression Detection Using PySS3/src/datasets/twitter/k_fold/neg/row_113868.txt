NoteI am fucking done. Everything I do I manage to fuck up, no matter how easy it happens to be.i canâ€™t do shit. So Iâ€™m leaving, I canâ€™t stand this shit anymore. I try and try to live normally but I just canâ€™t. Then the clock hits 1:00 Iâ€™m slitting my wrists and taking every fucking drug I can find. I donâ€™t care how painful it is anymore. I just want to end up dead no matter what.
