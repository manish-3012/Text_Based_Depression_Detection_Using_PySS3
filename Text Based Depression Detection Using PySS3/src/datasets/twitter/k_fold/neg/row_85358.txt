Killing myself is not an option anymore and that hurtsBack in college I realized I had involved myself in too many things (colleagues, internships, etc) and everyone around me thought I was over my depression that suicide wasn't an option and that stung really bad. I came close to suicide a few times as a teenager but obviously am still around and just the thought that I didn't have that option anymore hurt.

Nowadays, these thoughts are coming back. I can't kill myself. I feel like I should be happy that I have a family and friends who I know would miss me, people who have told me they love me. But this just feels like a weight holding me alive when I don't want to anymore. It hurts. I don't want to live but I can't disappoint these people.
