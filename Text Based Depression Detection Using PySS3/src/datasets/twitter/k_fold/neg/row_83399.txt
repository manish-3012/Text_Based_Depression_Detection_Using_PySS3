I split up with my loving, caring boyfriend. I need to die because I'm the worst person for doing thisWe wanted different things and he lived an hour away. But he made me feel so loved, so wanted, so safe and he was a bit overprotective but that was because he was such a sweet guy.  
I feel so guilty for doing this to him. He saved me from suicide countless times, made sure I stayed on my meds and went to therapy, and yet I did this to him. In the next couple of days I'm going to the bridge.
