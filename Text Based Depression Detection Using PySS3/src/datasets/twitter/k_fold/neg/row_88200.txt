ORANGEIt all makes sense, my suicide. But I can't get over the biological urge to stay alive. 
Today I was walking my dog, the sun was setting. The sky was dark except for a pink strip. The pink strip flashes orange like an explosion, lasts a second or two, then goes back to pink. Orange on a traffic light either means stop unless your over the line, or get read to go over the line. I often think about how I need to kill myself but I'm too scared, too comfortable, I need something to push me over the edge. Over the line!

The problem is I'm too fucking scared. I'm 90% sure that the universe isn't even real. I know this is a game. And killing yourself is winning. That's the objective, to escape this stupidity. Everything is set up to make killing myself the thing I have to do but the thing I least want to do. I don't want to die I don't want to die. I'm so scared. The orange flash means that it's coming soon, get ready to go over the edge. My time is up. Its so great but so scary at the same time.  I've been needing to die for two years and just now it is all coming clear.

On the other hand I feel so calm and content. Everything makes sense now. Nothing is real its all just a game ..like those sims games. And the objective is figuring it out and removing yourself from it. Overcoming the biological urge to live...the biggest accomplishment.
