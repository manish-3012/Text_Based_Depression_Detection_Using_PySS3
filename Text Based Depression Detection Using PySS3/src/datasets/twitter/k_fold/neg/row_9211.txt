gradesJust found out I failed chem and have to retake it.  Pretty much one of the easiest classes and I just fucked it up.  Costs several hundred a credit hour so this is basically at least a $1000 fuck up.  Where does this end.  Next I lose my scholarship which is basically guaranteed and im about to fuck up my calc final since i've learned exactly squat in that class so far.

I've got some nice rope or last resort a bunch of caffine pills which would be easy to od on.

i'm not cut out for this life.  everyone else has their shit together and knows where they're going.

I come into college assuming i'm going to be able to finally experience life and start living and instead enter a living hell.  I can't take this shit anymore.

I dont even know what the fuck has happened to me in the past 4 months.  hell I started fucking around with my knife but it's too dull for now until I get a stone to sharpen it.  I thought that shit was reserved for edgy pre-teens.

Doesn't help that i've come to realize there's no point to life.  Why do I keep going.  What is the point.  I spend decades getting an education.  work for years with a few good moments in between then linger for a bit and die.  I don't see why we even bother.
