If you're not a contributing member of society, dieThat's what seems to be what's in the collective unconscious of most people. I can see why: humans appreciate shared labour. If you don't collaborate you're a leech. And I agree. 
See, I'm an immigrant, and so I have to work twice as hard as natives here. But you know what? I haven't achieved that. Opposite of that, I have shown I'm incredibly useless. I have been job hunting for a whole year and the most I achieved was getting call backs from call centers. I panicked the one time I attended to the training process. I currently am living with my father, who's paying rent. I turned 19 some months ago. I wanted to die before that, I tried to jump under a subway train but couldn't bring myself to do it. My father has threatened to kick me out and honestly I kinda want him to, if that gives me the will to die. My depression has been untreated for four years (though I've had it for eight years now) and it's the main reason I haven't been productive. It's hard to adapt to a different society since the country I'm from had a huge economic crisis going on that made me get used to chaos. I'm introverted, artistic, sensitive, quiet, withdrawn, anxious, low in conscientiousness, high in openness, agreeable. Like what the fuck even. It's my personality and my illness what keeps me from adapting. I also lack friends and support system here. I'm just being a liability and wasting time. I rather be dead to stop bothering others like this.
I can't stand how true it is that non productive people are seen as leeches but when you want to take your own life then your life is valuable. Like. What. Let me die.
