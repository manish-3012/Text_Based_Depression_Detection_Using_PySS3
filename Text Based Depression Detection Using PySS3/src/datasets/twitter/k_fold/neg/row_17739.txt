I donâ€™t know what to do or sayMy life from the outside seems like I have everything under control. But truth be told I honestly havenâ€™t felt happiness in quiet some time. I have had this feeling that if I were to die tomorrow no one would care or even really miss me. I have been having these thoughts for almost a year now and do not know what to do. I am scarred to talk to anyone close to me because I do not want anyone freaking out about it but at the same time I feel like I am constantly drowning. I feel like I am worthless and that nobody truly cares for me
