im broken.im 20. i have crippling depression, severe anxiety and ptsd. ive been going to a therapist once a week for a little under a year and have been on a few different meds. citalopram, escitalopram, cymbalta.. none worked. ive been taking Doxepin for like a month now and i think its working?? idk. my therapist sent me to some place to evaluate me and "really see exactly what was going on in my head." it was like 3 once a week 3 hour sessions of testing and stuff. when i got the results and the doctor read them off.. honestly it was the most depressing thing ive ever heard. lol he said the normal amount of points of someone with "severe depression" was like 20 something points. i scored a whopping 46. ayy go me.. i cant talk to my mom or dad about this because my mom also has bad depression(on top of every physical illness she has.) and whenever i tell her about stuff when im having an episode she just breaks down. and i dont really have much of a relationship with my dad. nor my sister. and i dont like talking about stuff with my cousin(who is pretty much my brother) because its gotten to the point where whenever i let everything out in front of people i end up breaking down and crying. and i dont like crying in front of people. especially him. idk why. maybe its like a pride thing? idk..

**anyways.. let me give you guys a bit of a background.**

every romantic relationship ive had with girls has pretty much been trash. after breaking up with my first girlfriend she got upset and spread rumours about me that reached pretty much everyone in my school(middle school). people that i literally never seen or talked to before would come up to me saying what they were told and would laugh at me. because she told so many people, everyone believed her. no matter how hard i tried to defend myself. 

the few other relationships i had ended bad too. my cousin whos pretty much my brother would steal girls away from me before i could actually date them. ive been cheated on a couple times(once was with said cousin). all of that has pretty much scarred me. 

ive had countless opportunities to have girlfriends but ive always been scared. there was one girl i used to talk to online everyday. even though we never actually met we were super close. we used to say we were twins, thats how alike we were. she went to school just a town away from me. we literally talked every day. for hours and hours on end. she would ask to hang out all the time but i was too insecure at this point. i didnt want to meet her and accidentally fuck it up. we never ended up dating though because i was scared something would ruin it. thats my biggest regret in life. i know now that if i just stopped being a bitch and just asked her out that my entire life would be different. she would have pushed me to do better in school, we would have gone to prom, we would have done so much. honestly, one reason i never eventually asked her out was  because i was embarrassed that i dropped out of high school. who wants to bring a drop out to their mom and dad and their friends and say "hey mom, hey dad, hey friends, heres my ugly drop out boyfriend. i know we're high class and hes like barely middle class but hes suuuuper cool." nobody. i didnt want to embarrass her. i know she wanted to go out with me but idk.. i wasnt good enough for her. she deserved the world.. and i wouldnt have been able to give it to her. so instead of leading her on more i stopped talking to her. we still follow each other on everything and like occasionally comment on eachothers whatever but we never actually talk. i wouldn't be surprised if she deleted my number to be honest. not dating her **honestly** is my biggest regret of my entire life. 

i dropped out of high school at age 16. I missed a whole lot of school one year because my dad had a heart attack and was in the hospital for a week. then later my mom got sick with really bad pneumonia and was in the hospital for a week. and then my dog almost died. I missed so much school that i was either failing or was almost failing all of my classes. And school before that was already stressful. but add all of that stress onto my shoulders on top of the already extreme stress that school gave me..i **immediately** got my ged but never went to college. not even a community college. i know i should but school life is far too stressful for me. especially now. 

ive only ever had one job. a full time stock boy at some shitty retail store. i applied for part time but when they said i got the job and called me in, they told me they only wanted a full time stock boy. i tried it out and it was terrible. 50 hour weeks. i only had the job for a few months in 2015 because my coworkers treated me like trash. even my managers. they lied about me taking long breaks when i didnt, they blamed things on me, purposely called me like 7 different names. 10% of the time being my actual name. when i put my 2 weeks in, i overheard one of my managers say he was happy to get a new worker that doesnt look like a serial killer(i have the male equivilant of resting bitch face). that entire experience has pretty much killed my urge to find another job. 

my social life is fucking trash. i pretty much stay home every day. just watching youtube videos or playing video games or skyping with friends. once or twice a week me, my cousin and maybe a friend or two watch wrestling or some show together. occasionally i have friends come over(for something thats not for wrestling, walking dead or whatevr) but 9/10 thats because my cousin was the one to ask. they(my cousin and i's mutual friends) usually dont want to come over whenever i ask. they're either "too busy" or they're actually busy doing something when i ask. after a while of asking people to hang out and just getting rejected or just flat out ignored i stopped trying. 

my skype friends(a group of like 8 people that ive known mostly since middle school) ask me to come hang with them a lot but i almost always lie say i cant for whatever reason i think of on the spot. the reason i dont hang with them is because when we used to see eachother in high school, i was still skinny, had really thick long hair, had "cool" clothes and wasnt nearly as awkward(thank u mental illnesses for ruining my life btw). now im like 215-220(it fluctuates) with super thinned out hair, have dated clothes(not having a job with money coming in weekly apparently makes you poor. go figure.), and thanks to all of my annoying mental illnesses, im awkward as fuck. social situations can be my personal hell sometimes(most of the time).

when it comes to small talk with people(especially strangers, but even with people i know), im fucking lost. i cant. i really cant. i never know what to talk about and i just come off as painfully awkward. which sucks because i dont forget things like that and i just dwell and dwell on it. even if the person i was with didnt think it was *that* bad and end up forgetting it, i dont. i cant.

i want a social life but i cant handle the pressures. i want money but just thinking about looking for a job stresses me out. i want a job but i keep thinking its going to be the same as my last job. i want a girlfriend but im super awkward and because of my weight and thin hair, im not attractive enough to pull of being awkward. i want to message that girl and rekindle our relationship but im 4 years too late for that. especially looking like i do.. id have no chance with her. and that really fucking sucks. the only time ive cried while writing all of this was when i first started talking about her earlier and when i just brought her up again. 

i hate my life. im fucking broken. why am i such a fucking failure.
