No one is taking me seriouslyI just told my psychiatrist that I'm at high risk of suicide right now and that i'm scared of impulsively hurting myself. She prescribed me xanax and told me to just pop one when I felt those urges. I don't know why I expected her to actually help me. I feel so abandoned by everyone in my "support system". I think I'll attempt tonight. I don't see the point of holding on anymore
