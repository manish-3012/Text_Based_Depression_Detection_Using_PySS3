HopelessNothing left in my life to live for anymore, i just wanna die and never wake up. No support from anyone in my life man, itâ€™s just me in the end. Been severely depressed and suicidal for the pass 4 years and nothing is getting better, it just gets worse from here. And Iâ€™m so sick and tired of people telling me life gets better or youâ€™re too young to die and feel this way. Makes me no sense, it just pisses me off when I hear those supposed helpful advice. Just a bit of context about me, Iâ€™m 17 from Pennsylvania and currently a junior in high school. I donâ€™t have much friends or really a support group that has my back, Iâ€™m always seen by myself most of the time. I keep things to myself, not really interacting with the outside world. Everything that I once held close, is now all of sudden letting loose. Everything from my friends, and family, school is falling apart, I have nothing left to loose at this point. One second Iâ€™m happy and the other Iâ€™m sad, depressed, and crazy. Sure maybe I need to surround myself around better people that care about me, but itâ€™s hard for people to be accepting of me. I tried making internet friends to see if itâ€™s worth it by joining the different sub reddits they have to offer on here. And to my surprise, everyoneâ€™s the same. Maybe my expectations are way too high when making friends, but I find that people either ghost, donâ€™t respond at all, or say a few things and dip out like they never knew me. Itâ€™s saddening to me because I want to experience and have a friend that is down to earth and loyal. I consider myself an outcast, reject, and loner. Nobody wants to talk to me, walk with me, sit with me, or really associate themselves with me. I donâ€™t know what I did to deserve any of this, I am not denying the fact Iâ€™ve done and said fucked up things, however, i just canâ€™t seem to rationalize or understand how ones life can be this terrible. Donâ€™t get me wrong, there are plenty of people that are struggling out there worse than I am, Iâ€™m sure of it, but that doesnâ€™t mean my mental health isnâ€™t important. The saying, â€œThey only care only when you dieâ€ really is speaking into existence in my life right now. Maybe if I die, people will truly understand the pain, struggle, and misery i been through. Sometimes, I just wanna run away far away and never return. It makes me sad that my other friends are happy and have friends who care about them, while I literally have no one. All I do is wake up, do school work, sleep, and repeat. Itâ€™s really sad how my life has turned out, and I donâ€™t care if Iâ€™m only 17, age doesnâ€™t mean shit. Letâ€™s not forget to mention that I get made me of for feeling and being the way I am. I canâ€™t help that Iâ€™m stuck feeling depressed and suicidal all the time. Maybe just maybe someone out there will see message and understand what I go through..
