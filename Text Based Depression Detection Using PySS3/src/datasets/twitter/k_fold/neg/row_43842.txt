I wish I got in an accidentIts really weird even to me and I don't know why, I don't eve know if I want to die maybe I just want something to get attention from because I have no friends. If I was lying in a hospital bed atleast I wouldnt have to do anything, maybe if I was paralyzed I would have enough of a reason to kill myself, It doesnt even make any sense and I'm like in a really weird border between wanting to die and just dealing with being sad. so I kind of want something to push me over the edge so I can actually get the courage to kill myself. I don't know what I'm saying its so fucking stupid
