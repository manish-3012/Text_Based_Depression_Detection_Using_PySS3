I feel so empty, i just want to dieAfter years and years of abuse and lonliness i escape it to find love and they all hurt me instead and eventually leave me entirely alone. Its always my fault, they go because i tell them about the sexual assault or they go because i tell them about the MPD or they go because im trans people just always leave me and im alone and dying and all i want is to kill myself so i dont have to feel this pain anymore and i dont have any reason left to stay.
