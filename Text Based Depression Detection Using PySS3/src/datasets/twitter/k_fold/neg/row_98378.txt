I want to rest my head on your lap and fade awayi dont want it anymore

you came back after so many years

and it gave me a feeling of hope

that, maybe you remembered how much i loved you

and you wanted it back

but it isn't true

your happy with what you are

and i am not

i've never been since you left

when i told you all of this

it broke that growing bond 

i am so sorry

sorry for you

sorry for myself

and full of regret over every second in all these years

that i endured without you

but with you, all of this pain came back

when i had eased my mind to fade off into nothingness

you ruined it

i know there is no future
 
not for me

not for us


its all over

i cant take it anymore

its too painful to know you

cause you are not meant for me

and i am not meant for life


now the year's over and i am alone again

i told you everything but this

i am afraid to die alone -

if i only could rest my head on your lap and fade away

I'd die the way i never was being alive:

happy
