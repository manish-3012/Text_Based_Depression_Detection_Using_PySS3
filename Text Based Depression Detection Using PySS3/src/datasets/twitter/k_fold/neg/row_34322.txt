Suicidal thoughts.I have thought about suicide twice before in my life, both times I decided not to for only one reason. That reason is because I am still a virgin. I want to experience sex before I die. I want to experience what it is like to hold a girl, to embrace her, to kiss her, to please her, to love her, and to make love to her. I just afraid of my life. Part of me feels that I will eventually get a girlfriend and everything will brighten up. The other part feels like I will lose my virginity and then take my own life. I have other posts on r/depression and r/sex which explain the situation of depression that has caused me these thoughts, if anyone is interested.
