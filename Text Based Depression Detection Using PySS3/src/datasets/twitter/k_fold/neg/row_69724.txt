Knowing people care about me is the only thing stopping meI just keep struggling with a desire to live, or even do anything. I still find enjoyment in stuff, I get my school done, I kind of take care of myself.

I just keep going up and down rapidly, almost in an instant sometimes, and the worst part is I've made multiple plans, ways to try and die remotely enough I can't be found. 

Then I think about that even if I simply disappeared, I'd leave an awful note in people's lives. I haven't managed to find any reassurance in this lately. I just get mad. I'm hundreds of miles from the people who can help me, and they don't even know anyways. I simultaneously won't do it because I know they care, but at the same time I'm getting no meaningful of helpful social interactions.

I'm sorry if this was rambly or jumped around a bit, but I'm not in the right place to make sure I write right. Thanks for letting me vent.
