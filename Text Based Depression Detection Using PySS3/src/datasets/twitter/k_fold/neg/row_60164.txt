No one actually cares.I've felt suicidal for a long time. And no one cares. No one takes me seriously. They all think I'm doing it for attention. I guess in a way, I am. I want help. Hotlines do nothing for me. I have no friends. My family is far away. The person I love, hates the way that I am. No one likes my art. What point is there to living when nothing ever makes me happy? If it's "normal" for life to suck and be unfair, then I don't want to live in it. No one really cares about me. 

You hear all of these stories of people being saved from suicide by loved ones or even by a stranger. I would never be one of those people. No one even notices I exist here. No one even cares that I exist. If I died right now. It would take a week or so before anyone noticed.

For the person I love, If I could out of their life forever... They would be much happier.  They wouldn't have someone dragging them down anymore. I'm sure they would be relieved that I died. Maybe not on the outside. But I'm sure they would secretly be so so so relieved. 

Why
Don't
I just kill myself already.
