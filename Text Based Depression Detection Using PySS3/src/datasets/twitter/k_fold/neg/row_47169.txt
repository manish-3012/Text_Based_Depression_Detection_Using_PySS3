People don't take me serious anymore when I talk about killing myselfI'm only 23 years old and at this point I don't want anything in life. I'm in chronic pain, have been for several months now, doctors told me I'll be needing a shit ton of painkillers by the time I'm 50. I won't make it that far though. I have several addictions as well and my body and health is a mess beyond repair. 

I've told almost every one of my friends that I won't reach 30, I even told my mother that I'm not going to be around for much longer. People don't take this serious. That's a good thing though. My death won't come as a surprise.
