Something in my head keeps telling me to kill myself (18M)I have no idea what's going on in my head.
My family loves me, I know that.
I have an easy life, I know that.
I've had such a privileged life compared to so many others, I know that.
I've never considered myself to be depressed, I've never self harmed or any of that, I hate pain and don't like the look of scars, but over the past maybe year or so whenever I'm alone with just my thoughts to keep me company something at the back of my mind keeps telling me to just end it all. And although I probably should, I can't bring myself to tell my mum or anyone who I'm closest to because I feel undeserving of how I feel. Anyway about an hour ago I found myself with a razor blade in my hand, standing on the edge of a bridge with a nice view just wondering how I got to that point and realised that whatever this thing is going on with me is, I need help but just don't know how to go about getting help if I don't know what's wrong myself.
Sorry for the long-ish post, I just needed to get something out there even if it reaches nobody just to help myself get things in some sort of order in my head.
