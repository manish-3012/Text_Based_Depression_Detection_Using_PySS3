You ever just wonder why you dont deserve to be happy?Its just like, why? Why do all my friends around me get to be happy and I dont? It just gets so tiring, seeing everyone around you living their lives happy when despite my efforts, it just doesnt seem possible

If no matter what I do I cant achieve happiness then like what even is the point of trying anymore...
