what do you do when you no longer want anything in life?ive realised that i have no passions anymore and i have no plans or desires for a future.

the thing is, i dont really want to die. but i dont want to live either. i dont want to kill myself, and its not like i can anymore anyways - my family is at home every day now bcos of this quarantine shit. but i dont wanna be here. 

i am just so fucking useless and aimless i might as well be dead. i bring nothing to this world and i dont want anything. all the things i thought brought me joy and gave me hope was just pure escapism. ive always attached myself to fiction bcos i prefer anything over my life, and its made an absolutely hollow existence. i dont want to die, but every day i think itd be better than prolonging this shitshow of a life.
