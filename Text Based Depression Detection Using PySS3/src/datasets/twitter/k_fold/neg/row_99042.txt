I am sadMy boyfriend and I fought yesterday and well it was because my usa visa. It might get canceled. We both said each other shitry things and at some point he dropped he will delete his account because he can't deal with the shame I cause him. He ended not deleting it because Ibasked him to stay if he loved me but now he doesn't seem he is online. Do you think he just want some space or abandoned his account?
