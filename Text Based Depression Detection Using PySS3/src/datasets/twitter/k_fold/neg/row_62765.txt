I just got back to my house. My girlfriend is dead of an apparent overdose. We hit one year together a month and a half ago, but I have known and been in love with her for well over a decade. She was beautiful and complicated and her anger was righteous and her love was absolute. It took me a long long time to make her mine. She was about one month shy of celebrating two years of sobriety from opiates. We spent some time together and we talked last night, we hadn't seen each other in two weeks. In that time she hooked up with some people from the old days that are still in that life. They welcomed her back with open needles. I feel like she was waiting for me to leave town two weeks ago to do her thing. There is a feeling of empty in me that is so deep it is all echoes. She had been gone since early this afternoon. I came by this evening and thought she was sleeping and did housework. I checked her a little later and she was cold. 911 and frantic compressions but I think I knew. There was no blood on her face until I tried to get her heart started then there was a lot. We were going to get married at the right time. I loved her. And she actually loved me. I do not know what to do. So I find myself doing this. She had strong beliefs, I do not, we had amazing talks. A life together was the plan. I hope she is at peace. I miss you. I will always miss you.
