Before I try to OD tonightI'm going to think about her.

I'm going to think about her arms around me.

I'm going to revel in the fantasies, regrets, wishes and what was always unobtainable.

And I'm going to die in the dreams about her.

I'll wake up in the dreams, and never come to this world again. I'm not going to wake up as an unlovable piece of human garbage.

I'm coming, my love.
