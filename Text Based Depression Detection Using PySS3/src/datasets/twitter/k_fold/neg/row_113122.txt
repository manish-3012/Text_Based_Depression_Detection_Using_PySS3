pretty sure suicide is inevitable for meI go through good phases and bad phases. I have the most loving and understanding partner anyone could ask for and often feel she deserves better than me. I stay for her and for my family. 

The bad phases have been more frequent and lasting longer. 

Iâ€™m convinced suicide will be my way out, I just donâ€™t know when yet.
