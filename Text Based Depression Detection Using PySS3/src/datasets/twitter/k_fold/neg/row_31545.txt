It's Now In My Dreams, I Can't Escape the Thoughts AnymoreI actually contemplated suicide in my dreams last night. It's now that deep in my (un)/conscious...

I was going to jump in front of a car, ended up running in the direction the car was headed, and ended up almost knee deep in water. The road was flooded. Too much symbolism to handle at the moment, but man I was close.

What would happen if I killed myself in my dreams? Would it be a healing opportunity or make things worse?

Have any of you ever killed yourselves in your dreams? What happened?
