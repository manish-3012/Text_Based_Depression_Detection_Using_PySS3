unfitI don't think I've actively wanted to die in a long time, but I've been living for about a decade now with a profound mental illness (diagnosed four years ago), and it feels more and more preferable to not be alive.

It's an odd feeling. It isn't despair, it's apathy--I would've liked to have lived a good life, but it seems as if it was arrogant of me to pretend I was fit to be part of a society, even with medication. It would be much easier for me to just stop. I don't mean that in a self-pitying way. It just...this isn't working for anybody. Not for me. Not for people who know me. Could feed and medicate me for another 40-70 years but why bother really?

I don't know if I should be more or less concerned by feeling this way. I don't feel desperate or like I'm going to impulsively crash my car or anything (I remember feeling that way and doing that before I was medicated, this isn't like that). I just feel a sort of calm mounting inexorability toward the best-outcome of my death. Sorry. I don't know what I'm driving toward here or what to make of it. Just counting down mainly.
