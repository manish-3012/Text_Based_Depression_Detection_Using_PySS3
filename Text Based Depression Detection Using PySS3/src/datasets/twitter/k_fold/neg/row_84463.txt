Im pretty dumb. Im definitely not the sharpest shed in the toolboxI'm that one person that messes up so bad at work that it gets the verbal reaction "this has never happened before" and co-workers talking about me behind my back in hushed tones. 

I'm still in highschool however I'll shortly be Turing 18. I get average grades at school but if I don't even have the skills to apply what I've learned to real life then what's the point. I learn at such an incredibly slow speed which is the very reason I'm in a slower paced math class than the rest of my grade is taking. It's frustrating to my co-workers who are trying to teach me something, they have to explain things to me over and over again and in the end I'll still probably end up messing up.

 I wonder how much of a loss it would be to society it would truly be if I wasn't here, perhaps things might even be improved. One less person in line at a store, one less person in traffic, and one less person for my family to worry about, so on and so forth.
