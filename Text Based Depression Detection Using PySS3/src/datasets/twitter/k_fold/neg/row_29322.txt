Too many too often...Iâ€™ve been having dreams and thoughts a lot recently of being dead. Overdose, driving my car off the bridge, putting myself into situations where I could die and itâ€™s really scaring me. I havenâ€™t been this bad in a few months and this is the worst itâ€™s been since my last institutionalization. I donâ€™t know where to turn to get help because I canâ€™t afford it or insurance. I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone because I feel like Iâ€™m bugging them and I donâ€™t want to talk to my gf/ex/Idek what we are because sheâ€™s part of the problem. Iâ€™m just so tired of being an addict. Iâ€™m so tired of being strong. Iâ€™m so tired of faking that Iâ€™m not suicidal. Iâ€™m just so tired of life. I want help and to be better. I just donâ€™t know where to turn. Iâ€™m not going to kill myself but I really do wish I could be at ease. This is seeming like the best option.
