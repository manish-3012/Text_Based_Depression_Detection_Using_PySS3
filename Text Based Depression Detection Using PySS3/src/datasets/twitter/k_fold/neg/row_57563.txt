This one doesn't deserve a titleI just don't understand my own head. I am a successful IT engineer, in a great job, and have the respect/adoration of my peers, but I am completely unhappy. I drink, and when I drink I become extremes of my own personality. Obsessed with murder, obsessed with love, or just plain sad. I have some debts to pay that will resolve themselves shortly, but literally I have very little to be unhappy about. Yet I feel like killing myself is the most appropriate thing to do. I hate how I developed multiple minds inside myself, but I have no clue how to grasp and control them. I have pets and they're one of the reasons why I stay alive. But I can't overcome this overwhelming feeling of dread.

The answer and conclusion I keep coming back to is death. A permanent solution to problems and opportunities in my life. I've done all the other things to sort out this - drugs, sex/hookups, distractions in media and other things.

I just don't know how to come over this feeling of dread and sadness in my head. I have nothing I should be sad or ashamed about, so why do I feel this anger, this hatred for myself? How do I start reconciling my own mind, my own prison?
