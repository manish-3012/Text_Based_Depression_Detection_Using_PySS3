Would my parents miss me??Iâ€™m genuinely curious as to if my parents would miss me. My brother, probably not. We donâ€™t talk much anyways. But I wonder if my parents would miss me. Honestly, I donâ€™t think so. Theyâ€™re really busy with their business and tend to move on pretty quickly. Like, honestly I sorta admire how quickly they can move on from things. Itâ€™s a great skill. I wish I had it, but I donâ€™t. 

Come to think of it, Iâ€™m not sure anybody would miss me. Nobody sends me a text unless they want something anyway. And thatâ€™s never. I could go the entire weekend without anybody (my family included) texting me. My â€œfriendsâ€ typically forget about me unless I nag the crap out of them. I just need to find the right spot to kill myself in. But anyways, would my parents miss me? What are your thoughts on this?
