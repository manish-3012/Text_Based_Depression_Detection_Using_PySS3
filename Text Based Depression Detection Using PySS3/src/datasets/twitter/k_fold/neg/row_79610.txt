im most likely going to take my life todaylife has become unbearable, i cant stand how everything i do is never enough, and that im never enough for nobody and nothing.

Im 17, i study to the point of nervous fatigue, and yet im failing 7/11 subjects and it just keeps getting worse. It's never enough.

Im alone in real life, and as much as i try to talk to people it's never enough to make a friend.

I do exercises for my posture, it doesnt get better.

I have friends online, but they always either leave or ghost me like "she" 's doing.

I try to better myself to become more good looking, something i never was and was always bullied for not being, i can never get above a "almost average".

ITS NEVER ENOUGH. FOR ANYTHING. I AM NEVER ENOUGH, FOR ANYTHING AND NO ONE.

My family is hell, my grandma is dying, and i recently underwent a surgery which went bad, too.
