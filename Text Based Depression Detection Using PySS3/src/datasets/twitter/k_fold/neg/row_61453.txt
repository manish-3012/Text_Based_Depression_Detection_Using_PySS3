Why shouldn't I kill myself?I am a 21 year old kissless virgin who is almost done with university with no social life. I am literally spending my entire day in my room because I feel like there is nobody out there who would want to be friends with some low value male like I am.

Might be a good idea to spend less time on the internet because I feel like I am slowly getting 'corrupted' into an incel because of reading too much about stuff like social status and the 80/20 rule(80% of the women go for the 20% of the men).
