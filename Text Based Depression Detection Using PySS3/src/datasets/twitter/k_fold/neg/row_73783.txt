How would you commit suicide?Hello,

I have barely graduated and Iâ€™m considering either leaving everyone and everything behind. Or putting an end to it all. Donâ€™t give me the classic - go ask for help. 

Anyway, in which ways would my departure be easier? I never did drugs, but considering an OD. Though, it can be tricky. CO poisoning. Insuline + Kcl.

How would you do it? Painfully and unfailingly?
