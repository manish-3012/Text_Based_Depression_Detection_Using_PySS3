Too tired to commit suicide.If someone brought the bridge to me I could probably manage to drag myself over the edge, but driving out there and walking to the midpoint is beyond me. It's sort of funny in a surreal, Kafkaesque kind of way. Just wondering if anyone else feels like this or if I'm just the butt of some cosmic joke.
