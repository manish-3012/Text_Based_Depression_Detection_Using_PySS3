Everyone would be better without mei really do feel this way, if i killed myself a few people would be "sad" but i feel like they only would because social convention says if someone you know dies you are supposed to be sad but they really shouldnt be, no one i know enjoys spending time with me, i can tell by their faces and the way they talk and how much it is pulling teeth to get anyone to do anything with me that i am a horrible person to spend time with.

everything in my life seems like shit, the way it always has, im 23 and still to this date have never had a girl friend, and i dont care about sex i just wanted a girl friends because its someone that might care about me.

basically i am really considering suicide i really want to do it, i just need to build myself up so i can finally do it and be rid of all this crap.
