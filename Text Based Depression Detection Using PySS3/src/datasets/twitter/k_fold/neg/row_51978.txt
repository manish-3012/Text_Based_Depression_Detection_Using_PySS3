nobody cares, but Iâ€™m going to rant anywayEverything is so messed up right now, and itâ€™s only going to get worse. I know that for a fact. Iâ€™ve been majorly depressed and anxious because of some things that that are happening in the upcoming months. I know once the things happen it will be worse and I will be totally alone in the world. Iâ€™m also in and going to be in a position where I am forced to suppress my emotions. I already do that so much. Everything is changing and not for the better. Iâ€™m loosing everything and I canâ€™t possibly dead with it any longer. 

Not to mention Iâ€™m fighting off self harm and anorexia. I have no one to talk too and no therapist or medication to even ease the pain. 

Eating disorders suck because when I do eat Iâ€™m technically getting better but I feel like Iâ€™m failing. I donâ€™t want to get better but I do?? Iâ€™m not strong and I donâ€™t want to try. I want to end it but there is never a good time. I wish my parents would pay attention to me long enough to see Iâ€™m struggling to stay alive. 

Sorry for making no sense and wasting your time if you bothered to read this
