I dont wanna do this anymoreI dont expect much input on this bc why would i.

Im a woman, i bpd (that mental illness where every thinking your a manipulative liar despite the disorder mostly being brought on by trauma and emotionally invalidating environments), i struggle with alcohol and self esteem, etcetera ecetrea..

I fucked up the last relationship i was in. All my realtionships ive truly loved the person I was with. And yet this last one i fucked that up too. I dont wanna do this anymore.

5 years ago on the 23rd the closest person I had to an actual brother died. I didnt learn about it until april of 2016. 

4 fucking months. 4 god damn months and NOBODY thought to tell me. I knew and understood that we had grown apart. But fuck man, i figured someone would have told me and that i wouldnt have to find out on FB on my prom night.

I been hospitalized 3 times. I been thru countless therapy programs. Yet it never seems to get better.

Im.so tired. I have my last will and testament. I have my note.

Im just so tired. All i do is drink and cry and SH. I got a jew job recently and while i go and make money thats not keeping my head above water.

I dont know what to do anymore.

I dont want to do this anymore.
