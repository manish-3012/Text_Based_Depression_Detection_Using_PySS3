I Just Can't LifeStudy for college SAT thing for the 2nd time in a very competitive country - I get shit grades.



Received results of my PSAT version here. Well fuck.


I did NOTHING but study for this exam this year, since late January. Wake up, study, check corona news and college stuff w phone, eat pizza while solving math problems, fall asleep on my book and drool all over. Left arm got semi-paralyzed, went to hospital thinking I was having a stroke, I just had way too tense muscles at my neck-arm area that it pinched a nerve, I guess. A doc gave a couple shots of muscle relaxant and I was good.



Wake up in desk, wash, study, space out or slow down on studying, cry for an hour(yes, it happened multiple times a week this whol year), go to doc, get my meds, back home and study.



Didn't even properly play a video game since May. Angry Birds is fun though.




I'm 28 and I and dumber than 18 year olds - kids a decade tounger than me.



My family practically treats me like a sick, old dog that nobody wants to go near but give food and shelter out of pity. Not welcome inside the house though



Get a job? Can't. I cannnot function without xanax and diazepam daily. I cannot stand the anxiety I had my whole life anymore, I take them as soon as I feel a hint of anxiety of that kind. (The 'normal' anxieties feel a bit different and they are usually bearable)
