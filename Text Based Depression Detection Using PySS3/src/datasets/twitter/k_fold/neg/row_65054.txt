I don't know what I'm doing anymore....These past years have been awful. I've been on the edge multiple times. Every time I fail to execute, idk what it is. I've tried a plethora of methods to get out of this disastrous mindset I have, for example; therapy.
The sadness doesn't seem to end. I'm content with the constant sadness, because at least it's....constant.
I don't feel safe tonight. Tonight will probably be the night. I guess.....I'm sorry.
