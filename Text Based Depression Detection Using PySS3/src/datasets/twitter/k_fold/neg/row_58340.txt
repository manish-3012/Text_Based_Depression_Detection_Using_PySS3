Help?Hi.

I'm going through a pretty bad time right now. I'm in grad school, and was supposed to graduate in May. But even though I've been working hard I've failed a class and I'm worried about the feedback I'm getting about my thesis. It's been a long, slow decline over the past year basically. I feel guilty and sad -- I wish I was smarter, and just better. I've wasted time and money, and I feel like a failure. My director says I probably won't walk at graduation, and I don't want all my classmates to know. I'm doing makeup work, but I just don't see it making it better. Failing has stressed me out, which decreases the quality of my work, which stresses me out, and it's just a spiral... 

I've been wanting to be dead lately. I don't feel like I'm as smart or kind or organized as I want to be. I'm disappointed in myself. I feel gross. I wish at least I was a wonderful kind person people wanted to be around, but I've been sad an irritable. I just wish I was better, but I'm so tired. I want to quit trying because it's hard and I just keep failing at being a valuable human.

I've talked to my friend and fiance about it (and they're great and supportive) but I feel like I'm scaring them and I don't want to do that.

I guess I just wanted to say it here -- that I want to die. I think I'll be okay because I don't want to hurt family and friends and my fiance. But I'm hurting, and the desire is there, and the plan is there, and I'm not sure where to go next, or what to do that won't just further mess everything up. I'm not even good at being a failure. I'm not responding in a constructive way.
