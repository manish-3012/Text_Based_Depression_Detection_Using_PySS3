I'm a Deviant and it's time for me to end it.Over the past few years I've discovered how much of a sexual deviant I am. Even though I'm a straight heterosexual male I've looked up porn that doesn't fall in line with my spectrum. None of it really bothered me until I met an amazing woman who changed my life, but I can never be with her because of certain circumstances.

I'm very thankful to have gained so much self awareness and to have seen how my actions affect me, but I can't forgive myself. 

I've viewed some things in the past that shouldn't have been viewed and, even though I don't look at them anymore, last night I was on google images looking at "vanilla" stuff there was a picture on there that I clicked on of two characters from a video game in a very sexual act. I didn't know who they were until I did a search for them and they were two teenage characters from a video game. I feel so sick for seeing it and it feels like everything I've been fighting for the past few years has gone down the drain.

I can't even function correctly when I'm around people because all I ever worry about is them figuring out what a secret deviant I am and it causes me to feel shame, which I absolutely should because it's my fault. I'm going to sound like I have an ego, but people genuinely do like me now and I've been trying to improve myself but if anyone compliments me it just makes me think to myself if only you knew the real me.

I want to die so bad, but I've been putting it off because I know it's selfish, I just don't know how else to live. I'm sorry if I offend anyone.
