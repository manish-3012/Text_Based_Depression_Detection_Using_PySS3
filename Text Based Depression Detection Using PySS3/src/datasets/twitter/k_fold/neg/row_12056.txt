I just donâ€™t feel like getting up everyday anymoreAll my life I felt like nothing ever worked in my favor, wherever itâ€™s applying to a job and not getting it or trying my best in college and still failing. Iâ€™m only 19 but I feel like thereâ€™s no potential for me. I feel like Iâ€™m not getting anywhere in life and I always feel like the odds are against me in every situation. My girlfriend and my mother know that I have mental health issues and theyâ€™re always trying to help me feel better and i appreciate them but I feel like I canâ€™t do it anymore. It just feels like everyone hates me and I have no friends. I want to be a model but and for the past 3 years Iâ€™ve worked my ass off trying to get discovered but nothing ever happens. I just want to give up already. I feel like nobody understands me and they just feel like Iâ€™m complaining. I think that I just want to end my life already.
