What's a genuine reason to continue on?I've lost all my friends, people who I've known since I was little, people who were always there for me. I fucking suck at everything I do. I am nothing. I have no talent no matter what I try and spend thousands of hours trying. I am a absolute waste of talent. I've been sitting here staring outside my window thinking and brainstorming as to why I should continue to go on? Like seriously is there any good reason to go on? I can't think of anything. I get bullied every single fucking day during school, of course now it's online school so atleast that has cooled down, but fuck dude. This life has always been shit to me, and still is shit, I don't know what to do. It's getting shittier by the day, waking up is the worst part of the day, the day is the worst part of the day, sleeping is the worst part of the day, no one good second is the good part of the day.


I tried video games, I tried learning new things. It isn't working . What the fuck do I do
