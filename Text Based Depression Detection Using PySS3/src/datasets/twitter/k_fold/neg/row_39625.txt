Going to the shooting range tomorrowYe.  
People on this site pushed me over the edge.  Have already been feeling extra crappy for the last week or so. Yesterday I just started to feel like hey maybe I do deserve help. ...

Was actually supposed to see my doctor today for an appointment and referral to a psychiatrist but apparently because all my wounds are self inflicted I am not entitled to the same level of care as other people and "don't have a life threatening illness" so the tiniest glimmer of hope I had is gone.
