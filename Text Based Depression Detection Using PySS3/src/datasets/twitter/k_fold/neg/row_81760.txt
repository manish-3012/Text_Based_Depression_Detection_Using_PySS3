WaitingI really am tired of living. At this point my marriage is failing and we have accepted that as soon as the pandemic ends we can start to separate. No kids, no pets. Just a quiet parting of ways. I really have only one concern about killing myself now, my mother. She is getting older (70+) now and is living alone after my father died a few years back. I am just worried that this will be too much losing her only child so soon after her husband. 

She has no family and her parents died many years ago. She will really be all alone once I go and I don't want her to have to live like that. I'm worried she just won't take care of herself and will die lonely and sad. I love my mother and don't want that for her but it is so hard to hang on. I don't want her to die but part of me wishes she would peacefully pass so I can finally let go. I feel so guilty.
