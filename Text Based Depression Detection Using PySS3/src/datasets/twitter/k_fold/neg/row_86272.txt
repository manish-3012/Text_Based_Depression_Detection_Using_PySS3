I'm pissedI told my mother that I needed therapy, I mean this wasn't the first time I told her this but I was really being pushy about it. And she just said the most annoying thing. "Pray and read a bible." How the fuck is the going to help me?! If that could work half the problems I am going through would be over and done with. I try so hard to tell her I need therapy. I really need it. But she doesn't get it. Will she get it when I try to fucking kill myself again?! I am on a edge in my life and I don't know when I will fall off this edge. I am just so angry, lonely, sad, and just so disappointed
