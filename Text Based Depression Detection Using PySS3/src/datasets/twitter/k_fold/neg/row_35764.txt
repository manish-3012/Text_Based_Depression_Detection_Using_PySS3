Is it normal to just wish that I would die? EVERYONE wishes for death at least once, right?Not suicidal. I just wish I was dead. Nothing will change &amp; Iâ€™ll always hate my life. No longer planning my drowning etc. after going through a lot of different suicide scenarios, location, dates, &amp; times etc. I no longer almost do it after going to the place and holding stuff in ny hands before almost doing it. No longer giving my stuff away &amp; planning a suicide for months.

But I just wish for it still like Iâ€™m sure everyone in this world does at least once. I thought about my family and loved ones, and I donâ€™t want to hurt them so I wonâ€™t do it. But I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d fight for survival if I was given a choice. I just hate life so much &amp; Iâ€™ll never change my views.

Iâ€™m not depressed, not in pain, &amp; not suicidal. I just am lazy, I donâ€™t want to fight, &amp; I donâ€™t have any energy to live another 98 years +. Iâ€™m also freaking out that my birthday is soon. I didnâ€™t want to reach age 25. My dream was to die by then.

Iâ€™ll always wish to be dead and Iâ€™m not planning anything. Itâ€™s not suicidal ideation, but I just wish I could die. I wonâ€™t hurt loved ones so no I think this is normal.

Everyone feels like this at times, right? Iâ€™d appreciate honesty. I know these are normal thoughts that Iâ€™m having. I know that whoever (on reddit) says itâ€™s not normal is lying. Iâ€™ve been thinking about dying since age 11. I just havenâ€™t planned &amp; considered it out until age 24, which Iâ€™m not anymore. I just know this it normal &amp; I would appreciate it if you guys can tell me it is normal.
