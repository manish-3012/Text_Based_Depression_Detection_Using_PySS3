Why is life just varying levels of pain and sufferingIâ€™ve typed up my suicide notes to respective people in my family. I unlocked my phone. The background on both screens is instructions to call certain people first and let them know the news. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Fuck this place. I didnâ€™t ask for this shit.
