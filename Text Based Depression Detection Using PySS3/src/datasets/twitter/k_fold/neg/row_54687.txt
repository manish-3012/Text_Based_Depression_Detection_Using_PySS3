Valentines Day is always so hardLately I've been so down and I feel like I have no one. I have my mom and brother, and that's it. But lately even they don't seem like enough to make me stay. I actually live 7 hours away from them. With Valentines day here it makes me realize how lonely I am. I have no one. I feel like no one cares about me or ever will. Through my whole life it's only been my small family. I have 0 friends. My coworkers don't give a shit about me. I just... want to be loved. I want someone. I can't even describe what I've been going through. The pain is too much and honestly.... I want to off myself tonight. Who would care? My family would get over it I think, and the world would be better without me in it. What can I offer? I'm not pretty. I'm not skinny. I feel like my personality is flat. I can't go on. I don't even know why I'm writing this. I just needed to tell someone. 

I don't know if I want to keep living. I'm sitting here with the razor and I don't know....
