Questions about dying and social mediaJust as a preface, I am no immediate danger, but if I ever happen to give up on life. Are there any places like FB (you know that have a legacy account option)?, or are there any sites where I can send an encrypted file with my passwords? I want my shit inaccessible to my parents, and don't want them snooping on my accounts, so I might give my passwords to a trusted friend.
