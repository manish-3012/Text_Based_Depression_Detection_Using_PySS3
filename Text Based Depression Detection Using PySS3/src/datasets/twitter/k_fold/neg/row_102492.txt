I donâ€™t know if I can do this anymoreIâ€™m 16 years old and Iâ€™m trans mtf 
Iâ€™ve had a great fucking life but since high school started I never knew how much I hated myself
When I was in grade eight I started to hurt myself it got so bad that I never wore short sleeved shirts 
The â€œfriendsâ€ I had at the time told the counsellor that I was cutting, and thatâ€™s when it all came out my mom had now found out everything, Iâ€™m trans Iâ€™m cutting and I donâ€™t want to be alive
I love my mom, she is the best person on earth and Iâ€™m so grateful for all of my families help
People say that family is everything but for me family is too much
I hate being secluded and protected I just want to live my life and be myself with friends and just enjoy it
Iâ€™ve never been able to do that 
To this day Iâ€™ve never been to a party 
Or even been drunk with friends 
I canâ€™t even tell if I have friends anymore 
All I want is someone to talk to
Someone to hug 
Someone to tell me itâ€™s gonna be okay 
Someone to be brutally honest
Someone to take pictures with me
Someone to help me be myself 
Someone to help me be happy 
I know I donâ€™t need anyone and I know Iâ€™m too pussy to ever kill myself 
But I need to know that Iâ€™m not alone 
And yes I know my family could do all those things but thatâ€™s not the same
Family love is often unconventional love
I want to know that if I put myself out there someone can love me for who I am not just because we are family 
I want to know that if I fall down I can get back up again just because of the thought that someone cares
