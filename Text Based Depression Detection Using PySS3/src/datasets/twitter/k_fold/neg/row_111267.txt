I might try againMy name is ben so if yall know a fucker named ben i hope you read this cause im too much of a pussy to directly adress this to my friends and yalls names are being used just to make sure you know how much of a bitch you have been.

I tried killing myself in february and i reciently thought about it again

I feel like its unreasonable, so i try to make it worse so it feels just although i know my life is shit as is

Ive had anxiety my whole life to the point i rarely slept well with my lights on, but i shared a room with my younger brother until a year ago when my parents finally decided im a big boy. Ive been depressed for three and i dont know what started it i was only 10 i didnt deserve it. My may mom think i do.

My mom tells me my anxiety makes me a pussy and â€œ you are 14 in a monthâ€ like that means i dont have anxiety. She tells my dad who i know cares about me that therapy is a waste of money and i dont need it. It would change her mind if i told her what happened in february but i would break her heart and if it does she might still just get mad at me for not telling her sooner.

I wish my parents got divorced. My parents like eachother i wont lie but I think they are lacking in love or they just dont match, to my knoledge they married cause i came along. That divorce would create a finance problem i dont think my parents would be able to handle though. My dad is a firefighter and a csm in the army and my mom is a nurse but she doesnt work often for whaterver fucking reason so that puts a lot of stress on my dad to get a high rank (hes one of the highest in a batallion position) and work extra hours in a low pay job which wrecks him. He also cabbed for lyft but i dont think it was for money but just to get away cause he comes back pissed everytime. I want the divorce to happen cause i am the root cause of many of my parents arguements, thats as far as im going cause it triggers me.

I just realized that finance shit was dumb cause we are fine as is but im keeping it cause backround.

Two years ago in hockey i was at my first practice back from dislocating my shoulder (minor for a dislocate) and after a week i was back. Made sure everyone was going easy on me until the end where this little shit named andy made sure to hit me extra hard in the shoulder, although the wrong shoulder it was the worst pain i ever experienced. Later that night i puked twice, once in my unconsiousness.

That next summer laccrosse was great, i met my best friend davin and had two awesome coaches

Church camp had some great memories i went with my best friend in a cabin of 20 or so mutuals and friends and we did dumb 12 year old boy shit, fun. On the second to last day some one brings in a stickbug who was bouncing side to side. I decide it would be funny to bounce side to side like the stickbug, people were fucking with me like riding me and shit i was kinda annoyed but i expected it. Jake runs up to me and rubs his balls in my face.

School starts. Someone must if brought up the stickbug thing and he started this gay ben thing i didnt hear about it for a while. But there was a different gay ben thing that was between my friends on my bus. I made gay jokes got called gay, i didnt really care until it was all i heard on my bus and it became annoying. I told him to stop and he wouldnt. By then jakes gay ben thing spread and now i was getting called a fag by strangers. I dont care what people say but it was special this time cause i am actually bi. I havent came out yet but my preety much only close friend davin made sure he wouldnt be mad if i was cause i told him the annoying kids wouldnt stop bothering me and it made me question. But i knew i was by then.

Last years hockey was fun, we went to a resort got called a rice honky and a jew there, fun times. But i tried to kill my self in february the straw that broke the camels back was davin hanging out with someone that i didnt like or something. The memory i repressed. I took and handfull of ibprofen and went to bed. I made sure to tell davin everything and that it was his fault. I feel so bad even thinking about it. Luckily enough i woke up and had practice the next day. Davin didnt know what to do so he told a teamate and a friend aiden i took pills. We got into a fight and he said atleast i didnt try to take pills. I was mad i punched him a couple of times but we made up later. He was just as mad as me.

When hockey ended i was already looking forward to lacrosse of this year but school team got cancelled and i didnt feel comfortable playing on my high rank team so all of quarantine i only had my xbox until i reciently got a ukulele. In this time me and davin fell off for a bit so i played with aj and some other people i met on xbox that went to my school. Frankie and peyton were mean to me and aj started to become like them. But i stayed with them, mostly cause at first they were super nice. Depression and anxiety were way off of my mind. aj is starting to get nicer now. But they got mean constantly just telling me to shut up and stuff like that.

That was my first thought of suicide. I was simply alone for a couple weeks but i ask davin for a party invite but things were still wierd but i convinced him. That started to feel good that i was back with him. He was playing alot more with his older brothers brothers friends. I liked them. Haden and ashton were dicks tho. We dont do shit with them anymore. Im still suicidal thanks to frankie and peyton. But id be happy to try playing with blake and aj and cameron and landen.

Thats basically to where we are now i will repost this is a day or so adding other events but i just spent and hour on this and i get my feelings out now. If you read to here fuck frankie and fuck andy.

And if someone i know irl finds this. I want you to know.
