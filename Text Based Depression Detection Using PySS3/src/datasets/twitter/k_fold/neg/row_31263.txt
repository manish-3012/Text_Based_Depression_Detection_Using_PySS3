FailureI'm freakin out. I'm going to fail college, I can't write this last assignment and if I fail I made a promise I would end it all because it's the only chance I'm going to get to do what I want in life. I can't breathe. The last couple of days I've been feeling good but now the pain of how much of a failure I am is back.I was so close to getting to where I want to hopefully help myself feel better even the slightest bit but I can't do it. My heads all over the place. I'm looking at my collection of pills and the urge to take them is so strong right now.
