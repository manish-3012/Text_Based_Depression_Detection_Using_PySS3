My Birthday was Saturday and I wish I killed myself insteadEvery year it's like this: my office despite being a "card" office (everyone gets a passed around card for every birthday/sympathy/baby, etc) never gets me a card for my birthday, not even this year even though everyone knew it was on Saturday. (We've been going in despite the pandemic as our work cannot be done remotely). Then outside of work, I don't have any friends or family to celebrate with. I'm always alone on birthdays and holidays. No one cares about me. I just wish I could at least have one friend to spend time with but no one likes me/cares about me. I just hate my life. It's so empty and I know that no one will ever want me in their life. I'm dreading going in to work because no one will even acknowledge it. I honestly just wish I could get the courage to kill myself but for some reason I just can't bring myself to do it. I hate my life. I hate everything. I just wish I would die. I pray for death every day. I just don't know why it doesn't come.
