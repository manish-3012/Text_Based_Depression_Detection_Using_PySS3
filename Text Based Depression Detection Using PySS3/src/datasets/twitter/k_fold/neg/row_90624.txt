I'm 18 right now, if i haven't accomplished anything by the time i'm 25 i'm going to kill myself.I've never been good at anything. In fact, i'm terrible at most things. The things i'm somewhat good at are either completely trivial or i just don't completely suck at.
I've never had a relationship or kissed a girl, hell, i haven't even _held hands_ with a girl. Ever. 
If i try to get good at something, i just fail at it. And i never improve. 
Since i know i don't have the skills necessary to complete college, i'll never get a job, which means i'll never be able to move out, which means i'll have to leech off my parents for the rest of my life.

I feel like a giant waste of oxygen.
Sure my parents would miss me but they'd get over it.

I'll give myself some time though. Maybe a miracle happens. But if i'm 25 and i'm still on square 1 like now, i'm going to kill myself.

Edit: sorry if it seems like i'm attention whoring.
