reached a new limit last night.i ordered me a proper rope to hang myself with from amazon. i really decided with my lifes results over the last 5 years, that i would end it once it had arrived.   
thankfully this was not an overnight delivery and today i cancelled the delivery. 

its like a siren, its calling and calling me. and i wonder more and more, if resisting is worth it anymore.
