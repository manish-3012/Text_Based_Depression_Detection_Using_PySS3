January 11thI'm going to try to summarize my situation.

I was emotionally and physically abused by my father, neglected by my mother, and poor (no food or heat poor). I was rapped at 15 by my best friend's older brother. I was homeless by 16.

Currently, 25 and dealing with depression for the past 10 years and ptsd for 8 years. I'm in an emotionally abusive relationship (not physical at all). Almost 7 years now. Started out ok but it just gets worse every year. 

I'm still poor. So poor I can't move out and break up with him. My work hours have been cut and I apply for jobs daily. I asked to move in with my mother and she said no. I have no friends to reach out too. 

I'm so tired and sad. There is a fighter inside of me. I've made it through so many terrible things in life. But there has not been enough good in my life to keep me going.

I'm giving myself until Jan 11th until I end it all with my little gun. 

I'm still searching for jobs and online hustles. I will up until my set day. I want to find away to be free of it all. A home/apartment all my own to feel safe in for the first time in my life.
