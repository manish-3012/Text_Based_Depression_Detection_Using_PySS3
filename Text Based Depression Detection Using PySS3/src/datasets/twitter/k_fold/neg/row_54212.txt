i feel really lost.. I moved to a different city, and since I've gotten here things have been going really shitty for me.  I lost my relationship and friends, and I'm having a difficult time adjusting.  I really really feel lonely,  and since i have social anxiety, I'm really sad that I'm never going to be able to put myself out there to meet new people.  
I'm just sick of being so shy and the loneliness that it brings me.  I just go to work, eat, and sleep.  It is really killing me inside not having someone to talk to.
I just want to move somewhere else, being here just depresses me.  
Im just not sure what to do at this point,  I'm really sick of my shyness holding me back.
