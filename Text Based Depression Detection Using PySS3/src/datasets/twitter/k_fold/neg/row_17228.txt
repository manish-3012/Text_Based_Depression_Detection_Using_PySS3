interesting title?i hate how the suicide discourse is generally "but other people love you and they will be so sad when you die" as if i do not already know that? i know that no matter how much i think that i am annoying and a liability i do have some sort of influence on other's lives, and when you die a 'tragic' death everyone wants to paint you as some martyr and you were best friends with people who you couldn't stand. i can't say that when i take my life it won't affect other people, i know it will. and that's the part i hate. "don't die because what about other people" is the approach most people take when someone tells them of their suicidal thoughts. what about me? why should i live in misery for other people? what i want is to die. not only because im so terribly sad it feels like a permanent weight on my chest, but simply because i have lived my whole life. nothing will get better, of this is am certain. people come with expiry dates, and ive reached mine. now all im doing is rotting and making the air around me rancid. if i could blink out of existence, if other people forgot about me, my life, my voice, my face, the moment i died i would take that in a heartbeat. i am tired of my actions having consequences not only for me but for others.
