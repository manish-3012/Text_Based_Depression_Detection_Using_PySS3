41 y/o and never had a girlfriend...want to kill myself.I can't handle the fact that I've never had a girlfriend in my life.  I've tried all the options and nothing seems to work.   I just need to end my worthless f---king life.   Watching everyone coupled up makes me depressed and I can't handle the pain anymore.
