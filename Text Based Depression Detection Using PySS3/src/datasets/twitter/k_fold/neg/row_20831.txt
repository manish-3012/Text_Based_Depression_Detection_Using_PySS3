Contemplating SuicideMeds don't do shit, been hospitalized for suicidal ideation, been getting psychiatric help for a year now...yet nothing changed. I was given the false hope that "it all gets better" but I haven't seen results that improves my life. Honestly I don't think I will last for another year, and I'm desperate to get out of a mind clouded with anxiety and doubts. Fuck, the urge to overdose is really strong, but there's people I still care about... can't choose between life and death :/
