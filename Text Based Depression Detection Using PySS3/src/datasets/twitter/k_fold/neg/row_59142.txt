Romanticizing SuicideWe're all uniquely different. I often dislike myself for being so idealistic, perfectionistic, quite emotional and highly sensitive. I'm an ideal target for bullies, I have years of experience with that. I wish I wasn't so insecure. Like needing validation from others, agreement, approval, sympathy and/or attention. It seems like what a loss would it be for my family. My family is high achieving, realistic, reasonable, diligent. What difference would it make if I kill myself?

My reasons for not killing myself is that it would be cruel to youngest brother. He would be devastated. I'm scared of hell or possibly eternal Oblivion.

I just hate myself. Even though I'm bipolar, I think I'm more borderline personality. I struggle with ruminating, obsessive thoughts, impulses, and rituals. Addictive tendencies

When will this end? Why do I have a mental illness?

I'm not the best with different opinions. I wonder if I think this is hurtful and you do not, whose is right and who is wrong. I'm not the best handling the brutally honest truth, criticism, and correction. 

I do not have to deal my nit-picky know-it-all sister. My curiosity of afterlife will cease.
