Getting ready to leave but unwilling to give up.My best friend sent me a picture of her drawing saying she screwed up. For some reason I went straight to saying 

"when I say I screwed up you say no. now you did nothing wrong with that drawing and you say you screw up."
"nice brush"
"also, don't think will post my art anymore."
"if that's screwed up then I never really did anything right huh" 

what I meant was if she thinks her art was screwed up, mines is definitely way more screwed. She got what I meant, I confirmed it. But she hates what I say and said it makes her feel guilty. I'm so sorry. I really shouldn't have said what I said. She hasn't forgive me and I feel very bad about it. I guess I lost my best friend, and the only friend I could share everything with. 

when I said I don't think I'll post my art anymore, it actually isn't related to anything I've said before or after. I just wanted to notify her that I've decided to stop posting art on Reddit (I deleted all my art and threw away the physical copies already). and I hate myself for putting that as part of the text. I'm so stupid. 

I want to die. I tried to cut myself using a pen knife but every time I'm about to, I remember all the good times we spent together. Now I'm stuck at wanting to die but unwilling to give up everything I've gain so far. 

I don't know what to do. Please, I need some help. I learnt that it's okay to ask for help so here I go.
