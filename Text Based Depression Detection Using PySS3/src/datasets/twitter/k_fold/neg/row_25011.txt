Make the pain stop.I've come here hoping I'd find a convincing argument to keep living. My therapist can't give me one. The suicide hotline can't give me one. There is no reason. 

Every day is suffering. I've tried to find joy. Nothing will exist when I die. My world goes down with me. 

I was born happy, I was trained to be sad. I'm just a broken robot that has no use.
