4 damn years of loneliness, 25 years old and I'm ready to accept my fate.I've tried everything to try and improve my life, Ive tried finding a new job FAILED, I've tried making a friend (YES ONE FUCKING FRIEND AND I FAILED AT THAT) I must be either a really fucking boring cunt or I have this aura around me that just rejects people. I'm fed up with it, 4 fucking years I've been in my own company with every day making me sink deeper into the acceptance that Il never truly be needed and any form of human connection I make is short lived and I'm back to square one again. I just can't anymore, sooner or later I'm going to become another statistic of "highest cause of male deaths in the UK"
