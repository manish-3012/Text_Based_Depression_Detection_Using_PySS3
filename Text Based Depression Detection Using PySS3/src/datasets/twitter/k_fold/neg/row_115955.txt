I don't think I can do it anymore...Hey guys, last year (December 2015) right before I turned 18, I made 3 attempts to take my own life and they all failed. Recently I've been trying to convince myself that I can be happy but I don't see the hope. I almost didn't graduate from high school and I failed half of my classes my first semester of college. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and having to always keep myself alive is tiring and not worth it. I'm wasting supplies and money that could be used for more important things and people. I honestly don't see hope to keep living. I haven't been on a date in 2+ years and I feel like I never belong. It's not really worth it for me to keep living. The only thing that stops me is my younger siblings, I can't imagine how they would feel. But soon I think that even the thought of that won't stop me, I just have no will to keep trying and keep living anymore.
