Grammar is not my thing, i'm from elsewhere 21/M

Well I knew that my life is going to be horrible since seven years old, my father was alcoholic, constant fear in home, constant emotional bashing definitely didn't help me to man up, it made me worse, it made me not who I should be, tho i'm not blaming my father, i'm blaming myself, I am not able to express my feelings in anyway apart from anger and jealousy.You wanna know what the funniest thing is, I dropped out of high-school, never finished it, just couldn't cope up with other people.I was bullied, you know that feeling when someone just pushes you over and over and you are about to explode ? I smashed that guy's face into a brick wall and strangled him - scared the shit out of him, he ran away, I got my point across, he never told a word to anyone, it made me at ease to finally get on with my life and try harder, but I just couldn't do it, shit I was even bullied by teachers, subtle just the way they do, to motivate normal people, well that didn't help, it pushed me into a hole, everyday was a struggle and it still is.Tried to end it all four times now, i'm having some fucked up dreams too, so I just sit here in front of this screen and slowly rot.

When I look back over my life, heh , I laugh, I laugh so hard, it's all a big joke, and i'm the one who's on the stage about to ? choke
