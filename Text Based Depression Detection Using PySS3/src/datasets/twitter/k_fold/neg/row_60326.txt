I was going to kill myself todayI had everything planned. A note, a noose, some pills, and an empty house. I have been thinking about it for weeks and it just kinda feels like something Iâ€™m supposed to do. I am in a weird mental state somewhat akin to a nervous procrastination. I really feel like I should do it but Iâ€™m compulsively keeping busy with random chores. Iâ€™ve already done 4 loads of laundry today and Iâ€™ll probably do some more just to try to keep my mind from wandering. I feel so exhausted even though I got some surprisingly decent sleep but every time I sit still for a moment the thoughts go from a drizzle to a downpour. 

I really donâ€™t want to go on. I am a burden and I hate myself. The only thing holding me back is my family and a good friend. I donâ€™t want to hurt them but the pain is intolerable. I am in mental agony every day and I just want to find peace.
