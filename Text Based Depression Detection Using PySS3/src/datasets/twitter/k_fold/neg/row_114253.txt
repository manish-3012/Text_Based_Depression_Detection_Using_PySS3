10.14I have a great life. I am intelligent, pretty, studying architecture, having the best friends whom i can rely on even in the weirdest times and i have a loving and amazing family. I feel lonely, empty and worthless anyway. I just do not see the point of getting up every day and doing the same things over and over. I want to end my life but i do not really know what type of way. Sleeping pills sound peaceful.
