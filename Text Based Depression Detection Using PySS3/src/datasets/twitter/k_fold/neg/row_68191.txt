Made a promise I don't want to keepI'll start out by saying I know this is ridiculous.

About a month ago, I was in a really bad place. I was struggling with the end of the last quarter at school, I was doing a lot of negative self-talk I was having urges to hurt myself after years and years of not having any of those thoughts. I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night. I was hitting myself sometimes.

I had been late to work, almost always because of the stupid bus system. They're transferring me up to where I live now, but at the time I took it really hard when they pulled me aside and had to tell me I would lose my job if I was late again. If I lose this job, I lose my insurance, I lose any hope of a future where I can have some medical work I need done. I made a promise to myself to kill myself if I was late to work again. Don't show up at all, just, if I know I'll be late, go straight to my planned bridge. I knew I would keep it if it happened.

But I didn't want to kill myself. I decided to just be extra-extra early every day.

On Sunday, I was 3 minutes late. The first bus of the morning was 5 minutes late, the bus driver took forever, and was held up in the tunnel. I had to beg the bus driver to let me off, and I ran 15 blocks to work only to be late.

I felt so guilty for being late, because I knew what I had promised myself. I don't want to die. I've met someone that makes me really happy. Things have been getting better. But now I have this stupid promise hanging over me, and I can't let it go.

I guess I'm just ranting, I don't know where else to talk about it. Gah.
