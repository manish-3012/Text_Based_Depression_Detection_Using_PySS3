I don't know how to go on without herShe is with someone else. My world has fucking shattered. I can't move on. She was my soulmate. She loved me too, I guess she doesn't anymore. 

I have no desire to live anymore. I have no desire to have a life where she is not part of it. I would rather be dead than go through life knowing that I fucked up, it's my fault. She's gone all because of me. I am a fucking piece of shit loser.

If I ended my life, it would most likely make her life better. She wouldn't have to deal with me reaching out. She hates me so much. I just want the pain to stop, it hadn't gotten any better since she left six months ago.

I have the plan in my head now. I know what I need to do. The meds aren't helping. I haven't found a new therapist. The psychiatrist fucked up my last appointment. 

Fuck this life, there is no point in living. She was the most wonderful person alive.

I hope I do it this time. I hope I have the courage to end it. There's no point to this life. We live and we die. Might as well end it now.
