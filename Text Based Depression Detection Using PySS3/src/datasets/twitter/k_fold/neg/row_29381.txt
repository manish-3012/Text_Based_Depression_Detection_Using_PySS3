I want to die so badlyAll the time. Constantly. I don't wanna live with myself. I can't, I fucking can't. I don't wanna allow it. I can't write my name without feeling shame, I can't talk to people without feeling disgusted. I wake up every day with a swirl in my stomach. 

If my mom weren't here I would've done it. I wish I could go though with it, i just live for her. I'm gonna have this constant feeling until I die, just for her. It's gonna be a hell.
