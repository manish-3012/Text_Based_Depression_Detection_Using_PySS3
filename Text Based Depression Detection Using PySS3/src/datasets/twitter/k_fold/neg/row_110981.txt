I have become afraid to dieMy life is in shambles right now, and right now I might have screwed up that I fucked up the only good thing in my life. 

It took so long for me to get to a point were I could be stable, it took so much work and within months it was all gone. Now I am right back were I was 5 years ago. The problem is: I am now afraid to die (*damn you therapy*)

I know where to get a gun. It could be so easy.  I could take it and walk to the fields. And I want to do it. The urge is so strong, but at the same time I know now that that's not how I want to go. I want to live and have a mediocre life. But I am just a fuck up. I am all alone, pushed all my friends away. I think if I continue living I would just have a miserable lonely life. 

I've never had this conflict before. I always wanted to die.
