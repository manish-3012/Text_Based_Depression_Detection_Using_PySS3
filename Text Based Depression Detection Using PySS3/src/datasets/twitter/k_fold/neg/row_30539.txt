My husband just asked me for a divorce and I'm in shamblesI honestly don't know what I'm going to do.  I've been depressed for years but this is the first time if been seriously considering end it.  I have spent years with this man always by his side.  I haven't always been the best husband myself, but I've tried my best through it.  I feel so lost and hopeless knowing I'm not going to wake up tomorrow next to him.  We own a house and neither he or I have anywhere else we can go so we're stuck in the same house until we can figure that out.  I'm currently at a friend's house, but we both (my husband and I) don't want to tell people about it yet so I'm just stuck here until I have to go home to a house to a man that doesn't love me like he used to.  I feel so alone even with people, I'm scared and lost.
