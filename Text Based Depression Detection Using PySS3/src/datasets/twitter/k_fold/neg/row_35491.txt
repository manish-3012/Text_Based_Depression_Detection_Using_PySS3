Has anyone else survived a failed attempt...and now feels pathetic and guilty about it? I can't do anything right, not even kill myself. I feel like I should have done something more foolproof and lethal. That was 3 years ago. I tried again about 2.5 years ago. Again, just another trip to the hospital. I didn't think I'd end up this desperate again but I only have one or two things keeping me here now and I'm starting to not care anymore.
