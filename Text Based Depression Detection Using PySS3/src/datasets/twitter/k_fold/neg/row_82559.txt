I don't see why I should keep on goingI fantasize everyday about being hit by a car, or dying from a hand other than my own. I don't think I can kill myself, but I pray for someone to do it for me. I'm succuessful at some stuff, funny, kind of athletic, and really smart, but I feel like nobody cares. If I bring home a 5 on my advanced placement exam, or made everyone laugh at school, nobody seems to really care. 

I feel like everything I do is meaningless, and despite failing things on purpose or trying to hint about my feelings, nobody notices or cares. I don't have any motivation or driving force, but I desperately want to do SOMETHING with my life. I just can't bring myself to do anything anymore, and am thinking about either leaving or committing suicide. I just feel worthless, like I have no real family, friends, or potential lovers. I just don't know what to do anymore. Goodbye I guess.
