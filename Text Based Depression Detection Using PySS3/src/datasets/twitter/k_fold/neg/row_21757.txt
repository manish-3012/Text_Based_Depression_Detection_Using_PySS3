I don't want to be alive anymoreI'm tired of the CONSTANT anxiety attacks and being on edge 24/7. I'm tired of being alone. I'm tired of having no friends. I'm tired of being single. I've never even been on a fucking date before. I'm tired of being ugly. I don't belong on this planet. I've been told numerous times by people to kill myself because I don't like dogs. Seriously that opinion and other similar opinions I have that aren't even wrong or crazy make people be mean to me. Please don't give me adivce or tell me suicide isn't an option. I'm tired of hearing the same cliches over and over again. Therapy doesn't work I've been in therapy for years. Anxiety medication no matter what I take doesn't work. Currently the best way for me to overcome my anxiety is hitting myself in the head or pulling my hair. Sometimes I'll scream or grunt too and that helps. It helps me get over the current attack but within 2 minutes I'll have another one. The suicide hotline isn't going to help either. That doesn't solve any of my 'problems'. The help I actually need I can't get. I can't get rid of my anxiety. I can't just magically make friends that requires people to like me and for me not to be ugly which I can't control. My face is fucking repulsive. I'm not even fat. I'm not skinny either but I'm not fat. I smell good, I don't wear shitty clothes. I mention all that because I hear about doing those things to change if you have a disgusting face and voice like me. It doesn't change anything though. If your ugly no one cares about you. No one wants to be around an ugly person. I mentioned at the beginning of my post a girlfriend. That would be nice it would be but I'm more concerned about making friends. I don't need a girlfriend but I need friends. I fully expect myself to die alone no matter when I die.
