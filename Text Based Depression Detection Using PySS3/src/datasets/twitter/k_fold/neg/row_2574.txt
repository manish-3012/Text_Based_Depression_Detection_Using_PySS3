I'm not going to get betterI've been getting help with depression and anxiety for at least 6 years now. I was already bad to begin with then my mom, my only support, died unexpectedly almost a year ago now. 

I'm not meant to get better. I'm meant to be passed from facility to facility, program to program. It's all pointless. I'm just fucked in the head and I always will be. I already had depression and anxiety, then watching my mom die out of no where fucked me up even more. Had to do fucking CPR and everything. 

Just got home from my friend's. Wanted to just pick up some speed and run into a tree on the drive home. But I know I can't, I'm too much of a coward. It feels so good thinking about killing myself. I feel like it would feel fix me plus I want to join my mom.
