Crisis Lines?I had overwhelming suicidal thoughts tonight so I used 741741 (Crisis Text Line) because I have no one else to talk to. Our conversation went like this(sorry for formatting):

Counselor: Hello, thank you for reaching out. My name is \*\*\*\*\* and I am here to help. You said that you want to die, are you having thoughts of suicide?

Me: yes i just can't keep living i have nothing to live for or look forward to it's just constant pain and confusion

C: Alright, thank you for your honesty. Do you have a plan for how you would kill yourself if you were to?

M: i donâ€™t know i guess i would try to overdose

C: Do you currently have access to the drugs that you would use to overdose?

M: iâ€™m not sure

C: Do you have a specific timeframe in mind for when you might kill yourself?

M: i donâ€™t know soon i guess

C: Alright, thank you for answering those questions. These things are not easy to talk about but you are doing a great job communicating so far.

M: could i overdose on \*\*\*\*\* and \*\*\*\*\*?

C: How would you feel is we focused on what we can together do to get you the help you deserve together?

I apologize for the typo, "if we focused"

M: there isnâ€™t anything we can do i'm just going to go to bed thank you for listening

C: Sleeping is a good technique to help yourself and sounds like a great plan. I hope that you have a restful night.

Then the conversation was closed by the counselor. This serviceâ€™s goal is to make people feel heard and cared for in a crisis but I feel the complete opposite. I feel more alone than I did before. The counselor takes a long time to reply and it leads to me overthinking even more and falling deeper into the "crisis". Does anyone have any suggestions to these lines? I posted this to r/depression before I knew this sub existed.
