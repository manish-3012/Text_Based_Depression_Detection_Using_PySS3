I really fucked up and I'm really in immediate danger.Context is important.
I recently moved across the country. I'm 17 and emancipated in junior year of high school. I moved to Minnesota near extended family, but I've had a really hard time fitting in. My social life is nonexistent and the combination of work and school stress is killing me. But I recently began treatment for depression and have seen mild improvement with medication.

So onto today. I have settled into a social circle somewhat. They tolerate me most of the time and are generally friendly but it's obvious I don't fit in. I'm from the south, crass, loud, and emotional. They are quiet and reserved. Match made in heaven right?

So today the topic of assisted suicide came up during lunch for a project someone was doing. We went off on a tangent about suicide in general. I asked everyone whether suicide is ever justifiable for someone's circumstances. Someone said "no because family". I retorted with "how selfish is it to ask someone to continue suffering by living just so you don't have to suffer?". I didn't realize two of my favorite people at the table lost their cousin last year to suicide and I just accidentally called them selfish for wishing they were alive.

Ive already had such a hard time fitting in. Now I feel even more caustic and vile, and that the only way to prevent me from being a negative aspect of more people's life is to die or move across the country again. 

Thanks for listening.
