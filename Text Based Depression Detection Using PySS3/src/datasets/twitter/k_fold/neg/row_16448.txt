Want to leave but canâ€™t find a painless way to do it.Iâ€™m a 21F lesbian who just moved to a new city for grad school. Iâ€™m undiagnosed bipolar and have childhood issues that make me seek out relationships with a twisted power dynamic.

My family isnâ€™t supportive of me having a social lifeâ€”they think my entire psyche should be devoted to academics at all times. Last night, I told my grandma (who used to be a better listener when it came to mental health) that I was having the Bad Thoughts and she just got frustrated with me and said that I canâ€™t put her in that position anymore. So I guess Iâ€™m not supposed to tell anyone when Iâ€™m suicidal because itâ€™s a breach of boundaries, which makes it easier to keep to myself and finally do the deed in secret.

I flip in and out of suicidality. Sometimes I think that I should just keep living out of sheer obligation. Sometimes I donâ€™t want to live a second longer. Whatâ€™s the point? I have this nagging belief that humans arenâ€™t capable of real love and what they want is to have power over someone else. I remember some of my happiest moments were in toxic relationships where I was being bombarded with false love, shown off to friends and family, and had this false reality of being someoneâ€™s first choice and favorite person. I donâ€™t think I will ever find real love with a girl and get married. I donâ€™t think my friends or a lover will ever approach me first with affectionâ€”I am always the one to love more and initiate affection.

No one knows meâ€”my family thinks I am a source of honor and success (which Iâ€™m not, Iâ€™m struggling with school every day) and my friends and acquaintances see me as tolerable at best. Iâ€™m tired of loving everyone more than they love me. Iâ€™m tired of having no future. But I canâ€™t think of a way to do it that wonâ€™t be messy and painful.
