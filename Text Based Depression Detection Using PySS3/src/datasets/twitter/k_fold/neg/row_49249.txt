Why do they say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem?I have bipolar disorder and it can be very debilitating. Even on medicine I get into low moods where the only thing I can do is think about killing myself. I can't even get out of bed. It interferes with my professional life as I am a programmer and I need to be able to concentrate and think clearly, which is impossible during low periods. The medicine also messes with my cognitive ability.  

I've been dealing with this for years. I'll live with this forever. This is a permanent problem. I feel like I need a permanent solution.
