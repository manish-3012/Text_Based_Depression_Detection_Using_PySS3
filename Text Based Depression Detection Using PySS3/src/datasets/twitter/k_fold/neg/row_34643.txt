...I realized that I've completely cut off all friends and family. Start to send a text or write an email and stop halfway with a feeling of shame and cancel or delete.

Do people who have felt suicidal for a long time really just reach a point that is like a switch where they are just done and self isolate and thats how things progress or do they sometimes come back without intervention?

I've watch my own progression with suicidal thoughts from the cries for help to the joking about it to giving myself a deadline (once the suicide clause in life insurance is up)

to completely shutting down and no longer talking to anyone friends or family


I've taken time to tell the friends who really made a difference in my life thank you, letting them know that they were some of the best friends that I've ever had. 

I'm seriously considering taking video of myself playing with my kid and telling them just how much I love them and capturing happy memories on video for them.
