My mind's balanceThe way I've been contemplating wether or not I will kill myself for the past few months is that there is a balance in my head. 

On one end is my fear of dying. I'm not afraid of being dead. I don't believe that anyone will be waiting  to judge if my life was just or unjust and have me reap the consequences of what I've sown. I fear for the later joys I may have robbed myself of, for the people who will hurt for years after I'm gone. I must admit selfishly that my deepest fear isn't being dead, but the potential pain of bringing myself to that state.

On the other end of the balance is misery. I wasted my college years drinking. Perhaps there is a deity who judges us, not in the next life, but in this one. Since I pissed away an opportunity that few are afforded, it's probably fair that I'm in my current predicament. I work in a factory on second shift. It's cost me almost all of my friends, but it pays exactly what I need to keep from being homeless or starving. It's the same miserable monotony day in day out. Six days a week. I could tolerate all of it if I lived in a city that never slept so I could experience people more than one day a week. It's the isolation of my small town that really drives the loneliness home.

I'm just waiting on the scale to tip.
