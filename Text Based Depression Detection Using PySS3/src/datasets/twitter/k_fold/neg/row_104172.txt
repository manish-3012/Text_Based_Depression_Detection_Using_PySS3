Toxic father.I can't bear it anymoreMy father is a uniquely distressing person - he does not take anything pleasantly if its not in praise of him .It has been so long we've lived with him I'm 17+ now ( lived with him since birth ) .There's much longer to go maybe 7+ yrs before I can get away from him . Living in tension each day about what might trigger his rage or rant(which if i don't put up with I get the rage) , I'm no good at studies either, no friends or support really and I don't enjoy any subject of thing in life at this point- I'm tired of it .All total life is over for me . 

I'm thinking about asking my mother if she would commit suicide with me -we'd both be free of his burden and that of our illnesses.
