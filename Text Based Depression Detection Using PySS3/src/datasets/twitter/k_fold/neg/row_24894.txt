not making this up. I am banned from the national and local crisis lines.I have to keep talking. But I want things to get better not worse. If i go to a hospital, I will get out in a month or so and be homeless.  I just want to keep talking. To sort this out. I have to keep talking. It is like swimming. If I quit talking then I drown. 

Out of people to talk to.
