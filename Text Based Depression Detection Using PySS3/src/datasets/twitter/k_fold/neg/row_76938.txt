ParentsHello everyone. At this point in my life, it feels as if I am just a bragging point of my parents. A little bit of backstory. I have a older brother that is currently a senior in college at a very respected school. He is very smart and never had a problem in school. He was never really into sports because he was so smart. I am a sophomore in high school and more athletic then smart, Iâ€™m still a A B student but online school is really taking a big shot on my grades. They keep comparing me to my top 15 in his class brother and I just canâ€™t compete. Every time I try and explain to them that online school is hard to everyone they always brush it off and say things like, â€œyour brother wouldnâ€™t have a problem with itâ€ or like â€œI donâ€™t care about anyone else I just care about how your doing, and just as a by the way, your doing bad.â€ I just donâ€™t see what I can do, if anyone would like to comment on what I can do I would really appreciate it. Thank you.
