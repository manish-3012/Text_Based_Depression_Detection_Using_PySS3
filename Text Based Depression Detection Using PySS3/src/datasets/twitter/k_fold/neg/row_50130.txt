Ridiculed for Suicidal Tendencies Rather than Being Provided HelpEarlier today I tried to jump out of a vehicle going over 65MPH and was only stopped by my dad grabbing my coat and pulling me away from the door handle. After the initial scare from it, he said nothing about it at all and continued to berate me about the argument we were having beforehand. 

Later that day I got home and decided to paint my nails because, why not. I was swinging my arms around to make them dry faster and my uncle said, â€œAre you going crazy? Oh, donâ€™t answer that. I heard about you throwing a fit and crying and trying to jump out of the truck.â€ So, I guess my dad decided to bring it up, but it sounds like they made fun of me for it. No â€œAre you okay?â€ , â€œWhy did you do that?â€ or concern of any sort. Iâ€™ve never made an attempt on my life in front of someone, so I donâ€™t understand the pure apathy of the situation.

They say that killing yourself hurts the people you love and is selfish, but holy shit it seems that the people I love are the ones that are killing me ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸
