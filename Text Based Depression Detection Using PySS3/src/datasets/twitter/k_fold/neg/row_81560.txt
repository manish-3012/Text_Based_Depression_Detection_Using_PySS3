everyone would be much better off without memy dad could finally do whatever he wants without the hassle of taking care of me. no one would be sad and they'll eventually forget very soon. no one thinks about me now and I call bullshit if they suddenly care when I'm dead.  I mess up everything nothing seems to go okay. I want to leave this miserable place
