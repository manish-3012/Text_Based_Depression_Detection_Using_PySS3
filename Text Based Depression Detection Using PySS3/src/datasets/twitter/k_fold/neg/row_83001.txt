I cant.I can't do this anymore. I have no one left to trust. the only guy I've ever truly loved is toxic. my friend is more distant from me no one else. my parents fight over me. counseling isn't working. and just so many other things but I'm too exhausted to type it all. but I am kinda ready to end it all. no one seems to love me anymore. I can't go on. and I know right where I hid my last razor...
