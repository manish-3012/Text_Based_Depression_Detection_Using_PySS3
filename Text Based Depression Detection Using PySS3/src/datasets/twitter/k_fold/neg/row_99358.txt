a frustrating situationI experience my urges as a drawn out impulse. They don't come and go very easily -- when they're here, they're here to stay. They manifest as an intense period of brooding and meticulous research and waking up in middle of the night, followed by immediate withdrawal from social circles until I am totally isolated. The thought of suicide ends up being the only thing that can comfort me.

I tried it once. It didn't work, facilities were involved, as were the police. Interestingly enough, I felt as if I had betrayed myself and my body for having tried it: I felt abominable, like a murderer inside my own body, and it took months for me to forgive myself. I told myself I'd never allow myself to go that far, that deep, or that dark again. Turns out I'mÂ  getting there again.

It's a combination of debilitating body dysmorphia, which practically has me housebound, mixed with a very frustrating situation at a potential future workplace. It's being in a body that has been scarred and wrecked, and the possibility that the only dream (or rather, obsession) I've had for years might not come to pass, despite all my efforts. It sounds very plain, the way I'm putting it, but I don't feel particularly safe going into the details. It's living in a body that reminds me of a very painful past, and it's living alongside people who have had it much easier than me, building lives that I'd kill to have.

I don't feel like I'm depressed. I think life is very beautiful. There's so much vitality and joy to everything, and I don't mean that in a saccharine, faux-optimistic way. To lose life is horrible, a grotesque waste. There's so much I still have to see and be present for.

But the frustration and the anger and the despair are getting to me again, the corrosive envy and hatred and the desire to hurt people. The despair is probably the worst: it can get quite overwhelming and violent sometimes. It controls me, and I don't know what to do about it. And it certainly doesn't help that I am partially unemployed and have a lot (read: all) of free time to ruminate and plan and self-hate.

I've tried therapy several times. I loathe the concept. I despise it, it's disgusting to me. It's just something about the idea of someone presuming to know something about me that I don't that is endlessly repulsive. And yes, I know that's not what therapy is supposed to be about, but my animal brain sees therapy as violent invasion and an encroachment and I feel cornered and dissected and it's not something I think will ever work for me. My therapists were good, kind, and capable. That's not the problem. I've been on about ten combinations of psychiatric pills, none of which have worked, and none of which I will ever try again.

I feel like a feral dog trapped in a fire somewhere, constantly whining, and I don't know how to recover from all of this.
