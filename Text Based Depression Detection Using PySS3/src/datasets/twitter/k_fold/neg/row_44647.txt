What keeps you holding on?This is a subreddit for people who wanna off themselves. What keeps you holding on to life? I have struggled hard, and keep telling myself that tomorrow will be better, altough i know it probably wont. Any method i know of will be extremely painful, so i keep telling myself itâ€™s not worth it.
