Can anyone relateThrowaway because this is a ranty post  and I want a safe account to just get all this off my chest. 

Iâ€™m having a hard time with my MH. Iâ€™ve had MH problems for nearly 10 years now. I have a very poor quality of life because Iâ€™ve never been able to access any treatment in the community. Itâ€™s basically just see your CPN every two weeks, see the psychiatrist every 6 months and we will keep shoving you on the waiting list for therapy- which you will never be stable enough to have because you have been branded with bpd. The cancer of all psychiatric disorders. Go me.

 
I donâ€™t actually do impulsive shit or regularly self harm or attempt suicide. But last year I had this terrible depression and I made a fairly good attempt that nearly worked. Was sectioned and all that crap. Nothing came of it. Usual thing; we need the bed, you havenâ€™t voiced anything on the ward, hospital wonâ€™t fix you,  so back to the same old useless shit. 

Iâ€™m still depressed as fuck and itâ€™s not shifting. Iâ€™m getting seriously suicidal at this point. But I donâ€™t even want to reach out because I know what the response will be;
If your saying your suicidal then you have insight. Therefore you are free to chose whatever decision you want. 
You can see your CPN a bit more. Or the crisis team. neither of which really does much to help me personally. I also find they will not ask me about suicide and if I have a plan or date or anything comprehensive. And I feel itâ€™s because they donâ€™t want to know so they donâ€™t have to do anything further.
We can make you an emergency psychiatrist appointment. Which we know you struggle to attend at the best of times but if you donâ€™t take it or miss it then thatâ€™s it. The psychiatrist wonâ€™t prescribe you anything like diazepam or zopiclone because you have bpd and canâ€™t be trusted to not become addicted. Ha. But please take these antipsychotics that you hate that we just constantly mix up in a nice little cocktail that doesnâ€™t solve anything. 
Attend A&amp;E where you will have to wait all night to see the liaison team. Who will send you home with a crisis team referral because youâ€™ve not harmed yourself at this point so your not that serious about suicide. 

Honestly. I know the score. I know services are stretched and I appreciate that. But I canâ€™t get the courage to admit Iâ€™m on the brink of a suicide attempt because they always think itâ€™s just me being a drama queen and thereâ€™s very little that they can do. I honestly feel hospital would be a good idea but they wonâ€™t admit me informally and They wouldnâ€™t have reason to section me because they donâ€™t ask me explicitly how suicidal I am. I feel paranoid about saying â€˜hey Iâ€™m suicidal and x y zâ€™ because I know they will just roll their eyes and assume Iâ€™m trying to manipulate them into admitting me. 

Itâ€™s not getting better. Iâ€™m feeling more and more like there is no hope and I canâ€™t live anymore with this MH shit. My CPN knows Iâ€™m not doin well. I told her last week I had reached crisis point and so did my spouse. But sheâ€™s not made contact in 10 days and I donâ€™t see the point in ringing her to say the same thing. 

I almost feel like everyone knows Iâ€™m a lost cause and is ignoring it on purpose so I actually do them a favour and try again harder. 

Iâ€™m not asking for advice and stuff because I know what I should do. I guess if anyone can relate or wants to share that would be comforting.
