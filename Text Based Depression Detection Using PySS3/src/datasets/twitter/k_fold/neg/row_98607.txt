I don't think things are going to get betterI've been depressed since I was 11 years old, I'm 23 now.  Things haven't gotten better and I don't really enjoy anything anymore.  I've been living for my family, friends, pets, but it just doesn't feel like it's enough.  I've had a couple suicide plans for a very long time, thinking it might finally be time to follow through.  People I've opened up to have always told me that things will eventually get better, but I'm long past the point of not believing that shit anymore.  I just dont have anything I feel like living for, and when I think about it I just get sad and/or angry.  I don't particularly want to kill myself, but I don't want to deal with life any longer.
