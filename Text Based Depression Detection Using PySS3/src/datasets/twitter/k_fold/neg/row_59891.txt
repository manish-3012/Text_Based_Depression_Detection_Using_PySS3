Just feeling downSo I have a history of high functioning depression. I'm a 26 F. Just moved out of my parents home with my Fiance and have been feeling so down and in need of a rant.

I know I'm grieving from moving out of my parents homes. Both of them have majored medical issues including spinal injury and polycythemia vera. I start back to work on the 17th in a huge hospital (ER RN). I have some issues going on at school (in for my MSN) and I'm currently in the tank having only 30 bucks in my bank account because of bills and tuition.

I guess I just thought that this wouldn't be where I would be at my age, I thought moving out would be good from having controlling medical lated parents (days off were never days off between doctors appointments and running general errands for them including tending to our 4 dogs, and 19 chickens) but, I feel just as bad as if I was home. I feel lost, usually having a list of 900 things to do to tending to a home while I'm bored to my wits end between jobs (I've been selling on mercari for some side cash).

It's been rough trying to not let my FiancÃ¨ see these depression episodes as explaining it is less favorable as chewing glass ( I don't like to put my burdens on him) and I know he'll try and force me back to therapy (which isn't as effective as desired because of my refusal to talk about my feelings which you know is my fault)

Tldr Just a rant
