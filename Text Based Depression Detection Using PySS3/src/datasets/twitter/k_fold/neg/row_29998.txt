none of my friends answered my callsitâ€™s 4am where iâ€™m from..the people who said thereâ€™d be there and would answer the phone didnâ€™t answer. Iâ€™m so tired of being there for everyone else but when I need help, nobody is there to save me. The crisis hotline is pretty shit so thatâ€™s out of the question. I may end it tonight..i donâ€™t know. iâ€™ve contemplated this for a very long time and maybe this is just a sign, all my friends have deserted me already.
