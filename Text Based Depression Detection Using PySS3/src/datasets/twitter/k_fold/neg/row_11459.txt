Why are suicidal thoughts addicting?These depressive phases make you feel like absolute shit, but for some reason its also comforting and addicting to think about offing yourself or no longer existing. Why is this so? Why does it feel good to feel so bad? To me, it makes zero sense. Its almost like I get a release of dopamine when I spend an afternoon wallowing in my own self pity.
