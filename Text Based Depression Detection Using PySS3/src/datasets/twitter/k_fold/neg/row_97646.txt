It just seems so easy...I know what it feels like to be on the recieving end of suicide. So, that doesn't convince me to not do it. They'll get over it as I did, well, sorta. And I'm tired of crying. Of having no one to listen. My pseudo lifeline of a boyfriend...almost seems to not....care. So I have no one left. So...why not?
