I just need a friendI feel like an idiot for this but I've hit that point. I feel like ny life is completely out of control and I can't do anything to stop it. I just want a friend, someone to talk to. I'm not expecting you to help but I just need someone to listen and not judge (I guess a little judging is fine I don't care anymore).
I guess all I can tell you is who I am. My name is kait and I'm in my early 20s. I'm the store manager of a jewelry store and I hate where I am. I have a boyfriend, he's nice and we live together I just don't want to jeopardize my relationship with my feelings. I love fashion and design and making anything, even cooking. I'm half vegan but not the crazy kind. I chain smoke and probably drink too much but whatever . I Love American horror story and dead things and unicorns. I don't care if you hate what I like I just need a friend. Anyone. Or just someone listen to me. Help
