I'm sick of online classesI am tired of not doing anything all day, sitting in front of a computer screen too out of my mind to even do my homework. I'm tired of doing nothing during online classes, just staring into the camera like a f###ing donkey. I have not done most of my homework for two months now, and i feel like my head is about to explode. When i AM doing my homework, i can't focus on anything and when my dad tries to help me i'm not even paying attention to what he's saying and we spend a shit ton of time nearly every month/week trying to make me understand my homework while i am not even focusing on what's being told. If i don't pass the 8th grade i'm sure as f##k that i'm gonna kill myself or will end up hospitalized. I don't want to disappoint my family if i don't pass. ADHD is a curse. You guys can't help me, i'm completely f###ed up. I don't know what to do anymore but it doesn't matter. Soon i will get rid of myself and will get the sweet embrace of death. I feel like sh#t doing this because i have so many friends and family that would feel like crap if i killed myself and it hurts like hell to think what they could go through after i die. I don't even know where i will go after i die. Probably i will go to hell anyways. But i'm ready. Whatever i have to face now, i really deserve it.  


I am really sorry by the way. if i waste your time reading this, don't help me. I'm not going to pass. Thanks for listening and i wish you all the absolute best.
