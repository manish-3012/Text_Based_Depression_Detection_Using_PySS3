First thought when I wake up is her.I missed my chance.
We could have been together but I pushed her away.
I didn't pull the trigger and now she's with another man.
Fucked up thing is, I both want her to want me and I don't.
They were together last night while I was alone with a bottle of whiskey.
Sometimes we're our own worst enemies.
