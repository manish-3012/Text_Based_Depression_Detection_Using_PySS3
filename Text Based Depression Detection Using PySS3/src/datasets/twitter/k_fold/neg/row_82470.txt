I was meant to be aloneI should have realised it sooner I was always afraid I will end up like this I dont have any friends literary no one I haven't had a friend for 4 years I dont know why I am like this I feel so lonely I just want the pain to end I never had a gf always wanted one u see movies and people u know in a relationship so happy they r to  have someone to love to talk to I guess I am gonna die alone without experiencing those feelings to be with someone I am fucking hopeless and pathetic I am a disappointment no one likes me no one cares if I die tomorrow no one will give a shit
