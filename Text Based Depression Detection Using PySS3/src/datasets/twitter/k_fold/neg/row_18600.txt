I just want it all to go away I feel like im stuck in a nightmare I cant wake up from and I am so close to just ending it all. I had an attempt 2 weeks ago and unfortunantly I woke up.My two kids are the only reason I didn't try again the next day. I hate the thought of putting them through that but I just can't see a future for me anymore its just one big shit storm after another and I cant catch a break.
