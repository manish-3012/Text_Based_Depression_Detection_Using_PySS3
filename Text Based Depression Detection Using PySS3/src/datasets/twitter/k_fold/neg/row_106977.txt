I'm not selfishWanting to kill myself doesn't make me a selfish person. I always care about everyone, I put others before myself. And even with that they keep saying that I'm being selfish? 

I have tried for so long to change the way I think. To not feel how I feel. But I put others before me, I prefer making others happy. Why am I selfish if I'm trying to save myself or to take care of myself for once? 

I don't get it. I love the people that supports me, but don't tell me that I don't care about you just because I want to kill myself. Make it stop.
