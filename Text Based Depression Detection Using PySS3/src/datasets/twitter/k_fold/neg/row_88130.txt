I don't deserve to be alive.Sure, everyone should get to experience life. I have, and I've fucked it all up. This is the 6th shift of work I've missed, and soon they're probably going to fire me. Sure the first half was because I genuinely had a stomach bug, but now it's just my poor mental health. My boyfriend is probably going to yell at me when he gets home because he works his ass off, and I'm here broke, and better off dead.
