How do i stop feeling like i want to dieI am just a burden to everyone i meet, half of my friendships are hinged on the fact that i want to die and my friends are just nice people who dont want to feel like my blood is on their hands, I do not know how to be normal and how to be happy, I fail at most things i do and the main reasons i havent killed myself yet are my parents and the fact that i am scared i have not done enough yet. I dont know what to do, I am always sad and cant focus on anything. Ive tried to get professional help and it has always gone badly. i'm sorry for bothering everyone. I hope i die soon
