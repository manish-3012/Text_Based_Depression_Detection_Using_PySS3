Shut the fuck upShut up with your cardboard cutout bullshit phrases you know you arent helping. Everyone is so fucking annoying . Can't reach out to anyone it's either the generic "ooo it's not worth it keep this shit going for the sake of it etcc" or whatever pointless worthless pixels on the screen or "suicide is the biggest sin something something Allah something something you'll get buried near the roads like a dog instead of cemeteries". Can't reach out because I'll get hospitalized &amp; stain the family reputation or whatever caveman BS. If "everyone has had a hard time" then how come no one understands your shit? STFU. So useless and annoying. Don't try to write generic shit .you aren't there for me. I won't talk to you. I don't need help I know what I'm supposed to do. fuck off
