it's over.i can't do it. i spent five years fighting depression alone and unable to reach out for help when help somehow came to me through some miracle before leaving within another two years. it won't happen again. i'm alone now. i have nothing to look forward to in my life. i spend so much time thinking of what could have been if i hadn't ruined it, but i don't even know what i did to destroy everything other than just having no redeeming qualities, but that was always the case and she put up with it for two years. the pain i feel just existing alone like this is something i refuse to believe is anywhere near normal or anything that almost anyone else will have to ever experience. every time i think i've reached the bottom i get proven wrong the next time i break down and want to die more than anything else. i don't even want to post this with how melodramatic it sounds, but i can't think of any other way to describe it. i don't even have a real reason to feel this way; it's been months and i should be done doing any grieving. the only reason i'm so stuck on the relationship i had is because she actually made me happy just to be around. i'm tired of existing like this and it won't get better. the only direction everything has ever gone without her is down. i don't even know why i'm posting here; i guess i just want to hear someone at least feign caring since no one i actually know will now that i've frustrated any that wanted to help with how unable i am to benefit from it.
