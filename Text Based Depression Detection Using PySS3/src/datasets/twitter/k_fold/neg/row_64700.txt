Student loan debt and lonelyI made the grievous error of going to law school and accumulating hundreds of thousands in debt. I recently graduated and am looking for a job while waiting for bar results, but even if there's a slim chance that I pass I will still have no means to pay it off. I don't think I make a good attorney -- I'm socially incompetent and get flustered when given simple assignments. Any job I acquire I'll surely be fired from. 

This would all seem like nothing if if I felt like I had more of a social network. Last year I lost my best and only friend due to drug induced psychosis. I recently tried to reach out to her parents to see how she was doing and received no reply. I've lost other friends because of the person that I was, and although I believe I've grown the memory of those friendships still haunt me. I wake up from very vivid dreams where these people are still in my life and I didn't make any mistakes.

For the past hour I've desperately been trying to find a way to acquire nembutal or some guaranteed painless form of suicide, but to no avail. I just don't want to exist anymore with my pain and lack of social grace, and yet somehow I fail at that as well.
