It was a lie, it didnâ€™t get better. It probably never will.â€˜Itâ€™ll get better.â€™ 

Words that have been repeated to me since I was 13 years old. For a while, in my teens, I believed it. One day I would be rid of this awful disease of the mind and it would be better. Even on my worst days, I would tell myself that this was temporary pain. I believed I could get therapy with easy access. I believed medication might provide some release. I believed going to A&amp;E would finally get me the help I needed. 

But itâ€™s just gotten worse. And now I just want out more than ever. 

To me, itâ€™s not just my own life which is getting worse, but the world in general. People are dying because they canâ€™t afford food or healthcare, disabled and mentally ill people like myself are cast aside and left to rot. The planet is dying and the people who can help simply do not care. 

Fuck your â€˜raising awareness.â€™ Sod your â€˜reach out and talk.â€™ What do you think Iâ€™ve been trying to do all these years? Iâ€™m sick of the corporate and government jamboree about mental health, when services are underfunded and employment rights are breached. With your 6 month waiting lists and 101 appointments and being told by everyone you talk to you have to get in contact with someone else, how the hell are people supposed to get better? 

Iâ€™m so fucking done with this world, the selfishness and how isolated it can be not being able to find a foot in this sick capitalist dystopia. My next attempt will be my last.
