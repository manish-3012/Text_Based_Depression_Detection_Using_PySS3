IM GIVING UP READ ME sorry for grammar and I'm kinda writing off my head all over the placeI've been living with my aunt uncle and grandmother since I was a child because my parents were addicts and still are sadly . I've always been emotionally abused by my grandma idk if she was playing but it hurt me always saying oh yea they don't want yea and she would hit me and mostly only me I was here punching bag as a little kid . But she died two years ago and I miss her because she was really nice towards the end . So the past two years have been rough my aunt and uncle nonstop say the meanest most horrible stuff to me everyday I can't catch a break . I've been kicked out of the house multiple times one time they threw all of my clothes out the front door an I just sat on them and cried like a pussy I begged to get back in . My uncle has given me a black eye my aunt has got me in the corner and stomped me they just make me feel weak . Just more recently they've been even harder on me I can't focus in school or in my life I have no friends I'm sad literally all the time . I've been constantly looking for a job to get out of this hell for a little bit but It's not working out but I'm sure giving it time something will come through . I've told my dad about what was going on he just flips out and says well this is gonna just drive me to drink . He's an alcoholic so I don't want that it sucks because my dads just as unstable as me . I'm 19 will I see 20
