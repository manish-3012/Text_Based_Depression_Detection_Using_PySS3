i can no longer go on.I can no longer take anymore criticism from my mother. I can no longer hear another word of how useless i am every single day. I can longer live with her comparing me to others. I can no longer stand my father ignoring me. I can no longer stand the tone of voice when my father replying anything I was saying like I am an eyesore. I can longer tell myself to stay alive for my family. I can no longer believe there is another way out. I can no longer seeing my friends leave my side one by one. I can no longer imagine life if I ever find a job and move on. I can no longer imagine life getting better. I can no longer say I love myself. I can no longer trust any professional counseller, psychiatrist, nor psychologist which i met all three that judged me and given me and my condition a name within 3 minutes of meeting me, without me telling them anything, everyone was in it for the money. There is no more hope. I am just waiting for someone to tell me to die so I can finally do it. 
I have been imagining hanging myself and stabbing myself a lot more frequent. I used to think of ways of killing myself with lesser pain, but I no longer do, as long as it kills me, I don't think I would mind the pain. I don't know what and why I'm asking. 
I have seen people who claim to want to help only to be leaving sooner then I expected. I want a reset, but I know there isnt and wont be one.
