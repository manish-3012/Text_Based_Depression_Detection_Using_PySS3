I need helptwo days ago my fiance said her feelings have changed. We were supposed to get married in august, were together 2.5 years before this. She is my best friend and the love of my life and now shes completely excommunicated me. She said i didn't do anything, that it was all her, and that she needs to do this to feel "right". All of my life plans and aspirations were involved with her. Im 23. I feel completely alone now and cannot get any feeling other then the most intense anxiety and pain from anything. I cant see any good reasons to keep living in this pain. Im so early into it, i feel like im going to hurt this bad forever. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety when I was in my teens. I didn't ever feel normal until 3 months ago when i finally found a good medicine. I feel like this has undone everything. I feel my entire life is ruined. I am back to square one and I would rather just kill myself then try to put these pieces back together. I dont think i can put these pieces back together. If i can ill be a broken person. I dont understand why i would want to live like this/through this. I really dont want to die but I see no other way a to get away from how bad I feel. I feel like how bad I feel will kill me anyway, so i might has well just get it over with. Please someone help me.
