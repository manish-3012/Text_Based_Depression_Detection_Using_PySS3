Struggling with the idea of being forgettable.I'm a 25 y/o man that has always struggled with the idea that people can easily forget me. Get over me and just never come back. Its like a record that keeps playing in my head, always saying "They will never come back". And it has mostly been true, for friends and boyfriends. It especially hurts with boyfriends. I've never had one come back and say: hey, I wish I could get back with you again. And in the gay world, its very common to see ex's at least hook up again. But not for me. I just feel like its easy to leave me in the past, but for me, it is so hard to leave something behind and never look back.

So, what if I just left already and nobody would even notice I'm gone?
