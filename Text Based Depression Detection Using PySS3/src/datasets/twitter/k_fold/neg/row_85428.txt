33 year old virginMy suicidal thoughts are coming back again. I had a trigger just a few hours ago driving a van full drunk women from a concert at a ski resort. 

Many years ago I accepted that I'm simply not likeable and instead of pursing women I'll stick to my hobbies (skating, snowboarding, gaming, volunteering). At the moment I'm s snowboarder that volunteers to drive ski/snowboard trips.  Most of the attendees are women. As we were driving back the women were being weird and oddly flirty but in a joking way. You see all these women are in relationships so it was messing with my head and it triggered my suicidal part of my brain.

As soon as I got to my room I Googled "easiest ways to commit suicide", which eventually lead me here. I can't stop thinking of how useless I am. I know what most people are gonna say, but that positive thinking bullshit doesn't cure virginity or shyness. Typically if I feel worthless I'll go skating or play videogames and drown those thoughts out but I'm stuck in a hotel in another country surrounded by snow.  Should I just get a hooker and get it over with?
