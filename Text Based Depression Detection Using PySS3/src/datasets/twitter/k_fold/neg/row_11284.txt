I'm actually a bad person.As much as I've tried building up my self esteem it's no use. Everyone hates me. I'm self centered. Selfish. Mean. Hateful. Ungrateful. Childish. Empty headed. Too short too thin. Skin color isn't right. Voice is like nails on chalkboard. I have weird fetishes. I'm too different. Not unique. Insecure. Friendless piece of shit. My family doesn't even talk to me. No one loves me. I don't love myself. I want to die.
