I really don't know how much longer I can take everyone's bullshit.My parents say that I'm useless and I mess up everything. My friends say that they were never really friends with me. My sister hates me for existing. And I hate myself for not killing myself 3 years ago. I think I'm just going fix that mistake today or tomorrow. Im done. Life is just not worth the effort.
