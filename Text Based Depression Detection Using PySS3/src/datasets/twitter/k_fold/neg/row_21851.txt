The only reason I'm still alive is not wanting to hurt othersI'm 20, a trans girl, a uni student, and a total failure.

I'm going into my third year of what should be a four year degree, but I've failed so many classes that it'll probably take me six.

I've been depressed for over half of my life, and came close to ending it more times than I can count anymore. I've had suicidal thoughts for at least 12 years now.

For the past 8 months I've been struggling with an illness that has left me with, among other things, constant pain, no appetite, nausea, and I've lost a quarter of my body weight in the past 5 months. I've had over 15 doctor's appointments so far this year. They currently are trying to rule out cancer. Neither my friends nor my family know this.

My parents don't approve of my transitioning, and blame my condition and my declining mental health on the fact that I'm trans. They say they told me so when, after I came out to them, they told me that it would be the biggest mistake I'd ever make in my life. I told my mother a few years ago that I was feeling suicidal. She cried, I ended up consoling her. I never brought it up again.

My friends are amazing. They're the most wonderful, sweet, kind, caring people I could ever hope for. I... I can't bring myself to tell them how bad things are. All they know is that I'm 'sick'. They already worry so much about me. I don't want to make them worry more by telling them the full story.

I have literally everything I'd need to kill myself within five feet of me. I just don't want to hurt my friends. If there was some way that I could kill myself without hurting them, I would. They don't deserve it. They don't deserve to have to deal with me. They don't deserve to be hurt when I die, either. They're the only reason I haven't. I almost hope it is cancer so that I'll be able to die without hurting them as much as killing myself would hurt them. I almost wish I didn't have a reason not to go through with it.
