I have 8 days and 58 minutes left.I just wrote part one of my note. Coming to this decision has been so freeing. Nothing matters anymore. I donâ€™t have to worry about my future and how I will make ends meet (because nothing happens when you die and god doesnâ€™t exist.) 
Donâ€™t send me messages, Iâ€™ll just block you. I just want to get these words out of my mind. Also, it may be interesting to anyone who studies my suicide. 
Itâ€™s quite rare for women to choose a method that basically guarantees death, and I havenâ€™t found a study yet on female decapitation. Coming to this decision has given me peace, donâ€™t ruin that for me. Thanks.
