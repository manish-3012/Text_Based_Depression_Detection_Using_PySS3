Just found this subLinked here from /r/depression, and I have to say that so far, this is one of the most toxic, cold, and uninviting mental health subs I've been on. Dozens of posts go unanswered, and even un-upvoted. The first comments on the first two posts I opened were accusatory and "tough love". I don't know if there's anybody subscribed here that's supposed to actually be helping people, but if there are, you should be ashamed of yourself.
