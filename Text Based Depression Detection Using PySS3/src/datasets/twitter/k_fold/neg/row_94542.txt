Are some people just not capable of long term happiness??Itâ€™s Christmas and Iâ€™m not even excited. I have a loving family that I feel like I donâ€™t deserve and I donâ€™t even want to receive presents from them because I know Iâ€™ll feel guilty for having received anything at all.

Why am I like this? Why is my only happiness momentary.

TLDR; I want to die and Iâ€™m also genuinely curious if some people can just not be happy. 

Also Merry Christmas guys, take care of yourselves and have a great day
