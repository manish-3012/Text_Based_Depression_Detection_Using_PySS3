And again...There I was, tweeting about WSPD, but actually thinking of doing it. 

I'm having the worst weeks of my life and I was begging for emotional help from my loved one. I only want understanding for all the mess I did and tried to fixed but they made me felt so alone. I wish someone would just open my brain and change it. It feels being bipolar is a sin.
