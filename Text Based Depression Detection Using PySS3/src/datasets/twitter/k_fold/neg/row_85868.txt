Hate living a double lifeOn the outside im cheery, funny, fun to talk to, a little shy and soft at first and prob look stupid to many as well. No one suspects anything about me is the point. 

But at night its the opp. Suicidal thoughts and crying every night. It hurts. Worst part is I have NO ONE to talk to. Dumped my bf bc i cant handle relationships and its for the best..i cause more pain than pleasure.

Just a little thing i wanted to share..
