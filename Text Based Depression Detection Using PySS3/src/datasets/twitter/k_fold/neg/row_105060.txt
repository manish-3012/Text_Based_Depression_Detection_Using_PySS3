I ripped up my diaryI couldn't stand looking at it anymore. I didn't know what else to do with it, and today I just got so angry with it that I ripped the notepad to shreds. And I think someone in the library looked at me but I was just so mad that I didn't fucking care what they thought, and I just walked back to my car feeling relieved after ripping that old notepad apart. I'm just so tired and out of steam and I'm not even going to bother describing my diary because it's too painful. I just wanted to rip it apart so badly, and now it's gone and I just want to act like it never existed.
