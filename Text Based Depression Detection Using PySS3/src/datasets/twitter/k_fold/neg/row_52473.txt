Wondering if it will ever go away. I've had serious mental health struggles for about 10 years now (diagnosed as a teen). I have gone through harder and easier periods. Now is a harder one, though I feel like the mask has been holding up well. I always believed so much in "fake it till you make it". It actually worked for a long time. But at least once a month for the past year, I find myself thinking "if I had access to a gun, it would be pressed up against my temple without question". It's so serious, I know if we owned one I would have been dead a long time ago. I don't *really* want to die, none of us do really, but it's far too difficult to keep carrying on. I do it for others, I do it because I know I would fail and it would just draw more attention to me that I don't want. As miserable as I am, I'm happier being miserable in silence and having everyone think I'm doing well. 

But these thoughts. They won't go away. It worries me that I think about it so seriously. I'm not one for meds, the side effects have always been worse and they are not compatible with another prescrip I have to take anyway. Therapy has been a bust every time I've tried it since I was 19. I keep thinking it's going to creep up and just explode out of me onto the wrong person at the wrong moment. 

Part of me does wish we owned a gun, because then my mind would be quieted.
