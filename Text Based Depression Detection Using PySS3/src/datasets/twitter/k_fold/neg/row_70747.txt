I don't know how to get helpI am in therapy and told my therapist that i felt very suicidal. i've been depressed for awhile now and all i do is sleep and think about killing myself. i honestly don't want to be dead i just want to feel better or not feel anything. he first asked me if i could stay safe for a couple of days to set something up. i told him i'd be safe for a few more weeks cause i need to be there for something for a family member and then after that all bets were off. 

then he just started talking about taking walks outside and doing stuff like that to feel better. i got so annoyed and just felt like he wasn't listening... like he doesn't know how desperate i feel.. i don't know how else to tell him. i need some serious, heavy duty inpatient therapy right now or i'm not going to make it.. i'm starting to feel like the only way to get help is to attempt suicide. i sliced my arm up pretty good today because it helps to take some of the pressure off...  i'm worried about how easy it is to lose control doing that.

i left my therapist's office feeling like he's mad at me now. i don't know what to do :(
