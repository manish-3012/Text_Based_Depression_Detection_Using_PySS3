Couldnâ€™t cross post. Iâ€™m trappedI canâ€™t go to work tomorrow, unless I make up a story about being choked or some shit. I donâ€™t feel relief. I feel like I just meant to suffer. 

I left work bought a 50â€™ rope and headphones. I watched a YouTube video about tying a noose. I wrapped the rope around a beam pushed the latter away and it felt like barley a moment and the rope snapped, now thereâ€™s a visible spot on the ceiling where the rope was and my neck is fucked up. I have a .22 rifle but Iâ€™ve met someone who survived a 9mm to the head.

I canâ€™t take existing any longer. What do I do
