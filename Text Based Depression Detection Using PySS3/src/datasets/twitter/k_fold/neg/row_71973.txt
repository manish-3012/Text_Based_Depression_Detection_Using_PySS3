You ever find that suicide is quite comforting sometimes?I watched the documentary called â€œThe Bridgeâ€ (on YouTube) about people jumping off the golden bridge and it gave me a sort of happiness and relief...that I could go there and simply jump off and I would die just like that without really processing the pain. I feel so motivated to go there and do it, itâ€™s giving me adrenaline.

I also find it quite â€œromanticâ€ (I think thatâ€™s the word) knowing the fact that Iâ€™m leaving the world behind me and likely never being able to experience what the world has to offer ever again. It almost feels like I get to go in a different dimension while everyone is stuck on earth.

Ngl I feel quite pumped and happy right now.
