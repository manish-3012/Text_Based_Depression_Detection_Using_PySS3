Iâ€™m the biggest loser I know34 years old, live with mother who is ill, dead end job, canâ€™t drive, no money, no skills, no qualifications, stupid, no motivation, no attention span, lazy, worthless.

What is the point in living when my life is like this? I am a loser inherently and by execution.

The worst part is I have a girlfriend who lives me very much. We met in a different country a few years ago when I spent up an inheritance and pretended to her I have a better life. We have been together several times since but she lives in a different country. We speak to each other everyday and she has been completely devoted to me and she is pain being apart from me. She wants to come for me and has been trying to get a visa but I canâ€™t make it work. I have lied to her about pretty much everything in the first paragraph except my age.

I have been trying to stall things but Iâ€™ve ran out of excuses. The truth is just too painful to tell her. She is the only thing keeping me going and she has said if I leave her she would kill herself. I am a coward but this has gone on too long and the consequences of the truth being revealed seem very severe. If I could just die this miserable existence would be over.
