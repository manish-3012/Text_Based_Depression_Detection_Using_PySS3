Why have I failed at life?Why has my life turned out the way it has? I am 17 years old and have never had a job. My 15 year old sister recently got one at a pizza place. I have never bothered to go for my learners license and all of my peers have already moved onto their full license. I have never had a male FRIEND, let alone a romantic relationship. I will not be graduating high school because I dropped out in 8th grade due to anxiety. My cousins don't bother to keep in contact with me, yet they do with my sister. My old friends stopped talking to me after my anxiety got worse. 

Why was I cursed to be mentally ill? Why the fuck do I have random symptoms that ruin my life? I'm tired of this all. I'm fed up with the constant daily nausea and never being able to do anything because of it. I'm tired of CONSTANTLY worrying about every single thing. Doctors have been unable to help me, i've been in hospital 6 times. They either say i'm being overdramatic or they don't know what to do for me. 

I currently haven't left my house in almost a year(Last September). I have nowhere to go and I wouldn't want to leave anyway because of the symptoms. 

Why is my life so shit right now? Why are things like this? Why the fuck do I go through this 24 fucking 7? All I do is lay in bed on my computer because I can't do anything else. Christ, help me.
