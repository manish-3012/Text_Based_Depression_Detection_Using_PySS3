My Dad needs helpOn a October night, my mom decided it was time to leave my father, and he wasn't ready for it, he had been a good dad but not a good husband, and he's taking it roughly. Since October I've had to call 911 several times due to his suicidal thoughts. And it's only been getting worse even with treatment and such, to the point where he wants to help people in Syria, but not to help, but so I can say my dad didn't kill himself the terrorist did, and I don't know what to do with him. He says he feels useless and that he can't provide for me and let alone himself, he has no one but me and I'm afraid that soon I alone won't be enough and one day I'll come back from school and I'll find the dreaded note, wishing me well and saying goodbye. I know it's not me that's suicidal but this is the one of only place I can look for answers. Thank you if read this
