Girls who can't speek for themselvesAs the title says I hate those kinds of Girls now, today meant to be a fun night out with a couple of friends combined with the challenge to speak to as many girls as possible (obviously I am a introverted guy posting on this subreddit), I had nice conversations with most of the girls I spoke with but one, I was particularly fond of seemed to be interested. I took the leap of faith and spoke to her, she seemed interested in speaking to me so I stayed and kept on talking. Almost an hour later a one of her friends send me away, struck by disbelief I looked at her and all she did is nodding. This was the first time I wanted to harm someone, this guy who thinks what's best for her. Never in my life was I so enraged. The reason I post this here is that I normally don't want to harm anyone but me. It's the first time I honestly tried to speak to someone and got just rejected by a third party. I am so sorry if this doesn't belong here.....
