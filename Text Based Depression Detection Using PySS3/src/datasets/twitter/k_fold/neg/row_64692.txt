Is it ever okay in your opinion to be just done in life?I have an extremely rare condition which means I am completely normal yet unable to smile. It's a curse and a particularly cruel one to carry. I have this because my Mom took drugs when she was pregnant. 

I have struggled working 11 hour shifts 5 days a week. I was going to be a Dad at one point but my GF and I lost the baby before being born. My current GF is driving me further into a pit of dispair. 

I feel at this point, I have never actually known what it is to be happy. Being happy to me is not being hurt in that moment. I've been burned, stabbed, cut, spit on, stamped on and hurt in every way I can imagine. I kept going every day till this point and I feel I can no longer go on. Can enough be enough and calling it a day on this earth be the right option?
