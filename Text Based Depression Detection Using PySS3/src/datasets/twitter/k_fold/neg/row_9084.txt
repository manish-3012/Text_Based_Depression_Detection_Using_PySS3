IAmA Gay teen who had depression w/ suicidal idealations and a plan, was sent to a hospital for 16 days, and have been 'better' for three+ years, AMA.Basically, I'm here for those of you who are considering suicide or are extremely depressed. I was bullied at school, was beaten a few times. I had weight-related issues as well, and was tormented for that. I guess I'll answer whenever a question comes up. I'll be on early tomorrow morning (6:00 EST-ish) and then again in the evening. You can PM me, or just drop a comment.
