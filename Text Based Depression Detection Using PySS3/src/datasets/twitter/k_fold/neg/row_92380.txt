I can't do this anymore2017 was the worst year of my life. I lost my girlfriend of 5 years, all of my friends, failed my senior year of high school, failed a suicide attempt, and was medically declined being able to march in the professional marching band I tried out for. I'm 17 and I recently broke my back but have been slowly recovering. Ive been through so many serious injuries that I feel like I'm living in the body of a 100 year old man. I'm broken. Physically and mentally. Those that I'm forced to call family always take advantage of me because ill do anything anyone asks because I'm a nice ass person and I have a huge heart but nobody wants me unless theyre trying to take advantage of me. I have multiple methods I'm going to use at once. I'm not sure when I'll do it but it'll be soon most likely. Its a shame really. I'm very educated and very good at multiple trades. I know it may not sound that way because of my not graduating last year but that was just because I was so depressed I couldnt do any work. I dont know what to do anymore. I dont get why everything is crashing down around me. My parents told me I have to be out of the house by next week. I dont have a job because no one is willing to hire a 17 year old dropout. I dont have anywhere to go. There's no reason to go on anymore. I'm probably going to be dead within the next week. If my resolve is strong enough ill do it tonight but I'm not 100% sure that this is the correct decision. I have everything prepared so that if I decide to do it I can immediately do it without hesitation. Attached is a poem I read every morning And every night. I thought that a thread like this may appreciate it as much as I do. I'm really not a big fan of poetry but this poem I love. Anyways.... When Tomorrow Starts Without Me by David Romano(maybe)

When tomorrow starts without me,
And I'm not there to see,
If the sun should rise and find your eyes
All filled with tears for me;
ï¿¼Â 
I wish so much you wouldn't cry
The way you did today,
While thinking of the many things,
We didn't get to say.

I know how much you love me,
As much as I love you,
And each time that you think of me,
I know you'll miss me too;
ï¿¼Â 
But when tomorrow starts without me,
Please try to understand,
That an angel came and called my name,
And took me by the hand,

And said my place was ready,
In heaven far above,
And that I'd have to leave behind
All those I dearly love.
ï¿¼Â 
But as I turned to walk away,
A tear fell from my eye
For all my life, I'd always thought,
I didn't want to die.

I had so much to live for,
So much left yet to do,
It almost seemed impossible
That I was leaving you.
ï¿¼Â 
I thought of all the yesterdays,
The good ones and the bad,
I thought of all the love we shared,
And all the fun we had.

If I could relive yesterday,
Just even for a while,
I'd say good-bye and kiss you
And maybe see you smile.
ï¿¼Â 
But then I fully realized,
That this could never be,
For emptiness and memories,
Would take the place of me.

And when I thought of worldly things,
I might miss come tomorrow,
I thought of you, and when I did,
My heart was filled with sorrow.
ï¿¼Â 
But as I walked through heaven's gates,
I felt so much at home.
When God looked down and smiled at me,
From His great golden throne,

He said, "This is eternity,
And all I've promised you.
Today your life on earth is past,
But here life starts anew.
ï¿¼Â 
I promise no tomorrow,
But today will always last,
And since each day's the same way
There's no longing for the past.

You have been so faithful,
So trusting and so true.
Though there were times you did some things
You knew you shouldn't do.
ï¿¼Â 
But you have been forgiven
And now at last you're free.
So won't you come and take my hand
And share my life with me?"

So when tomorrow starts without me,
Don't think we're far apart,
For every time you think of me,
I'm right here, in your heart
