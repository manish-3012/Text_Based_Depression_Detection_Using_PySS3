I'm really tired of life...So, recently, I'm going through a pretty rough patch. I got into an argument with my pal of a clique, left the Whatsapp group chat, and basically the clique fell apart after it. Some of them still continues to live without any issue, while I'm here crumbling apart. 

I have NEVER EVER attempted suicide or cut myself, but I have constant and recurring thoughts about it. Why am I still here? I can't take it anymore, nobody cares, etc. 

School is a getaway for me, where I put on a facade that I'm fine, joke around and all. I sleep A LOT and use it as an escape, and once i wake up, it's back to reality again...

It was only this year that I became more depressed and started having unhealthy thought patterns. 

I don't really have much more will to live, I see no purpose, I feel alone, empty and lonely.
