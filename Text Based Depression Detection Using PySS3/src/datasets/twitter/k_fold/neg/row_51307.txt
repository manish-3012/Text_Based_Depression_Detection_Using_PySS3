How do people do this "life" ?Maybe I'm just pessimist but this world is so fucking bleak. Love is so hard to find because people are selfish scum, cost of living is so high you can't even live comfortably..even with a fucking degree. And us young people may not even have retirement in our future the way everything is going. It's so fucking bleak. I see no good aspect to this life unless you're fuckinf filthy rich, if you're poor and have mental/physical issues, it's fucking torture.
