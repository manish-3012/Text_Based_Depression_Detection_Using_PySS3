will someone pretend to be my bfI know this is pathetic but I just want to feel loved. I a lot of mental issues and can't be in a real relationship. 

I know its not real i'd just like to pretend and feel what its like. 

I won't be killing myself if nobody does it. I'm just having a rough night and the thoughts are there but I won't act on them.
