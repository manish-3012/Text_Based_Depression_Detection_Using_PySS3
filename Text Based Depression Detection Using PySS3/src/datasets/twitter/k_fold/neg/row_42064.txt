Guilt re: surviving an attempt after being clinically dead five years ago &amp; wishing it had workedI have really severe C-PTSD... it basically functions as a brain injury with mental illness features. And I finally got to do EMDR therapy and stuff and I'm the best I've ever been in understanding and grappling with it all. But I'm homeless for the sixth ish time in my adult life. And I'm just so tired. I can't find a job, it's been almost a year. I need to spend like $100/wk on chiropractic stuff to bare minimum not be in pain. I live on couches and floors and beg for money every day. I'm turning 30. It's hard to see the point. I tell other people to not give up but it feels stupid at this point. There's no way out of this broken system. It feels like the second I was born the way I was to who I was it was over. I don't want to feel like this every day.
