Im just in bed, itâ€™s 2am, got a exam at 8am. Listening to music, donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m just tired, you know of like everything. But itâ€™s g. Iâ€™ll be fine I think/hopeIâ€™m 17, 18 in like 1 month. Everyone expects me to do something with my life. But Iâ€™m gonna be honest, Iâ€™m just strolling through, doing nothing so bad I stand out or so good I stand out. Every if Iâ€™m the best at what I do. Yeah yeah up myself. Ha ha. But Iâ€™m just doing that so I donâ€™t get attention, Iâ€™m slowly cutting off ties with my friends. I getting rid of social media. Well done that. I have reddit tho I guess, for memes mainly. Iâ€™m slowly being a cunt in everything I do, so hopefully my gf breaks up with me. And Iâ€™m just trying to do nothing at home, just distant, you know. Iâ€™m writing like some guy is gonna have the exact same story and be like â€œyesss dudeeeâ€ but I doubt. Anyways. Just waiting. Waiting for 1 gf to dump me, friends to forget about me and go on with there own life. And to be distant from my family. Then Iâ€™ll go. It could be tomorrow. It could be in a year or 10. But it will come one day. And then Iâ€™ll just run down center and rage quit.
