Chronic Illness, no future in sightI have primary progressive multiple sclerosis. I'm only just about to be 33. Never married but I have one child who is mostly with his dad and wife. Im useless I feel now, sick and dont know why I'm alive for. 

Im stuck living with my mother due to my health. I can barely handle being around anyone or watching anything "normal" it makes me cry, ill never have that. 

Im stuck on disability, all my talents and skills are or have disappeared from my health stopping my enture life. I have never been married probably never will. Sure im pretty or whatever but no one wants the sick one... 

I don't want to end my life and hurt my loved ones. I also believe in God, don't think Im supposed to do that... BUT I dont see a future just more bs as it has been. All I think of is dying and how great it would be to escape my painful broken body and be free. I have suicudal ideations a lot now but won't do it....but I can't stop thinking it lately. 

I've had docs only traumatize me way worse too, as many others have. Going to try to go on meds again but that never works and hurts my disease more too. I feel so alone and want to be loved so badly. I don't even know why I'm bothering writing this anyway....
