My life is practically over...I've officially lost all hope. Two days ago, I got the worst beat-up of my life. I live in a very conservative and traditional Middle Eastern home, and my family thinks of me as a whore. My brother's friend claimed that he slept with me, and my brother didn't think twice before believing him. He went through my private chats and beat me with the intention of killing me. He then dragged me down a flight of stairs by my hair... I managed to escape, and am away from home for now. 
I seriously don't know what to do, or where I'll go when my options of places to stay run out. My family is taking his side, and he's threatening to literally end my life. I'm tempted into going back home and letting him kill me, but I don't want to die that way. It seems to me that suicide is the only way out, really... There are just so many ways to do it, and not enough reasons not to. 
The law won't be on my side, I don't want to live in a shelter, my family is against me, and I'm running out of time. My desire to die keeps on growing, and I can't think of any reasons to back down on it.
