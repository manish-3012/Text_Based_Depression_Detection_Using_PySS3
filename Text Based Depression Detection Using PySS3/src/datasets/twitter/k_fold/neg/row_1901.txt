I'm giving up. I'll be dead in a few weeks.I'm way too tired to start writing stuff about myself since no one will read it anyways. Basically I hate people. I think everyone's terrible and that no one has any empathy. I shouldn't be upset over something like this. I should get over it. But I can't do it. It's too much for me.

So I'll be dead in a few weeks. I don't really care about my family anyways. I've got no friends obviously. I don't even care if anyone will "miss me".
