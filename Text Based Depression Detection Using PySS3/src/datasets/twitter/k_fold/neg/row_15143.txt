I feel unemployableHey everyone. I was turned down for a job I applied for today. It was pretty rough. The message was this bubbly sunny "Hope you have a good week" thing. Idk I kind of wish it was just "You are horrible" because that would have been more bearable. For now, I think she was lying. I kind of think that I don't provide value to anyone. I guess my parents give me money, but like, eventually that would run out to. 

Like I think I have good skills and a good personality. I think this comes off in my applications, or at least I hope it does. I know that my future interviews will be different. But for now, I don't know. I am signed up for a meditation class in May. I think that will help. But will it help if I can't find value for anyone? 

Like my cousins are mostly in low end jobs and drug addicts. I know I could end up like them. Logically I could just end it all as Idk how I could get more experience to make myself valuable. It would also be too painful to take an entry level low paying minimum wage job if I were to be reduced that low. Maybe I couldn't even pay back my debt. 

IDK it's just so scary.
