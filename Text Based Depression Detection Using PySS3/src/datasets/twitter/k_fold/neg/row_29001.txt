I feel like the end of near, not in sight but closing in.Not too sure what I'm looking to get here tonight. I've been struggling a lot here recently with my own life in various aspects. Failing out of school, detaching from friends and family, ruining relationships and sabotaging my future. I don't much want to die in the next week but I honestly feel like it's the only thing that makes sense for myself. I know what I'll do, how I'll do it, and a brief statement to leave behind.   
  
I'm really tired of fighting this and ending up here. If It was to somehow work out now, I can only see it ending up back here again and again. I spoke with my counselor last week and left feeling much worse than before. They asked me to return this coming Monday. I don't know what they expect to do for me when it hasn't been helpful the past three years.   
  
I guess I just have a question for anyone, but do you think I'll do it this time? I've been here before but do you think this could be point to jump  the ledge?
