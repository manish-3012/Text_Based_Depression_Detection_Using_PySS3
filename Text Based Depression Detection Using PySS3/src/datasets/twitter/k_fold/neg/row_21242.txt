Hating myself.Hi. As you can probably tell by my user name, my name is David. Compared to the top post and other posts, this one might not seem so severe. But please read.
I am 16 years old in America. I don't exactly have a sad family life. My parents love me. And I know that Reddit probably won't like this, but yes. We are a Christian family. The main problem i have is my insecurity. When I was young, (not much, about 10) my friend and I would truth or dare. We would go to far and do things like "sexual" things. I am not gay, but I actually enjoyed doing it. I continued doing it for 3 years. I started to realize what sex was... and i started a great state of depression. Now... i am a reclusive, untrustful, socially awkward loser. I go to sleep crying at night. I think about how awful of a person I am. It doesn't help because of how fat and disgusting I look. I can't talk to my parents about this. About any of it. If they knew, (being very overprotective Christians) I know that my life will only get worse. I have considered suicide. I don't know how I can get out of this depression. Any help?
