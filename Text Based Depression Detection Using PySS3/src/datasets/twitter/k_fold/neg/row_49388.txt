The only choice I seem to have left is what caliber bullet I want to useYep, a few feet away from a plethora of firearms. I was going to leave the house to do it, now I want him to see what his emotional abuse did to me. 

Don't worry, I'm still in the fantasizing stages of it all. Been down this road but now it's all changed. 

The man I was so grateful for ... omg if you only knew the depths of his pathetic existence. And I worshipped him. I was his butler, chef, masseuse, maid, secretary... and his verbal punching bag.

In 10 years, he's never once told me I'm beautiful. Not one time. He's said "that looks good on you " but never once complimented my physical appearance.

I haven't had sex since I was 35, I'll be 40 next month. That alone is ridiculously abusive. He'd tell me to fix something about my life and maybe we'll start having sex again. I did everything he asked, even lost 50lbs and am pretty slim now. 

Why do I stay? He has controlled me for a decade. Isolation, ridicule, doubting my own sanity... it's fucking sick and it's my life. I have no access to finances, I cannot work currently, I have no transportation aaaannd I'm dealing with major psychological issues. 

Where would you start to try and make your life better at 40? Or would you even bother?
