I have too many mental health issuesIâ€™m due to see the psychologist soon but I canâ€™t wait until then. It fucking hurts trapped inside of my mind. I donâ€™t see a future for myself if I do get diagnosed as mentally ill. I donâ€™t want to take medication every day to silence my brain. Iâ€™m a POS and i just canâ€™t wrap my head around why. But it pains me to hurt people the way I do. I canâ€™t explain why I say weird things or act a certain way. Iâ€™m in so much pain and its unbearable. I want to wait for my grandma to pass, but I donâ€™t know. Living is so exhausting and I even doubt if Iâ€™m saying this for attention. I donâ€™t know myself.
