I just want someone to know...I'm giving up.  

I've tried for years and years to fight through, but it's not getting any better and is getting worse.  If it wasn't bad enough to have several co-morbid mental illnesses, even my therapist admitted that my life seems to have a never ending stream of bad situations/events.

I've always had trouble making friends, but thought I had a couple I could rely on.  But I get screwed over and pushed away when I tried to open up about my depression and struggles. I can't say I blame them - I wouldn't be around myself either if I had the choice.

I won't have a job as of next week as they've had someone take over my duties...they didn't even tell me(although I knew it was coming), they just stopped putting me on the schedule.  

My bank account is in the negative and I've lost my health insurance.  I just had to move and there's no money for next month's rent, so I'm going to screw over the landlords who took a chance on me &amp; end up homeless anyways.

The only thing I want is someone who will tell me its OK to give up. To acknowledge that I have tried hard for years and years to work with my doctors and get counseling and change my life and its not getting better...it's worse.  I wish I had cancer or some other disease where death would be understandable when treatments aren't working and/or quality of life is poor.

I feel so ashamed that I'm a failure.
