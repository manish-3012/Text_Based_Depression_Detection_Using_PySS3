My ex-girlfriend still friend committed suicide on Saturday.I have never felt worse in my life. We didn't have any unresolved issues and she called me a little while before she did it. She was hysterical and I tried to calm her down as best as I could. I told her I was her friend and she could tell me anything and that she didn't annoy me by calling me. She said she had to go and I told her to call me back in a little bit. The next phone call that I got was from her sister asking if I knew where she was. I told her where she said she was about 2 hours ago. They found her body hanging from a tree a little while later.

20 years old. Young beautiful and smart. She had suffered from deep depression for years and had tried to kill herself before. I feel that if it didn't happen now it would have happened later. She was very unstable. She could smile to someones face but be thinking about death. 

It just feels good to write about it. Hug everyone every day and make sure to let you know how much they mean to you.
