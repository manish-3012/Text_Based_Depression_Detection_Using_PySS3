I think I almost tried to kill myself today.This morning, I took a bottle of ibuprofen tablets, and was contemplating on whether or not to try and overdose myself.

I think I mightâ€™ve done it if someone didnâ€™t walk into my room. Honestly, Iâ€™m still thinking about doing it. Especially since all the person who caught me (my mom) did was yell at me, making it about schoolwork and how it must be because iâ€™m not doing it. They told me to try and be closer to god or jesus or something along those lines. I donâ€™t think they said a word about caring about me though. Maybe they meant to or something. They lectured me about how I should focus on school and studying to assure I have a good future.

It makes me think, if someone whoâ€™s supposed to be one of the people who are closest to me, do others care less? Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re trying to be good parents, and itâ€™s probably my fault to begin with. Maybe over the counter meds was a sorry attempt to begin with. But, to be honest, there are so many reasons to go through with killing myself, but for some reason Iâ€™m trying find a single reason to stay.
