I just want to restMy mind is in shambles, so sorry for my ranting. I just wanted to vent. Long story short, Im a failure. I tried and failed so many times since i was little. Im 17 years old turning 18, and i still havent got my shit together. Im failing almost all of my classes, and my parents are paying the price for it. They stopped saying anything except a dissapointed and a defeated sigh. They used to yell at me and scold me. But this is worse. I feel like a useless parasite. I wanna make them proud, i really do. But i just cant. Even things im kinda good at compared to other people im mediocre at best. Sometimes i wish i didnt have few good friends and relatives, just so i could die in peace. People kept saying things get better and i foolishly believed. Only reason im still living is video games.Im a huge fan of video games, especially RPG games like Witcher 3 and Skyrim. Probably because they let me escape into another world. One that I matter. I love the feeling of being capable, independant, doing what you wanna do, saying what you wanna say.. Im tired. I didnt ask to be born yet im forced to endure this pain. All i want to do is sleep forever or play video games. Sorry for the long nonsense. I probably wont be around for much longer so i wanted my story to be heard and seen by atleast one person. Im killing myself after finish my last playthrough of The Witcher 3.
