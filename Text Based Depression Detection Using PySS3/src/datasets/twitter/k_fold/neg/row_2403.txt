I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m a 19 year old dude. Iâ€™ve never posted here or reached out or anything to strangers but I donâ€™t really know where else to turn. My depression has gone off the rails at this point. I havenâ€™t had a steady stream of good days in as long as I can remember. Today I got dumped. Yesterday I learned my uncle has terminal cancer. Piled on with the uncontrollable shit Iâ€™ve felt Iâ€™m just at the point where Iâ€™m done. I cut for the first time in like a year tonight. I want to die and I just donâ€™t know where else to turn. Iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t where this belongs or whatever. I just needed to get this shit off my chest and I dont know what to do.
