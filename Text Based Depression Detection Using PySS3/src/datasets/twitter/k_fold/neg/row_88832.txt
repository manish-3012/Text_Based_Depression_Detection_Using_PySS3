My family is falling apartMy husband came out with having gender dysphoria on our anniversary. I wasnâ€™t even the first person he told. We have two children together who adore their father. Heâ€™s decided he doesnâ€™t want to transition since his parents and siblings would not be supportive and his friends arenâ€™t very supportive either. He also doesnâ€™t want our kids to lose their father. Ever since finding out Iâ€™ve been spiraling into deeper depression. Iâ€™m so scared. If I could just fall asleep and not wake up I would gladly take that option. My husband keeps telling me that thatâ€™s selfish and it would hurt the kids so I keep trying to not think that way but Iâ€™m hurting so much that pain is physical now. I feel like I canâ€™t breath and whenever I eat I throw up or feel nauseous until itâ€™s digested. Iâ€™m terrified of what the future looks like for my family and donâ€™t know if I can hold out long enough to see it
