I don't know how much longer I can survive this world.I'm trying to survive till after Christmas but it just feels like an impossible task I have a million trust issues because people have screwed me over so many times and I just dont see the point to life if we can't just be honest with the people close to use. Because what's the point of telling them the trust when they will just feed you with lies. But again this could have to do with my self esteem and maybe it's in my head but I really just cant take life anymore their is no more joy just constant misery
