So why should i live with depression?It's literally fucked me over since I was 15. They can smell it on you, see it on your face, the whole nine yards. It's real fun when you have both pdd and mdd.

Then everyday of your existence is miserable. I come so close to acting on my ideations on a daily basis that I don't know how I'm still here.

Life sucks, I suck, and death puts an end to the suck.

No more pills, no more therapy, no more unfulfilled aspirations. Just nothing.
