I Have NothingIs it suicidal if you just really want to die?  I donâ€™t want to be the one to kill myself, I just donâ€™t want to exist here anymore.  I have a child who is the only reason Iâ€™m hanging on so tight.  No matter how hard I try, I have no friends due to having severe PTSD.  Thereâ€™s no one interested in me romantically for almost a decade.  I feel so worthless.  I have no job.  I wish I could just disappear in a cloud of smoke, but I canâ€™t do that to her.
