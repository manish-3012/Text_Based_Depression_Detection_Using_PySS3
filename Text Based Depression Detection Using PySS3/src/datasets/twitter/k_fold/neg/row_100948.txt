Anyone else feel that life is pointless and to maintain it you have to waste all your time on this planet?Let me elaborate ,
I cant be the only one who finds it really depressing, that , you study for 4 years, get a degree, spend money/ get in debt. THEN (BECAUSE THE COST OF LIVING IS SO FUCKING HIGH AND YOU NEED TO SUSTAIN YOURSELF you need to go to work for 8 hours plus a day spending your time (that you can never get back) to make $ for the company that you work for. Even if you make a decent salary you're still getting screwed because you definitely make more $ for the company then they pay you, if you make a million in profits , at max you'll get 100k a year (10%)but you're wasting 40-50 hours a week of your life and come home at 6pm with only a few hours to enjoy yourself before you have to wake up the next morning and answer to your dickhead boss ! 

might as well OD at this point
