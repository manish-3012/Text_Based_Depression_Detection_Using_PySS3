best way to commit suicide ?iâ€™ve considered multiple ways but iâ€™m not sure which would be the best one.

iâ€™m at home with my parents, i donâ€™t have a drivers license since iâ€™m not yet old enough to get one. thereâ€™s a forest near me as well as a train station if that helps. guns arenâ€™t allowed in this country so i canâ€™t use a gun :(

i want to do it in a way so that thereâ€™s no risk of me staying alive.

preferably something that happens as quick as possible but itâ€™s okay if it doesnâ€™t.

so far i think hanging myself could be a good option but i donâ€™t have rope.
