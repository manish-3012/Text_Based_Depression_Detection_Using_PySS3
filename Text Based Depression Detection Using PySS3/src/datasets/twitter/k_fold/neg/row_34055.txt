Would this be called an "attempt"?Hello anyone who cares to read. I posted yesterday but it din't get noticed much. So here I am, typing to no one about no one important.

Today got really bad. I tried so hard to just ride it out. But I couldn't handle it any more. My boyfriend and I got into a fight, over everything from my depression to money issues. It ended up with my leaving (he wouldn't let me leave without my cell phone or my keys even though I wanted to leave without them). I just started walking/running and got the the "mountain" (over 120 feet climb up/down). 

I started walking up on the "mountain access" road. For some reason I stopped walking on the side of the road and started climbing through the brush until I got as far as I could (more than half way up in sandals!). I took a picture of the view and sent it to my bf on his cell, telling him sorry and that he would be better off without me and blah blah blah. After I sent the message he wouldn't stop calling, so I eventually picked up, sitting on the edge of where I climbed up, trying to muster the courage to throw myself off.

After 2.5 hours he talked me out of it and convinced me to come back, that he would meet me half way to take me home and to bring me some water (I was getting pretty dehydrated).

So now I am home and my bf is working the night shift. I can't stop of thinking up a new plan. I don't know what to do. I can't go to the hospital and I don't have a therapist/counsellor.
I just want the pain to stop, I just want to close my eyes and drift away in my sleep to wherever it is we go to when we die.
