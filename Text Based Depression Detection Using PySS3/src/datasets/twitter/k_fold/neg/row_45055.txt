VENTING // TW: Self Harm // 03.07.2019I have this massive urge to tear up my arms really badly. I want to bleed out. I want my arms to be destroyed. And to laugh while people try to hold the skin together - but they canâ€™t.  So I just bleed out and die. But Iâ€™ll be happy as it happens. 

Content. Finally.

Iâ€™d feel proud that I could do that much damage to myself. And relieved that I finally get to die. I think Iâ€™d be smiling as I bled. And laughing. Iâ€™d feel so happy. 

I want the rush of seeing so much blood. And my insides. A reminder that I am nothing. Just a fleshy capsule kept going by a heartbeat and oxygen. Nothing more. 

Everything else we think we are is an illusion. Weâ€™re not special. Or unique. Or anymore worthy of life than any other living organism on this earth. We are a blip in the timeline of existence. We are absolutely nothing. Irrelevant. Useless. Unnecessary. 

And all it takes is a nick to an artery to end it. And thatâ€™s it forever. We are so fragile. 

I wish I had the physical strength to reach my radial. 

Iâ€™d finally be happy.
