I'm way, way too stupid to exist.Spent so long thinking I'm smart, and when reality hit, I had to re-examine it. I think I've tried everything there is to try to improve my situation, from reading philosophy and literature to getting addicted to video games but nothing seems to do it. I'm too stupid to understand any major ideas. I can't internalize and understand the multiplication of negative numbers as a concept (no matter how many videos I've watched) for fuck's sake. I hate how fucking stupid I am and this carries down to basically every single element in my life; from my strained relationships with friends and family to my academics and my horrible skill at video games. I feel like the most basic life form which just strives to exist, nothing more and nothing less and I'd rather just die than be this unthinking being. 

The worst part of all this is the crushing self-awareness. I cannot hide my head under the sand and believe whatever the fuck I want because I'm not delusional, but when presented with reality, I cannot for the life of me comprehend it. I feel like I've lost every single argument because I always feel they've made solid points and I can't respond adequately. I'm fucking 18 and can't speak out without stumbling and stuttering, forget elaborating concepts which I know. I'm sick of just consuming bullshit and being unable to react to it because of my stupidity. I'll most probably end it tomorrow. There is no proper rope at my house so I'll need to head to the store (and the worst part is, I had to look up a video on tying a noose because I'm just that dumb, and even understanding that took me time. It's just hilarious now, honestly).
