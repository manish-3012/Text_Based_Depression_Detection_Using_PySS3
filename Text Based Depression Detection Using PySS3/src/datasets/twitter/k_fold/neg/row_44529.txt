Called the police on suicidal SOFor the past months now theyâ€™ve been depressed. Today was really bad. SO wouldnâ€™t even look at me and threw my hand away from them pretty harshly. And yelling at me to stay away from them. 

I got multiple texts that they were going to do it and lots of depressed thoughts. This happens very often. But what they were saying was a bit more serious and the way they spoke to me in person was darker and scarier than normal.

They didnâ€™t reply for a while so I got scared. Thinking the worst had happened, I called the police to check on their safety. 

They checked. They were okay. I got multiple texts saying they hate me. They hate me so much. Did I do the right thing. She was embarrassed but I thought she was gone. I didnâ€™t know this would happen. Please help
