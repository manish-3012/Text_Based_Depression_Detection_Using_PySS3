SuicideMy mood is so low Iâ€™ve tought about suicide more then hundred times! Iâ€™ve tried but failed once! I feel so down feel like it isnâ€™t worth living! Feel like my living spirit is sucked out! Every night Iâ€™m thinking how nice it would be to just let go and leave! I have/canâ€™t talk to anyone! My thoughts, anxiety and depression is killing me! Is there anything I could do to feel any better just a little please! I want my old life back without this... is there anything I can do? I want to live like before, but live like this isnâ€™t worth it! Is the only way out suicide? this world and its expectations is killing me...
