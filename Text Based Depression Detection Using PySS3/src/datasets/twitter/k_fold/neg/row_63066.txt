I completely squandered my college experience.Spent five years here because I am terrible academically. Not only that, I am terrible socially. I go to school in Austin, which is the music capital of the world with festivities everywhere. Didn't go to a single one. Didn't make a single friend throughout any of my classes. They say "college is not about what you learn, it's about who you meet." I have met no one. I am about to graduate next month and head right back to my hometown that I left five years ago. I remember being 18 and being so excited to go to college, and now, at 23, I am completely friendless, without job connections, and despondent.
