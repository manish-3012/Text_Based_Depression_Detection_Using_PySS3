Serious QuestionWhy is suicide considered selfish? To many its seen as selfish but to the one whom experiences the want for it, its because its an escape from , what they feel as, a life time of sorrow. if this was the case, wouldn't it be selfish for the ones around that individual to want him/her to keep going if it is just going to be miserable? I'm not suicidal right now, for the most part, but this idea crosses my mind a lot. any input anyone?
