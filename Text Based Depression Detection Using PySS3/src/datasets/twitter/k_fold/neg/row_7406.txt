Quick questionI'm not gonna kill myself or cut myself(although I did) or anything. I just find this thought coming back to me constantly: after I get out if school, work in a job for the rest if my life, I'll live in a retirement home for ten years and die. I am not special. They're is no goal in life for me. I'm pretty much just watching the world die.

On a phone, sorry for grammar.
