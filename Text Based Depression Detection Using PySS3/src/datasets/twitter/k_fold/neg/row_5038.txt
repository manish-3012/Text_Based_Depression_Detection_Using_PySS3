I wasn't supposed to live this long.I never wanted to make to age 18. Idk why. Probably because I knew I wouldn't be mentally strong enough to handle adulthood. Turns out I was right. Past trauma, new symptoms, current events, and future uncertainties have me on edge and I'm tired of it. I can't afford proper help and at this point, I don't want it. I wish I could go somewhere and leave the war inside my head behind. But I can't. And I can't take this anymore. So, I'm not gonna live to see my next birthday. I'm incredibly sorry to those who may be hurt by my choice (and fuck you to those who will pretend to be hurt when you know full well that you caused this shit) but, I did try. I tried so hard... I just can't handle this pain anymore. I hope you understand and I hope you can forgive me when I do it.
