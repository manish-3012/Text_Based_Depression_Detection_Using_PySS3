Self harm, what do I do if my mom finds my cuts?I cut a lot my forearm and I'm taking care of it myself. This morning while I was putting a cream for cuts and some bandages, my brother walked in, and found me with my arm covered in bandages. I'm super afraid that he will tell her. 

It's not one or two cuts, there are like 30 little cuts, there's no excuse. If she finds out, she'll go nuts, and I'm afraid because I don't want her to suffer. I'm super nervous for tonight, when she comes home (there are like 10 hours left until she comes home and I'll be anxious as heck all the time)
