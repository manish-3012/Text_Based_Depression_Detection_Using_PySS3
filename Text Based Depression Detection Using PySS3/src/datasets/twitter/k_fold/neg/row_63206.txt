I'm having a mental breakdown cause I lashed out at someone who didn't do anything badTw: suicide, self-harm, a breakdown. Not sure if you need to put warnings but just in case

I have clinically diagnosed depression and stuff is getting better but I still think a lot about suicide and sometimes relapse to hurting myself. I just feel like I need support. It's almost 1am, I have a very important test tomorrow and I'm waking up at 6:20~am and I can't fall asleep because I can't stop crying. I am so sick and tired of my emotions getting out at the wrong people. I'm so exhausted from handling all of the stress and emotions in general. I am scared of failing my test which I learned so much for and just..I am sick of constant suffering. I don't know what to really do. I relapsed after the person ended a call (we fall asleep together on call every night) and this time.. they just..ended and said "calm down and go to sleep" and I just want to die now.
