Failed my entrance exam. Now I feel paralyzed &amp; lost.Got my result yesterday evening (grad school). Haven't studied since then. Didn't go to gym today morning. Feel like dying.

My next exam is on January and I know I should be preparing for that. But I am not able to. I'm paralyze due to uncertainty about my life.

Not making it this time was a big shock because I was expecting to get selected. Next year I'll be too old. I'm 24 years old already and all of my friends have job. I don't know what to do.
