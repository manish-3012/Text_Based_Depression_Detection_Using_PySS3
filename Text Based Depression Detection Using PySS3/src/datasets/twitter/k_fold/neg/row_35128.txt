If this is how painful life is then I don't want to liveI feel terribly embarrassed to admit that the catalyst for this is something so dumb, but essential there was someone I met on a dating app and we really clicked and we were continuously messaging for almost six months now. The person lives in my hometown while I go to college somewhere else. We didn't want to formally define our relationship till I got home for summer break and we had time to talk it through. Today is the first day we're in the same area and so I messaged the person yesterday to see if he wanted to meet up, but he never responded. Also out of morbid curiosity, I checked the app and it looks like he's been actively using it as recently as this week.

I want to acknowledge how stupid and dramatic everything above sounds- I know I'm blowing the situation out of proportion in my mind. I know that any number of non-malicious things could have happen so that he hasn't responded yet. I know that we aren't exclusive so he has every right to still be on a dating app. And I guess the terrible thing is that I know all of this and I still feel irrationally overwhelmingly hurt. I never thought I would be so affected by romance, but I also confess this is the first time I ever felt truly in love.

I've suffered from depression for quite a while now so I also confess that I've thought about the call of the void a lot, for a number of other things, and I've been on the metaphorical edge a few times before. But I've lived, in retrospect, a very sheltered and lucky life, all things considered, and so as pathetic as it sounds, this is one of the most painful things that has happened to me, partially because it was so unexpected- everything has been going great up to this point.

But I despise how weak I am- how affected I am by something so trivial in comparison for all the better reasons people commit suicide. I despise myself for being so stupidly and naively optimistic and opening myself up to someone I probably barely knew. I despise myself for believing, against all logic, that there was a happy ending in store for me. And I think- if this is how painful it feels- to be ghosted by someone who I'm not even officially dating and only have known for half a year, then how painful will it be if I ever got divorced? How painful will it be if something actually terrible happened to me? Part of it is the situation, but I think the larger part of why I want to kill myself is that this situation has made me realized how weak and pathetic I am and how utterly non-resilient I am and that I'm not the kind of person who can take all the miseries of living.

I know this is long, so if anyone has read to the end, thank you. Really. I've always turned to words for comfort and while I feel like nothing can completely placate me right now, I was hoping that putting everything down will at least give me the imitation of coping. The only other thing that has been comforting me is playing out the steps in mind, visualizing my last moments, knowing that I have the power to kill the ache in my heart and end this sham of a life.
