Back at itI made it 16 days without being suicidal, which is a record for me since things got really bad almost a year ago. My insomnia has kicked back in, and with it, the thoughts are back in full force. I'm so tired and so lonely and I've lost so many friends. I wonder if they ever really liked me or if it was simply pity/compassion/politeness. It doesn't help that I've basically been abusing ambien, not to get high, but just to knock myself out before the thoughts get too bad and be granted a reprieve from life.
