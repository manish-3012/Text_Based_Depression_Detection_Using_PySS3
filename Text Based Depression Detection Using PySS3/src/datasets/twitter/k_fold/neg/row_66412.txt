My friend said something to my parents that made me breakdown.This was before I got kicked out. My friend was over for the night and me and my parents were arguing about how I didn't have a job.

Mom: why don't you have a job yet?? It's been almost 5 months! I still don't even know why you quit the last one!!

Me: I told you... I was too depressed to go to work and I know that sounds like an excuse but I physically felt like I couldn't move... I quit so they wouldn't have to fire me.

Mom: That is an excuse and It's always an excuse with you!! You just didn't want to go! If you're so depressed why didn't you ask for help? We're you're parents we would've helped you!

Me: mom-

Friend: she fucking has! How dare you even say that? You want to know why she doesn't ask for help from you guys? Because every time she does you tell her to get over it!

Mom: I wasn't talking to you. 

Friend: no, you weren't. But I'll say it because [my name] won't. If you would actually pay attention for once you'd see that your daughter is SCREAMING for your help, you just don't want to hear it! 

At this point my I'm just completely speechless.

Mom: well if you want to make excuses for her go ahead, but you need to get out of my house now.

Friend: gladly. 

So we drove to her house and ate ice cream. 

Find that friend that will stick up for you. Please listen to someone that might need your help. To them it might make the biggest difference in their life. I know that night it did for me. I love all of you beautiful people.
