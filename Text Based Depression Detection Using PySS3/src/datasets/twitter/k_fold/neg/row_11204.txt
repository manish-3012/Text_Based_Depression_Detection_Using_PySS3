I just want to disappear.Everything in my life has been falling apart as of late. Lost my job, s/o left me, family doesn't care for my existence, funds are running dry, and I don't know how much longer I can bear living this meaningless life. Death seems to be the best option at this point. Nothing is making my life better, everything is breaking me. 

The only positive thing that I can see coming from my death is that nobody will have to mourn my death. I have no friends, family, or lovers that would care if I left.
