I'm collapsingWriting here again. 

Being lonely is hard. I haven't had friends in 7 years. The depression stayed away when I was being bullied. Maybe it made me think that they cared. But that also has ended. My loneliness has gone worse ever since the school ended. With that, depression has crept in and so have my thoughts become more hopeless. I don't want to do anything. I rarely leave my room. Two places I go to are the kitchen and bathroom. If I go out, it is to go smoke and buy alcohol. 

I'm too afraid to tell anyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to tell my mom, I can already tell what she'll say. Blaming herself or me. That's how she reacts. I don't want to hear anything my parents have to say. I can't tell a professional either. I don't know what I want from my future, but the only glimpse of light I can see is being a police officer. But I can't do that if I have any kind of record. I can't tell anyone even though every day keeps getting heavier. I don't want to go on. I can't see the end. And with my wrists full of scars, I'm not sure about the light either. When they see my scars they'll definitely deny me.

I don't want to go on like this anymore. A single voice in my head says, "just one more day", but why should I. It hasn't worked before. 

But maybe I will tell somebody tomorrow, like I tell myself every day.
