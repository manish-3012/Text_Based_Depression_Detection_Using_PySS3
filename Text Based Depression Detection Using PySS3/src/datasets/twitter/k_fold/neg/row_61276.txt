I don't know how to title this.I'm a 15 year old boy with no friends, I can barely make any eye contact with people and at social environments like school, I feel like I'm a blind person at a museum. I know there are lots of things around me, I just cant take a part in them. I have the most monotonous life. Wake up, go to school, seem like a fool 90% of the time, come home, watch tv shows online or listen to music until I fall asleep. And repeat. I'm a successful student, the kind that listens well during the class and 10 minutes of revising before the exam is enough to get a score of about 75+ out of a hundred, which is amazing compared to other people, sometimes the highest of the class even. 
I'm too lazy to study. Too lazy to do anything. I argue a lot with my parents about responsibilities because I just dont do any. I dont want people interaction at home (I never told anyone about that before.). I just want to lay in bed in peace without being disturbed with things like walking the dog or cleaning. This is when the suicide part comes in. After arguing with people, I often think of suicide. Not only afer arguments though. It's always in my mind somewhere. I often think about how they would react to a dead me. I have the possibility to just do it. I *always* wish I was never born. I just dont know what to do and I feel as the point where I break is soon.
