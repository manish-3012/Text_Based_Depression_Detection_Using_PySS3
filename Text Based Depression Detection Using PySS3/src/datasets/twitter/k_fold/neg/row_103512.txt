All I want for Christmas is cancer.I hate my job and I just want to die, rather than work another hour, hell, another five minutes.


I have painful, crippling social anxiety, but I've worked tech support over the phones for most of my adult life. Over five years of call center work total has sapped my will to live. I hate interacting with customers. I just want a job where I don't have to. I'm good at what I do, that's not the hard part. I don't like being yelled at, hate dealing with the word games and emotions of the customers, but honestly, I don't think it's any one specific thing. My pay is great for the work I do and I have decent health insurance, but I can't relax because even when I'm off, I find myself counting the hours until I go back (I work 4 hours on, 4 off, 4 on, so that doesn't help and no, I don't have any say.) I think I'm becoming that grizzled veteran call center worker you meet who hates everything and everyone. I sometimes put myself in unavailable after calls just to cry uncontrollably. 


I have a child and a wife who depend on me. My wife was homeless before we got together (bad family life, homeless since she was a teenager) and has no marketable skills, can't make anything over minimum wage which doesn't even cover childcare. I'm in school and working 40-50 hour weeks, depending on mandatory overtime. I'm failing out of college because I can't keep a balance, work and school are always in conflict and also probably because I'm too fucking stupid to remember anything, even though I study more than 10 hours a week outside of class. I'm always in school or working and yet I am failing at everything I try. I like to think maybe I could actually finish school if I didn't have to work but maybe I'm just a fucking idiot. 


My family - they're the reason I can't kill myself. I want to, God, do I fucking want to, but if I do, they will struggle and flounder. They've got no one to count on but me and I've got no one but them. 


I have life insurance. $200,000 for a little over $2 a month. If I got cancer, if I got hit by a car, if something "out of my control" happened, she would be set for a bit. She could buy a cheap house in my town- something we can't do now - and live off it long enough to go to school and learn a marketable skill. 


I feel like I'm in a hole I can't climb out of. I grew up very poor and have been living on my own and working since I was 16. I never really thought of college as an option, even though I always wanted to go. I started community college two years ago and when I started, I was doing very well with my schoolwork. I also was only part time at work and we were on food stamps, with no healthcare, no phones, living in a one-bedroom in the worst slum in town with a caving-in ceiling, black mold and bedbugs and I could barely pay any bills. The baby - who was an accident, thanks to a broken condom and being literally unable to afford an abortion/living in a red state - was a newborn then and I was terrified I would never be able to give her a better life. Now I have enough money to pay all our bills and we live in a safe and decent apartment but I feel so shitty all the time I feel like Iâ€™m never there for either of them. I feel like a piece of shit for being weak and I feel guilty and ashamed and miserable and fucking hopeless. When theyâ€™re asleep, I lay awake at night worrying about the next dayâ€™s work. I worry about school. I wake up in the middle of the night convinced Iâ€™ve forgotten something. Sometimes I cut and burn myself alone in the bathroom to try and let some of the pain out.


 I'm sorry if this seems jumbled, I'm actually typing this from work into my phone so I don't get give in to temptation to leave early.
