I almost did itI'm at such a low point right now. I'm ashamed. Something set me off and made me feel empty again. So I tried to hang myself. I don't even know why I try. I just regret it afterwards. Why the fuck do I try when I know that I won't do it? It's always a specific thing that sets me off as well. It's disgusting. I shouldn't compare myself to other people, but I still do. I know it's not healthy. I know it just makes my self esteem plummet. Though I am a rather homely girl. Maybe I deserve to feel like shit.

It's so petty. I don't think I should be here right now. Being in an eternal state of nothing sounds incredibly tempting. I've been sleeping for most of these past few days now and I feel it's a taste of what it's like. Nobody will remember me. Then at the same time, I want to remain here. I think I'm just really dumb.
