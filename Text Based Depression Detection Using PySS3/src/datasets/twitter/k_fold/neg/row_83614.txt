i dont see the point anymoreWhere do i start
im a 15 year old male with heavy self confidence issues 
ive been told by a lot of different girls  and guys im attractive but i still see myself as the 5'7 chubby un-athletic sad little fuck who sits in his dark room crying all night 

i had the perfect girl for a year i loved her but of course the shitty side of me came out at the end of the year and all im gonna say is i completely ruined that entire relationship.
im a month into my first year of high school and im already failing 2 classes. 
i feel like nothing but a burden to the few that are even around me anymore my mom my dad and my best friend Emily. i suck at school i suck at my job. no one looks forward to working the same night as me because i close and im so fucking slow (work in a pizza place) i dont mean to be. 
ive tried therapy and it barley helps at all 
all my friends left because ive had consistent suicidal thoughts and no matter what anyone tells me i just end up still feeling shitty and they get tired of telling me the same shit over and over night by night so....yeah. 

i dont think i was here to survive 
ive done some good in my life and i think i was here for that and nothing further 

all i do is cause my parents stress
my moms wanted to give me away since i was like 7 and my dad believes i should be the most masculine human ever so not a single emotion around him. 

i honestly lost all hope at this point and have nothing to turn to i dont have anyone to turn to anymore
you guys are it
 i hate myself and i just dont see why i deserve to be here
