Something inside me tells me that I should just end it allMy life outside isn't too bad, but its me who I hate. The reason is because I feel really worthless and being someone who you don't like at all really kills you inside. I keep being ignored by people especially in college, I am not as good-looking as I think I am, I am horrible with woman because of no confidence plus I know I can't find someone I want, I just can't do anything right or do things that I want. I feel like this is a sign that Life just wants me to kill myself. Is this really how it is? or is it all in my head? I need help please.
