FridayI'm finally doing it. It's going to be this Friday with my friend. 

The plan is to have one last good night full of drugs and sex in a shitty motel. 

I'm 18 and the past few years have been shit. I have a terrible relationship with my parents, I had a lot of trouble with the law, I was just suspended last week and I can't walk the stage, and I'm being kicked out this Friday with only $350. I have a place to move in with my best friend since third grade in a whole new state. Honestly, those are just the negative things. 

My life has been pretty good, but I think psychedelic abuse and my general depression has been too much. I fucking love life some days, and some nights, I just can't take it. 

Since I was thirteen, I knew I was going to kill myself someday, and that day is May 29th. 

I'm not looking for sympathy, but I think I'm posting this just to tell someone without them finding out who I am so they can stop me.

Thanks for the good times, Reddit. I'll still be on this site until Friday night.

**Update 5/30/15**: I couldn't get a gun until today. I just got it and tonight is the night. Thanks again.
