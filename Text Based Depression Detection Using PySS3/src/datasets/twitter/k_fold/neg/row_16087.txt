Gonna do it anyway.I've thought about it for a while. I know I'm going to do it. I'm really only posting because I felt the need to share without anyone trying to stop me. I don't think anyone cares much for me. Not my friends or family who never notice me. I'm young but I already have so much regret I know it's just going to build up the more I live and it'll just become more unbearable. Soon, I'm going to lose all my friends to college and then I'll be alone. So alone. I don't think I can make any more friends but then why would I? So they can pity me or ignore me or use me? No one'll notice me gone. I'll be forgotten soon enough. I hate my life and myself and everyone dies so why not make it sooner?
