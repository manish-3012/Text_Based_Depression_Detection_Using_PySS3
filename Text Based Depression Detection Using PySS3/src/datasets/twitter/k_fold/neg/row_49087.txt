My boyfriend of 6 years left meTwo days after our 6 year anniversary, my boyfriend told me he didn't want to be with me anymore. It's been 3 days since and I can't think of anything else. If he sleeps with someone else or gets into a relationship with someone else, I will be devastated beyond words. We spent more than 1/3 of our lives with each other, and I can't hold on anymore. I've always thought I was going to kill myself, but I was so happy that I didn't think about it often anymore. We live together, we have a cat together, the rest of my family lives far away and I only have one friend I can stay with, who is in a bad relationship. I am just so. Fucking. Broken.
