I want a gun but Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll kill myself.So as the title says it, I want to purchase a gun. I have been mugged twice in the past living in the city I live in. I now suffer from an overwhelming fear of everyone I see. I sware up and down everyone I see, anyone that drives behind me is out to get me. It literally leads to debilitating anxiety. I can even comfortably leave my home. Aside from not wanting to leave home I also suffer from extreme anxiety and depression. I canâ€™t escape from my own head, any attempt to get out and make it better leads to worse anxiety. I know a firearm would remove almost all my anxiety surrounding others harming me, but Iâ€™m almost certain I would end up using it to take my own life. help !!
