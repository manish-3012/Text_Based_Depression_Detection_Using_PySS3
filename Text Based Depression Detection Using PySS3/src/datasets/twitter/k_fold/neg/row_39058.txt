It's getting worse and worse and worse nothing else is getting betterMy mental disorders are getting worse, depression is getting more severe, I have friends but they never ask 'how are you', while i'm obviously suicidal most of them won't care to start a chat just if I started it and they reply late, everything is crumbling down nothing is getting better at all, Medications aren't helping, therapy is not helping, If I can't get better and it's only getting worse how suicide is not the only answer to this permanent problem? I'm 18 and I'm a dropout I can't get out of my home, I eat only to take my meds to avoid the withdraw symptoms, why I'm so hated ? abandoned, Isn't it super selfish to ask me to stay for my friends who don't care about me or my abusive family ?
