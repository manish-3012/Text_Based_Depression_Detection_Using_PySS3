I wish I was happyI wish I wasn't at war with my brain all the time. I feel so trapped and scared. I have no future and I honestly hope I manage to muster up the courage to commit suicide before my 18th birthday and graduation in a couple months. Maybe things will get better but I don't want to be here to find out. I wish I could just fall asleep tonight and never wake up. Everyone thinks I'm okay. I am okay I just wish I was dead and no one believes me.
