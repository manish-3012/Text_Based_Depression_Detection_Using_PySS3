I just canâ€™t do it no moreI wake up every morning crying, I live alone, I struggle to even get out of bed, I have substance abuse &amp; alcohol issues to help deal with my aspergers &amp; adhd, Iâ€™m unemployed, I have no girlfriend, no motivation or skills, Iâ€™m virtually a recluse, I sleep most of the day as I have nothing to get up for &amp; have bad anxiety that the only time I feel comfortable leaving the house is at night time to go and buy food for myself &amp; cat, Iâ€™m just at my wits end with life, I think of suicide on a daily basis about buying a rope and just doing it, thing is Iâ€™m so stupid I donâ€™t even know how to tie the thing! Knowing my luck it would fcuk up &amp; id end up a failed attempt &amp; end up a vegetable! Does anyone know what would happen if I just landed up to my local mental hospital &amp; told them I canâ€™t deal with life no more help me? Would they treat me? I canâ€™t continue my life like this no more
