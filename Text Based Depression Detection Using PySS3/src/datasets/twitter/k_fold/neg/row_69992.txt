Killing myself Sunday nightCheck my other posts if you want. Tl;dr is I have a nasty condition and I'm in constant untreatable agony. I've hit a really bad wave this past week or so.

I'm done. I'm giving myself until Sunday for it to pass. Otherwise, I have a gun and note ready. The agony is unreal I can't function. And my condition isn't going to be getting better any time soon.

Last post. Bye everyone.
