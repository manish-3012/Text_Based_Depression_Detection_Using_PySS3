You are not aloneYou are me. I am you. For some stupid reason we get to believing that others deserve to be here, they deserve love, happiness, success and we are the exception.

I read these posts and keep seeing myself over and over and over again. It forces me to recognize I am never alone. It's an insidious and cruel illusion. 

Belonging is a birthright. We don't get why, but we were intended. All of us. No matter what we've done or experienced, no matter how pointless it feels, no matter how much we've screwed up, we have a place in this world. 

I am with every last one of you right now and what strength I have I share with you. 

I might be violating sub rules with this but I don't care. You are my brothers and sisters, you are shining stars sharing the same sky and not at all separate from me. I don't know you, but I fucking love you and have faith in you. In us. We will get through this.
