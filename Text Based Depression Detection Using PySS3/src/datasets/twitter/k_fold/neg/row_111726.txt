Lonely, Hamilton, GayFirst off... I'm a decent looking guy. There is no reason I should be lonely, sad and down all the damn time. 
But I am, I can block stuff out with work but then I'm on the way home and the reality of my life comes crashing down and I'm miserable. 
I have no friends, literally - I have none. Don't have any family either. No support. I moved to Hamilton in February and haven't made any friends.
