While grocery shopping, had thoughtsWent grocery shopping, and while I was there standing in the aisle, I thought to myself "Why am I bothering to buy food or nourishment when I'm so close to going through with it? I'll probably get fired soon. I should just end my life now before things get worse than they already are." I wore my mask like I always do as required in a store but more for other people's benefit/to comply rather than for my own protection.
