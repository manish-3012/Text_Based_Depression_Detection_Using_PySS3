I hate being aliveI'm 16 years old and ever since I got to high school it just feels like life just gets worse and worse. Almost everyday I get the feeling of not be wanted. I have pretty bad social anxiety which just makes everything so much worse. I'm not close to anyone in my life and I don't feel like there is anyone I can really talk to about this. I can't express myself or really make new friends because I'm scared of getting made fun of. The time I actually attempted to express myself in a way was when I liked someone and I told them I liked them but they didn't like me back. I HATED myself for a long time because I thought it was something I did wrong. After that it just destroyed the actual little confidence and self esteem I had for myself. I really hate the way I look and I want to change it but it's not like I can do that.  It doesn't help with the fact I see her everyday and it just reminds me of it. I search videos on YouTube on how to build your confidence and how to look good but it doesn't help me at all. I really wish I had the power to just kill myself and end it all here but we don't really know what's on the other side. I just hate everyone because it feels like all they do is make fun of me. There's nothing special about me at all especially since I have bad grades. I have thought of killing myself several times before. I just really wanna dissapear.
