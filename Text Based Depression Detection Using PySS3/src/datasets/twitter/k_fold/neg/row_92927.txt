how to diei think i narrowed it down. i would starve myself because if i change my mind thereâ€™s an option to stop it and since it takes so long maybe someone would notice. i know itâ€™s bad but i want to die but sometimes i think i want someone to care about me dying more than i actually want to die. i just want attention i donâ€™t necessarily want to die i just want someone to love me enough to notice and stop me. i could die right now and no one would find my body for days. then again i feel like thereâ€™s only really one person i want to care... he doesnâ€™t want to talk to me and iâ€™m scared without him he was the only thing keeping me from doing it now heâ€™s gone i donâ€™t know how to stop myself and yes i know itâ€™s pathetic to be so dependant itâ€™s just how i am
