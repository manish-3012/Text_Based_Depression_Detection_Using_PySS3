Tonight's the night, I think.It's got nothing to do with the fact that it's valentine's Day. That's just a coincidence. I just can't deal with the nothing that's going on. I'm going to go for a drive. Even though I'm not legally allowed. I don't care. What are they going to do? Arrest me? Good luck arresting a corpse. Anyway. I'm going to go for a drive. And when the urge kicks in.. I'll slam into a tree, or bridge support, or something. I won't have to worry about the car saving me because it's from the 80's. Safety didn't exist in the 80's. If I can't do it then.. I don't know. Things will probably get worse? They always seem to. Fuck this. Even I'm self aware enough to know I didn't deserve this
