My situation.For years, i've been struggling with suicidal thoughs. The But I can't kill myself. I wouldn't know how and I just like to live. I enjoy life, most of the time. But then, every year or so, I just have a dip. I don't want to do anything, I sleep for 16 hours at a time, and still I'm tired, I cry for nothing, I lose all my friends. I just... I want to dissapear. But then, again, I know I don't want to kill myself. Which makes things worse.

I... I don't know what to do. The dip i'm in, now, has been going onfor 6 months.

I don't know why. I don't want to self-diagnose anything... I'm too scared to go to the doctor. I'm hopeless. I have got a boyfriend, who is wonderfull and tries to support me. But he's losing his patience. I don't want to bother him with my problems.

Guys... please. Does anyone know HOW, HOW do I feel better again? I've tried to talk to my friends, but all of them backed away. I've got noone left. Noone who understands that I need psychological help. I've never been in so much pain in my life. EVERYTHING i do seems miserable. I keep messing up everything. I4m a bitch all the time, because of my moodyness and only notice it AFTER i've done the social dammage. I can't. I'm up... I want to sleep and never wake up again...

TL;DR :  I feel miserable all the time and need help, because I can't kill myself, but can't stay in this emotional pain all the time.
