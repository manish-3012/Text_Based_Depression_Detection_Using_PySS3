I think thereâ€™s something wrong with meI donâ€™t know why, but I always forget the small stuff, like to throw the old toilet tissue roll out once I put a new one in. Actually this happened today, and now I feel like shit because I think that my mom thinks that I do stuff like that just to piss her off. I almost started crying because of that, man. She asked me what was wrong and I said, â€œI just feel badâ€. She said â€œwhyâ€? I said â€œI donâ€™t know whyâ€ (even know it was obviously about the toilet paper). She asked if I was doing things like that on purpose so I can make her pissed off. Of course I donâ€™t, why would I do that? She tells me that she does way too much and she shouldnâ€™t have to be telling me to do things like clean up after yourself. Thatâ€™s true, I think way too fast sometimes and Iâ€™m really forgetful of the smallest things (like turning off my fan when Iâ€™m not in my room). I told her that and she told me that she didnâ€™t need to hear my excuses, she would understand if I had a bunch of homework or I was studying for my SAT or something, but I have no responsibilities. She should have to tell me to do things like that, and thatâ€™s true. I honestly think thereâ€™s something wrong with me.
