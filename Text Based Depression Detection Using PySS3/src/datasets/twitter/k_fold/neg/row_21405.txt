Want to end my life, but afraid of what happens afterIâ€™ve pretty much decided Iâ€™d like my aimless, desolate life to end. Iâ€™m too emotionally and mentally scarred to amount to anything. Due to circumstances beyond my control, Iâ€™ve been shaped into the kind of person who will always be chronically depressed. I became very capable of making new friends by my own merit, but always inevitably lose them because of the toxic behaviors that I learned from family members, growing up. And, Iâ€™m at the age where itâ€™s too late for me to fix any of it.

Iâ€™m not posting for anyone to talk me out of it, but rather for encouragement to follow through. On that note, DMâ€™s work just fine. I need any extra push I can get because Iâ€™ve been down this road before, twice. I chickened out at the last minute both times, and told myself, maybe things will get better. They havenâ€™t. I was also terrified of the prospect of going to hell afterwards. I donâ€™t want to jump out of a frying pan and land in a fire. Iâ€™m sure to continue to be miserable if I stay alive; whereas, the outcome is uncertain if I can muster up the courage to go through with this. All things considered, the logical thing to do is to kill myself. Donâ€™t try to talk me out of what Iâ€™ve already decided. Help convince me that there is no hell, that Iâ€™ll have nothing to be afraid of if I can go through with this, or say nothing at all. Thanks.
