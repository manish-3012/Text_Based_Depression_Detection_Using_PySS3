Last resortLong time lurker reading posts but never actually had an account. Deciding to post here as sort of a last effort. I've been depressed and suicidal for a long time now, I've been through therapy and there are time where I've gotten better but I always end up in the same dark place. I know a lot of people here feel the same way and I thought maybe if I talk to others who get me maybe it will be more helpful than someone I'm paying to be my friend.
