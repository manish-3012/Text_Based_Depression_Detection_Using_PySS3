The only thing keeping me alive is guilt.I donâ€™t want to be that selfish bitch who hurt everyone by killing herself

Living this way for 16 years

It hurts so much

I feel like a dog thatâ€™s been crushed by a car but no one will let me be euthanized because it would be selfish of me to stop hurting in exchange for others hurting

So I just hurt and hurt

It doesnâ€™t get better

I wish everyone else died so Iâ€™d be free to kill myself but I only want long happy lives for throes around me which is why I havenâ€™t killed my self yet

I feel trapped

Iâ€™m panicking

Thereâ€™s no way out
