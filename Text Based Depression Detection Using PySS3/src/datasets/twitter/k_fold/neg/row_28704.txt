I think I should try to kms againThis year on August 23rd around 1am I took a bottle of tylenol, downed the whole thing and then later on threw everything up. Before that I used to cut myself, nothing deep, just enough to make the blood come out like a scratch. The first time I tried to strangle myself but ofc that wasnt going to work. I have...ALOT of emotional baggage. Im sure everyone says that but I dont think you'd be able to handle mine. I dont wanna get I to it because I don't think anyone cares, the people in my own life would say "you can always talk to me" but when I actually open my mouth, im told I just depress everyone around me, im too sensitive,  im doing it for attention. Or I just get shrugged off and people talk over me and cut off my words....im only a 17 year old girl I should be worrying about other things...but whats the fucking point. The only thing keeping me going is making art...but what if I never get anywhere with it, what if im just wasting all my passion for this thing just for no one to be interested in it. I just wish I could be sumwhere secluded where i have anything I want and all my needs, or just live in my imagination away from this world..I will admit im alot more sensitive then the average person, by that I just feel things to much and cry to easily. I magnify small things and hold onto things that hurt me bc it feels familiar, and it's better to feel something rather then nothing. Im sorry this is all over the place...the point is I want to die....or atleast bot be in this world. I wanna die...I really wanna die...but im too much of a coward. Those questions rush unto my head, is there reincarnation,  does it just go black, does my conscious ness live on without my body, is there an after life....what happens after death...My fear of the unknown and the pain from the method to end myself is the only thing keeping me alive, that and art...but again...im sorry for rambling, I have no one else to talk to..
