I've lost hopeI don't usually post on reddit, but I need to vent. I know people have it worse. Which is why I never post anything anywhere. But I feel like I'm going to scream. I feel stuck. I feel like nothing is left for me. I want to die. I want to throw up every last bit of my life. I can't take medication anymore without getting sick because of when I downed all of my painkillers and antidepressants. I just need to scream until the life inside of me drains out and there is nothing left.
