i really havent been feeling good lately and everything feels like its falling apartsince the very beginning of august nothing has meant anything to me. its hard for me to get attached to people, and ive been noticing a change of atmosphere in my home. its like time stopped. i want this all to end and i cant think of any ways to help myself. its really selfish of me to feel like this, but if i were gone, everyone would be more comfortable. i just make situations worse and dreadful. whenever i try to repair friendships i accidentally ruin, they want nothing to do with me. even after a simple slipup. its so so hard to pretend everything is fine and im not going insane. ive lost too many friends because of a dumb comment i made or a mood swing. i dont know how else i could make things better. this is really my last option, ive tried talking it out, asking what i did wrong, and even helping them with random things. i swear they know im faking it. im a terrible person. i deserve to decay. its all my fault.
