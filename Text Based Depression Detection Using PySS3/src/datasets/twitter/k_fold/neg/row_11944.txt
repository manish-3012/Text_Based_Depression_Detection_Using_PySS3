tempting to just say screw it do it on the night of Christmas evetired of being frequently lied to  by my mom grandma and cousin  the only one who  understands me is my dad {mom and dad divorced for 8 years} sure he did something stupid in the past but i forgive him  every damn day is feels like im having a mini heart attack and all these emotional crying outbursts   for the past 4 months.  the only things that keep me happy now are 3d platformers and animal jam
