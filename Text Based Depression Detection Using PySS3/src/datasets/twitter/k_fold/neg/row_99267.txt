I want to die but I donâ€™t know howI have struggled with depression and anxiety for upwards of 10 years and i just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I had a new girlfriend who i am absolutely in love with but due to her own mental issues she wants space because she doesnâ€™t want her emotions to drive me away (they donâ€™t) i tried to be understanding and i have been giving her space, but sometimes iâ€™ll text her to see how sheâ€™s doing and sheâ€™s hanging out with other people and i donâ€™t mind that but it just seems like she wants to spend time with every person except me. I already deal with so much i feel so unwanted by everyone and this just pushes me to the edge, i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. 

I have thought about killing my self a lot but i know that it would crush my family, i just want somebody to shoot me in the head or i want to get hit by a truck when iâ€™m crossing the street i just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. 

(Iâ€™m sorry for being all over the place itâ€™s hard to articulate my thoughts very well)
