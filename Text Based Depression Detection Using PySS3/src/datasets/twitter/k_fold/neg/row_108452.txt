Pretty much everyone dislikes me now.Basically my own family except my dad hates me. My own friends hate me.



Bullied, Tormented, left. I've had everything done to me and I feel as if I've experienced it all.



Literally what hope do I have? There's nothing for me IRL and no one for me irl. I don't see a reason to keep trying anything what hope exists?
