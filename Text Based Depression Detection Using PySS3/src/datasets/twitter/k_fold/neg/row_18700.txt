I'm not hitting the bar of lifeHey there... I just want to share with you that I'm not the one worth living on. I really like pets, and if only I was female I'll be a good person to be loved, to give everything I have to my love, and to raise my children and give them all of my supprt.

But apparently I'm a male, and It's too late/too inappropriate to be a trans, so I have to struggle and I have to suppress my competitors. All my life, the whole meaning is to outcompete the other males. I just can't, but biologically I have to. I don't want to though. I just want to give a life and support someone.

Frankly, chances are, I'm going to live on my life of competitor. But these thoughts of not beight the one and not wanting to are more and more frequent. At least let you guys do your best, I'm genuinely hoping that you'll move through. Sorry If I take some of your time
