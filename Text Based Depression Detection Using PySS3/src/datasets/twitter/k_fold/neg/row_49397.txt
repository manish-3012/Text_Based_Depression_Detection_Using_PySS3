I am fucking terrified right nowI am in my first full big year of college. I am 28 &amp; it took me 10 fucking years to get my life even remotely together. All the relationships I had (romantically) blew the fuck up in my face because of lies, cheating or a wonderful combination. I have been alone for 6 years, &amp; the depression slowly gets worse. It's like a slow acting poison. The "friends" I have on facebook are distant, or have a family or are in some relationship. I see them happy &amp; it kills me. I want to cry &amp; I cant. I am stressed from college because I feel I won't get anything from the career path. The one person I knew &amp; was close to I met off a video game. (WoW) &amp; we where very close. So close that we where ironing out the works for a LDR. That blew up in my face in a wonderful explosion of lies from her. I always get lied to. I do not understand why. I am a very kind hearted man. I don't do creepy things like over step bounds with female friends. I always am respectful, &amp; always step up first to help people, but I perpetually find myself on the shortest end of the stick in life. 
Anyways, she was my best friend, &amp; now I'm alone. I have all these fears &amp; no one to talk to. I want someone to wrap there arms around me &amp; tell me it's ok. Im so scared. And with this getting worse &amp; worse. I keep thinking of the easy way out, but I am too big a coward to do it. But the desire is there. &amp; I feel like trash for it. Why is it that I am always there for others, but when I need it, not a soul is found for me? What did i do to get this hand? FUCK!...I'm just scared, &amp; confused...
