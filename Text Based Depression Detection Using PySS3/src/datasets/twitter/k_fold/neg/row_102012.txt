I just want to die.Hi.

On December 30th, I turned 30.

I also lost my job.

This isnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™ve been fired from a job, but it is the first time Iâ€™ve felt... lost. Itâ€™s the first time I have seriously considered suicide as a response to it. Itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve really let myself ruminate on whatâ€™s gotten me here, and felt the need to off myself because all I do is fuck myself over, seemingly every chance I get. I know thereâ€™s a word for that, but I canâ€™t think of it.

I just... I donâ€™t know what to do.

I had an interview the day I got fired at a place I used to work. I didnâ€™t get fired from there, technically. I chose to walk out so I wouldnâ€™t get fired. But this isnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™ve interviewed their since I left. I didnâ€™t get the job the last time, so Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m not going to get it now.

I filed for unemployment but I doubt Iâ€™m going to get it because Iâ€™ve been fired.

I need to pay rent soon but I donâ€™t have the money to do it.

I am just so, so scared and tired and unsure. I just want to kill myself so I donâ€™t have to deal with myself and my self-sabotaging bullshit anymore. The only person I have to blame is myself and I am just... so, so sick of myself.

I just want to die, man.
