Waiting to diePlease dont attempt to persuade me to live because I have made a decision and it's only a matter of when at this point. Please do tell me, from a parent's point of view, would it hurt less to discover the corpse of your child at the least anticipated moment or watch your child slowly wither over a few months, having time to prepare for the inevitable? I want it to be as painless and free of regret as possible for them because it's the least I can do.
