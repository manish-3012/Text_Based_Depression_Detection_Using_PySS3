Not time sensitive or urgentIâ€™m too anxious to commit suicide or to hurt myself in any way, but I constantly feel like everyoneâ€™s life would be better if I did. I only ever hear about how I donâ€™t work hard enough or I ask for too much or Iâ€™m too bitchy and Iâ€™m convinced people would get over my death pretty quickly. I recently got a 97 on a test but since some people got a 100 I was incredibly disappointed in myself, and I put no work in all year but remained on the team to go to the state math meet, only to be cut out by one point after the final regular meet. Iâ€™m aware that these are amazing achievements and I would be impressed had it been anyone but myself. I struggle to feel good enough and recently Iâ€™ve been realizing how much of a negative effect Iâ€™ve had on the people around me. Things are piling on and I donâ€™t know what to do, I donâ€™t even feel comfortable talking to my therapist about it because she just says things like â€œthatâ€™s an amazing grade! Stop comparing yourself to othersâ€ and it doesnâ€™t help at all. Iâ€™m scared that this trend of not wanting to talk about my problems and not being proud of anything I do will put me in a worse place, since it already feels like being gone would make everyoneâ€™s life better.
