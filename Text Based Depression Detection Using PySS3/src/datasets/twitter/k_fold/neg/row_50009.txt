"Reach out to someone if you're feeling suicidal" How the hell am I supposed to do that?I hate when people say that. The assume that all your problems go away if you just ""reach out"" to someone. Not everyone has people that they can talk to. I'm not even sure what I want at this point. I went to therapy once and I hated every minute of it. 

Every time my parents drove me there I felt like such a disappointment. I ended up tricking my therapist into thinking that I was better because I felt guilty my parents were spending so much money for me. 

Help what do I do? I can't take it anymore. I feel like a ticking timebomb. I go through my days emotionless and bottle it up and then I come home and fall apart. 

I need help I just don't know how to get it. Please help.
