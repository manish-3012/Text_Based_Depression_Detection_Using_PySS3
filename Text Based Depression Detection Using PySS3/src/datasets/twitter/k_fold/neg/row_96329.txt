No Emergency But I'm WorriedHey All, 

Long time lurker, first time poster. Over the years I've commented on a few posts, shared a few of my own strategies and generally helped when I felt I could. This however is my first time on the podium.

I'm 25 and I've been suicidal on and off for like 11 years. I know all the tricks and have even gotten myself to the point where I can feel an episode coming and prepare properly.

Anyway, in a month I loose a seasonal job and, with some other break up and lack of success stuff, I can feel some real dark periods are like 2 weeks away. This time something weird is happening. I'm not scared. 

Normally the idea I might finally off myself fills me with dread as my brain completes the checklist of consequences. The anxiety bubbles and I just freak out.

Recently though? It feels great. I will be in an anxious situation and thinking about leaving is like breathing out after holding it for hours. It's like I'm finally getting permission to relax where I couldn't before. I'm not burdened ideas of hurting my family, friends and peers; my brain just accepts it and moves on. These days the thought of suicide is the most Zen thing in the world.

I'm not in any immediate danger. This won't happen next week, but I've fought this thing a bunch of times and I think I'm starting to make peace with the fact my last fight might be coming.

Is this a weird thing? Like has anyone else been in a similiar place before? Let me know.

P.S. This community is awesome. During my darkest episodes it was amazing just to see that other people were thinking in the same way as me. Let's keep this shit up.
