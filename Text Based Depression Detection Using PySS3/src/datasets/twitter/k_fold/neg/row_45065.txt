I don't know what is wrong with meNo matter what I do, I just can't be happy. I read alot of books on how to win friends, how to be happy, how to not be depressed. But nothing is really working for me. Sometimes im happy for a week, but on the weekend I cry myself to sleep. 
I just don't know what I should do in my life. Nothing seems right for me.

Im going to study cognitive science this month, in a new town. I never was good at making new friends. Actually, I really suck at it. And when I think again about it, I never had any friends.
Im just socially retarted and maybe too ugly, too. 

I also never had a girlfriend, like everyone else. Even the biggest retards I know had at least one. I didn't even hold a girls hand (in a relationship way). The first time a girl hugged me was with 17 (im 19).

Im thinking about suicide for at least 4 years now. The only reason I don't do it is that it would make even more trouble. My parents have enough problems themself, and don't deserve a dead child (even i don't like them). I don't want other to feel bad. Also, I don't want to be weak. In my mind, Im weak if I commit suicide (sorry, but its just the way i feel like atm) and I want to be the "though guy". But Im just a retarted who never was though, and never will be. 

What the hell should I do?

Sorry for the unstructerd text and bad english, but I just don't feel like coreccting it.
