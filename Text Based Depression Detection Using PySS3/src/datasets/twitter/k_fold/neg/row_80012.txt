I can feel myself slipping away againI tried killing myself almost half a decade ago, but it didn't work out the way I wanted it too. Honestly, I'm thankful for all the extra time that I've had. There were lots of good memories that I wouldn't have gotten to have if I had died that night, and great people that I'd have never known.

But I still feel the same way I did before, it's been sitting in the back of my mind all this time, sometimes barely noticeable and other times almost consuming my thoughts; but always there. And now I'm finding myself winding down the same fucking path as last time, pushing people away, spending all my time alone, slowly losing all motivation to carry on living an okay life; and there's no reason for it. Nothing set it off. There's been no noticeable change in my life up until I started slipping away, and it's going to ruin me.

I've never wanted to kill myself, I'm scared by the idea of it, but I have wanted to die for as long as I can remember, and I know that I can go through with it, with a lot more success than last time. But I've been holding on, and I'm going to keep holding on as long as I can, because part of me hopes that if I just wait, my mood will come around again and balance itself out, like it usually does. I feel like I'm rambling but I don't have many people in my life I can be open to about this sort of thing, and typing all of this out has been a little therapeutic. Thank you for reading this.
