Im not here because i want someone to talk me out of this, what i want is information.If i mix 20x 10mg of temazepam with 2x 1mg xanax and 50x 0.5mg mirtazapine would i be able to overdose? I could probably get my hands on a couple of valium also
And please dont ask me to reach out, because i dont want to do that anymore. This is what ive been wanting to do since i was a young child. I almost succeeded a couple of months ago, but the rope stretched just enough for my toes to touch and air to enter. I woke up in a puddle of pee and i was absolutely gutted to be alive. And ive been grieving my failed death ever since. Im hoping someone can give me some advice on how to do it successfully.
