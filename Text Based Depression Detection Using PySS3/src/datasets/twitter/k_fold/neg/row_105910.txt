TiredIâ€™m just honestly so tired of life. Iâ€™m more depressed every day. I hate myself bc I know how much I have and how happy I should be but Iâ€™m just fucking miserable all the time. I keep looking for the common link in everything that goes wrong in my life and itâ€™s me every time. I always tell people when they ask, â€œI think about suicide, but I would never act on it!â€ Lie. It seems like every day I visualize dying more and more graphically. I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t want to be alive. Itâ€™s exhausting.
