I give it 4 years topsHi, I have to work today.  Before I do, I would like to post that I feel a lot better knowing I will off myself around the 4 year mark.  My only living relative is my mom and will die soon.  My life was filled with so much sadness I can't even begin.  I have no boyfriend, and most likely will never get one.  I am unloveable.  I have nothing to live for.  So, yeah, I will go to Mexico and get the stuff and do it then.  No getting old, no dealing with these horrible jobs, etc.  No dealing with "Did I say the wrong thing."  Etc etc etc.  But in the next four years, I hope to leave people better off than when I found them.
