This is crazy.I think gun is the only way. I tried suicide by cop but ended up getting shot 5 out of 27. Why I'm not dead I don't know why. 2008, then ended up in prison. I'm glad to be alive, Don't know why I'm not dead. Lucky I've had family to get me thru it. Now I teater totter. I should be grateful to be alive. Just a reminder, I don't know why I'm alive but shit I don't know why I'm typing this.
