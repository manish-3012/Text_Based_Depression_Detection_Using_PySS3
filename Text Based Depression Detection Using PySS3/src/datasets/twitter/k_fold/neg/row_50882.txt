Just kill the quadriplegicBetter dead than a quadriplegic. Please let me die in my sleep tonight so I don't have to do this myself tomorrow.

Don't want a fancy car, big house, money, or a family. I just want to be free to go and do as I please, without asking anyone's permission. I want freedom, beholden to nothing.

I will not live in submission to quadriplegia. Give me the honor of death I beg of you.
