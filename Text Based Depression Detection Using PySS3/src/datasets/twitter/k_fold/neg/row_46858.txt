I really wish that suicide assistance or whatever it's called was possibleToday especially it's hard.
I tried to commit suicide again... my family, my mom is someone I live for so watching her being taking advantage of I lost it and afterward I took it out on myself but I know how much it hurts her and all I could do was cry because I feel guilty at the same time I'm suffocating I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know how to deal with this
