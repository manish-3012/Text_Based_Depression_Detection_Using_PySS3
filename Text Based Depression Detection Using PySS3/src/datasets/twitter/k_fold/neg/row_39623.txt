A day ago I made a post about how I planned to kill myself in a year. Iâ€™m going to do it tonight.I had to write that title to confirm it. Iâ€™m going to use a rope and attach it to a wooden plank going across the top of my garage, and Iâ€™m going to use a chair to finish the job. I havenâ€™t decided which chair yet. There is no way that can fail. I wonâ€™t be able to breathe. No one will check on me for a good hour or so. 

What changed? I donâ€™t really know. I just kind of realised that Iâ€™m well and truly finished on the 25th of November. I wish I had a cooler date but maybe this is the one god had in mind for me. Iâ€™d rather die then go back to day to day life as of now.

Iâ€™ve just been listening to Lone by Tyler The Creator. That will be the last song I ever hear most probably. Iâ€™ll listen to music for about an hour beforehand.

If anyone wants to know a bit more about me, Iâ€™m 16, male, in college. Never had a girlfriend. I couldâ€™ve, but I didnâ€™t due to anxiety. Part of me wonders if it couldâ€™ve been different if I was born quite good looking, and I had a girlfriend. You know, that emotional and affectionate kinda relationship with a best friend that you care about. Iâ€™m going to die a virgin but I donâ€™t think I care. Ever since I got acne my self esteem plummeted, and I canâ€™t shake it off. I donâ€™t want to say acne killed me, but I think itâ€™s finishing me off.

Iâ€™m passionate about football, well I was, but Iâ€™ve gotten too depressed to even look at a football. I donâ€™t even care to watch it anymore. Nothing interests me. I only go to the gym so no one thinks there is anything wrong with me. Iâ€™ve been seeing a doctor but therapy is too long of a wait. 

Haha, I hope they donâ€™t show my school photo in memorial to me. I fuckin hate that picture. I shit you not, Iâ€™m just going to put in my suicide note a personal message to my college to explicitly NOT put my picture on the big screen. Iâ€™m evidently insecure in the afterlife ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸

My family. I donâ€™t want to talk about them. I love them too much and I hate the fact that Iâ€™m about to put them through pain but itâ€™s temporary. Itâ€™s all temporary.

I am a popular kid at my school. Thatâ€™s not me saying Iâ€™m this great cool guy at the top of the hierarchy, but thereâ€™s not a single person in that college who I hate and couldnâ€™t be their friend. How do I think theyâ€™ll react? I donâ€™t know. How do you react? Cry? Maybe for a day or two. Then theyâ€™ll be fine, right? 

Funnily enough, I spent my last day ill, doing nothing, just chilling. I watched a few funny videos, I think Iâ€™m going to go on Xbox later and try fortnight battle royale as people tell me itâ€™s really good. Plus itâ€™s free.

Why am I making this post? A final message to Reddit after 2 years or so. And more importantly, I want to know if any of you, have lost anyone to suicide. I want to know how people reacted afterwards. I want to know whether everyone will be okay without me. If itâ€™s attention seeking then Iâ€™m sorry for that. But I donâ€™t want to leave having said nothing at all, you know? I used to read these posts and make comments all the time about a year ago. Never in my life did I think Iâ€™d be on the other side.

I think thatâ€™s everything. Thatâ€™s all of my concerns. No more schoolwork, no more stress about the future, no more pessimism, no one judging me, no more judging myself. Iâ€™m going to go have dinner. Play some Xbox. Grab my headphones and phone, turn on my playlist, and hang myself. 

In 3 hours, my story will be over. Crazy.
