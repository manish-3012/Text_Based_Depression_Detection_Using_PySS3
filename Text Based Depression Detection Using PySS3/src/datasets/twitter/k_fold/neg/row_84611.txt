[Serious] Pretty sure I'm losing my mindI don't even know if this is the right sub for this, if not please point me in the correct direction.

I swear I'm going crazy. Sometimes I slip into this way of thinking where I'm completely convinced that this life is some kind of a simulation/dream, or something completely made up in my head. Sometimes I think I'm my own God and I created this entire universe just for me.

But then I snap out of it and come back to reality. The problem is, I find myself slipping into the simulation way of thinking more and more often and reality seems harder to hold onto.

The reason I posted this here is bc while I'm in the simulation way of thinking, I have extremely dark, suicidal thoughts. Sometimes I am thoroughly convinced that I need to kill myself in order to wake up in my real life. Or I think that this simulation sucks and I really screwed it up when I created it, so I need to kill myself and start all over again.

I want those thoughts to stop bc I know they're not real! At least while I'm typing this I know it's not real, but I know later today I won't have such a firm grasp on reality.

Someone please help! This is not a joke.
