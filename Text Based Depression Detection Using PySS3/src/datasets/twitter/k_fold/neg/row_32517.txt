I feel emptyIâ€™ve already tried to overdose once and for a while afterwards things were fine, but now everythingâ€™s fallen apart again and Iâ€™m right back where I started. I canâ€™t make friends, I canâ€™t do the most basic of tasks, I canâ€™t get work done on time. My parents are out of town for the next few days so I figure now is the time to do it. I just hate myself so much and I canâ€™t talk to anyone about it without lying and pretending everythingâ€™s fine. Tomorrow Iâ€™ll probably take whatever medicine I can find and try to overdose again, hopefully it works this time.
