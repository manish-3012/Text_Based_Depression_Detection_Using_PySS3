My mom is in hospice. I'm killing myself tonight because I can't be here to watch her die.I'm sorry mom. But it's just too much. I know everyone will say "don't do this, at least wait until she's gone." I can't. My fear of watching her die and the emotional pain of that is too much. Everything I read on the internet is about how much life hurts after losing a parent and how it never gets easier, and I want no part of that.

I bought a gun. I guess thank God for bad gun laws in the US. This will be the easiest way. For the first time in forever I feel genuine excitement. To finally be free of this agony.
