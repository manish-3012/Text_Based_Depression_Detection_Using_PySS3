Iâ€™m sorry but I just canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™m tired of not being able to sleep, not being able to enjoy anything, and constantly unable to keep food inside of me and constantly having headaches. I canâ€™t live with my family, I canâ€™t live with online classes, and I canâ€™t live when nobody fucking cares at all. I canâ€™t live like this. Iâ€™m constantly visualising different ways of killing myself, suicide notes, locations everything. I just canâ€™t live like this...
