Next thursday is most likely going to be my last day alive I will probably end my life.10 yrs ago i moved into some low income apartments the manager back then told me i didn't need to put my income down because i was a cotenent. me never living in apartments before i didn't know if it was real or not so i went with what she said. no income. fast forward to now. 9 managers later and new owners of the apartments later. the landlord asked if i had income i told her yes. i put it down. showed her proof of income. they said thursday we have to sit down with the head corporate of housing authority and talk about what will be done. the manager said there could be legal action she doesn't know. all she knows is thursday we have to sit down and talk to them about it. idk what to do at this point. I contacted legal aide, they told me there is nothing they can do to help me until I am told what the housing authority is going to do. I need help. I m freaking out badly. i can't breath im shaking, im crying nonstop. im a hysterical mess. i have cptsd, and being around men triggers it badly, if they are going to arrest me, i will be a serious mental case and break down. i don't know what to do. im already starting to freak out so badly.

if they do say they are going to arrest me or have me arrested or evicted, etc I will end my life. I literally can't be through with that. I as in jail for a week at age 18 for family dispute and being around those guys in there I was a horrible mental mess. had to go to the county jail clinic several times for severe anxiety. no way i can survive in prison if they decide to go that route.
