Death is my salvation.I don't have any friends. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have aspergers. I have ADHD. I have a fear of all medication. I have no way to treat this. I have suicidal thoughts. I have never been normal. I'm always bullied. I have no positive social interaction. I have no social skills. I have an easy way out. I have the ability to kill myself.
