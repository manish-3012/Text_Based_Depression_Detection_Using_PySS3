Life is too hard and I just want to die.I've come to a point where I don't care if I come across as weak to normal people. The truth is, I have nothing to look forward to in this life. Everything just seems so bleak. I can only distract myself for so long until  I inevitably and it all. Oh well,  I guess I'll stick around until I find a way that is easier and painless.
