I donâ€™t see a point in life anymore.I just donâ€™t feel like being alive anymore, I just think that nobody would care. My parents wouldnâ€™t, I have no friends, and I donâ€™t want to feel anything anymore. I have extreme social anxiety and I care about what everyone thinks of me, and I have a condition that makes me feel like I donâ€™t deserve and love, respect, friendship, family, money, an education, or anything. I want to just kill myself and get it over with. I donâ€™t see a point in life anymore, i try to keep myself from ending it all but Iâ€™m losing hope. Thank you.
