im seriously contemplatingits been about six months since i was last depressed. lately its just all came back in a wave. all of my friends keep ignoring me. school work is piling up. im so sad and i dont know why. it seems like no body i know cares. i have even told one of my friends i was feeling sad and they just left me on read. it feels bad that youve invested so much into a relationship with someone and now they just ignore you when you need them the most. shell be on calls with other people and ill text her and shell be like sorry im on call with one of our friends and im like can i be in the call too? and she just leaves me on read. i feel like my friends dont care about me anymore. i feel so alone in this world. every once in a while ill get away from my depression again and ill think ive gotten better but it always comes back.
