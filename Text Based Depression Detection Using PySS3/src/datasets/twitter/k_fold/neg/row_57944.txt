Overwhelmed and need to talk with someone- 28, M
        
- I'm extremely socially isolated. Always was a loner but it's grown severe. Lost all my friends gradually over the past few years. Some due to my own neglect, others due to them dropping me, others I actively burnt bridges with. I speak maybe 100 words a week at most. Half those are hi and bye to my 1 coworker. Others are cashiers and such. The only person I converse with is my therapist I see once a month. 
         
- Diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum just a couple months ago. What good does knowing now do me? Would've been helpful to know as a kid. I don't know what to do with the information now
          
- I don't trust my family, you might even say I hate my family. they're stupid, ignorant, emotionally unavailable and overall just not a source of support
         
-  I hate my job and would quit in a second if I could. but i'd default on my mortgage, utilities, other payments etc. immediately. like, not in a few weeks. the first week i don't have an income, it'd be over. i'm trapped.  
        
- i've been gradually growing more and more emotionally unstable but lately, past month-ish it's taking over. I'm crying a lot and at any time. sometimes at work and I have to hide so no one will see me. 

- I feel like I'm losing control. doing crazy things. last week in traffic I passed someone on the right shoulder opf the road and then ran a red light to escape the situation.  
        
- i've thought about suicide a lot. i've thought of plans. researched methods. the scary thing is when i used to think of suicide it would be a thought that came with a bunch of dread, guilt, fear, but lately the thought just brings relief. 
         
- my therapist has urged me to call the local distress centre if i'm feeling suicidal. but i don't trust them. they can and will trace your call to the cops if they think you're a danger to yourself. and records of your call, according to their own confidentiality disclaimer, could be subpoenaed in legal proceedings!
