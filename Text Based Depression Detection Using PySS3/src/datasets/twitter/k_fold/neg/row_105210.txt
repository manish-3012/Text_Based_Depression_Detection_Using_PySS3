I want to kill myself after my baby is bornLong story short my boyfriend and I were looking at c# videos to use to make a video game, I'm a little spacy without my ADHD medications and I'm unusually tired from my pregnancy. I was paying attention to the video just ripping my nails while I do it, he looks at me kicks me out of the project. I told him your being unfair without even giving me a chance we argued I walked back said fuck you to him but in front of his cousin's room, he got upset. When we were away from them he hit me three times on my arm and I cried. He doesn't sit down and talk he just shuts me down. Whenever he sees me sad for days he would sit down and take me more serious. I feel there's like no point and I have nobody.
