A slow, little deathI've struggled for years with depression, suicidal ideation and borderline personality disorder. Multiple failed suicide attempts have left me partially handicapped.

I dont drink much (maybe 2 or 3 glasses of wine a month) but my liver is failing. 

I was supposed to get more blood work done to figure out the cause (probably autoimmune) but between C19 shutting everything down, I cant get anything done. 

 My blood work is always all over the place anyway.

I've been anemic for about 2 weeks, my stomach is severely distended from ascites, i have awful bruising all over my body, my SOB is getting worse and just getting up to feed the dogs feels like I ran a marathon. I'd be surprised if I dont show signs of jaundice by next week. 

I'm a mid level practitioner, so I know this will be a painful road ahead. I'm just done.

I'm beyond furious that the hospital I work at has restarted non essential surgeries. Between capitalism and dipshit people walking around, I hope it ends the way we all hope it's going to end.

I'm in relatively good shape otherwise. I'm a very healthy  weight (low side of normal), I eat pretty good, I floss everyday, I go to work, etc.

Honestly, I'd rather not get the blood work and skip whatever treatment they'd like to put me on. It would be slow death but I could cash out a part of my life insurance to live it up for a month or two.

A natural suicide....hopefully before the real apocalypse begins.
