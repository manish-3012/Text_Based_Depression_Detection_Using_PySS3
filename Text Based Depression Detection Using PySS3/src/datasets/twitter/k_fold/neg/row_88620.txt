The world is not designed for meSo, I'm ugly. I'm probably never going to find any love and die alone. I'm 20 years old and have never had a date. This has to do with the fact I'm unattractive. It's pretty noticeable what's wrong with me. Some people occasionally called me names when I was 12 but beyond that I never really got bullied.

Twice I got rejected. They said it had nothing to do with my appearance, which might be true, but definitely has played an extremely large factor in their decision to reject me.

I do have friends though. I asked a couple of them whether my 'condition' was noticeable and all of them said no. I know they only say no to make sure I'm not feeling terrible, but it makes me feel terrible because I know they lie.

Everyday I'm thinking about my condition. I'm so depressed about it I'm thinking about euthanasia. My friends don't know about this. They think I'm just living normal life, since I don't talk about this stuff with them.

I don't know how to behave around new people. I always have the feeling they think I'm weird or that something is wrong with me. 

I know I'm not the ugliest in the world but I'm definitely ugly. Comments like "you're probably not that ugly" are not helpful. Objectively spoken I'm just ugly. The world is not designed for ugly people. All they get is rejection, they are being bullied, they are considered less... All I feel is mental pain and I can't imagine a future where I'll be happy.
