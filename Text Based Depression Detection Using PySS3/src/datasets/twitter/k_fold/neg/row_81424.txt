I got out of bed to prepare for my suicideI took a shower, shaved my legs, drinking my coffee, Iâ€™ll miss coffee and cigarettes damn. Iâ€™m trying to clean my apartment so when someone finds me itâ€™s not a fucking mess, Iâ€™m thinking about doing a goodbye video instead of a letter. Iâ€™m scared my mom will blame someone, I just want to try and stop that. Iâ€™m scared, scared to die but also scared to survive. I started thinking about afterlife, I know itâ€™s dumb, but Iâ€™m scared it exists, thought about reincarnation too, scares me as hell. Iâ€™m crying for some reason, I donâ€™t feel relieved yet, Iâ€™m aware Iâ€™m just a loser giving up. Iâ€™m scared the pipe where Iâ€™m planing to tie the noose will break. Fuck Iâ€™m terrified, but I canâ€™t do this, Iâ€™m so lost. Iâ€™m already dead, itâ€™s just about ending my body functions now.
