Please help meFor the first time in my life I called a suicide hotline and the guy was very helpful. Unfortunately I had to cut it short because my family got home and I'm ashamed I called. What would they think if they knew. Would they think I'm insane? Have me committed? 

And my boyfriend? We both have issues with depression but I'm medicated for it. He's so supportive but I'm terrified to tell him I'm contemplating this. 

And my doctor. I lve been considering going to her and asking for something prn like Xanax or Ativan but idk what to do, or if I tell her about my call to the suicide hotline? Will that go in my record? I'm just... I don't know what to do anymore. Please someone help me

Edit: hey everyone, just wanted to let everyone know I'm okay. I told my family and my boyfriend. They were super understanding, and I just went to the doctor. He put me in contact with some resources and also prescribed me something as needed for anxiety and sleep. Thank you everyone for your concern and help ðŸ’™
