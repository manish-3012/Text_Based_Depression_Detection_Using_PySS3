I just dont see the pointIm 20 in uni for chemistry have a part time job i have friends i hang out with a lot but I just hate myself so fucking much I only ever thjnk about myself being dead or how I would go about killing myself i honestly hate myself more because there really isnt much reason for me to feel this which just makes me want to kill myself even moee i tried to when i was 15 I tried to hang myself and fucked it up, which makes me even more annoyed at the fact it didnt work
honestly dont know what to do anymore
