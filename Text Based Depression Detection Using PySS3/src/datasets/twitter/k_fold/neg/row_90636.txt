Why is it so hard to take my own adviceLogically, I know suicide isn't the answer. I've comforted and supported people to avoid thinking that and wholeheartedly believe it for their situation but once I feel worthless I jump to that. Honestly, no one needs me. I have a huge age gap with my siblings so my mom can focus on taking care of them. My friends have their own friends and my boyfriend lives far away so I'll probably be doing him a favor. It just feels like it would be a huge relief.
