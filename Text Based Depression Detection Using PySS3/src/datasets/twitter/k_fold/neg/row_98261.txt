Goodbye. My poem to my world.My best friend feels more distant by the day.
Her boyfriend hates me, he knows I'm in pain.
My girlfriend is lovely but she won't stay.
My guy friend is lost either way.

This nice friend in class stopped talking to me.
My best friends brother is unable to see.
My childhood friend was just a bully.
Her friends were mine and they left obviously.

This one girls cousin left my school
The girl herself herself was up to no good.
Some time ago a guy called me cute.
He left the country, I'm such a fool.

Between me and my parents there is only hate.
They told me they wished that I was straight.
I wish I was good but this is just fate.
How tell me how has it ended this way.

I won't get through this, I died in vain.
I know st peter won't call my name.
If I carry on it will stay the same.
You can't tell me everything will end up ok.

I better stop now, I'm running out of space to write.
I can't go on like this, I have lost my fight.
I'm saying it now, I'll end it all tonight.
There's nothing more for me to say but...

Goodbye
