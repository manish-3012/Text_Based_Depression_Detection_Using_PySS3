My kid is my roadblockSo, been living with clinical depression since 2002, been through somewhere between 14-17 medications, some in combination and some not. I have been in psychiatric ward twice. Once in 2005, closed ward for suicide attempt and once late last year, open ward, for ECT-treatment(Electrocshock). I'm as active as I can be, on days when it feels possible. I have been through cognitive therapy, neurotherapy, exercise regiments (that I follow on days when it feels possible. I don't want to be accused by doctors that my depressions stem from lack of exercise (36yo, 180cm, 83kg.) and pretty much every "flavor of the month" in psychiatric treatment.


I will go back in for another series of ECTs as soon as my therapist gives the "go", and after that is completed, I have tried everything. Sure, new medications, but after 16 years of trying that, I kind of lost faith in that.

**Sorry about the wall of text, now to the issue - My one roadblock from not slitting radial artery from wrist to elbow, is my 3-year old son. It's a very strong roadblock - for now. He's too young atm to understand that isolate myself in my "mancave", and my hope is to get much better by the time he (and his friends) DO understand what's happening, and why dad is being so weird. I feel like I'm working towards the clock, and atm, "completing" the ECT (I had 6, but normal is 10-12 with "refresh" every 2nd month) feels like the last chance, and maintaining the roadblock.** 


I just really needed to get this out, that you for reading if you managed through it all, and I hope you manage to create a great day for yourself.
