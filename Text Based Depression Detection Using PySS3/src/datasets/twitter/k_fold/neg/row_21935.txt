Last chance for meHi guys. I can't seem to move on after a huge loss in the Year Of Shit, 2019. The year that took my life away even if I'm still breathing. I don't like to talk about my loss because I get hardcore judged by people for whatever. But it broke me. I'm now trying TMS in a last ditch to save myself, but I'm still depressed in the early stages of the treatment and can't imagine a future  without my old life. Mostly I feel rage at the injustices of my repeated misfortunes, that's one thing only the people on here seem to grasp. You guys r awesome and I hope we all make it.
