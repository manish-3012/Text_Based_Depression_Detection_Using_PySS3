at an impassejust when things started to look up from this bleak existence everything came crashing down i met someone who i fell in love with but of course i canâ€™t ever have anything good happen i even thought i could open up about my feelings but that was stupid and selfish because nobody actually gives a shit about me iâ€™m always the butt of the joke iâ€™m â€œthat weird kid â€œ that gets funny looks in the hall iâ€™m mentally disabled always have i just wish people werenâ€™t so bad  at hiding that they find me a laughingstock i get ridiculed when i say that iâ€™m depressed so i hide it deep down and the people i considered my best and only friends find me a burden i have what i need to end my life here and know iâ€™ve just been waiting for anything good to happen but i feel like itâ€™s finally going to happen soon finally some momentary bliss after i push everyone i love as far away as possible so i can be happy for once
