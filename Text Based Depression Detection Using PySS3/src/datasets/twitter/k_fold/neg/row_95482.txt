I donâ€™t know whether to go to community college or a four year because I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m going to commit suicide or notIâ€™ve been thinking about this for a long time. I really want to go to a four year college because I donâ€™t want to kill myself at home while going to a community college. I also want out as soon as possible. However, my grades are lacking and if I decide to go to a community college, I can transfer to a better college. I donâ€™t want to live for an additional two years while attending community college. I just want to end my life.
