Sort of rambly but I feel like I need to talk/vent (trigger warning)I've had depression and anorexia since middle school, and I'm 20 now. My psychiatrist and therapist recently (within the last year at least) diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder, which is basically schizophrenia + depression. I feel like everyday it's just so difficult for me to even get out of bed and go to classes, and about 75% of the time, it doesn't work. I can't leave my apartment. I haven't left my apartment for the last 2 days, and though I haven't felt suicidal in a while, I can't think of the last time I felt genuinely happy and all I can think of is how hopeless everything is and that I'll always be like this, depressed and hearing voices and seeing things and not being able to go out and have fun. My doctor told me when I was hospitalized that suicide is something that people consider when they run out of coping mechanisms or when their coping mechanisms aren't sufficient for the problems they are facing, and it seems to me that I've run out of methods to deal with my problems. The only thing that I can think of that is stopping me from shooting myself in the mouth or overdosing is the thought of my parents and how sad they would be. I keep thinking that once my parents grow old and pass away, I'll be able to kill myself and not have to worry about people being too distressed. I don't know what to do anymore, and I don't see my therapist and psychiatrist until the end of this month/early next month (respectively).
