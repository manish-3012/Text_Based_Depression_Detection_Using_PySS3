Iâ€™m scaredItâ€™s been about two years since I attempted suicide. The help I received after leaving the hospital did nothing. I stopped going to my psychiatrist and therapy sessions only the months later. When I went to my psychiatrist I felt as if he didnâ€™t believe a word I told him. He treated me as if I was a waste of time because my problems werenâ€™t as â€œsevereâ€. Therapy just felt wrong to me, I could never open up. I havenâ€™t been okay this whole time. Iâ€™ve been self harming in the bathroom and more recently starving myself. Waking up this morning was hell, I got a call from my boss asking me to come back to work on Monday and I agreed. 
I will not be back on Monday, I wonâ€™t even live to see the sunrise tomorrow. I will be leaving this world today. Because third time is the charm, right?
