What's the point of going on?I honestly can't find a valid reason to go on. 
I'm surrounded be people but have never felt more alone. No matter how much I try to find a place I belong I can't. I see my family happy smiling enjoying there lives and I envy them. I barely fit it with them. Hell they know jack shit about me. I feel isolated from people and I'm starting to have trouble even feeling "normal". I feel like I'm losing that last part of me that's able to be happy and I'm scared.  Scared that once that part of me is gone I'll just be a shell. Walking around feeling nothing, belonging to no where. I rather be dead than go through that, but no matter how hard I fight it. It feels inevitable, like I'm fated to be alone. I can't stand it. Why don't I belong?
