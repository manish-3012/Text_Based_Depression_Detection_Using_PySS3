I will be dead within a weekObviously I can't talk to anyone in real life about this, since that would disrupt my plans, but I felt the need to tell someone. I don't have anyone I can talk to anymore about this kind of thing, as I've pushed everyone away in preparation for getting to this point. I wish I could do it right now, but I'll maximize my chances of 'success' in a few days.

I'm sorry I'm such a failure. I've wasted my potential and my life. From the outside I look somewhat successful, but it's all a facade. Long term, this is the correct decision.

Goodbye, everyone. I wish I could say it's been worth it.
