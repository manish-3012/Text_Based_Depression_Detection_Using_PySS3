I am so tired.I'm just so tired of living. Too scared to die, too tired to live. So here I am.

I was molested as a child, beaten often as a young child/teen, developed eating problem from it and weigh 400 lbs and never been able to get the weight off. 

I've went in for mental health treatment, nothing helps for my anxiety other than benzos (which I have been on for years,now) and there are no SSRI's, SNRI's, MAOI's that have worked fro my depression. I've tried all of them over the years. I started treatment at age 13, I'm 20 now. 

I'm still fat, I have no job and live with parents, I used to be able to play the guitar pretty well but then I developed a health issue with my joints and can no longer play, and on top of it I'm addicted to opiates because I A) Hurt, and B) have mental illness that has so far been treatment resistant. It's goddamned miserable. 

I'm lucky I at least have one true friend and a good father whom I live with (he got custody of me at age 14, and I've lived with him ever since), but I'm just wearing down. Especially with everything going on in the world. It's just all so. . . exhausting.
