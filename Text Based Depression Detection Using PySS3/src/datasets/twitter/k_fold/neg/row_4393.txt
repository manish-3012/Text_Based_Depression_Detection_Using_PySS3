A reason....Please....My life is absolutely nothing.  I am completely alone.  Day in and day out, I spend alone, no human interaction.  I have no friends.  My dreams have all been crushed.  I tried to do what I wanted to do in life, and failed.  I have no social skills, never have, never can.  People like me are just destined to this.  

I have come to realize that absolutely NO ONE in this world likes me or loves me for who I am.  My parents don't even love me for who I am. My friends don't/are all gone, and finally, the love of my life, the only person that I have ever loved, the person that was going to marry me and have children with me, the person that told me they would be with me to the end, the person that said they wanted to die next to me, left me as well.  I have learned that no matter what anyone says, there can be no long-term value placed behind it.  I have learned that I could just disappear today, and no one would care.  No one would even notice for quite a while.  Nothing brings me happiness anymore.  I can't stand going to bed in tears, and waking up in tears, knowing that I am completely alone forever after all.

I beg someone.  Please.  Just give me a reason to live.  I can't think of any, and it's all I want.
