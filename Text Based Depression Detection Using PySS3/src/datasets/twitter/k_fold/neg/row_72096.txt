I donâ€™t want a lifetime of pain, loneliness and rejection. Maybe I should just kill myself.Ive been struggling to keep friends for years. I recently made a new friend. Sheâ€™s funny, we have lots in common and really get along. I looked forward to being bffs, and having a lifetime of happy memories. She made me happier and a better person. 

Then she introduced me to her guy friend. He started asking me to hang out. I went along with it cause I liked the company but realized he was interested. I asked my friend how to let him know I just want to be friends. She said, donâ€™t mention it until he does. 

Then, she told him to go for me and said exactly what to say/do. The next time we hung out he said he liked me. He was acting so romantic I considered it. I told him this. But ultimately Iâ€™m not interested in that way. He kept asking me to hang out afterwards and it was making me uncomfortable. I told him I was busy. 

A few days later my friend and I went out for drinks. She kept reminding me that I lied to him that I was busy, that she would have to see him later, knowing that I lied. And she felt so sorry for him because he was sad about me. She kept mentioning how sad he is. I feel like sheâ€™s not a real friend. Maybe I couldâ€™ve handled this situation differently too. 

I almost saw a future full of friendship and love but now itâ€™s gone. I have no one, and I can never hold onto friendships. Iâ€™m barely holding onto my job, and living with an abusive lady but struggle to find a new living situation. 

Iâ€™m so traumatized and have such severe social anxiety that itâ€™s hard to interact with people in day to day life. It was really getting better with this girl but I feel that sheâ€™s gone. It would devastate me if this kept happening and I could never keep friends. I donâ€™t want a lifetime of pain loneliness and rejection. Maybe I should just end it all.
