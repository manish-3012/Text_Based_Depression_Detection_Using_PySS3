HopelessI just spent the last 45 minutes on the phone with the national suicide prevention hotline. Aside from asking a few questions (are you alone, are you planning on hurting yourself, etc), the person I talked to really only repeated what I said. Iâ€™d say my health issues/living situations/relationship were affecting me drastically, and all he said back was, â€œso it sounds like youâ€™re having health/financial/relationship issuesâ€ and then ask me to repeat what I literally had just said. Then afterwards not offering any words or advice or even a, â€œitâ€™ll get better.â€ He just kept asking me to repeat myself. Towards the end of the call, he essentially said, â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s much I can do for you. Are you okay enough right now to get off the phone?â€ 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel so stuck, in almost every way I can be. Iâ€™m trying so hard to get my license and get a job and help myself, but I keep having uncontrolled seizures and Iâ€™m so scared Iâ€™ll never be able to help myself. My anxiety crippled me to the point where I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to get a job and handle it appropriately, no matter how badly I want to. My boyfriend says heâ€™s going to break up with me because of finances, though he doesnâ€™t pay for anything for me and the few dollars I scrape together I give to him so he can continue to have a home. Iâ€™m homeless, trying to pay for my insulin, food, meds for my seizures, HSV medication, Iâ€™m trying not to break down every second of the day or disappoint my dad by ending it. I just feel so fucking hopeless and scared and I donâ€™t think I can keep doing this. I feel my brain deteriorating from this constant stress and sadness and anger and anxiety, my memory is so bad I canâ€™t even remember key parts of a conversation I had this morning or even who it was with. Iâ€™m breaking down over the smallest things. Iâ€™ve lost about 40 pounds in a month and a half. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to keep living like this
