don't see a point.i don't think theres a point to live honestly. i mean is there really any point? the things i wanna do for a career don't make much money but i know things that do but i dislike them. i'm not really interested into going to college honestly. i just feel like i have to to be successful. honestly i'd rather just kill myself. death is inevitable. so why even keep going? i don't enjoy my life. i don't like many people around me or i'm just neutral on them. i feel like no one would ever love me if they knew i was depressed. so i'd have to go all my life not telling anyone about it. and plus i already feel so alone and it seems like thats gonna be the rest of my life. i don't see why i just go on if i won't ever enjoy my life. i'll just be a sad man who does some stupid job which he hates. probably won't kill myself now. but i see myself when i'm like 30 so alone and hopeless i just end it.
