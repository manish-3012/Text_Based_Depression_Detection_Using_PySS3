A nothing personI find no enjoyment in anything. My soul has been crushed by narcissistic parents and a verbally/physically abusive ex boyfriend of 3 years. No one cares about my existence yet they wouldn't dare let me opt out. I'm not funny, cute, sexy, talented, smart, or passionate about anything. I used to be. Now all I am is tangled up headphones. A pain in the ass and more trouble than they're worth. No one wants to hear me speak. No one cares about my pain. I feel contagious, awkward. Like an opposing magnetic force that pushes everyone way inevitably. This is not living. The person inside me has died, and I'm just keeping this shell alive. For who though? People who don't care about me? What kind of silly joke is that. No one cares. No one cares. No one cares. I feel like I'd be better off dead.
