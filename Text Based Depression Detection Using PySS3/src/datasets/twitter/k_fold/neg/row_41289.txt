Sweet November[This is the reason](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wdy3r/25f_advice_dealing_with_husbands_24m_affair/) for the most part... I set the date months ago, November 19 of this year. I thought that we wouldn't be back together this soon, hell that we probably wouldn't be back together by November 19 so it was a go. Now I am struggling trying to feel whole and recover from this but sometimes just ending it sounds so much better. I don't think I'll be any more whole in November than I am now. I just want it to be over. I just want to not be here and not feel this way anymore.

I don't want to wait till November. I want it now.
