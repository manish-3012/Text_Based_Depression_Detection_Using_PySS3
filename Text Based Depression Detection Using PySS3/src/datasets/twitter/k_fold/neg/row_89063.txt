So close to kill myself and end all the pain.Why am i still alive, i should have been dead a long time ago. Why was i even born? Do i even have a purpose? Lol. Do i have to wake up every morning? Why cant i die in my sleep? 

Why have all these dark thoughts taken over my mind?

Whats wrong with me?

My thoughts are eating me alive.
