GuiltyHey. 

I felt like I had so much to say because I had my inner monologue. And an outer one. It felt real, and raw. Now that I post here, I'm at a loss for words. 

I'm tearing as I sit here at my desk, contemplating life, thinking about how we got here. How my afternoon went. How everything just happened to push me to this point today. How you got to reading my post. It's funny how certain things just have to line up. 

You could have took a nap and missed this. Maybe I'll delete this post sometime later and you would have never have seen it.

I wouldn't do it, though. Suicide that is. My ex's older sister did that in December 2018. And my closest friend did that in February of 2020. Were either of them surprises? I would like to say yes, but no, they were not. 

Why wouldn't I do it? Who would I let down? My team, my coworkers, my manager. My brother, I'm his best man. I have to give a speech sometime in October, I can't miss that. At least I think it's October. 

I don't want anyone to feel guilty. Who would feel guilty? My family, my 'friends', my ex of an 8 year relationship, my coworkers, my therapist, my online friend. 

And now you.

Would I feel guilty? Would I be letting myself down? I'm okay, I promise.
