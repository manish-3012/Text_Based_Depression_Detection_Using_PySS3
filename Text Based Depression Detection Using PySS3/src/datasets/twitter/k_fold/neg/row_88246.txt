Things can't get better.When things look like they are finally  getting better, life says ,"fuck you." and just reminds you that things aren't actually getting better. 

I moved schools ,and decided to graduate early at 16 instead of waiting until next year. I don't have any friends at my school. I've been there for a few weeks. I don't know anyone. I just work at school then go home and read. And it was working. I was alright. I thought I was doing okay. Then he hurt me. And I can't stop thinking about it and blaming myself. And all of the problems masked so well earlier came up again and I feel worst than I ever have. 

I know other people have been raped and have been strong. I'm not strong, I'm weak. I can't take it anymore
