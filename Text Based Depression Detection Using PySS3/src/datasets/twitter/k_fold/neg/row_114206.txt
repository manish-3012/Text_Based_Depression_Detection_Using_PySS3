I'm in desperate need of urgent help...One of my best friends, who is 1,500km away currently, has given me very good reason to believe that he's about to off himself, if he hasn't already. I don't know his friends in the area, nor his family. He recently moved to a little town in the mountains and none of us (his friends) know his current address or any other helpful info. What am I to do!? A friend who is nearer (but still far away) is calling the local cops, now what?

I'm panicking. Please, somebody, help!
