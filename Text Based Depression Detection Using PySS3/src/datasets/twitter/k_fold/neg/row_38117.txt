Parents called me a disappointment to my face and I'm tired of it. I just wanna leaveI just recently turned 17 and everything hit me like a bag of bricks. I'm failing school and my mother put me on house arrest bc of it. Now my house makes my anxiety flair up like a bitch. And me being here 24/7 with no break doesn't help. It's winter break and I've been going out bc I hate it here. Now when my mother told me I couldn't go out and took my keys. Anxiety got worse, she got mad bc I was freaking out and crying, and I felt helpless. Now the battle with my mother about getting me to a doctor for my depression had been ongoing since I was 13. The razor helps me but now I have my bf talking me out of cutting. I can't see him so I'm stuck in this internal battle of immense sadness, anger, frustration, and anxiety. Idk what to do at this point...help?
