......I think it's time for me end it.
Can't get job, can't get an education.
Can't afford rent.
Don't have any friends.
Don't like people. I'm an outcast. Society wont even accept me.
Not worth trying anymore. failure that's all I know and, thats what people think of me. Only wish I have is for people not to come to my funeral.
