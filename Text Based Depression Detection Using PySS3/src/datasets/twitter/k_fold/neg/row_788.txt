GuiltyFor context, I have a scat fetish, donâ€™t judge please, I didnâ€™t choose to have it.     
     
A while ago, when I was like 17, I was at a gathering and watched a high school girl go upstairs where I knew the bathroom door didnt shut all the way. Knowing this, I went upstairs after them and hid in a bedroom trying to hear them use the bathroom. I honestly donâ€™t remember what happened after that but I think I thought about intentionally walking in on them. I donâ€™t remember them leaving the bathroom and  im pretty sure i didnt even hear anything but I feel like I violated their privacy. I feel super guilty about this and have been agonizing over it for weeks. I feel like this is the furthest extent of my fetish and that it took over in my head and overruled my moral judgement. I think of myself as no better than a rapist or something because of this, even though I know itâ€™s irrational. I canâ€™t get over this. I also have depression and OCD
