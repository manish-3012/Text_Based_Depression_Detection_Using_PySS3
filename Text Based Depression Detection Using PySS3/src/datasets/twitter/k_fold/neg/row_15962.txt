I'm Jay and I want to kill myselfI feel depressed whenever I go to classes, friends to me are just people who pity me and would try to leave my side after a few months. In my mind I think that no one in my life likes me, I have written a suicide note. I have never told anyone about this problem because well, I'm too afraid to do it. I try to take my mind off it using the writing method but through some event during the day the thought always comes back to me.
