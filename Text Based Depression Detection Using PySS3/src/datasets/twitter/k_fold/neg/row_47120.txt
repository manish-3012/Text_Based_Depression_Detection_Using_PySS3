How much longer do I have to live anyway?How many times do I have to go to bed hoping not to wake up in the morning? I mean, come on, 25% of the nights I just don't ever want to wake up. Isn't there a peaceful God that will let me just pass in my sleep? It's getting to the point that I'm going to have to take the reins on this and do it myself.
