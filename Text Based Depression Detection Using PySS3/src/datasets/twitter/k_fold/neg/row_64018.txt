I am getting closer everydayEverything I am capable of achieving without luck is not worth achieving. So why even bother? I don't wanna wait for a miracle anymore. People tell me that there is always a way to be happy but they have no idea about the life I am living. I am sure there is someone in a worse situation than me but knowing that doesn't helps a bit. I don't even know what I except typing out this stupid thoughts.
