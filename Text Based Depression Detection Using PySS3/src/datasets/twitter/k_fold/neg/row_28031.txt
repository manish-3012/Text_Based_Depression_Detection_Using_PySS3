i wish i didnâ€™t have cowardice tendencies so i could just end myselfLife is so unbearable. i think itâ€™s a little bearable when you are able to choose a struggle, but when everything is a struggle, you lose your sanity. 

sometimes i stare into the distance with great shock because is this really my life? is this all there is? pain and never ending mental and emotional torment?
