How much to tell counselor?Suicide is basically always on my mind and has been for years. It's something I've thought about as long as I can remember, but I haven't really taken it seriously because I've never gone as far as making an attempt. I just go through cycles of being basically ok to hating myself and everyone and everything in the world, not wanting to be alive, and barely being able to stand being around other humans. I hate the idea of counseling, but I've decided to try it because my job right now offers a few free sessions and requires me to be around people for like 10 hours a day and when I feel really bad and people mess with me, I get mean and I cry more, which is really embarrassing and extends my wanting to die phase. 

I need to know how much is ok to tell a counselor. If I admit to having suicidal thoughts and fantasies, should I be concerned that she might initiate some kind of intervention in my life or will I be safe if I don't say I have specific plans? My family finding out about this is my worst fear.
