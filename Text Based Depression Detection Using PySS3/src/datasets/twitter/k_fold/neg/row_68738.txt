Not even sure what to call this...Long story short I'm a pretty shitty person. I only have three real friends and I feel like I'm just a burden to all of them and I let them down all the time. Thats why I'm not talking to them about this really. They have better things to worry about then some worthless person like me. I don't even know why they care. I'm not worth it. A lot of their problems are my fault Because I had the power to prevent most of them but I did nothing. I feel like the longer I'm here the more I will destroy their lives. I feel like it would hurt them to know I'm trying to talk to strangers before I talk to them but if anything that just proves I am a shitty friend. But I know if i tried to talk to them they wouldn't be interested or they would be to busy or something. I really don't know. Sometimes I feel like they act like my friend even when they don't want to be.  Plus it would probably just be a waste of their time anyways. Thats all I am is a waste.  I'm supposed to be leaving for the military in June. I saw it as a way to get away from my home and to let my friends live their lives the way they deserve. I don't deserve them as friends. But I don't see the point anymore. I'm sure I would screw up in the Army too and that can get people killed. I don't know. I just think the world would be a better place without me. Sorry. I'm sure everyone has better things to do then read this.
