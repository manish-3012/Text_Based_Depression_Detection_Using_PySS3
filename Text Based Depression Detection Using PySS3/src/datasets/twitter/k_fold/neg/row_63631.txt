Ok, so I've recently started working at my church/grade school(where she and I went to) as a part time janitor/maintenance guy. That means I have been once again roaming the halls of where I spent the first 10 years of my school life, and well...how can I stop the memories from coming back. It's like I'm back at those days and how can I not stop thinking about her? Being in the classroom where I used to sit and think about her, in the gym where we danced, and especially the halls where we'd stare at each other as we passed by each other. Oh, how my heart aches. It takes all I can to keep myself from crying infront of my boss and coworkers. I can't help it, being back where it all took place, it's just a big reminder that I failed and it's all over and I'm NOT going to get a 2nd chance! I know, I sound like emo, but please remember, I've gone through my whole life(25 years) and only had this 1 girl give me ANY kind of attention, so when you don't get much support or attention, well you can't help but feel unwanted, invisible, and depressed, and these feelings arent' going to go away if this remains constant. I'm glad I got this job, but it's been very hard for me to put on a brave face and pretend like I'm not thinking about something painful.
