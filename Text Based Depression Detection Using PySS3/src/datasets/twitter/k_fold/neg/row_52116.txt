No contact with my twin flameI (25 f) got into an altercation with my bf (24 m) and too much alcohol was involved and things happened that would never without alcohol. Both of us have PTSD and have struggled with mental health issues our whole lives and while things transpired that have made me really have to take a long hard look at our relationship, and myself. I feel so empty without him, I'm so incredibly codependent. I've completely set myself on the back burner to just throw myself into him, not that I'm sure I'd be doing too much anyways like he saved me from addiction and took me out of a really negative place. He's my absolute rock and my everything. I found a job near his place and he was moving forward in his life, I was starting to have healthier thoughts and feel a little better, and then I get violently ripped from him. He's shown me what kind of life I can have, he's shown me to choose life over drugs, I don't think I've ever sincerely felt love before him. I've been away from him for a week and it's the longest we've spent apart since we started dating a year ago. I'm trapped in a hotel room with nothing but my thoughts, I legally can't go home, I can't do anything but just dwell on this .
