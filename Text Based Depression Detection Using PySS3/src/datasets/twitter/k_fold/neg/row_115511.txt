Should I be homeless or just kill myself?I live in AR, a state with shitty tenant laws. I live in a cheap apartment which is constantly filled with smoke, noise, and bugs. I have autism and cannot cope with this, and I can't afford to pay for an apartment with no smoking or noise policies. Should I just kill myself or try being homeless first?
