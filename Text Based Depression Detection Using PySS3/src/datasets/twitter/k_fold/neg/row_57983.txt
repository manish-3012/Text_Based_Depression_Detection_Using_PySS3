I'm 31 years old, about to graduate with a degree in chemistry and I will most likely take my life soon after achieving that goal. This is my story. I got married when I was 20 to run away from an abusive and dysfunctional house to find myself only to be married to a cruel human being. I lost myself and wore a mask to stay safe from daily criticism, most things I did were for him. He blames me regularly and yells at me everyday, a level of devaluation that I don't think most understand. For 11 years I'd continue to pick myself up and try to find hope in a world outside of this one. For a moment I had a glimpse into that life when I made a friend at school, unfortunately he used my low self esteem and need for help and support to abuse me as well. It's uncanny how the two of them say such incredibly similar stuff to me. Now their voices echo in tandem in my head. I have no family support and I'm drafting a will. I still do my daily activities to the most part without interruption and have realized quickly not to talk about my plans. Unfortunately sometimes the only way to get out of something is to really get out of it. I hope my kids forgive me and know how much I love them but I can't have them see me being treated like this and I'm so sad I failed them.
