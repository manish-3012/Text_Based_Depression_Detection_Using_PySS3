My sister and her boyfriend moved across the country Thursday and now I have no oneMy sister and her boyfriend moved away Thursday. They had been living with my mom and I for about 2 months in our basement to prepare for the move. I wasn't even really upset until they were actually gone. (This is all about my sister. Her boyfriend is a good dude but this isn't about him, just a side note) I'm a 16 year old male (11th grade) and I have bad social anxiety, so my sister was my only friend. She was the only one I could go to with my problems (both my parents are in my life and I love them but they can be hard to communicate with). She has the same parents and almost always understand what I'm going through. She relates to me probably more than anyone. I've cried a few times since she left and I'm not even a big cryer. I get very upset whenever I go into the basement half expecting her to be there but all their stuff is gone and the basement is empty. I also go back to school tomorrow, as we had been on a week long break for thanksgiving. The stress is piling on and I don't know how to deal with this. I miss my sister so much. This is only a recent problem, add this onto my social anxiety, depression, and OCD and I don't think I can go on much longer. I don't want to die but I want to stop feeling so constantly shitty, so I do want to die in that regard, if that makes sense.
