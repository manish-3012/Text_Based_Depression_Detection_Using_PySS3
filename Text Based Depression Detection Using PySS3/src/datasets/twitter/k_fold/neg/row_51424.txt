I'm trying to find a way out but I can'tI looked for any therapy, anyone really, to tell me what is wrong with me but I can't find any. There are CLSC that are free but the waiting list is over a year and I probably won't make it until then. Psychologists and therapists are way too espensive for my budget and I dont have a family doctor to check up on me. I tried seeing a psychologist at my school but they aren't there half the time so there's also a huge waiting list. I get that's the case most places but right now I really need the help, i've been having suicidal thoughts for months and have an history of self-harm.


The one person that did hear me out couldn't really tell me what I have or give me medication as they aren't a professional. At the very least, someone knows.


I want to get better but I can't even figure out what my damn problem is. If anyone has an idea, please, please let me know.
