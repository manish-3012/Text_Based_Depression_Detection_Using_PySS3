I think Iâ€™ve reached my limitI go from â€œokayâ€ to completely suicidal within seconds. I get sad over the dumbest things. For example, if I see someone eating alone I get sad. Iâ€™ve always taken everything personally and to heart. It doesnâ€™t take much to make me cry. I sometimes get random overwhelming urges to bawl my eyes out too. Such small insignificant things can ruin my whole day. Iâ€™ve already ruined so many countless days for myself. I can read one silly Reddit comment or one irrational thought. Thatâ€™s all it takes to push me down. That one bad thought or comment will make me feel self-conscious throughout the whole day and keeps me from talking. Iâ€™m also sensitive as hell. If I speak in a group chat and no one responds, I will dwell on it for hours with the thought as Iâ€™m not liked. Deep down I know I have friends that care yet I still feel alone. I KNOW I have friends, yet I feel like I have no friends (I canâ€™t explain this feeling). I feel my heart hurting everyday. That â€œpain, pressure, tightnessâ€ physical feeling in my chest. Even when my thoughts stops, that constant, dull feeling of sadness still lingers. It hurts so bad to the point where I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. Iâ€™m tired of waiting for things to get better. I just want to escape my suffering and the only option I see is to completely erase my existence.
