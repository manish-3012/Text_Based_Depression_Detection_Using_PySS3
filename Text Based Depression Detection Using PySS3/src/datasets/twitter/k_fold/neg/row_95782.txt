Can anyone spare time to talk please? Attempted suicide. No friendsCan anyone spare time to talk? I know its a long shot but I have NOBODY to talk to and no friends and I just need to get a few things off my mind that's driving me crazy. I attempted suicide and almost succeeded a week ago and I feel so helpless and weak as a person :( ive always felt this way but the last 6 months have been a lot worse

Thank you!
