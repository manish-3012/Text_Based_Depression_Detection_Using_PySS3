Hey first postI have a decent background, no abuse or anything, not diagnosed w depression or any of that. But I just have 0 will to live and lots of existential crisis. I mean Iâ€™m just so bored with this life, Iâ€™d rather just kill myself and see whatâ€™s next.  I canâ€™t do that though bc I have people who care about me and shit also i can be v selfless but Iâ€™m just so damn bored and these days just drag on and Iâ€™ve got so many years to live yet. If anyone can relate to this, please tell me how you deal w having to exist.
