My girlfriend wants to commit suicide please help?My girlfriend has been severely depressed and wants to commit suicide. Her depression has been getting worse lately and has started cutting vertically on her wrist along with deep cuts on her: Legs, Wrists and belly and has been thinking deeply about how she wants to go. She refuses to go to the doctors or go to a therapist because she states that they do not help and will tell her parents. She doesn't want anyone to know and has never tried going to the doctors or therapist and she doesn't want to talk to strangers about it. I am the only person that knows about this and don't know what to do anymore because i'm deeply afraid that she will do something soon. please help, thank you
