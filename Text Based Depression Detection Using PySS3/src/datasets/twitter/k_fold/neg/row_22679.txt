People who donâ€™t want to die are the irrational ones to meI donâ€™t get this idea that itâ€™s a good thing to remain alive. Living is so painful. Especially whatâ€™s happening right now in the world I just keep having this feeling that there should be some opt out, like compassionate euthanasia for those who donâ€™t feel life is worth living. It should be a choice and I want to be able to choose freely to go.
