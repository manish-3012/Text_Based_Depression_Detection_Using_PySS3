The world hates me. Like the actual world. I don't want to be alive anymore. Whats the point?I have been treated badly by everyone in my life. I think Ive been a bad person but not on purpose. I get really anxious and easy out/ freak out. People often mistake what I mean or say and think I have an attitude even when I don't and tell them I don't. My grandma adopted me but and her and my mother , her daughter would laugh and say "she isn't my daughter you take her I don't want her". They and my aunt would laugh at me whenever I cried or was upset or they would scream at me. When I would ask for a hug they would recoil in disgust. My mother would punch me in the stomach as hard as she could. My aunt would scream at me whenever I would make any noise when she was watching me.

I was overweight so I was always teased and bullied. Even by teachers. I was called a "fat bitch" constantly and told "I should have just left you with your whore mother, Im going to take you back"

People are so mean to me even when Im nice. People laugh at me and gaslight me and try to confuse me. Whenever I'm talkative and nice they basically run away from me. When I don't say anything they make up lies and other me. 

I think I'm autistic as well.

People don't like me. The world treats me like shit and the older I get the more I realize how much they hate me. (Im a black woman so I'm treated like a dog)

Im too white for black people and Im too black for anyone.

I just want to stay in my apartment forever. Nothing makes me happy anymore . Whenever I find something to look forward to something I realize there is no point because I have no one to share it with.  Whenever I see other people happy I immediately realize how alone and useless I am.

I use to be so happy. I guess I was just too stupid to realize what the world wis. 

I have no family and no friends. Literally zero family. Literally zero friends. They are dead and I never had any. After high school when people were not forced to be in groups with me I didn't have real friends. I have people who deal with me for about a month then start showing signs that they hate me and that they don't want me around.

Im not fat anymore,I even thought I was pretty for a little bit until the world reminded me I was just a disgusting black girl.  I have done things to be proud of, Im nice but the world still hates me. Im shown hate everyday. In Starbucks, from bus drivers, from therapists and when I try to get help I'm dismissed. 

I wish I could just be happy. I wish I wasn't autistic or black or a woman or so different. If I could just blend in so people would treat me like a person, I would.
