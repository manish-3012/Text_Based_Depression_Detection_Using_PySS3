I'm close.I think about killing myself on a daily basis. I have been having these thoughts for the past couple months now. The only thing that is stopping me right now are my children. And when I say the only thing, I really mean, that's it. Sometimes though, I feel like maybe they would be better off without me anyway. They deserve someone better anyway. 

My husband cheated on me with one of my family members. He apologized and has been trying hard to make it up to me. That's not even really all of it though. My family knew and never told me. A lot (well, almost everyone) in my life has completely lied to me about this. I have absolutely no one in my life (with the exception of my kids) that are really there for me, or care about me. I come from a big family and to find this out and have my life completely change, has been so damaging. 

I think about ways to do this, so my kids will not find me or anyone else. I think I should just have them stay with a sibling and then come back to my house and before I hang myself, call the police, so no one but them, finds me. 

I am so close. I don't think I can live this way anymore. I can't do it.
