Can't take itThis might sound stupid, but here goes nothing. 

Ok, so i'm only 12. My parents have been divorced for a couple years now but they always had fights. Mom had some problems with drinking/drugs, so i live with my dad. I love my father, don't get me wrong, but sometimes i wish i could run away or just end it. He makes it seem like i can't do anything right, he always yells at anything i do wrong. He always wants to be right and gets angry if someone corrects him. I don't know why he gets so mad at me, it seems like he seldom gets mad at my other siblings. However, i'm doing the best in school and always try my best to respect him. He's always taking away my phone/playstation for very minor things such as being late to school, and one of my sisters gets to school late every day and isn't punished for it. He hits me sometimes, and that only makes things worse. I wish i had the confidence to tell him that yelling at me and hitting me doesn't improve me, it just makes me sad. I don't talk to him about this because i'm sure he'll just get angry at it and won't care. Once he saw a text to my friend saying that i was feeling depressed. What most people would do is help me out and be supportive of me, but instead he goes off yelling at me. There are some times where i just want to kill myself. I need help.
