A questionIf I'm going to kill myself eventually anyways, would it be worth it to go off and do my own thing for awhile. I want to just drive somewhere and not tell my friends or family where so they couldn't find me. This is something that I always fantasized about but I've never considered actually doing it until now. Escaping from my dull painful life never seemed so appealing.
I have about 4,000$ to my name which isn't much but it will last for at least a little while. After that I would just hang myself and be done. I just don't want to spend my last few days living my same old boring day to day life.
Would something like this be worth it?
