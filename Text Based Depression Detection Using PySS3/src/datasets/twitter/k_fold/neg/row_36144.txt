I need something differentSo in summary I'm not depressed-- I actually live a pretty happy life

I'm a teenager, my parents treat me well, me and my brother are basically best friends, I have a loving boyfriend, and I have many many fandoms and people in my life who I love. I'm very happy!

But I want more. I'm like a little kid in a lot of ways. I want to risk my life somehow. I want to be a firefighter. I want to be an astronaut. I want to be a police officer. And that's the start of it- when I see things like Batman or the Borderlands games, or just something exciting- i think how amazing would that be to stare danger right in the eye? I want to have more risk to my life. I want to stand on the tallest building in the world with no railing. I want to be able to climb a mountain. I need some sort of danger or excitement in my life, without, y'know, dying.

But now I'm having suicidal thoughts because of it. I want to slit my wrist, just for the pain and being on edge. I did slit my wrist about a year ago out of depression, but now I want it for the rush of thoughts and for something different.

I'm a teenager. My parents wont even let me walk around the block to my friend's house, or to the local convenience store .2 miles away without my big brother around. I need something new. I need an adventure.

And I'm starting to think that maybe suicide is that route-- who knows what could happen?? I need something different from staying home on my phone and going to school every day for a few months. I'm not even old enough to have a job and don't have any money. Who knows what could happen if I tried to kill myself? Would I meet someone new on a ledge, would I finally figure out what happens when we die, and would anyone be there to stop me?

Is there anyone else like me? Like is there a word for it? I know, I sound like a sick emo teen, but I'm seriously fascinated by the concept.
