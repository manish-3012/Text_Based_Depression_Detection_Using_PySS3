some lives just arenâ€™t worth living.looking at it logically, some peopleâ€™s lives are so joyful and they are happy there is no reason for them wanting to die they wanna live forever. but for people like me who donâ€™t have a lot of happiness come our way and our left to our own devices even in traumatic situations suicide is the logical solution to an end to all the pain and never ending depression and anxiety. 

iâ€™ll probably do it soon, but it doesnâ€™t matter way. ill die a statistic regardless
