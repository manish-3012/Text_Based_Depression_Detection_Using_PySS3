Nothing wrong with me?I have lived a very average life as an individual, with certain circumstances in my life being extra-ordinary. Before I get to those I would like to preface this by saying I have since middle school (age 11-13) had many suicidal thoughts.

My life has seemed to go from my own mediocre event to the next. Dating without finding someone who gets me, going in and out of shape, and having jobs that never fulfill me. Never once have I felt the, what i deem, needed passion to fuel someones life. Throughout college, which I still semi-attend, i have struggled to find a subject that clicks with me enough to stick with. Originally and on paper I am a history major, which to me (regardless of what I find interesting) means nothing. Not nothing as in without care, but nothing as in it holds nothing towards my future.

I realize that my generation, those born in the early 90's, are more depressed than our forefathers. Yet I still cannot hold back the need, no, want to just end it all. To finally reach Oblivian. A place where nothing I do can ever effect what the future lies.

I realize that the feeling of utter abandonment that my generation feels is nothing unique to myself; I cannot help but weep internally for how this epiphany makes my suffering feel selfish.

I day dream dream almost daily how I can find a way to end myself without ruining the daily running of those around me. Recently I made a deal with myself to wait until i am 32 in order to complete the act, with the stipulation being that I have not found my niche.

Going back to the extra ordinary facts of my life. My father was recently, within the past 2 years, been diagnosed with frontal temporal demenita. This realization is the only thing that has actually paused if not almost entirely halted my suicidal thoughts.  The utter selfishness of suicide is a constant struggle and understanding that I have.

I wish i could squash the thoughts i have of ending myself. I have a decent life, I should not be wanting to die. 

Essentially is there any advice or help that you can give me?

PS: I am sorry for the long winded post. It is just nice being able to vent without fear of judgement from my friends and family.
Please forgive my numeral grammatical mistakes
