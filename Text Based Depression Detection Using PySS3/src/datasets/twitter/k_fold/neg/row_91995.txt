I fucked upIâ€™m in my first year of college, did pretty well first semester, 4.0. Got overconfident, fucked up a lot this semester. I need a 3.7 to keep my scholarship that pays 80% tuition. After seeing what I got in my other classes, I saw I needed to keep a B in my last class I didnâ€™t have a final grade for. Needed an 84 on the exam to keep a B. Got an 83. No amount of cramming last minute could make up for not paying attention all year. I fucked up, lost this scholarship permanently. I donâ€™t want to keep living. It would be so much easier to just end it all than figure out a way to get that kind of money. So much easier. 

Iâ€™ve been depressed and wanting to die for a while, but never enough to consider killing myself until now. My girlfriend tries to help, but she gets really worried and stressed whenever we talk about this kind of stuff, so I donâ€™t wanna say anything to her about it. Should I?
