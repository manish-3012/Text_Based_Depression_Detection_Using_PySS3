Depression led to heartbreak that led to attempted suicide, I plan to try again.My parents (abusive, druggy father) are getting a divorce. It hasn't been pretty, more abuse and court cases. I can deal with that. I asked out a girl that I've been friends with for more than 6 years, she now hasn't said a word to me since telling me no. The night after I tried to kill myself by chugging a bottle of NyQuil. My friend stopped getting responses from me on Snapchat and broke into my house knowing something was wrong and saved my life. I should have died that night. Recently my mom was perscribed anti-depressants, and every day I have the temptation to take those and go to sleep forever.
