This might be a long one. I feel very low.There's a fair bit to this story so I want to apologise in advance if anyone decides to read this. 

I suffer from schizophrenia and depression, both of which are medicated. Despite my medication I feel that I don't have much relief from either of these conditions. It seems to be I'm untreatable as I have been given so many different combinations of drugs and none have ever worked. I have a history with drugs and recently have fallen back to smoking cannabis in an attempt to self-medicate. Let me just say I know this was fucking stupid and I really do feel guilty for this.

Last week I got an intense period where I heard voices (Which has happened in the past, however before being put on anti-psychotic medication) which led me to harm myself with a razorblade to the point that I needed stitches. I'm sitting here having torn these stitches out and I really don't know why. I can't go back to be restitched, the way they look at someone with self inflicted injuries will just make me feel worse. 

Even when I'm lucid I still have the strongest urge to kill myself. I have attempted to OD on my medication before but to no avail. It feels like my life is ebbing away until I am finally able to stop it and it really scares me. I can't even talk with my best friend about this because I don't want to burden her and she's working til 1am. I literally have no one here and I don't know what to do. 

I'm sorry this is so long.
