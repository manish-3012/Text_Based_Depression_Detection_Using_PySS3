I have a plan and Iâ€™m so, so scaredOn Election Day Iâ€™m gonna do it. I have a spare toaster and Iâ€™m going to throw it in the bath with me. The suffering doesnâ€™t end and itâ€™s only going to get worse. Iâ€™m trying therapy, Iâ€™m trying medication but Iâ€™m still the same piece of shit I always was. My family would be better off if they didnâ€™t support me. Iâ€™ve never had a plan this solid before. Even when Iâ€™m happy I canâ€™t help but think about it. So I think this time Iâ€™m really going to do it.
