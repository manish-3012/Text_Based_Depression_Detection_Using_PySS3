I love myself and everyone around me but inside there is just nothingness.I just want to lay down and die. I know you all love me, and I love you too but
there is just nothing on the inside. I feel completely empty, I am handsome, witty 
and sociable. I have friends who I like very much but this black hole is so much bigger.
I do not wish for anything but the pain going away.

Right now I just want to move to a new city and kill myself, I don't want my family to find me
hanging from the ceiling. I don't want to hurt people but this pain is just unbearable. It's a permanent
solution but a still, it's a solution...
