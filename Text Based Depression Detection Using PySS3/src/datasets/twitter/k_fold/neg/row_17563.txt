I feel really close to breaking downAlot has happend the last week, I feel like just breaking down totally. I donÂ´t know what to say really. I just feel like slowly IÂ´m going further over an edge that I wonÂ´t ever get back to. I want to stay on this side of death but it feels so fucking hard. I am just crying and crying feeling angry and angry.. People are just not there.. IÂ´m not talking about people here just people in real life arenÂ´t there.. And they just donÂ´t care.. 

Edit: I think I might have to go to the psych hospital.. IÂ´m feleing so bad and sad and my mind is just going worse and worse.. I need someone to talk to I need someone to help me out of there but  itÂ´s just me. IÂ´m not enough :(
