I am going to commit suicide if I donâ€™t find a solution3 month ago I had a really terrible bout of insomnia where I couldnâ€™t sleep for 5-6 days straight. After almost one week without sleep, I decided to go into a hospital and told the doctors, in my delirium like state, that i hadnâ€™t slept for a week.  They put me on 50mg of seroquel, still couldnâ€™t sleep so they had to give me like 1mg of lorazepam. During the following night the same shit happened and again I took the same combination of drugs to sleep. I then decided to get out of the hospital and return back home, where I managed to sleep with 3mg of Standard melatonin. So I took 100mg of seroquel in total. Now I worry about potential side effects. Prior to this I already had experienced 2 month of constant brain fog, light sensitivity and a feeling of constant overwhelmt, like being over stimulated. Since taking the medication I feel like my memory, ability to recall words, phrases and concepts took an immense hit. I also experience coordination problems and i am unable to focus. I almost feel like retarded. Is it possible that a dose of 100mg of seroquel in total has such a negative effect on my cognition? Furthermore does anyone have any idea what else could be causing this. Btw I am a medical student in my second semester. All of the brain fog an mental issues started around the end of the first semester where I almost effortlessly aced all the exams and generally speaking performed really well in my life. After that I had to skipp almost half the second semester and I am now barley able to function in my day to day uni life. I canâ€™t even follow lectures, take notes and other basic stuff.
In the beginning I hadnâ€™t had any depression or anxiety at all but after living with this shit for 5-6 month now I am totally depressed and I have developed anxiety attacks because Iâ€™m starting to believe this feeling and these symptoms will be constant. 
I have always been a smart kid, did well in school, socially, everything. I had a reputation for being intelligent and i would always be the first person to turn to with any sort of question about every topic whatsoever. And now I am pretty much retarded. I canâ€™t take this anymore I want my life back. I feels like my brain is not able to process the incoming information and stimuli anymore. Itâ€™s like too much information. I have even trouble to pass a normal street because my brain canâ€™t keep track of every movement at once.

Thanks for reading this, it is my first post I hope Iâ€™m doing it right. As you might notice English is not my mother tongue, hope you can still understand it though.

Edit: I am unable to think clearly for almost 4 month. I really canâ€™t think or process any information whatsoever. I have always been really smart and it defined me and it is the most important aspect of my life which has now been taken from me without any hope or reason to think that it will suddenly improve. So I am going to commit suicide if I donâ€™t find a way to feel like myself again. Before this happend I hat everything and was able to feel so much love, I considered myself very empathetic and emotional intelligent and now I am merely a piece of flesh. I canâ€™t keep on existing like this. It is too much to take.
