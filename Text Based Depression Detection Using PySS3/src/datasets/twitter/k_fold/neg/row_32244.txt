I absolutely hate my life and the only reason I havent killed myself is because some people would be sadMy life has always been terrible. I was mentally, physically and emotionally abused by my father, neglected and humiliated by my family, bullied and hated by all my peers. The only time I was truly happy was when I thought I was going to be able to go to a wonderful college in Sheffield, UK. this was a big deal for me because Im very poor and my inheritance is the only money I have. I grew up poor and everyone hated me for it, my family is very classist. My mom told me that would be able to afford it. So I got very excited. But then 3 weeks before I was supposed to go she told me we couldnt afford it after all. I cried and got very upset. Then I moved to a different school. This one wasnt so bad, I wasnt being bullied. I applied to 4 universities and got offers from all of them. But I still cant afford to go to them. My only alternative is to go to a shitty university in Kenya and everyone will discriminate against me because they think kenyan degrees are fake.  But I cant get a job in Kenya because the salary is so low I cant afford to leave on it. Im so tired and I want to kill myself. My childhood was terrible and the rest of my life is going to be terrible
