I survived.I took an OD of a cocktail of medication. I was on a ventilator and hooked up to several IVs. The doctors were convinced I wouldnâ€™t make it and had told my parents to prepare for the worst. But somehow, I survived. 2 days later I woke up, sky high on morphine and terrified. I screamed, cried, cursed at the poor hospital staff for keeping me alive before being given a hefty dose of sedatives. A few days later I was discharged and given a course of antibiotics as I had developed a mild case of bronchitis. My body is weak, and I canâ€™t stomach much. Iâ€™m exhausted mentally and physically. Everyone is walking on eggshells around me, constantly checking up on me. Guilt is eating away at me. My Mother isnâ€™t well, she depends on me for help around the house and I nearly abandoned her. I canâ€™t stop thinking about how much stress I put her and my Father through. I just wish I never existed at all.
