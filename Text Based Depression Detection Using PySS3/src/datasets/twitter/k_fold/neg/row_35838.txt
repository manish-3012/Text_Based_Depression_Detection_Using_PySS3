In a bad placeI don't even know what to say I just feel terrible right now. I have for years but It's worse now. I think I am falling behind in my school work because I often skip classes because  I'm too anxious and depressed. Yesterday I missed an exam that's worth a big portion of my grade and I'm losing points because I keep missing classes. 

If I fall below a 2.0 GPA I'll lose my scholarship and get even more depressed but I just cant bring myself to do work or even attend because I just want to die. It would be better If I could get a job to pay for it if I did lose my Scholarship but I can't even get a job. 

I have been trying for years. I have failed every interview because I have extreme anxiety and aspergers syndrome. That's another reason why I want to die. 

I hate being a useless freak, I can't even make friends in real life and I can hardly even speak. I also feel like a horrible person because I had this guy  friend who was into me and I was finally honest with him and told him I was gay and it crushed him. I feel like a demon doing that to him when he's already going through tough times.

 Basically the gist of what I'm saying is that I don't deserve to live and I'm a failure and I want to die. I have tried getting help. Medicine and therapy and being hospitalized didn't do anything for me. I'm just draining my mom's resources and being a pathetic burden. Even she's getting sick of me. I feel completely alone. I have a bottle of pills and alcohol and my brain is just screaming at me to do it. Im sorry for the long post.
