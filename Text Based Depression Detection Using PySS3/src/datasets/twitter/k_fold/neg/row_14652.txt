I always end up back here....By here I don't really mean this particular subreddit, although that kinda does happen too. No matter how many times I try to improve and wait for "things to get better", 100% of the time I end up laying in my bed late at night, just thinking *what if?*

What if I actually went through with it? Would I be brave enough? Would fear stop me? Would I actually do it? Who would find my body? Who would care? Will it impact anyone else's life dramatically, or just a temporary sadness? What would be my last thought? Is this really it? Complete nothingness after this? Or is it some trippy afterlife/rebirth process? 

I think it was as young as 8th grade when I realized I could potentially kill myself. I noticed when I would read/hear stories of other suicides. I'd feel a connection to them, like a mirror. While everyone else either mocked it or viewed it as the worst possible thing, I viewed it as "hmmm, I wonder how many thoughts we had in common? They kinda looked like me...had the same interests as me...I feel like I could've been their friend". I always felt like saying to them " *Hey... I get it...*"

I don't know. I'm not  gonna kill myself anytime soon (at least I don't think so), so sorry if this is a misuse of this sub. But I always come back...I always come back to that eerie gut feeling that suicide really is the way I'm gonna go. I can't shake it, it doesn't really even bother me much anymore. It's now more of a curiosity/wonder what will trigger it type of thinking.

It's been a weird night. I'm gonna go to sleep. I hope whoever is reading this can relate somehow. I'm not sure why that would matter, but it'd make me feel less alone.
