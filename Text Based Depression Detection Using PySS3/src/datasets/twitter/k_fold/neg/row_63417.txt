HelpHello everyone, let me start. Iâ€™m depressed since Iâ€™m 13, and i see a psychiatrist since Iâ€™m 13 because of that. At the age of 15 i started to self-harm, and my left hand was all cutten and it was bleeding so much. I stopped self-harming after that. After that I had to stay at psychiatry for 3 weeks. I am on Asentra (anti-depressant). On summer 2018 i fighted depression and won the fight. Yea, i mean i won the fight but i can still feel the depression being here, but it wasnâ€™t strong as usually. Now Iâ€™m almost 16 years old, the depression is again strong as usually. I literally have no motivation to even get out of bed or go to school or something else. I am going to fail my grade because of my depression. I donâ€™t care about my grades or even anything about school. I skipped school a lot of times because my depression is hitting me hard. The most of my time i only feel sadness or nothing. I isolated myself and just wanna be alone and just sleep all day. I dont feel hunger and iâ€™m not thirsty. Iâ€™m thinking about ending it all because i see no light at the end of the tunnel. My soul hurts so much and iâ€™m dead inside. Everyone keeps saying â€œyouâ€™ll be fineâ€, but that are just lies because iâ€™m with depression almost 3 years already.
