restraining orderso a live in ex of 4 years decided to end the relationship by moving literally across the country for school, slowly breaking off all communications, and ending things over chat and email instead of speaking to me. this is all while i was struggling with severe depression during the whole process.

all i recieved was 1 email for closure, i tried to plead with her, ask her why she was treating me this way, what i did to deserve this. she just cut me off. i know im not a perfect person, i made mistakes during the relationship, we didnt communicate as well as we should have, but i never in a million years thought i would be worthy of such horrible treatment. we lived together for fucks sake.

i tried pleading with her further, even with no responses, i just wanted to be heard, and then after half a year i got enraged. she had become the devil incarnate, how could someone treat me so badly and just ignore my pleas for help? who could be this evil?

this is when things got bad. the emails turned to hatemail, my self worth was crushed, it had to be her fault. i called her every name in the book, said horrible horrible things, criticized everything about her, basically threatened suicide repeatedly, i really felt worthless, like i had no reason to live anyways. maybe if she knew i was willing to kill myself in efforts to finally get closure, she would listen. no.

but what she did do was collect the emails and attempt to get a restraining order against me. the police told her she needed to formally ask me to stop (yeah, actually speak to me). she finally sent me an email about a month ago.

now i know i did really fucked up things, i have serious problems, i made mistakes, but i only wanted to be spoken to, to be treated with respect and compassion.

this may not be the case, but right now i feel that she really doesnt give a fuck if i was alive or dead. she only cares about herself and i minds well kill myself at this point. 

my cries for help were seen as threats, maybe rightfully so.

im at a loss right now, things have finally sunk in that i will never get closure. i really kind of feel like ending it. if the person that i thought was the nicest person i ever met could do something like this to me, i have no faith in the rest of humanity. i dont trust anyone.

fuck.
