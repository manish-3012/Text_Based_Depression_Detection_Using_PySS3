What's the point thoughSo what actually is the point in life. I'm 22, gf is pregnant with second kid. 1st kid is 3 and hates me because we couldn't bond when I was away with the army.

I actually get no enjoyment from anything in life, I used to love watching football and playing ps4 but now it's boring as fuck and I actually have fuck all to do in my spar3 time. 

I really wish I enjoyed spending time with my gf and son but I don't, I simply do not enjoy being with them, I count down the hours till bed time, not because I'm tired, just because I don't have to talk to anyone anymore. 

I am in an IVA and a shit Â£8.21 an hour job so I have around Â£10 a week to myself after paying bills. So there's no prospect of ever having a house or a nice car, I always wanted that until this year when I realised I'll just be bored then too.

I am a shit father and shit partner. If I do it now while my kids are young then she could find another partner who's better than me.  And the kids would be 10x better getting raised by someone else. 

Head is up my arse.
