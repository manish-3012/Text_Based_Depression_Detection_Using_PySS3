I'm just done with it.. but why can't I do it?Hey everyone I'm just done with it, done with everything.. i'm 15 right now. and I've been bullyed for about 10 years ( I even moved like 4 times.. it kept happening) and not just normal bullying with cursing and such.. but just people hitting me with sticks or baseball bats for no reason. and every time I thought I finally got a friend I could trust, they would just stab me in the back. There are also alot of fights at home between my parents and me every day and I just can't take it any longer. but why can't I do it? I stand on the edge of a skyscraper every day.. I have a knife in my hand every day.. why can't I just jump or slit my throat? I don't have anything I want to live for? please someone explain it to me.. no one is nice to me in the world, I got no friends, my parents wish I was dead.. i'm always ignored and if I'm not ignored, I'm being beaten up. but still I go to school every day cause I want to be able to get a good job and hope to have a nice life later on.. even tho I know I will never get one. I'm always crying alone sitting in a corner of my room.. I don't even have someone I can tell this to, why am I so alone? why does everyone act like this? why can I not bring myself to commit suicide? someone explain why I can't do it.. :S
