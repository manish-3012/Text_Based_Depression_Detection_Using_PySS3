Some help needed and adviceNot sure if this is the right place to post but I want to ask,  how difficult would it be to find prescription drugs that can kill me? Would a shitton of ibuprofen/parecemtol work? I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s painful, I get migraines all the time so Iâ€™m used to it, I just donâ€™t want a gory death and I canâ€™t drown myself. Thanks sorry
