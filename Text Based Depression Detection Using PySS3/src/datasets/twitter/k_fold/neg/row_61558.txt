Contacted health clinic about social network friend's worrying status. She is posting demanding that (I) oust myself. What do?No more details regarding her posts are necessary other than to say that they have been concerning for a while and today's post was unquestionably suggesting suicide. 

You may skip the following text and go on gut instinct; here is my take on the matter.


- She is in a college I recently graduated from and I am moving out of state. The social ramifications for me would be absolutely minimal. I will likely not see her again and our social circles do not overlap. I don't consider myself her close friend and actually I'm fairly positive she hates me for the usual sexually and academically competitive/emotional reasons that often cause rifts between college aged women.

- I would not be doing this as self-validation. My reasoning is that she may need a scapegoat; she may simply block me, where as otherwise she might delete her social network and completely shut down an avenue she may need again in the future. Another friend has been monitoring her posts with growing concern so blocking me wouldn't stop her network from reaching out to her.

I worry that by not outing myself, she would only feel more powerless and at the mercy of the world; by providing a focus, she may be able to more easily move past the matter and (hopefully) seek the assistance she needs to feel better. 

If I should oust myself, it would be via private message as to not embarrass her further. Were it to happen, would a succinct, "It was me. I was really worried about you. I hope you feel better soon" be sufficient?
