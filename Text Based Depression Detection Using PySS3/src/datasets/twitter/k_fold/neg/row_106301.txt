I have no idea how to go on.I used to be a normal person besides my anxiety problems. I had friends, hobbies, played sports, and looked forward to experiencing life. When I was 15 all that changed. Suddenly, the world seemed dark and dreary for no reason that I can recall. 6 and a half years later everything is the same, only worse. I don't enjoy anything, find no pleasure or joy in life, and am emotionally void most of the time. At one point I felt lonely but over time I've become antisocial and no longer even feel the need to talk or have social contact. My very personality it seems has faded away. I dropped out of college a few years back because I couldn't concentrate, my memory was poor, and I had no motivation. I've been on five different antidepressants, gone to a therapist, and tried exercising like I used to despite my fatigue. Nothing ever works. Death is beginning to look like the only option I have left.
