hello?I don't have anything to say really. My life is looking as dull as it always has been, dropped out of highschool, no job, no friends, no ambitions and certainly a very limited supply of hope. Depression came about 7 years ago and hasn't faded since, at this point I can't tell if I'm even depressed anymore. 

It's been so long, no social interaction or intimacy. I don't feel much anymore, almost completely apathetic. It feels like my humanity is being drained away, soon I'll be nothing but an empty husk and at that point I really don't see a point of return. 

I tried therapy, didn't work since what I feel has sort of been engrained into my personality and so I can't get rid of it. I was to late to seek help, I'm going to head out later on and travel as far away as possible before ending my life hanging from a tree somewhere. 

Unless ofcourse somehow someone manages to change my mind. I'm really curious if anyone has that capability.
