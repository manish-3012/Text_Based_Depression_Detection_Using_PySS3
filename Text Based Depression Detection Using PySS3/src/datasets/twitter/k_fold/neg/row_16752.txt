Long term prepI feel bizarre posting this. Its been a very hazy 6 weeks.

Just 2 weeks ago I began mentally planning. I've never thought like this while having a clear head and nothing (substances etc)to distort my thinking. I have been working overtime, paying off personal debts, thinking of letters to write, things to prepay so there is no financial burden afterwards, cleaning and a bit of mini purging so there is no mess or lots of stuff.

When I start mentally planning throughout the work day, I've become calmer, energetic and more productive. When I come home I completely shut down back into my haze. 

I don't have a solid date, just a process to make it as tidy, simple, well prepared and considerate as possible. And also to insure that it's not an impulsive act..giving my self time while I sort things out. I want to soak up the Summer heat a bit since we get long winters. My birthday is the end of August so I was contemplating the day after? Im not settled on anything and just feel so 'out of body' typing this.
