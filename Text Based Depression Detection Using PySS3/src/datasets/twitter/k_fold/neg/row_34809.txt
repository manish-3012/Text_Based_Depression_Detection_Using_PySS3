Iâ€™m so deeply depressed and alone.I had no friends in my hometown so I moved across the country, hoping it would force me to get out and meet people. The problem is Iâ€™m still awkward as fuck and donâ€™t know how to socialize at all. I used to at least have work friends. I donâ€™t even fit in with people at my new job, though. And itâ€™s hard to meet people when you have to go everywhere alone and everyone is already out in big groups of friends or at least with one other person. Even if I met another person idk what to talk about. I donâ€™t even know what people my age do anymore. 

Now Iâ€™m just miserable and donâ€™t even have my family around anymore. Except my sister who came with me, but sheâ€™s starting to drive me fucking crazy. And I canâ€™t even go home because Iâ€™m stuck with my new lease until next October and I spent my entire savings account to get here. 

Iâ€™m so fucking stupid for thinking I could make this work. I want to start cutting again. I honestly hope I just donâ€™t wake up tomorrow
