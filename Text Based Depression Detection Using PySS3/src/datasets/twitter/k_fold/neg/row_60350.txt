been a while since iâ€™ve felt suicidal and man i never thought iâ€™d feel this way ever again but here i am.been thinking a lot today. i wish i killed myself last year/earlier this year, really fucking wish i did. iâ€™m so tired of living everyday because itâ€™s all the same, i wake up, eat, watch youtube videos, play computer games and sleep. i do some other things but not very many other things. iâ€™m so lonely, havenâ€™t had any friends since i was in 7th grade, iâ€™m in 9th now. iâ€™ve got no family besides for my mother, i donâ€™t have anyone to talk to. i think that it would be better if i were dead because i wouldnâ€™t have to suffer with my mental health any longer and i would finally be set free from this hell. but it would hurt my mom, terribly. thatâ€™s why iâ€™m not dead, and because i think iâ€™m scared to attempt again. i havenâ€™t had any massive suicidal thoughts since beginning of this year, it sucks to have these thoughts again honestly. i donâ€™t know what to do, i wish i could be okay.
