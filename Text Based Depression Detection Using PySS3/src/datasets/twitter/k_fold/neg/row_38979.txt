Self-fullfilling prophecyI sometimes see my life as a movie or something and think to myself that suicide would be the cherry on top, the thing that everyone would expect from me, the ending to a story about a miserable life.

I know I probably won't kill myself, because I don't have the guts, but I think about that a lot.

Everything, literally everything, is shit currently and has been for the last five years. My future is pretty grim, I try not to think about it, I will probably become homeless in the next months.
