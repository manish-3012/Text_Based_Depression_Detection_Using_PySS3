Being in a British School was an absolute nightmareI went to a school where nearly 25% of the student body came from the UK. 

Most of my bullies were British. The teachers that all used to torment me, and make fun of me, and always embarrass me in front of the class for whatever were all British. 

This all made me develop a strong hatred for British people, and my hatred for them seethes to this day. I see them getting drunk and making an absolute scene everywhere I go. 

I see them always getting confrontational with everyone wherever I go. 

My hatred for them will forever remain. I just wish I wasn't put in a British School, and although I graduated, I hate it. I fucking hated it.
