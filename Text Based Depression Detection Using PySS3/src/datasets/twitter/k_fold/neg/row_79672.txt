21m going to end my lifeI've got about a week left. I won't be "explicit" about my method. I'll just say I've got some medication I'm going to take, go to bed, and have respiratory depression in my sleep. My fear is that this combination won't work and will cause permanent brain damage and I'll wake up a vegetable. I've been depressed since the 6th grade and can't take it any more.  I have zero friends and don't feel much love for my family anymore like I used to when I was a kid.  I've never had a girlfriend and don't see myself having one any time soon.  I've got two passions in life; psychedelics and women.  Neither of which I can have.  Can't have psychedelics because the state has me on meds that block the affects and I can't have women because, well, I can't find a girl that likes me.
