If it wasn't for my daughter I'd fucking do itI moved to a state my wife is from.  We weren't doing well to begin with.  We broke it off.  I live alone.  I have no friends here.  I am too busy with work and father duties to make any.  I posted some profiles on dating apps and for a month no one has shown any interest.  It confirms that I am the ugly piece of shit that I think I am.  It doesn't matter, I wouldn't have time to date anyone anyway.  I feel like all I am is my obligations to my daughter.  I feel like she's the only one that would be affected by my death. If it wasn't for her I could just be a bug splattered on a windshield and someone might bother to turn the wipers on, maybe not.   I'm in a bad mental space.  I was doing well until I wasn't.  I've been pretending that everything is fine. I have no one to confide in.  I'm tired of pretending.
