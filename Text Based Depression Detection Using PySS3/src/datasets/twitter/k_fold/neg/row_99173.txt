Now I have no one left, I think about suicide everyday. I donâ€™t even want to die but I donâ€™t want to be in this life.The last person I had who I thought actually still loved me was my mum. Today I accidentally seen messages between my mum and sister for weeks saying horrible things about me and how mental I am and how much I am ruining my sisters life and how I bully my parents into looking after their health. I feel like the last person I had on my side in life hated me all along. 

I think about milking myself every hour of every day. I walk passed a car and imagine throwing myself in front of it. I walk passed a river I imagine throwing myself in it and drowning. The only thing that stops me is thinking that  what comes after might be worse than this pain now. 

Everything in life seems totally hopeless, I am seeing a therapist and anything she says doesnâ€™t help so I know now that even if I got help nothing would change. 

I wish I could die and transport into another life.
