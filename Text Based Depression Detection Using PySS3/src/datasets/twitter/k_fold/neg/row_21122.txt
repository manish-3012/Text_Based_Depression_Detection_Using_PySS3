Spiraling continuously.This is bound to be at least a relatively long post, so Iâ€™m sorry in advance. Iâ€™m a father of 2 little girls, Iâ€™m married, and I do all that I can to keep up the motivation to keep on scraping by. They are the reason I live. And yet I am here. 

Iâ€™ve recently come to terms with the fact that I try so hard for no other reason than to try and find pride in anything that I do, in hopes that it will somehow bring back any sort of desire to keep on living. I feel bad for even putting my story out there, in fear of taking away from someone who is perhaps more deserving of any sympathy. I wouldnâ€™t, at all,  consider myself a decent human being. And I feel as though Iâ€™m a disappointment in all aspects. I canâ€™t give my girls the life they deserve. My parenting is shoddy at best. I donâ€™t treat my wife how I should. Iâ€™m significantly less successful than everyone around me. 

I feel trapped. Iâ€™m not sure if this is a cry for help, or if Iâ€™m just hoping that venting will somehow help the issue. It seems almost pointless that Iâ€™m doing this, because I know that once Iâ€™ve posted this Iâ€™ll go back to my daily routine without sharing this with anyone I know personally. 

I secretly hope that I disappointment my wife and children to the point that they leave me, so that all I have to do is wait long enough for my grandparents to pass so that I wonâ€™t feel bad for offing myself.

Iâ€™ve already lost my mother and my sister, and one of my grandfathers in a 9 month period. Is that what started all of this? ... I wish any of this had a point discernible to myself.

Iâ€™m sorry for wasting your time. 
With all sincerity, I hope you have a good night.
