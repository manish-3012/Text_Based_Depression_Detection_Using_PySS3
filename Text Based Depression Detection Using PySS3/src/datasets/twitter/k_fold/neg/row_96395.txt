I canâ€™t picture myself living my full natural life, let alone another 5 years.Long story short I did something pretty messed up when I was 18 and Iâ€™ve tried living with it for 2 years but to no avail itâ€™s always on my mind. I realize that no matter how much I wish I could go back in time itâ€™s not possible. I just turned 20 and if you had asked me 3 years ago how long I wanted to live for then i would have said â€œforeverâ€. I was so hell bent on living a long time that I was planning to get frozen when I died just so I could have another chance at living when my natural life expired. 

The worst part about all this is I have the greatest family support and have had a really good child hood.  My parents do not deserve to lose their youngest son but at this point I canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™ve never experienced guilt like this until these past few years and I honestly donâ€™t see myself living like this till 25 itâ€™s just a constant struggle and my grades are starting to struggle bad.

Everyday is a repeat I will wake up feeling like shit and by the time I go to bed I will feel somewhat better but then I have dreams about what I did and it repeats every night.

Donâ€™t get me wrong I really do want to live. I love movies and video games and want to see what they look like in the future. I wanted to see what it was like to ride in a self-driving car. I wanted to grow old with my friends and attend my older brothers inevitable wedding but I see that if I stuck around I wouldnâ€™t ever be in the moment and enjoy those things I would constantly dwell on this thing I did at 18 like I do now. I know everyone around me is gonna blame them self for me doing this but I will make sure they know it was my fault not theirs. I hope my parents can still lead a happy life they still have two great sons after all. 

It wonâ€™t be today but it will be soon, Iâ€™m sorry mom and dad I wish things were different. Iâ€™m going to miss my older brother as he was always looking out for me. My oldest brother and I were supposed to hangout next summer because of the age difference I never really got to know him and now Iâ€™m taking that away from him, Iâ€™m sorry. The hardest is definitely my friends they always wanted to move in together after we all finished school, you guys will have to find another roommate Iâ€™m sorry. The only bright side is I wonâ€™t have to see my dog grow old and die because I love that dog.
