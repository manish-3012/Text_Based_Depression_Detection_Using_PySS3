TiredI'm just.... tired. Tired of waking up every day exhausted. Tired of getting pep talks by teachers for not turning in my homework and having people see me as a fuck up. Tired of having no friends and sitting in the library every day at lunch. Tired of my family talking down to me, telling me how unhealthy and lazy I am. Tired of being holed up in my room every day, staring at a screen for hours on end, eating garbage that takes years off my lifespan. Tired of simultaneously fearing death and wishing for it. Tired of having a hobby I wish to partake in, but not being able to due to having no friends.

Tired of my life, but not tired of living. But when it comes down to it, I'd rather not live than live my life any longer.
