Big moment for me. Iâ€™m finally getting help!It hasnâ€™t happened yet. I donâ€™t know what my moms' reaction will be.

So I wrote a note. Not a suicide note, but a note. Sheâ€™s going to read it in a few moments. I have it on there that Iâ€™m suicidal. I also have it on there that she can look at my posts on r/SuicideWatch without me getting upset. 

It started when I didnâ€™t want to go to school. Why? Donâ€™t fucking know. But I was crying, on the verge of going on a downward slope of suicidal thoughts. After she's done loading the laundry, she'll read the note, and probably read my posts. Might actually be getting some help soon! Just goes to show that you can get help. Even if you canâ€™t put it into correct English ( or whatever language you speak ), Iâ€™d recommend writing it. 

This is **huge** . Iâ€™ve been waiting to get help since, well, as long as I can remember thinking these thoughts. She'll probably read this too. My adrenaline is pumping, and Iâ€™m actually excited to get some help for once. Knowing that I have another route of escape from what Iâ€™ve been feeling, that isnâ€™t suicide, is...thereâ€™s no word for it! 

Thank you, mom, for everything.
