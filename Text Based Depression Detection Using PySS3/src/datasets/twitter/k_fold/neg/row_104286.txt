I ruined my own life with both weed and social media. How do I recover? (24/m).I embarrassed myself online loads of times. 

Lot of typing errors, misunderstandings, even drunk intoxicated posts I later regret. 

I have posted hundreds of embarrassing posts on social media from 2008-present. 

The bullying and unwanted thoughts don't stop. 

I am a human being with friends family and loved ones. 

I am in pain 1,400 minutes of the 1,440 minutes of a day. 

40 minutes of pleasure. 

1400 minutes of I wanna blow my brains out. 

I'm addicted to weed and a perverted idiot with a low self-esteem.
