I'm the worstI can't take this bullshit anymore. I hate myself more than anything in the world, and no matter what I do, I never improve. This hatred has expanded to everyone close to me. They're somehow able to put up with a shithead like me, yet I treat them like shit anyway. I'm too much of a coward to even kill myself, something that would benefit every single person including me. 

Today, for what feels like the 1000th time, I completely ignored my partner and talked shit about them. Even though they've done nothing but support me, I can't help but hate them. 

I'm so selfish and talentless. I don't contribute to anything or anyone. I deserve to die, and I wish I could stop being a pussy for just one night so I could finally end it.
