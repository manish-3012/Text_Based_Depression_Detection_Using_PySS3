Well I don't really know if it's my fault, but it's quite possible that it is.Sorry for my bad english

I really feel very bad in general, I am 16 years old and I feel that I am the worst in the world, I feel that I am self-centered and exaggerated for thinking that my perfectionist mother is enough reason to want to commit suicide when I have seen people with worse problems than me, I feel I'm an idiot because while my friends all have very good grades, I hardly get to pass classes, I feel like I'm just a parasite, since I don't do anything at home while my grandmother feeds me with her money, I hate myself a lot.

For more than a year I had considered committing suicide by injecting air, it is something strange but I am really very scared to throw myself from some high place or cut myself and I feel that, although it hurts more possibly, at least the realization will not scare me, really , I just feel stupid for sharing this here, the closest day I was to do it was a day in which I had a discussion on the phone with my mother which was that when I arrived in Mexico (I want to clarify that I live alone with my grandmother in Venezuela, my mother lives in Mexico and my father in the United States) if I did not comply with all the rules of his house, I would throw myself out on the street in a country totally unknown to me, that day I had decided to do it, I sent him a letter of suicide where he explained why he was doing it to finally apologize for disappointing him, but before he injected me, he called me and reassured me, telling me that he would talk to my mother so that she would not tell me those kinds of things again, that I love aba and others, at that moment I knew that I should try to move forward even if only for him, but lately it is becoming very difficult, I am feeling terrible and every time I feel like everyone hates me, I have always felt that I annoy everyone and They talk behind my back and lately I feel like it's worse, I really don't think I can anymore
