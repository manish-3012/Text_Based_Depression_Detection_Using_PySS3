It's been a while, but...Over the last year or so, my mental health seemed to get better by itself, but I still have lapses back into my old mindset every now and then, and when that happens, I worry that my depression will come back in full force. What do you guys do in situations like that?

What do you do when you don't want to die, but you don't really have any particular good reason to live?
