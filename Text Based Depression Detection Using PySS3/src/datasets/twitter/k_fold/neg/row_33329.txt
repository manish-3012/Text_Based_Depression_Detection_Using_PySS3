.Hey reddit. I know this is a weird place to come with my problems but itâ€™s almost 5am and I donâ€™t know when I stopped crying but I have and I feel weirdly calm. Iâ€™m so, so, so tired of this. Iâ€™m only 16 and I know that compared to so many people I really live a privileged life. I have parents who love me, but I really canâ€™t do this much longer. Iâ€™ve been on meds and in therapy for depression, anxiety, phobias, and bpd for coming up two years and Iâ€™m just not getting better. I know people say it takes time but my issues arenâ€™t because something bad happened to me, theyâ€™ve been inherited. I come from a family full of depressed people, I lost my granddad to suicide and my dadâ€™s in recovery but I know that it isnâ€™t something thatâ€™s ever going to be fixed. Itâ€™s as much a part of me as anything else. When I was six years old I told my mum I knew I wasnâ€™t going to die of old age, and I didnâ€™t understand why she looked upset and told me not to say things like that. I still believe it. Iâ€™ve always known Iâ€™m going to kill myself someday, and now Iâ€™m coming to terms with the fact itâ€™s going to be very soon. Itâ€™s going to absolutely destroy my parents and I hate that but I really truly believe that the heartache I cause them now, being vacant and sad and unreachable is worse. I hate everything about myself. Iâ€™ve done enough research on mental illness to know that Iâ€™m just experiencing a malfunction of my brain. I know these things, but theyâ€™re still happening. It doesnâ€™t make sense. I know that, and it frustrates me. But I really truly want to die. Itâ€™s the only thing I care about anymore. Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m writing this post. I guess itâ€™s a last ditch attempt at getting validation or help. Iâ€™m not sure. I just know that Iâ€™m so upset, and so fed up of being alive.
