I'm so tiredFor nearly 16 years of my life (I'm 19 now) I've suffered from severe anxiety and depression. I've had constant panic attacks, I dont really feel any emotions anymore. I may be fine for a couple hours or while I get what little sleep I can, but at night and while I'm awake I'm constantly thinking about ways to die, or what if scenarios like mass shootings or bombings. I'm physically and mentally exhausted and I just want to quit, just give up. The only thing keeping me here is that I'm a Christian and I dont want to go to Hell for killing myself. My mind constantly convinces me that im dying or I have diseases or any number of awful things. I just want the pain to end. Pills for it haven't worked, weed made it worse, like it convinced me that everything, food, drinks, are laced with drugs and I just can't do this anymore. I'm crying right now, just as I do every day because of all these things going through my mind. I wake up and my entire body is either numb, aching or feels like I'm repeatedly being stabbed. My knees are fucked and my backs fucked. I just cant do this anymore. I'm so tired
