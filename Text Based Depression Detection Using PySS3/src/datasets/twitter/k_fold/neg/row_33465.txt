I've lost all I love so goodbyeI have been through the worst health I can imagine.
In that time I couldn't communicate with my good friends. My dear friends who I love so much.
They won't speak to my any more because they think I have abandoned them or I'm making up my issues.
I honestly feel so shit right now. Like I can't live on this earth any more. I feel like the world has just thrown me a curveball that I can't get over.
I tried to live my life without my friends and I've tried to live on this earth without my late wife.
I just can't do it anymore.
I've had enough.

Goodbye to everyone I've ever loved in my life
Know that the love was real.
Know that I cared so deeply.
Know that I held you all in high esteem.
I just can't do this life anymore.
I can't live every day knowing what I am.
I am a reject. A mistake. Sperm that wasn't meant to thrive into a human.

My late wife Ginger was the only woman or person on this earth that understood me fully. My mother is up there and my ex James. But apart from Ginger nobody understood my mentality, my health, my life, the way I live, the way I function in this world.
She's gone. And everyone else around me is gone or leaving me. What is the point? My mom is better off without me anyway. I'm just a thorn in her side for years. I wasn't meant to be born. I'm a living reminder of her abuse. She never said that to me and always treated me far too well.

I just can't live anymore. I've tried.
I just can't. It's not for me. The pain is too real.

Goodbye.

Love you xx â™¥
