.I'm waiting in the er after od. My bf thinks it's his fault, it's not. It's just the straw that broke the camals back.

I didnt expect it. I was so excited to see him after a terrific week.my ptsd is triggered w llot rn. My dad wants me to emdr,  but I don't want to remember details. 

I guess he was my only hope. Ik that's not healthy. But it feels like my heart has been torn out of my chest and sheared 


My future is falling apart
