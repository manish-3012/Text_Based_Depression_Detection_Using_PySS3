I wish I could apologize by doing everyone a favorI'll never be able to apologize enough for the burden I am, but I want to save everyone who knows me from knowing me any longer. 

I think about suicide daily. I think about the family and few friends who deserve better. I wish I'd never been inflicted on them. 

If this year is any indication, I shouldn't exist. I've reached rock bottom with my anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I'm consumed by fear and nightmares since I was raped in January. 

I feel more isolated than ever. Perhaps I'm meant to feel alone. I can't help but feel that this is the punishment for the person I am. Therefore I'm holding as much in as possible from the people who've been unfortunate enough to interact with me. I don't say that I'm worse off than ever. I don't say that I'm cutting again. I don't say that I hurt so much that my chest aches. 

I love my family. I love my dog. I love my best friend. I think each of them would be so much better off without me in this world. 

I'm sorry to whoever reads this. I guess this is where you go when you have no other outlet. I'll probably delete this, but I needed to write it.
