I don't necessarily want to die, but I'm not sure I want to liveIt's been a rough year.  PTSD since last summer. Health issues that have had me on short term disability for months.  Constant pain.  Debt from medical bills.  Debt from lawyer bills stemming from two dogs breaking into my house and attacking my dog (PTSD).  Just initiated a law suit as the owners of the dogs are refusing to pay.  And then the state of this country.  Every kid that kills themselves because they feel the sickness and weight of the world.  Every mass shooting.  I've been seriously thinking it would be easier to swallow a bottle of pills and go to sleep...
