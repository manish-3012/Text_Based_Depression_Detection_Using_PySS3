Just need someone to talk toI've tried several chat lines and I can't get through. 

I feel so tired. I've been fighting depression and anxiety for so long now. I don't know what else to try. I finally gave in and tried therapy and medications this last year as a last resort. My psychiatrist has prescribed a few different antidepressants and keeps upping the dose but I'm starting to lose hope anything is going to work. My soul hurts. 

I'm so grateful for the good people I have in my life but I just feel guilty for the burden I place on them. I wish I was alone so I could slip away quietly.  

I don't want to die but I'm in so much pain. My thoughts keep getting darker and I'm losing the will to keep fighting.
