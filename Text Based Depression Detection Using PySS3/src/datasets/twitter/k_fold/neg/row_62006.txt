I want to dieI've been suicidal my entire life and it's always felt like a losing battle but lately it different. It's not that I'm losing the fight, it's that I can't fight anymore. Fighting to stay live is hard enough, fighting to stay alive with Depression and Anxiety is even harder, but fighting to stay alive with Depression, Anxiety, and Diabetes is too hard. To top it all off, I'm completely alone in this fight. Everyone knows about my illnesses but no one cares. No one checks in, no one tries to learn and help me, no one knows how much I'm suffering. And I can't live like that. Not "I don't want to", not "it's hard too" but I simply CANNOT. No one loves me and my life isn't worth living and suffering alone. I can't live anymore.
