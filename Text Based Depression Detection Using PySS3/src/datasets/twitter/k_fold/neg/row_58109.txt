I'm not trying to be convinced into livingYou are born  
No one asked you  
You get what you get  
If it's not a lot it's your parents fault  
And theirs before them  
All the way down the line  
To the first man  

Life is such that we can go through it now largely alone  
It didn't used to be like that  
But we are like that now  
Better technology  

A lot of posters on suicide forums wants to be argued into going on  
That's not true  
A lot of them want to get some sort of stamp of approval  
For hating life  

It's like they want you to say it's okay life is awful  
Or perhaps  it's a last ditch attempt to find something in common with someone  

Either way, it speaks to the primitive need for acceptance  

Isn't that nice?
