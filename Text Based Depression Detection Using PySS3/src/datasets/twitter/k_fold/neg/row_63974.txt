iâ€™m tired of lifeiâ€™ve sworn to myself that i wonâ€™t kill myself nor hurt my body because it would hurt my friends and loved ones
so now i live in misery wanting to die every second of my life, not feeling joy from anything i do, just existing with mare minimums like a meal thrice a day and at least six hours of sleep and then go to work. on weekends i just lay around doing nothing wishing i didnâ€™t have friends who care about me so i couldâ€™ve just attempted suicide finally and got it over with.
my mom died when i was 13 and itâ€™s been seven years since that happened and life is just getting worse.
the worst thing though, i know that deep down i *love* life, iâ€™ve been so in love with life a few years back, but itâ€™s buried so deep down within me that i probably donâ€™t have a chance to reach out to that place again
when i do go out with friends i forget about my problems for a while and i smile and laugh with them but the second we part ways i feel bad and miserable again.
life sucks and iâ€™m just so tired, i wish i was dead
sorry if it was a mess i just needed to share it somewhere
