I want out and itâ€™s really selfish.Im a teen and I really hate everything about myself. I hate how I talk how I look how I dress my entire personality etc. I want a way out of my body and out of the stress that I have constantly because of school. None of it means literally anything to me and Iâ€™d much rather kill myself then work on an essay for another second.

Iâ€™m not sad all the time Iâ€™m really not. I know Iâ€™m not the ugliest person and Iâ€™m a fairly talented musician i gig semi regularly i have a nice body bcuz I lift etc. i am happy when Iâ€™m with my friends but none of them like me as much as I like them. Iâ€™ll put it straight I have a terrible crush on one of my bestfriends sheâ€™s one of the only thing that motivates me but Iâ€™m 100% aware it would never work out no matter what I do. 

No matter how happy i get in always reminded that life is 90% work for no reward in the ends and honestly Iâ€™d rather die right now than have to work and â€œtry my bestâ€ for another 50 years and be in the same situation in the end but without all the potential I have now. xoxo
