How does it get better?Everyone always says it gets better. But when? How? I think itâ€™s just a lie.

I am 35, gay male.  I am extremely shy and have a hard time meeting new friends and find most of the gay world fake. The one thing I wanted was my own family and it seems that time has passed. 

Most people think I am rude and stuck up because I am so shy. Guys I am attracted to do not even give me the time of day. (I am not even a bad looking guy and make a good living). Yet I cannot connect with anyone.

I no longer have the desire to live, I wonâ€™t kill myself because I cannot do that to my mom while she is living. But I have no reason to live, my life is a series of lonely motions. 

How can I get better?
