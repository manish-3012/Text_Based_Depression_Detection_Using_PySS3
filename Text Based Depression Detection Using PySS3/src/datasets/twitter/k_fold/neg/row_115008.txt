Don't know how much longer I can take feeling like this.  Nothing seems to be going right in my life.  I feel like I am at my breaking point and if nothing changes by tomorrow around this time I have to build up the courage to go ahead and end this pain.  Sorry to vent on here but I have absolutely noone to talk to no friends or anything.  I've tried calling the hotline but it seems that I get put on hold for long periods then keep getting the same guy who seems to rush me off the phone but I guess if I keep getting him he must volunteer a lot and is overwhelmed.  Meds and therapy haven't worked other than to drain my pockets dry. I have lost all hope and don't want to be in this pain anymore.
