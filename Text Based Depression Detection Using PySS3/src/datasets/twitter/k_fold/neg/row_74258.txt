I went from being on top of the world to an absolute loner that no one cares aboutI used to feel like I was on top of the world. Everyone liked me, and I had an awesome group of friends, a beautiful girlfriend, and my life was completely stress free. Over the last couple of months though, my life has sucked. My girlfriend broke up with me,  I moved so I lost contact with basically all my friends, I went to a new school and I know literally nobody and even at home my life is boring. Like I said I pretty much lost all my friends so when I get home I have to do homework I donâ€™t want to do, I play games Iâ€™m bored of, and listen to music that Iâ€™ve over played. I have nothing to look forward to anymore and I feel like Iâ€™m in an inescapable prison. Every day it gets worse and worse
