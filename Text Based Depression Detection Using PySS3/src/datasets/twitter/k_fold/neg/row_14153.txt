Already took 8 Excedrin PMs in the last 30 hours.Reddit, I need your help. Every time I get depressed I start taking sleeping pills to the point that I forget how many I've taken and pass out. I just forced myself out of bed for the first time in 18 hours.

I'm just worried I'm going to absentmindedly take too many and end up either dead or in a coma. I mean that 8 is an estimate, it can very well have been more.
I'm not here for attention or advice, I just want someone to talk to, preferably someone who has had experience with sleeping pills.

**UPDATE** Its about 2:30pm EST and I haven't taken any since about 11am,and I put the bottle out of eyesight so that I wasn't tempted to take anymore, I'm still pretty shaky, but I'm finding ways to distract myself, I have art class in a few hours and my boss just gave me the day off tomorrow (which should help I can relax and sleep naturally for a bit). I just want to say thank you to everyone who replied, you all really helped a lot :). I may update again later if things with the bf don't go well, or PM some people who said it was okay. Thanks again you guys :)

**2nd Update** Okay, 8:45 pm, feeling much better emotionally, but really physically ill, dizziness, nausea, loss of direction, unable to make coherent conversation, but other than that fine. Again, thanks everyone for your positive attitudes, it really helped me out, also, I dumped the pills and am going to try to sleep on my own tonight.   (YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME)
