Femoral artery or Helium TankIâ€™m a 22 year old guy and I have a gf (21) Iâ€™ve been with for 4 years. We have always thought of eachother as soulmates, and nobody here can convince me other wise so donâ€™t bother. Weâ€™ve always talked about marrying and having kids too. When I was a kid though I didnâ€™t think it bothered me but having been molested twice, my father leaving my single mother when I was 2, and always being abandoned by any friend I have, Iâ€™m a deeply insecure and immature person. Iâ€™ve been in therapy for a month since we separated. We separated because of the following. Because of super high ego and insecurity due to getting into modeling, along with hornyness I cheated on my soulmateI was so disgusted and repulsed with myself. My gf months beforehand got back into smoking pot despite having addiction problems and didnâ€™t tell me about it which now worries me even more. 
It is my fault and mine alone. I regret my mistake horribly and I donâ€™t know what was going through my head. In an effort to grow up and mature, I confessed to her a month afterwards, and that was a month ago now. She was obviously devastated. I told her that I take full responsibility, that I understand her pain and suffering, and that if sheâ€™ll allow, I want to show her how much Iâ€™ve grown and that it was a one time thing.
Anyway, my gf and I were checking up on eachother till she decided the other day that it may be best to take some time for ourselves and that sheâ€™d let me know if she needed anything. So now I wonâ€™t really be knowing if sheâ€™s safe or not but I also donâ€™t know whatâ€™s gonna be going through her mind which scares me. She said she doesnâ€™t know what she wants. I moved out of the apartment and donâ€™t worry Iâ€™m still paying rent, we were sharing it with a girl roomate, and I then moved back in with my Mom (who is a surrogate mom to my gf and loves her a lot too)

Even though Iâ€™m glad I smartened young and before 30, I feel like if we were to end things, then I lost out on my one chance for true love and a family. My girlfriend and I have lived together for 4 years, talked in detail what we want our wedding to be like and what our kids names will be. I know Iâ€™m young but Iâ€™m intelligent enough to know that sheâ€™s the love of my life, and yes I did a horrible thing but it doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t love her with all of my being. I donâ€™t want to be with anyone else and expect them to live up to her. I donâ€™t wanna have kids with anyonelse but her. So yeah, if things donâ€™t go right, I feel like Iâ€™m going to kill myself via helium tank. Iâ€™m a trust fund kid, so if I died my mom and uncle would get it to retire. My gf would be named heir. And Iâ€™d freeze my sperm just in case my gf wants it or my mom wants grandkids, whatever. But Iâ€™m terrified of killing myself and what it would do to them, but Iâ€™m terrified of living. Most people especially my age hate me off the bat anyway since I donâ€™t smoke, they think Iâ€™m â€œrichâ€ for having a trust fund despite living in an inner city, and for being a little good looking. I want to show them my suicide letters and beg them to forgive me and have a second chance because Iâ€™m scared of the future, but then it may be seen as manipulative. She even said as of rn that she canâ€™t begin to appreciate any progress Iâ€™ve been making or improvement Iâ€™ve had. Iâ€™m so directionless rn. I know I can get through not talking to her as much, but if I lose her, idk what Iâ€™ll do.
