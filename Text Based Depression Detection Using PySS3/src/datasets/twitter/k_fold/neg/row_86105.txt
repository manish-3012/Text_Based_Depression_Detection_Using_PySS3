My friend has said 'i dont even want to be here if im not with -girl-' and believes she will break up with himHi Reddit... I really really need your help. My friend... Lets call him -guy-... Has fallen out with his girlfriend because of some severe trust issues between them. He fully believes that he is going to lose her on Thursday when they next meet up. He has told me that he hasn't eaten or slept in the last 30 hours. He has just said to me 'i dont even want to be here if im not with -girl-' and I have no idea what I can do to help. I've told him that he needs to get help, but he said that he'd get thrown in a 'looney bin' because his mind is 'too fucked up right now'... I have no idea what I can say to him to help him. Nor do I know what I can do to help the situation. I'm good friends with both -guy- and -girl-. Reddit... Please help me. If this is in the wrong area PLEASE tell me where I can get some help for my friend.

Thank you for reading.
