AdviceWhat do you do if you want to die? I donâ€™t think I have the â€œgutsâ€ to kill myself. Over all I love a clean active healthy life style. I am just not happy anymore. I smoked weeed pretty much every day since I was 13-14 through to 19. Iâ€™ve stopped it for a year now. Nothing has really changed. Maybe the weed helped me. I havenâ€™t had a drink in over a year. I pretty much do everything right. Maybe I just need to get more sleep thatâ€™s about it. Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m good looking but some times I canâ€™t see it. Iâ€™ve also never had a girlfriend or anything close to. I just feel so damaged. Itâ€™s hard for me to do anything anymore. I try to start each day fresh with a good mindset and most of the time I am but I just feel like itâ€™s not worth it anymore. Iâ€™m sick of everything life has to offer. I donâ€™t like anyone or anything anymore. I feel as if Iâ€™d be better off dead. I donâ€™t want no sugar coat bull shit that life will get better because it most likely wonâ€™t for me. I just need to know what the fuck I should do when thereâ€™s not much more I can do. Iâ€™ve come to a halt.
