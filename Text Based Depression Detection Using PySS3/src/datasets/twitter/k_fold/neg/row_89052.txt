nothing flashy, i'm useless and need to just end it.I've spent the past three years pondering about ending it all. I think i'm finally ready to let go. I'm tired of the loneliness, yet i'm so introverted i can barely talk to family anymore. The knowledge that i'll never accomplish anything isn't helping either. I've thought about going to a hospital to see what they can do to help, but i can't bear even the thought of bringing this up to my mother. Putting on a fake smile every day is all I've done for the past two years, and i'm tired of it. i can't do anything right, always being criticized and dug into like mud. i wish i had a gun and something to take me out of the experience and numb my senses.
