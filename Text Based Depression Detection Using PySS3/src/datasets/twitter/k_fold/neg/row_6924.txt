Honest postOkay let me give you some of my background before we get into the politics of it. 
Iâ€™ve had a long history of mental health problems since early teenage hood AT LEAST and over the last 2/3 years Iâ€™ve been actively suicidal, Iâ€™ve been assessed under the mental health act MANY times, Iâ€™ve been admitted o hospital for overdoses and self harm many times. Over just the last week I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve gone a day without police or medical staff with me because I tried slitting my throat and wrists and took and overdose and tried jumping off a bridge.
So hereâ€™s my question. Iâ€™ve been under so many different mental health teams that have discharged me because they canâ€™t do anything or a lot of the ones where I live donâ€™t want to do anything. 
So why wonâ€™t they just let me die?
If they canâ€™t do anything, I sure for hell cant do this on my own, so just let me die. Stop saving me. I donâ€™t want to be saved. 

Iâ€™ve tried doing everything. The mindfulness. The exercise. The eating well. The making friends. Contacting them when things are getting bad. Taking the medication. Talking to the people I should be about this. And none of it helps me. 

I just canâ€™t do it any longer, it seems like Iâ€™m just broke and I just donâ€™t belong. 
Hopefully Iâ€™ll manage to die one day and stop this horrible feeling because I canâ€™t manage it and I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll ever go away. 

Sorry
And good luck to the rest of you. X
