so tired of being in a cyclei go through ups and downs so much and its exhausting. i just want to die. i just want everything to end. i dont want to be alive anymore it is not worth the fight. cutting helps. but only so much and its only a matter of time before my mom finds my razor. ive never been so sad in my life. i hate myself.
