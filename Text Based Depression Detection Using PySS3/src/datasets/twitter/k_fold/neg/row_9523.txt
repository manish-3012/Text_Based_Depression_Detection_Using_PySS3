I don't think I'll be around for much longerI have no family of my own. My mother is dead. My father seems more distant than ever before. I'm a fuckup to the point it's just sad. I've accomplished nothing but ruining myself financially since graduating university 13+ years ago. I've reached a point beyond depression into a numb realization that I'm probably not going to be around to see my 40th year. In fact, I hope I don't. I'm glad I haven't had any kids. I'm glad I'm not married and that my romantic relationships have not worked out because putting anyone thru who I am would be sadistic. My hope is that when I finally do what needs to be done, I am found by someone to whom I am just another body. 
The numbness is a new thing. It's an uneasy peace. It's uneasy in that the prospect of non-existence is an unknowable thing. All I have ever known in existence and not existing is at the same time, not knowing. 
It is weird though, knowing that even if I weren't so financially and socially fucked, it still would mean nothing.  I could be rich and well-known and it would not change the fact that I just do not want to experience life anymore.  
I just hope that I am forgotten quickly. I don't want to be remembered. I want all of my personal effects to burn. I want my name erased from what little insignificant history I have made. I've done nothing worth remembering so my death won't be worth remembering either. I can only hope that it doesn't inconvenience too many.
