I'm not loved. I'm trapped in an immobile mind but life isn't stopping.I'm in an immigrant family and the only person capable to fulfilling the societal responsibilities (neither of my parents speak English, my brother is too young). Outsiders don't understand how hard it is for me because normal teens my age don't have so much weight on their shoulders. My parents don't understand what I am going through, and they don't try to. I have no family or friend support for my depression. I'm not loved, don't belong to anywhere. My mind is so rotten and sad but school just started. I don't want to face all that. I really don't.
