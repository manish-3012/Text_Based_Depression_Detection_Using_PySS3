Ready for the endI have an intrusive thought that runs through my head throughout the day, "at least I'll be dead soon," or "I'll be dead by the weekend"

Recently my ex and our dogs came to visit
Sine theyve been here Ive been called a manipulator, a piece of shit and a vareity of different things

It's obvious this person isnt good for me and I'm so tired
Really considering taking about 30 benzos tn along with a bottle of rum and taking an uber to a park or something and let them find me in the morning
