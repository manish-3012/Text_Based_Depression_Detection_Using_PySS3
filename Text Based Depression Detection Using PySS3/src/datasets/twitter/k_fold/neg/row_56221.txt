I hate that suicide is stigmatizedI wish society would stop treating suicide like such a big deal. I battle with severe depression and constant thoughts of suicide every day, and I have been doing this for as long as I can remember. It seems to only be getting worse, and I'm seriously running out of options... I'm in a lot of debt, I'm broke, I can't pay my bills, and I honestly don't even know how much longer I will be able to keep my part-time cleaning job because I can't afford a bus pass to get to the locations.

It's not even about the money, though; I'm tired of being a wage slave to a broken system. I don't want to be a part of society anymore, and I have no desire to build or maintain any relationships I have with anybody; you're all garbage to me. I've been pushing off suicide for far too long, and I think that it's in everybody's interest that I finally end this constant pain and suffering. I think I will plan my death today.
