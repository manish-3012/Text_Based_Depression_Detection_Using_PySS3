I'm planning on going to the ER soon for severe depression/suicidal thoughts? Should I?Things to know:

 I'm 13. 

I'm not telling anyone about it. 

I will be calling the Suicide Hotline and I'll tell them to take me or else I'll kill myself. (not the best plan, but it's all I have left).  


**My goal:** To be taken to a psych ward. To talk to a psychiatrist. To finally get help after all this pain.
