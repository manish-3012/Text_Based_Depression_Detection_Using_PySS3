Lazy and unemployedI'm in my 20's.  I've been voluntarily unemployed for the past few months after I quit my job (due to boredom).  Since then, I haven't been motivated to apply anywhere.  I just feel as if I'll end up just as miserable as I was before no matter what.  I don't have hopes of getting any decent job, only working in a call center or something near minimum wage.  I was hoping to use this time to enjoy myself, work on  a few projects.  It's no use, though.  I can't do anything, it seems.  I just browse the web all day.  I can't even seem to keep my apartment clean or do my dishes.  Honestly, I just don't know what to do with my life.  I know I'll start to run low on money soon, but don't really have any options if I do end up broke.  This leads to some very uncomfortable thoughts.  I honestly feel unimportant, stupid, and lazy most of the time.  It seems that even if I wanted to do something (write, for example), I won't do it. I might start to, have a desire to, think about it, tell myself "I'm going to do it," but then after the initial "hoo ha," I just lose myself in my thoughts.  Nothing ever seems to get done.
