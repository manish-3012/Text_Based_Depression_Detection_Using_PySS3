Opened up to my momI'm lucky she tries to be so understanding. On top of this shitty pandemic we're all stuck in, this year I had to move to a new city over three hours away from home for a new job I got after being fired from my old one, I'm financially supporting my girlfriend while she studies to be a nurse here with me, and I had a severe manic episode triggered by the protests that have been happening in my country that made me think I was the successor to Vladimir Lenin 
Which almost got me fired yet again.

My psychiatrist has been switching up my meds lately and the withdrawal from abilify has been the worst of it so far. I feel so much pressure to be performing well so my girlfriend's life doesn't collapse beneath her, and I just can't. A few days ago I thought about ending it all this Sunday night so I wouldn't have to face another day at the fucking office on Monday. I've hated every job I've ever worked and I just know if I kill myself one day it'll be on a Sunday night. I called my mom up and she managed to talk me down from it. She knows I struggle with bipolar and that my uncle killed himself because of it too, so she takes that shit seriously. I'm lucky to be able to talk to her, but my God I felt close to the edge.

This shit has been going on well before 2020 also. Emotionally abused by my dad as a kid, expelled from highschool for a misunderstanding, addicted to psychedelics, injured in a car accident twice, diagnosed with a mental illness that worsens with age, fired, sent to a psych ward, etc. I'm just tired. Everyone says it gets better but I just don't see the light at the end everyone's talking about. A lot of people live long sad lives up until they kill themselves in their 70's. How do I know I'm not just one of them? I don't want that. I'm too tired for it.
