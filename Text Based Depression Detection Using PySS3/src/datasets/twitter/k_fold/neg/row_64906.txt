Convince meI made a similar post a couple of days ago in the depression subreddit and now I'm posting here. I hardly have the energy to type any more, so I'll keep this short. I really want to die, but I'm not fully sure about committing the act myself. My family has made it clear that they don't want me around. I have no friends and want no friends. I have no interests or ambitions. Life has no meaning or purpose to me and never has. I just can't seem to get my family to understand my depression and how many of my issues could stem from my Aspergers. Convince me why I should continue.
