Is it honestly worth all this painMy mom noticed my cuts on my arm from "burning' my skin with an eraser. She questioned it because I did it before after a kid told me about being able to do that. I said my arm itched so I used a pencil and it took off the skin. In all honesty I just want to come clean that I'm self harming again so I can see a therapist. I don't want this anymore it's getting worse and I'm really unhappy. I don't have call minutes on my phone so I can't call the hotline. I can't text either. I was going to use a friends phone but it was dead. I really just want to talk to someone on the hotline.
