I hate when people treat depression as some sort of separate entityItâ€™s not, itâ€™s just me. Itâ€™s my fucked up brain. Itâ€™s not â€˜depressionâ€™s faultâ€™ if I do something wrong, itâ€™s mine. Falling into depression was my fault so everything I say and do while depressed is my fault, too. Stop trying to take all blame off of me.
