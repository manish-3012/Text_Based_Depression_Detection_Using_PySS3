I donâ€™t think anyone could love me20m Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression ever since I was five. Iâ€™ve had a lot of physical and emotional abuse from my parents. I eventually went to my grandparentâ€™s house because my parents didnâ€™t want me anymore. The cycle of abuse continued until my grandmother died three years ago and my grandfather moved out. I used eating as a coping mechanism so I gained a lot of weight. I was bullied for that all through school. That and I was incredibly ugly(I still am). When I was in eight grade I discovered that I was gay and it destroyed me mentally. Iâ€™ve had a porn addiction since I was fourteen and now I have issues. From all of this I have trust issues, social anxiety, no self esteem, I sometimes self harm when Iâ€™m super depressed and stressed, no motivation to improve myself or do basic hygiene needs. I also have aspergers so Iâ€™m pretty much stupid and I constantly make simple mistakes. I constantly want to die. With all of this I realized that nobody will ever love me and I might as well kill myself. I have a my day to act set this Saturday. Iâ€™m just genuinely worthless.
