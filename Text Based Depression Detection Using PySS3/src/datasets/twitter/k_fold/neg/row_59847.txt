Ran a red light just to feel something.Ran a red light just to feel something.

Hi guys, 

I haven't been feeling so well lately, things that I really used to enjoy don't mean that much to me anymore. And for the last months I feel like I am on autopilot. I tried getting into new stuff like crypto which I do enjoy but this does not ignite a fire in me. 

So I visited my gf just now, and on the way back there was this really shitty stoplight which is usually quite slow. Normally I just stop and wait 10 seconds and go but this time I felt like I had to  run through which I did. (In my defense it was midnight.) To my surprise the second I did, a truck came around the corner honking and flashing it's lights at me. At the moment I was lauging and filled with adrenaline. But on the remaining 20 minutes home, I started thinking that was really dangerous. If the truck was faster or I was slower I could've gotten hurt really bad. 

Does this recklessness show any danger? Do I need to get help? Have you ever had anything like this happen before?
