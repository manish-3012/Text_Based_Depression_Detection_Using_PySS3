Well, I must be reaching the endI've been taking medication for months. I've had four therapists, many methods and lifestyle changes. But somehow, I keep falling back in.  I'm back in my hole of sadness and despair. I want to die.  
A normal person would say look! You have a boyfriend who has agreed to exchange promise rings, you live in abroad, you're heading to a prestigious university next year, you have friends that love you!  But my mind... my mind sees otherwise.  I see a boyfriend that pities me, a job I don't enjoy, classes I'll fail at, friends that simply tolerate me.  I feel so alone, constantly. I feel like a failure of a human being, that something is terminally wrong in my brain that I will never be happy.  I stand beside the subway platform and can almost bring myself to jump, but the fear of surviving stops me.  
I'm tired of being a burden, of feeling broken. I'm tired of feeling alone. I'm just tired of being.  I have no drive, no motivation. I can't even walk to the post and drop off my insurance claims. That would GIVE ME MONEY. But yet, I can't bring myself to do it.  
One of these days I'm going to do it. I'll get a hotel room in a city where no one knows me. I'll fill the bathtub and paint it red.  I won't be tired anymore, because I'll be gone.  I am alone.
