I feel behind in lifeFor context im a 19 year old male. I moved across the country (USA) when i was about 14-15 and had life pretty normal. Moving situation tanked and ended up living with a friend in butt fuck no where North Carolina. At 16 we could afford to move to the original place (Virginia beach). Since then i was kind of messed up, and depression got really bad. Couple that with prescriptions from doctors that made me a zombie, i didnt make friends. I was already bad at math before the move, but I got royally fucked in class when i arrived. In Virginia (yay for common wealths), they have a test called an SOL. If you dont pass that test at the end of year/semester, you don't pass. No way in HELL im passing math. (Yes i stayed after and tried studying)After looking for any solution and maybe a math disability, i ended up dropping out and enrolling in a private online school so i can "cheat" most of it. I still havent finished my schooling, they have  proctored tests, so I'm fucked for the final. That brings me to the main point im making. I dont have my drivers license (or any permit) and i havent graduated high school yet. I feel like every fucking 16 year old i see is driving and/or graduated already. How did my dominos fall like this.. Im starting a job with a small landscaping company so at least im doing SOMETHING with my life. But i cant help but feel like a failure. How do i talk to other people like this? "Yeah I can pick you up, let me ask mommy first"... Or lying about graduation. I feel so embarrassed and hindered.
