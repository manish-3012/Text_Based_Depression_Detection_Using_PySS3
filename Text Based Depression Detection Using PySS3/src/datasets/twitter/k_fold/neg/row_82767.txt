Working up the nerve to tell my therapistI'm not planning to commit suicide, but I can't shake the feeling that it'll happen eventually. It's really hard to fight my depression or improve myself or my life if I can't see my life lasting more than a few years longer. It just feels like there's no point, but I know I can work past it. I'm really nervous about telling my therapist though, I'm afraid of her freaking out. 

What's the most gentle way to bring it up?
