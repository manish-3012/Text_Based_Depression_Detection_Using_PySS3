I so wish I could be someone else right now...I love my life now, especially with a great family and a couple of friends. But I hate myself, and Iâ€™m problematic. I even made my mum cry when I made a joke... god, what is wrong with me? 

This life is too repetitive and I donâ€™t want to live for 60+ years, I would rather die alone. Even the word suicide/death makes me feel happy, so why canâ€™t it just happen? 

Love you guys
