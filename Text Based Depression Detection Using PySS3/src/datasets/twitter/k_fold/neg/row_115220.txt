im constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts and do i not want to fight themi feel like ill feel better if i let myself drown in them and eventually kill myself. im pathetic and miserable, and quarantine made me feel better bit it will not last forever.

im stressed and tired, whenever any slightly bad thing happens to me i just want to die, and its happening quite often

yesterday, before sleep, i thought about how people would feel if i killed myself, and noticed most people wouldnt even care, just like me
