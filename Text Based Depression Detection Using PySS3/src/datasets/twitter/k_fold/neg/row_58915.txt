I just to be goneThis will not be the first time I have tried to take my own life and I have learnt from my mistakes.

What's the point of living when you have never actually lived? My life is a joke and I have failed every aspect of it.
I have nothing to show for 26 years of living ,literally nothing.

I tried to kill myself two years ago. Was dignosed with clinical depression was ordered to see a therapists etc. Things started to get a little better but good things Dont last. I got off the meds through lying and telling them what they wanted to hear. The past 8months I have procrastinated about suicide everyday.

3days ago my girlfriend left me for somebody else out of no where. This is the last straw I'm done. Again rock bottom has been hit and this time I won't fail.


Iv written my letter my family and friends and a sperate letter to my ex whom I am still in love with the pain of this is unbearable.

I'm not going to wake up this time.
