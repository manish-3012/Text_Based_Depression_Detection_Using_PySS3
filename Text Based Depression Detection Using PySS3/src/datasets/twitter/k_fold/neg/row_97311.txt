Self Corrosion (shitty song I wrote about life)Filled with the fear of living,

I drown myself in poison with every breath I breathe.

Misery and hatred only linger within me.

I will destroy myself until my death.

I wish I could end my life within a second.

Every night I thirst for another bottle of venom.

It teases me with death and forces me to live.


Tired and disgusted of myself,
Iâ€™m going to push myself deeper into hell.


Iâ€™m just a walking bag of shit and bone.

Push me over the edge into death 

because that is my one true home.

Do it now, Iâ€™m tired of hearing my breath.

I will drown myself in acid until I am nothing.

I will cut deeper and deeper until I reach the veins.

Tired and disgusted of myself,
Iâ€™m going to push myself deeper into hell.

Second after second the pain gets worse.

Pleasure is a fantasy to strengthen this curse.

I searched for happiness and found out what a lie it was.

Peace can only be found when Iâ€™m reduced to dust.
