oofdoes anyone else wanna kill themselves bc they feel like theyâ€™re the problem? cause thatâ€™s how itâ€™s for me literally all of the time and i fucking hate when people say suicide is only a perm solution to a temporary problem, like bitch I am the fucking problem the only way I could be temporary is if I kill myself. I wish I could simply wipe everybodyâ€™s fucking memory of me and I canâ€™t because thatâ€™s not possible so the only way is for me to fucking kill myself so I can finally be content with my life.
