How can i get helpSo i'm from the UK but working overseas for a couple of months. My depression has reached a point where i consider it life threatening. I don't have a dr in the country i'm in (germany) as i'm not a resident. My Dr in the UK can't refer me for psychiatric help unless i'm in the UK.

Aside from talking to the likes of Samaritans or Calm over the phone i don't have any hope of getting treatment, diagnosis, therapy, medicine, etc. 

Anyone been in a similar situation amd able to give advice? I'm at a loss 

Thanks
