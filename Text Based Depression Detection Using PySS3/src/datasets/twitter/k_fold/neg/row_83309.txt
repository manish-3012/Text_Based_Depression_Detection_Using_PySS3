I believe that I will OD before the end of the monthI'm tired, exhausted. 
These meds aren't working, the shrink isn't working.
I'm always in Physical, emotional &amp; mental pain.
No matter how many times I continue to fight against the urges of just ending it, I can't seem to shake it.
I keep seeing a vision in which I overdose on pills, I can't rid of this image in my head, like it was meant to be.
I'm attempting to give life one more try before it's over.
