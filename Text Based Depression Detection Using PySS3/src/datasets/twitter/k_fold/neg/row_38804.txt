My brother is suicidal. I need help.I don't know what to do. I'm really good at helping people. I take pride in it. But I feel like I can't help my brother. It's tearing me up inside.

If this is not the correct subreddit, please direct me to the correct one. Sorry if there is something in the sidebar that I didn't see. I'm on my phone and can't see it.

I'll try to give as many points as I can without taking too much of your time. He's having problems with alcohol and cocaine abuse. He just went through an abortion with his now ex-girlfriend.  He hasn't been going to work. Just stays at home watching horror movies. (Horror movies are not out of the norm.) He was moved out with his girlfriend and now is at home with my parents and me. His old landlord is hounding him for unpaid rent which sends him to extreme stress and aggrivation. He came to me yesterday to get out of the house and we spent the day downtown, but today he's back to bed ridden.

He's was having panic attacks for a few a weeks (no previous history to my knowledge) but they have tapered off the last few days.

I just don't know what to do. I'm so worried. I try to play it cool and leave him alone and wait for him to come to me (Which he does at least once every couple of days.) My parents smother him and spend every moment they can hovering over him. I try to convince him that he's talented with art that his life can be anything he wants it to, but he's gotta work for it. I tell him that he can slip into the dark and let it take him or fight back. I try to play the strong optimistic older brother but it doesn't seem to work. (at least, it doesn't backfire and aggrivate him.)

Please help me, I don't know what I'd do if I lost him.

Edit: he's 26 and I'm 29. I've read that he's at the cusp of mental issues surfacing, but I make no reference to that with anyone. I just keep it to myself and leave the diagnosis to the doctors (that he avoids)
