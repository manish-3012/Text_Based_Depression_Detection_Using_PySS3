i'm exhaustedeveryday its a mental battle for me to even get out of bed never mind do anything I'm not sleeping anymore like I'm lucky if I get 1hour of sleep this is the worst I've ever been. I have overbearing thoughts of trying to kill myself I've already had 3 overdoses. I'm exhausted I'm overweight but I don't eat anymore idk how that works. My boyfriend adores me so much so I just pretend to be happy because when I'm not he makes a massive deal over everything its so hard to fake a smile and not cry. I got removed off my college course because I had a panic attack and couldn't return. Only good thing is that I've not cut my body for 30 days so my boyfriend gave me my sharp knives back last week. I lost my weekly appointments with my psychologist at the beginning of lockdown because I have anxiety with facetiming and phone calls. I am so close to killing myself I'm not scared of dying I'm scared of being back in hospital because the attempt failed, having to put up with shit off everyone for trying to kill myself because they cant understand the way I feel.
