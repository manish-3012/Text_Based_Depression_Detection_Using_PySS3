i need encouragement... plzI've been thinking of killing myself for years now but dont have the guts.. Everytime i hold a razor it just slips and i cant continue.. My body is covered in scars and is full of memories.. I really cant take this anymore and i know it wouldnt matter to anyone if im gone.. The only person i dont want to leave behind is my boyfriend whose suffering from depression as well; who i think would understand my situation.. Plz help me gather up the courage.. I cant take this anymore..
