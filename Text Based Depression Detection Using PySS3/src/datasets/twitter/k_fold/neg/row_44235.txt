I know it's not the end of the world but it's so constantBeen struggling with bipolar depression for about 5 years now. On and off my meds which is my own fault. Have had suicidal thoughts for a few years. Having them now. 

I'm insecure in my relationships, insecure about myself, and i always imagine that one day I'll lose my courage to keep fighting and give in to my suicidal urges. I feel like shit today, haven't taken my meds in a few weeks (again, my fault) and i keep seeing the same patterns in my behavior. I'm sick of myself. 

I don't want to die. But i want this endless suffering to stop. I know i don't have it bad compared to others but I'm really my only point of reference and life sucks. I'm lonely, and i hate myself. I don't want to die but i don't want to live like this any more. 

By the way i took my meds today. Not that they're fast acting, so i still feel awful. Talking to a friend now...but she's far away and can't do much for me. 

Don't know why I'm posting this. I'm not going to do anything. My parents would be devastated. But I'm just...sad.
