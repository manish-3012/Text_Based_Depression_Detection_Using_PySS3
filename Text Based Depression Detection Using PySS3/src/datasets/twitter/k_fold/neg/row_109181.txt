When will the agony stop?It's post zoster shingles on my scalp... the pain makes me insane. Every day I suffer and I don't know how to live with this condition anymore. Not even morphine or fentanyl touches it. After hundreds of neurologists I am left helpless and depressed. Lyrica doesn't like me anymore and Amitriptyline doesn't give a shit.
