I can't stand itI texted my friend that I was tired, but I didn't mean it in the way she read it. Whenever I joke about death (not wearing my seatbelt, not looking both ways before I cross the street) she just thinks it's dark humor, and she has no reason to think otherwise. In all honesty, she's the only one that will even put effort towards seeing me, but even then, the effort ceases at 9 PM when she goes to hang out with her boyfriend. I have people I know, friendly acquaintances, but I dont have someone I can call whenever, spend time with at night. I don't know why, I'm probably just a joke when it comes to relationships and just a loser who bitches about it on the internet. Twenty years I've been by myself and my sophomore year of college is coming to an end. I don't want any pity, or an easy fix, I know the reasons I can't get out of bed in the morning, and how I'm not working to change those reasons. But I'm going to be going home soon, and while everyone else on this campus is drunk and hanging out with friends, all I can think about is home, finding my dad's old double-barreled shotgun, sticking the end in my mouth, and what kind of Rorschach painting my brains will make on the wall.
