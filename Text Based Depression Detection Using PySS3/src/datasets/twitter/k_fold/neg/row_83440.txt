Its gonna happen, someday.I dont know when or how, I dont even know why I'm posting this. Maybe I just want to be heard, even if theres nothing anyone can do to change how I feel. Ive gone flat, I used to be sad, I used to get angry, I've been happy, had comfort, I've felt feelings they dont have words for. I used to try to convince myself that I can change my perspective, even if i believe its a level of insanity to create this imaginary will. I have already lived my life. Ive loved, I've had my 15 minutes of fame, I've traveled and met amazing people. In a way I had the crash course of living a meaningful life, and now its gone. All those great experiences just distracted me, I never really felt any different. Ive tried everything, my soul has given up, I'm practically already dead, only here to satisfy others selfishness and taxes. I can feel it coming, whenever I think about time, it brings me a sense of peace, that eventually I can finally go, move on to the next stage. The world has become vurtual to me, scripted and bland, I already know what you will say, I know it wont change anything. In a way I have a sense of enlightenment, I know theres nothing anyone can say to me, nothing anyone on this planet can do to me, my mind is mine and I already know the hearts deepest pain and that nothing is forever. I know it will be random, probably on a good day, rather than a bad one, and everyone will say what they feel they need to say after Im gone, maybe then I will be heard.
