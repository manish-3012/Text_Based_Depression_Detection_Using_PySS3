Need to help a friendA friend of mine attempted suicide for the fourth time in her life. Second time in this past year. She still wants to die. I need to help her but i don't know how.
It's bothering me a lot. I haven't told her that this is depressing for me and I've lost many nights of sleep, because it's insensitive and selfish.

Kindly help me. Thank you. How do i stray her away from this.
