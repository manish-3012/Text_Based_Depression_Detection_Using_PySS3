Fuck this year Iâ€™m outLost my job and having to scrape by for cash, got into a serious car accident and their insurer is aggressively chasing me for money, my grandparents &amp; pets have passed away and Iâ€™ve been rejected by numerous old friends who donâ€™t care about me anymore and potential love interests after trying so, so damn hard to win then over. Nevermind being stuck indoors because of coronavirus.

I donâ€™t think anyone will ever love me or ever care about me again. Iâ€™ve posted on here before with a different account and was told to wait out  for a year and see what the future brings. I wish I never even waited.
