I am worthless...I admit it, i am worthless... I am a waste of oxygen, nothing good will ever come from me and i admit it, that i am just not worth of being in this world
I am a ninth grader who has always clinged to a fragment of hope to pass the class since seventh and now, i can barelly find any hope of passing 9 class. School has always been the main reason why i feel despair when i go to sleep, when i wake up and when i even think about life. I am stupid, i can't learn some things, i am just not worth it. I want to study alone with a private teacher because that worked out fine for me during eight grade and actually got positive grades, now the teachers that had free time to give me private lessons have their own classes to teach and i have to join the rest of my class and try to learn with teachers that  i cant learn from...
I hate my life, i really wish i could love it, but school overall is just hurting my insides.
This has gone to the point where i even hear weird noises in my mind, whispering me "suicide, kill yourself etc" and i am starting to go crazy from it.
I really could use some motivation to cure this madness that has plagued my mind for a long time now.
I don't have many friends, i don't like to go outside a lot and i definitely am not sociable.
