LetterWrote a letter today. To my family. Saying Iâ€™m sorry and goodbye. I was have calmer suicidal thoughts and thought now would be a good idea to write it, as usually I have rash thoughts of suicide and never know which way I will end up going. Thought maybe writing on my computer was less personal. 
Do you think itâ€™s easier for family to get a note, or to think it was an accident?
