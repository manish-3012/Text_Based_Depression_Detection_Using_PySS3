I just wanna die : (So I've had problems with depression and self-harm for about 1,5 years. When I hit rock bottom I got a girlfriend. She was the one I wanted to spend my life with and I loved her more than anything. About a week ago she decided to break up with me because I did drugs was addicted to cigarettes. I said I could stop for her but she did not believe me. She has ignored me since and spent almost all her time with my best friend from 6 years ago. Today he told me they have caught feeling for each other and that really broke my heart. I'm about to lose my best friend and I'm failing in school really bad. She was the reason I lived and got out of bed. I don't wanna stand in the way for them because she feels happy and safe with him. Like she did with me... I just wanna see if anyone could talk me out of it. I just see no point of living. If I could get a chance to OD on heroin I would definitely do it but I don't have any money so I can't.
