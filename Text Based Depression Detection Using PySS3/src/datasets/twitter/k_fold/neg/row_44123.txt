Im being manipulated.I recently moved from canada to the philippines to take up a job opportunity from a person i know but have never been able to fully trust.

Now im here and the feelings of mistrust are coming back. This person is constantly trying to influence my thoughts, promising me big things and attempting to convince me out of my own thoughts.

Im not sure what to do now because i dont have alot of money and even if i wanted to turn back i could not.

It feels like im stranded in the ocean with a shark circling me. Im not adverse to buying a gun and killing myself. I really havn't cared for life much, even aside from this problem. 

I feel as though this problem, as it persists, could justify my normaly underlying thoughts of suicide. 

Im alone out here and I dont see a good future for myself despite the promises that were made before i came here.
