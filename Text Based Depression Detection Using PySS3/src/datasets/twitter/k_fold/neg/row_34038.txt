Everytime things get better they mess right back up again. This time I'm done.So I thought everything was going well, I solved my homelessness, and paid my first month's rent.

A month later and Covid-19 has out me out of work, I haven't paid the rent due today because I simply don't have it and I've been given 24hrs or the landlord is exercising his probationary period rights and evicting me.

I can't do the streets again, I'm just going to end my life because that's honestly preferable. I've lost everything this past year. My relationship, my son, and now a place to live - again. 

Nobody should have to live this way. And I refuse too. This is my time.
