GoodbyeI've made my decision. I have to go now. I don't want to feel this way anymore. Every step I take, I'm put five steps back. I'm done. Goodbye. Thank you, mom...dad....for raising me. I wish I would've been able to switch places with someone more deserving to be your child. I love you guys so much...but my road ends here. 

Thank you to my friends as well. I hope all of you become successful in the near future. Goodbye. Thank you. God bless.
