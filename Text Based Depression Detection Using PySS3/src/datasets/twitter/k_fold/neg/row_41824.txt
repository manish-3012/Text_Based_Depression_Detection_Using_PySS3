You're worth more than the liesThose small voices that seem to get louder.. more pronounced; the hopelessness of a better future is in essence not being able to foresee the future and when you do look into the future all you see is life remaining the same or just getting worse. Those lies in your head are what keeps you awake at night, those voices keep telling you "If I just let it all go, my pain and suffering will be over". No one wants to die, everyone just wants to feel like a boss, they want to take charge of their life but when such undermining circumstances arise many people get stuck, many people can't find a way out of the rut that they're in and when those voices get louder and the pain cuts deeper, there comes a point when those thoughts are now controlling you and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. Don't listen to those voices, be stronger, set goals with your life and choose to accomplish them, let no one stand in your way, let no person get you down, be the best you, you can be and learn to love yourself. Most importantly, learn to control your circumstances, instead of your circumstances controlling you. Much love reddit and goodnight, peace.
