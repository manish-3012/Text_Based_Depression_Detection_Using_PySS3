Exit Act - Suicide Reform 

Hi, my name is Adam and I'm the founder of Exit Act ([exitact.org](https://exitact.org/)) -  A suicide reform initiative to legislate open euthanasia services for all acute and chronic intents and justifications.

I'm a 36 year old Human Relations Specialist for Social Neglect, Chemistry Interaction and Gray Area Matters. My impetus is assimilation for empathetic, explicate and advisory purposes. If you find my development to be an unfortunate necessity I ask that you please share sentiments and contribute other helpful information through the appropriate forums on this service for our legislative use.

If you've been impacted by suicide and support our mission to establish humane administration for suicidal persons consider making a financial contribution through our [crowdfund](https://exitact.org/crowdfunding) to support our efforts and help those that are unable to cover burial costs in the wake of suicide events. Referencing is highly instrumental if you know someone that was impacted by suicide and would also be interest in contributing to our mission.

On February, 1, 2021  (National Freedom Day)  I will lead an open meeting for public expressions and opinions on the topic of 'open euthanasia legislation's in front of the white house in Washington, DC 20500 U.S.A. at 10:00 AM EST (1:00 PM PST). Ensuing campaign proposals for legislation will commence, thereafter, and stress the sentiments of contributing forum members and the information provided through our Instruments &amp; Provisions forum will be used to devise our legal documents.

I thank you, sincerely, for your interest in Exit Act.

&amp;#x200B;

Kind Regards,

Adam
