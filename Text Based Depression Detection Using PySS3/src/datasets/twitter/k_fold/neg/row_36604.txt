Am I strong for still being here or am I weak for continuing to want to die?I don't know what to do anymore. I've lost the love of my life.. I have nothing else to live for. My depression and anxiety has pushed her away. I have been alone for almost a year now. We were supposed to see each other again exactly 3 months from now and have our own apartment. Now I am stuck with no other options
