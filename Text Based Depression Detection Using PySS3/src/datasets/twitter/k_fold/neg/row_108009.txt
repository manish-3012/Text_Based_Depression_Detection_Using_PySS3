who do i seek help from?who should i go to to talk about my current suicidal thoughts? very unhappy with my current situation/existence. it seems kinda weird to book a psychologist appointment and say 'hey i'm a bit suicidal', i doubt i'd even be able to do that. should i talk to someone else first? what do i say? i dunno if anyone can even help me haaaa
