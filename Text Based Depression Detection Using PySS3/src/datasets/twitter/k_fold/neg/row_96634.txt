I have lost the will to liveso basically i find my life pointless. I have no motivation to do anything, I used to draw and enjoyed it till i was 16 and my depression resprung (first time was after my school found out about a pedophile I was seeing and he broke up with me).As i went through college my depression worsened. I tried to make friends but it seems like im not interesting enough or a horrible human being since i was never really invited anywhere.
My roommate now hates me, ever since i tried finding ways of offing myself. We used to date and i basically used him to the point of him feeling dead inside. I find myself mean, useless (useless job and can't do anything for myself) and an emotional vampire. So today at work i was looking up guns and lethal drugs, but of course all out of my price range. I've tried therapy that did fuck all, i was hospitalized for wanting to kill myself and that made things much worse. So if you know any way i can off myself painlessly and cheaply that'd be most helpful. im a horrible human being so im certain no one will miss me, at least not for long. In fact some people will be overjoyed or relieved that im gone and im sure their lives will be much better afterwards.  
My life is going nowhere and its probably going to be a lot worse (things have been great compared to the other shit i went through.) So might aswell get it over with now. The longer i wait the more people i hurt.
