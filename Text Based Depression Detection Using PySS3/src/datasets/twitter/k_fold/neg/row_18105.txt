School making me genuinely suicidal, I feel like iâ€™m ruining my lifeI dropped out of public school in the beginning of my Junior year to do online school. My parents made it very clear that fucking online school up too was NOT an option. Well guess what, Iâ€™m fucking up. Iâ€™m many credits behind and I canâ€™t open my computer without breaking down and crying. I feel like a failure. Iâ€™ve thought about taking an equivalency exam (Hi-SET, GED) as almost all colleges accept those (Yeah... Iâ€™m still planning to go to college) But that would mean iâ€™d have to ask my parents and I donâ€™t think that would go down well. School has been ruining my life since I was 11, I get good grades and iâ€™m a pretty smart person but my mental health is very bad and my attendance was always terrible. It sounds stupid but I get violent anxiety about this because it feels like iâ€™m ruining my chance at a good future. I feel like I should just kill myself because clearly iâ€™m not capable of doing anything.
