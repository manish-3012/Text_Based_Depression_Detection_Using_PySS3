I've never felt this calmI've failed school 5 times. I can't land a stable job. I'm just an explosive ball of anxiety and have been my whole life. My therapist told me that life is not for everyone, and I agreed to give school one last shot this year. When I fail this last time, I finally have permission to leave.
