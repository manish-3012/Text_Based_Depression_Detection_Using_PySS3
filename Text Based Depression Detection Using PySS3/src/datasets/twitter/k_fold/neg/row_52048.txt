Last night I got as close to suicide as possibleI've been suicidal for about two years. I've realized that part of why I'm depressed is that I don't think there is a life I want to live even if I could "feel" better. I got so close last night. I had a last meal and watched a movie in my car I connected with before I went to my prechosen place. I had the method and simply just needed to pull the trigger. I partly couldn't do it because of the gall of the sheer act, partly because of the pain it would cause my family and partly because I don't know what is after this life. I've heard ideas of god punishing you or that you're in some state of eternal pain. The reality though is I'm still here in my miserable life, I'm so deep in the hole that it'd be so hard to get out and even if I did get out I've lost the life I loved so much that what is the point. Please don't tell me that you can talk to me. I've already talked. I've already analyzed. I just want to go. More so just doing this so someone knows my current feelings.
