no one understands that I just can't fucking leave my abuser. I do not have stockholm syndrome.I actually love him with all of my heart. 

The mental health system fails people regularly and indoctrinates the public into the very false thought that we victims who love our abusers are suffering from stockholm syndrome. I'm tired of no one understanding how much I love him, how hard it is to stay, and how impossible it is for my heart to leave him. I. Love. Him.

But I was strangled this morning. There has been a history.   I can't keep living with the pain, and the heartbreak that comes from being in love with him. I'm tired of hearing people that I will "find someone even better", that I'm worth more. I know that, and I don't want to. I only want him to rehabilitate. I don't excuse the horrific acts he's done.

I'm so lost, I'm so hopeless, and I'm so tired of anguish. 

Edit: Thanks for downvoting the post, you compassionate souls. Take a look at what sub we're all on.
