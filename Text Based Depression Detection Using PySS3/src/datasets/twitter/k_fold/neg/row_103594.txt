I want to kill myself even though things are fineI've attempted suicide once before, which was a traumatic experience, but I've been thinking about committing suicide to comfort myself on a daily basis. I think the thought of suicide is appealing because it's an escape to all my problems in life. I've been thinking of doing it again soon because I have this feeling that, even though things are going well in my life right now, my life will go in a downward spiral in the next few months.
