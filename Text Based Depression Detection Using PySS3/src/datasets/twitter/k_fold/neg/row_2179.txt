I'm attempting again tomorrowA few days ago I attempted Suicide, but it didn't go very well. With this method though, it should actually work.

There's only one thing that could go wrong. If it goes wrong, that means all my possible ways of committing suicide are gone. I just hope it will work out this time around.

My plan is to tie my noose to the handle of my wardrobe, and then do that low suspension hanging method. I haven't tested it, so hopefully what I suspect may get in the way won't get in the way. On the plus side, no one will interrupt this time round.
