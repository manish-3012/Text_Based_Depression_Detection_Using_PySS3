I never will be a profit person.I'm 25 years old right now, without any kind of studies, just the secondary school. Working as a office cleaner in London cause in my country (Spain) is so fucking hard find a job, and if you find it usually will be shitty payrates. So I need to go here with my girlfriend to search for our lifes, both are working but she works more hours than me (I always alk for more hours but they never give me) so she earn more money than me, and usually I feel like I'm a shit in the relationaship cause I earn the just money to pay the rent, food and rarely I can save a bit for me or for her, cause I smoke weed too. 
I want to find anither job, but almost jobs want people more qualify than me, so I just can work as cleaner, kitchen porter that kind of things .. I lile this cause I always rest on weekends so I can stay with my girlfriend and do things together. I want to go to school to study and get some degree to find a better work, but with the work I don't have any time for study .
I want to take the SIA door supervisor license but my english is shit, so I feel afraid to try it but I don't have time to study english too ..

So I think I'm living in a bucle, spiral where I can't never escape, so I will be a cleaner all my life and I can't never buy a home or start a family ..
Now I feel like I never will be anything.
