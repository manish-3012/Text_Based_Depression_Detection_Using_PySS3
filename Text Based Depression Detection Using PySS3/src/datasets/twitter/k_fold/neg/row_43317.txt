A few unpopular opinions (warning: very controversial)Just a few unpopular opinions I have about or relating to suicide, which is something I've been thinking about for a few years now. Sorry if this gets controversial.

â€¢ If I finally die, I don't care about what my family will think about it. In fact I'd like to traumatize them because I really hate them, mostly because they're the reason I exist and suffer, and because lots of other people my age (between 12 and 30) hate their family too, so that's the cool thing to do.

â€¢ I don't care that I'll "stop existing" and that "there's only nothingness" when I die. I think that's the whole point of it, to stop existing so I won't suffer anymore.

â€¢ Life isn't "precious". At least *mine* isn't. I hate being human, my life, and my family, and whatever caused me to exist, whether it's god if you're religious or the big bang / evolution if you're an atheist. I used to be religious, like most other in my country, but since I hit the age of 15 or 16 I gradually stopped believing in things like god, heaven, hell, etc..
