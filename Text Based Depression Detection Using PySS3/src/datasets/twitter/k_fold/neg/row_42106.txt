Constantly living in fear from my abusive family is exhaustingI wish I didn't have to deal with their stalkerish behavior and constant demands. Few people understand what it's like to grow up in a abusive home and it pisses me off. I end up getting gaslighted even more which decreases or completely destroy the progress I've made. With holiday season and birthdays coming up, im just can't do this anymore. It's been 25 years of pure hell
