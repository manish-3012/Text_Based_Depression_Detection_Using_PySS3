I am wasted space.My BPD and suicidal ideation have been spiraling so much recently. I lay awake at night and imagine all of the ways I could kill myself. Iâ€™m 22 (F) and have nothing to grasp onto. Iâ€™m caving in on myself. Iâ€™m so ashamed to be alive. Sometimes Iâ€™m too afraid to leave my bed because Iâ€™m scared someone is watching me.

Why did I have to be born into this sick family and develop all of their mentally ill, addict fueled, suicidal genes? Everyone around me is drowning. 

I am so empty. I canâ€™t drink away the pain anymore. I wish I could be euthanized because this is so cruel to make me stay alive any longer. Iâ€™m sober in this moment but I would do anything to overdose or bleed out or just simply fall asleep with no dramatics and never wake up. I have nothing to prove to anyone by succeeding or living my life to the fullest. I am sick. This is cruel. I have no treatment options because the health system is full of vultures. I deserve to die.
