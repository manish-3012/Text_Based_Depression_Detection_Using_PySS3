Idk...I'm proud of you...
I just wanted to hear this 4 words when I was younger.
And now I hear this sentence very often but it means nothing to my. I thought I would be happy when I change myself but no, I'm not happy. I wouldn't be even sad if I know I die Tomorrow. I would be happy. Idk why I  write my problems on reddit, probably because I got nobody to tell that i'm sad...
