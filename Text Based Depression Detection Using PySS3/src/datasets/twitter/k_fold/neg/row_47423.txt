i failed, such a garbageI hung myself yesterday, I failed obviously. Then today I accidentally told my mom since she asked me what's in my neck. Our conversation went like:  
Me: "I hung myself last night"  
Mom: "Why? Why did you do such a dumb thing? You won't get attention from that."  
Me: "No I just don't wanna suffer anymore. I'm hurting. I'm disgusted with my existence."  
Mom: "Well, but you fail. As expected for a failure."  
Idk why she could be cruel like that. Maybe her mean coworkers pissed her off again. I love her a lot but this is just too much. Also not the first time. I've been told that I'm a failure, living like trash my whole life by my parents.   
But well yeah I do be a failure. Failed at killing myself then cried all day because of that? Such a failure.
