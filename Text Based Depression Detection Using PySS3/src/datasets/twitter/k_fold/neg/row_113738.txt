To those who want to helpFirst of all, thank you. Just the fact that you want to help means a lot to a lot of people. But donâ€™t treat us like we are children, or like we are so ill we cant handle ourselves. Iâ€™m in my early twenties, female recently was hospitalized for 4 days because I overdosed. Physically I was okay but they sent me to psychiatric facility. 5150. From this experience I can tell you how degrading it was to be treated like a child or like I am insane. When I simply asked for a bread roll they forgot to give for lunch, the cafeteria staff just looked down on me shuuing me away telling me Iâ€™m wrong. Or being told â€œyou are not well enoughâ€  to do one thing or another, that feels awful. We are still adults still people treat us the same way you would normally. We appreciate help but taking aways pills or razors like we are children is useless and degrading, we can always just buy more. If you know someone who tried to end it but failed, give that person some credit because they are the ones that stopped it.
