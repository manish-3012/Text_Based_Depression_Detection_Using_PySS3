I did something so stupid.I'm laying here awake because I hate myself so god damn much. 

I haven't been the same since a certain natural disasters occurred in my area. I'm worse. I did something so stupid tonight and drove under the influence. I HATE myself for what I did. We talk about the disaster and I just lose myself. 

Oh my God. I'm sorry, world. So flipping sorry.

I had to put this out there. I'm so unhappy about what I did. I just can't believe myself. I wish I never existed.
