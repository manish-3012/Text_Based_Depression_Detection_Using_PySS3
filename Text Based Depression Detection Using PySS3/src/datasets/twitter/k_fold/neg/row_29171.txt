How do I just do it?The pain im in wonâ€™t stop. Iâ€™ve tried so hard to be better and Iâ€™m too worthless to be loved. All my life all I ever wanted was someone to talk to. And I could never matter to anyone. 

I want to die, but I canâ€™t be brave enough to end it. How do I just gather a few moments of courage to slash my neck open?
