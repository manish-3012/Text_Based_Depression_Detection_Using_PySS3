Calling the suicide hotlineIs there anyway to guarantee they will send cops to the correct house? I called before and they sent police to the house across the street. I watched the cops beat up the homeowner and put him in handcuffs before taking him away. I felt guilty, but I could never bring myself to apologize. I want them to come to my house because I'm going to kill myself...and I want to kill some cops, too. I can't get the one who raped me or the one who murdered my brother, so any cop will do. They're all racist, misogynistic bullies at heart. 

I want to do this tonight or tomorrow, at the latest, so TIA
