Need reliefI have deression and anxiety due to regrets that are very painful burdens, interfere with my present happiness and cause me grief.

I can't forgive myself and spend the entire day wishing to back in time and do things differently.

Due to this problem I can't focus on anything and have lost my job.

Please help, I can't live with this regrets anymore.
