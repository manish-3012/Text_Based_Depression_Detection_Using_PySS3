not sure how to continuei've been feeling down off and on for 7 ish years now, and this (school)year it has been getting progressively worse. i've been near attempting twice in the past few weeks. i have so much shit to do over the next few weeks. the way everything has piled up has me so overwhelmed. i sharpen my knives and make nooses when i get in these moods. i get high on stolen prescrip pain killers. i drink. i hurt myself. and now i just feel like suicide is imminent. i need to either die, or find the motivation to power through the next few weeks. i dont know how to manage. i need help.
