Suicidal and need to express thisI have my reasons I want to die. Believe me, the reasons are sufficient. I don't want to talk about it because thinking or talking about the specifics makes me feel worse. I have chronic illnesses along with a host of other problems with my life circumstances. There is no hope for a better future. My parents don't understand how difficult it is for me to live. I tell them but they tell me maybe a miracle will make me better. I know this is not possible but they are in denial and insist God will help me. Of course, this is ridiculous. I want to die but I can't think of a reliable way. I'm so scared of failing and being in a situation where I can't even make an attempt again. I just needed to let this out. Thanks for reading, anyone out there. I wish the world was a fair and just place with a God etc. like my parents think it is. I know better.
