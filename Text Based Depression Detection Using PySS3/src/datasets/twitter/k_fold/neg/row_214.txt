No one cares.I'm at the point where i have no freinds, parents don't care, and no hope of a romantic relationship because of low self esteem and confidence due to bipolar disorder.  All the things I like to do alone are bad for my health.  All I really want is for someone to care about my wellbeing.  

I've tried joining clubs and groups around my area; they all suck, and the places you go to make freinds attract the most annoying, antisocial people - even I wouldn't hang out with some of these people who can't formulate a complete sentence.  

Eveyone I know is having a great time - except for me.  No one even bothers to like or comment on my facebook statuses anymore... which makes me seem even more of a loser.  Please, is it too much to ask for one person?
