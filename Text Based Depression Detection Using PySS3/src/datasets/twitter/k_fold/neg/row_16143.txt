Can you ever actually recover from suicidality/a suicide attempt?[[throwaway as people know my username]]

Attempted suicide 7 years ago and was literally pulled back from the edge by roommates. I don't really remember much about it due to the crazy meds I was on, but I do remember intentionally putting on Imogen Heap's Hide and Seek as like my last song.

Fast forward to today and Hide and Seek just randomly came on youtube and I started crying and partly wondering what would have been... like I'm alive but life is hard and I'm quite lonely when not at work so it's just weird to hear that song; so many emotions came flooding back, as well as memories of what I could see when I listened to that song 7 years ago.

Just wondering if that resonated with anyone here at all?
