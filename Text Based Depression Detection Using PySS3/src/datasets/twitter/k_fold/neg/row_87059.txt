Attempt made my life sort of betterA few hours ago i hung myself but my neck didnâ€™t break so i was slow suffocating. And then out of nowhere my body was like: OH MY F*****G GOD Iâ€™M GONNA F*****G DIEâ€™ and released a unhealthy of adrenaline so i pulled myself up and released myself from the noose.then suddenly i was motivated to get Aâ€™s for tests on school and wanted to get really good at piano. 
So that suicide attempt sort of made my life better, i know that doesnâ€™t make sense but i have motivation and that makes me happy.
