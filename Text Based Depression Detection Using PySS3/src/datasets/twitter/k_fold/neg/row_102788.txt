Nobody other than my family/salespeople have ever texted or called me before.Nobody's ever asked me for my phone number for over two decades. When I was a kid, the other kids in the neighbourhood all knew the phone number of each other's houses. None of them ever asked for mine. Even after I got my first phone ages ago, nobody ever asked me what my phone number was. Nobody's ever messaged me or called me.

Idk why, but I just thought about this on my way home from Uni today. Made me incredibly depressed once I realised that i've never gotten a phone call from someone that wasn't a family member or someone wanting to sell me things or scam me.
