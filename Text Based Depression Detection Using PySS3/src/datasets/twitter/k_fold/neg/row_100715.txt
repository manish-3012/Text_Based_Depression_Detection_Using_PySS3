I called the suicide hotline but they're all taken. I really am suicidal right now and can barely take it.Please help me. I called the suicide hotline (for the record I'm German and it's called Telefonseelsorge) but it hangs up on you if all lines are taken. So I'm not sure what to do here.

About me... the last two weeks have been spent with nothing but crying, and serious suicidal behaviour. It's actually hard not to kill myself; I'm doing everything I can not to.

Please help me. I just want help. I can't take it anymore. Life is just so... so terrible. :(

Near me, there is a cliff. I'm really tempted to just jump off it. I'm not sure how much more I can take until I give in and jump. I can barely control my actions anymore.
