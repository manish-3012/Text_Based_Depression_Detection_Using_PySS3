How much longerIâ€™ve been dealing with Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a few other things for years now. I keep feeling worse by the day. I have friends who I know care about me but sometimes they donâ€™t text me back for days. They also are online friends but still the best Iâ€™ve ever had. Iâ€™ve got the next few years planned out but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever make it that far. How much longer until I can be happy? How much longer until I can be cared about and loved? How much longer do I have to struggle through each individual day doing the same things over and over again, until I can finally break free from the monotony that is my life. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I donâ€™t want to end it myself, I just donâ€™t want to be alive if this is my life. How much longer do I have to suffer?
