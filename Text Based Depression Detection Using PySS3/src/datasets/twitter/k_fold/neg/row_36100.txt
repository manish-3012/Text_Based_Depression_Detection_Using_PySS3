Things are so bleak and I can't stop thinking about it.I can't take this pain anymore. It will be so long to get any psychiatric help. I can't have my kid. All my friends are gone. I have no family. I had to leave my job and city 6 months ago because I was getting death threats. The people I was with abandoned me and now I have nothing. I'm trying so hard, and I can't stop hurting. The pain is overwhelming right next to these unstoppable thoughts. My gf is refusing to let me put myself on a hold and I can't live with her. I'm so scared. My ex husband tried to take my kid from me several times before. And now im homeless, no job, no money no hope. I just want to be selfish and give up. I won't hurt anymore, and I won't have to worry about the guilt of what I've done to others when I'm gone.
