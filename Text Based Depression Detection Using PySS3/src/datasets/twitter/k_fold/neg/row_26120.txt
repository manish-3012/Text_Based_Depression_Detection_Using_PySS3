I canâ€™t do this.Iâ€™ve been out of trauma treatment for less than 3 weeks now. While I was there I started feeling so much better. Now that Iâ€™m back in my hometown I donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s like this blackhole is consuming me and Iâ€™m spiraling into a scary place. I canâ€™t bring myself to do anything, I donâ€™t feel like I have anything inside of me to fight this darkness again. Itâ€™s been a struggle to even keep taking my meds that I know are helping me. I think if I stopped them I really wouldnâ€™t come back from it. Part of me wants to stop taking them because I want to finally have the ability to kill myself. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone about it because Iâ€™m donâ€™t want them to worry about me, or try to talk me out of it. Where do I go from here? Is it even worth it to try to dig myself out of this hole? How do I keep going anymore. Everybody at the center told me Iâ€™m such a fighter, so resilient. But Iâ€™m just too tired to fight anymore.
