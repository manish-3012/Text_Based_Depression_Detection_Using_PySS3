Thank you allI just want to thank everyone on here that helped me and I wish you all do great I havenâ€™t had suicidal thoughts in months I started exercising and eating better and Iâ€™ve been in such a better mood in the past few months. Like I said I hope everyone on here and especially people that have helped me along my way gets better soon.
