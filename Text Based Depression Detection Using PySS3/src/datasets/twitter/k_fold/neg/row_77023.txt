ContemplatingHello. I really donâ€™t know where else to go to or if my country even has suicide hotlines. Since I came back home for the holidays everything has just been a mess. Iâ€™m always placed at the center of the feud between my parents and even forced to stand there as they argue while being essentially blamed for what happens and it happens almost everyday and I donâ€™t want to continue living like this. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fear of what happens after death and if I ever manage to overcome that fear I can truthfully say I will be gone. I wish I could just move out and not deal with this but Iâ€™m only 16 again I donâ€™t know if this is the appropriate place for this but I donâ€™t know where else to go
