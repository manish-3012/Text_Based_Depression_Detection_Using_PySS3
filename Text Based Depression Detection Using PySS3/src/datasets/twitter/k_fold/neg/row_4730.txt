AcceptanceEveryone always says that life is a game of compromises, of accepting less-than-ideal circumstances and trying to make do with them, limping along as best you can anyway. They tell me that I should just accept that that's the way it is and try to enjoy it. But they never stop to think that maybe they're the ones that need to practice acceptance when I say no. I see no point to it. A glass half empty is a glass half empty, you know? Why am I paying full price for half a glass? I've been through two therapists and three medications with a total of four doses in the past seven months, and whatever do I'm supposed to be making has about five more to show itself before I buy myself a shotgun and my landlord new carpets and paint. 

Tick tock.
