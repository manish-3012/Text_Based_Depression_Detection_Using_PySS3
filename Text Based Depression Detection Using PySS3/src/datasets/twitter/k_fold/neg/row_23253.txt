Seriously thought about throwing myself in front of a bus.Got out of school today(freshman) and seriously considered throwing myself in front of a school bus.

Now, obviously I didn't. Not saying I don't wish I did. And I know I probably don't have it as bad as...well anyone. I know my life isn't worth anything. I can walk out a room and rarely anybody will notice. 

Someone got a call and talked about how they were invited to dinner and then named everybody. They wouldn't have mentioned me if they hadn't walked into the room and saw me. I know because they paused and almost kept talking until they walked in and saw me, then quickly said my name. That just happened. As I was writing this post. 

I know whatever I post is useless to all of you. I doubt anyone cares and I don't see why you should. I might not even post this from anxiety! So if you do see this...what am I supposed to say here? 

Strange I played DDLC. A game that warns you to NOT play it if you have depression and other things.

Well bye.
