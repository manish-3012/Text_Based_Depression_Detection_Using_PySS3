Confession for strangersJust want to start off by saying that I donâ€™t need reassurance, I just want to put this confession out in the ether in a community thatâ€™ll actually read it. Iâ€™m losing my battle. What went from a monthly thought about suicide, started turning into a weekly thought, to a daily thought, to an hourly thought. Between the civil unrest in my country and Covid, it feels like my world has fallen apart. I was laid off due to covid, UI hasnâ€™t kicked in for over 7 weeks, no calls for interviews for the same amount of time. This means itâ€™s very possible weâ€™ll lose the house soon. Weâ€™ve been trying to have  a baby over two years now, but nada. She went to the doc but they said she was completely healthy and fertile, I probably am just unable to have kids. By all means Iâ€™ve failed not only as a man but as a human being. I plan to divorce my wife in late Dec or early Jan, giving her all of (whatâ€™s left of) the assets and fur-babies, save enough for a gun and ammo, so that no one has the burden of finding me once itâ€™s done. Thank you for reading this, I donâ€™t have the heart to tell anyone I know that Iâ€™ll be leaving soon.
