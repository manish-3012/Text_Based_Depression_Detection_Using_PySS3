Please help me.Hello again , i  have posted here once before but , i have the need to do so again. For the past month or so i have stopped eating , not willingly but most of the time i just do not feel hungry. I have thoughts of suicide almost daily and i can not stop thinking about how i just never had any kind of long term friendships , and the funny part is that this never really bothered me in the past , and i know it is stupid to crave something you did not have to start with. I only ever really had 2 actual friends. One who we drifted after a while and another who wont bother to converse with me if i dont start talking. I keep having thoughts about "cutting" as well but i am too scared to even bother. I dont know what to do. It feels like i do not really control my own mind anymore.
