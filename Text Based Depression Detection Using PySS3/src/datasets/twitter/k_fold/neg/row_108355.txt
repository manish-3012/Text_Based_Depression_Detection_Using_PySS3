My anxiety consumes meI have general anxiety disorder that I'm in therapy for. I pick one thing and stress/obsess. Right now I'm anxious about flying. My husband booked a trip for us to see his family and I've been having severe suicidal thoughts where I fantasize about taking myself out of the equation so he can live peacefully with his family. I don't want to get on a plane. So much so that I'd end my life just so I wouldn't have to. I'm not sure what it is. I guess just being in this vessel of death that I rather take matters into my own hands. Die how I want to die. Not in the hands of a pilot or a plane that is malfunctioning for whatever reason. It's all I think about. I can't be a wife this way. I can't be myself this way. It's overwhelming me with grief. I can't function. I need help. I feel like I'm screaming for help but no one is listening. No one can get inside my head and feel how I feel. It's unbearable. Just waiting for this flight is destroying me. Mentally. Physically. I've been getting heart palpitations, panic attacks, nose bleeds. I need help. I'm not sure what to do or where to go. If I refuse to go, he'll seek divorce. But if I oblige, I'll be in my own personal hell until we board and then I'll be in real hell. I'm lost.
