I'm sobbing and can't breathe, my parents just fought, dad slapped dog and said he's moving out Oct 1st.I'm 17 and live with my parents and 14 and 5 year old sister. I have severe generalized anxiety disorder and depression with episodes of psychosis. I have been in one of my worst relapses for the last 8 months with almost no support and today things have been made as bad as ever. 

A few months ago my dad brought home a dog from a rescue shelter. He lied and said he lived alone with no other animals. This dog is not good with animals, but we've been training it. Today the dog snapped at our other older dog and my mom removed it from the area. My dad proceeded to find the dog and slap her hard and she ran away. My dad followed and yelled. 

This caused an argument and I said you aren't going to slap a dog in front of me and get away with it. My dad proceeded to start screaming in front of everyone(including my 5 year old sister) and saying "THIS IS MY FUCKING DOG, I CAN DO WHAT I WANT". He and my mom got into an argument and my dad started playing victim talking about how he's "always wrong" and "not loved by anyone". He said he could do a better job raising kids on his own. He claimed to be moving out October 1st.

I'm now here in my room sobbing with my anxiety as high as it could possibly be. I'm trembling and I feel so hopeless. I don't want my dad to take the dog, I love this dog and it has helped me through periods of depression. I want it to live a fun life. I feel bad for both my parents, but especially my mom. She is ill and shouldn't be going through these arguments.

Someone please help me. I don't want to cry anymore. I have a feeling if it wasn't for me being here, things wouldn't be like this
