Something.I told my one close friend about my suicidal idealation and my depression and was very comforted at his response. I asked if he'd be cool taking me to the hospital if I needed it and he said he definitely would. He was very supportive of me and I love him for it. I'm just scared I'll relapse in a couple days again and go back to feeling like complete shit. Please help
