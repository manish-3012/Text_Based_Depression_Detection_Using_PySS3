A difficult case!Iâ€™m not very good at articulating or really feeling emotions. Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m not sad though. I donâ€™t cry any more than normal for a guy, and I laugh and I smile and I appreciate the little things in life. Iâ€™m an optimist, and I take time out of my day to appreciate the work people around the world have put into the things I enjoy, like my old car or my old computer or my old clothes. Itâ€™s really a wonder how people today enjoy such awesome things, and yet they donâ€™t really give a goddamn about â€˜em.

I live in an absolutely beautiful place that Iâ€™m absolutely grateful to be in, but nobody around me seems to care about it. I really feel fundamentally different from the society around me.

I dropped out of college after I got demotivated by both an advisor fuck-up and a complete lack of financial aid despite straight Aâ€™s. I have no desire to make any more money than I currently do. I truly appreciate everything that I currently have, and recognize that not doing so simply leads to desiring better and more fanciful things that really arenâ€™t all that necessary.

Yet, it seems like modern society is all about buying new cars as status symbols, buying large televisions as status symbols, buying fancy houses as status symbolsâ€¦ et cetera. I donâ€™t get it, I really donâ€™t.

Iâ€™ve travelled across the US and I have seen everything Iâ€™ve wanted to see, and done everything Iâ€™ve wanted to do. Iâ€™ve experienced true love, Iâ€™ve learned a lot about the world around me, and Iâ€™ve tasted exceptional food.

The main reason I just donâ€™t feel like going on any longer is because I donâ€™t really have anything to look forward to. I donâ€™t want to do anything else in life, and anything beyond this point would be a form of stasis â€“ just waiting off the inevitable while I keep my body running.

The thought of jumping off a nearby cliff makes me feel happiness and completeness, and I spend most of my days looking forward to the unconsciousness of sleep.

I have to stress that I do not cry or feel sadness when thinking about suicide. I simply feel that I have completed my run in life, I completed my lifeâ€™s dream before 21, and now have no motivations to carry me forward. Anything from here on, I feel like Iâ€™d just be a drain on natural resources and taking away from the younger generation which has just as much a right to life as I do.

So what on Earth should keep me from jumping?
