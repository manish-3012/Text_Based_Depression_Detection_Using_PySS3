Donâ€™t know whatâ€™s real anymoreIâ€™m dealing with such a fucked up time right now, and I had a terrible acid trip recently that has just changed my life forever and Iâ€™m not the same I feel like I was emotionally abused from the person who I was tripping with like a sick fucking experiment 
My boyfriend of 3 years left me and isnâ€™t coming back. He doesnâ€™t even care enough to message me at all, he doesnâ€™t give a fuck about me. The only relief is sleep. And then I wake up crying. I just want to end it but Iâ€™m too scared. I have no one to talk to. I think about suicide every time the acid trip comes back into my mind I donâ€™t even think my brain can process what happened. I keep wanting to throw up. I just feel so fucked up. Itâ€™s my own fault. 
Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was like 14, Iâ€™m 21 now. Iâ€™ve been bullied my entire schooling life.  Among other fucked up unspeakable shit. I think back on my â€˜friendsâ€™ Iâ€™ve made in my life (not many) and theyâ€™ve all just ended up being so fucking cruel. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me but I have felt like there was something deeply wrong about me since I was so little. Sometimes I think Iâ€™m okay but then I get all these intrusive thoughts and I go down into this deep dark spiral that I canâ€™t get out of. Iâ€™m scared of myself and I m scared of this world and our existence. Sorry to whoeverâ€™s reading this. Probably gonna delete this anyway
