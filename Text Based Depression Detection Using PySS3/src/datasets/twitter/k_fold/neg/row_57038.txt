am i upside down or is everything else fucked up?So I have been recommended by a psychiatrist to get on fluoxetine and buproprion. My reaction earlier today: "You're joking, right?" This surprising sequence of events probably started when I started feeling unmotivated in med school and my girlfriend dumped me. (Although I can't be sure of that. Thinking in depth about my childhood I may have had depressive symptoms since well, as long I can remember). The tipping point was when I caught myself seriously considering jumping from the George Washington Bridge as I walked across. That scared me. I have pretty intense suicidal thoughts a couple times a week (noticing ways to kill myself with things in the environment and weighing lethality). However drugs seem like a bad idea. They're not going to change the facts that everyone hates me, that I'm ugly, that I'm a failure at everything I try, that I'm boring, etc.
