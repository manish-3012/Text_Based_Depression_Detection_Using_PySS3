I'm readyI've tried before, but this time I'm serious.

I broke up with my girlfriend and left all the online servers I'm in. handed over ownership of things I run. I'm going to leave a note for my parents and run away tonight. have razors and a noose with me. I'll do what it takes. 

life is shit. bulimia is shit. depression is shit. break-ups are shit. therapy sucks, my life sucks, I suck, and I can't wait to be free.
