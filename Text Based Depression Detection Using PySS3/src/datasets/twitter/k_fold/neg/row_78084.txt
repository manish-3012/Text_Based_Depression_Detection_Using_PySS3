I'm getting scared for my best friendShe told me not to show anybody this but I need help so we've been writing notes and the latest one caught my eye I'll put it here "Hey, It's me again...Are you gonna be there then when I'm crying? Are you gonna be there when everyone is gone? PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE Don't leave me alone in the darkness when no one else will show me the light. I want to stay friends with you, I REALLY do. But I know you'll be gone soon, everyone always leaves me when they realise how much of a bad human being I am, I actually am. I want to make this last because when I remember I know that these memories will what brings me back from anxiety attacks, my suicide attempts, and when I'm broken and crying. I love being bestfriends with you, and I love spending time with you. You are one of the few reasons I'm still alive. Thank you for being there for me when no else cares. I'm there for you, no matter what happens." Man this got me chocking up so much. I'm so worried.
