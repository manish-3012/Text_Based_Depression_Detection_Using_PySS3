I'm scared if he dies I'm gonna kill myselfSo the main idea of this post is that I'm struggling to predict what my state of mind will be if my dad dies so I have no idea how to prevent killing myself on impulse. If anyone's got any advice or resources or anything that might help prepare me I'd appreciate it.

For context I'm 18, live with my dad and the rest of my family is in different countries and I'm not super close with them. No friends except my best friend who I only know online. Always been super close with my dad and rely on him for mostly everything.

Backstory is below as I wrote it for my friend if you wanna read it, sorry the grammar isn't good.

So on Tuesday my dad's getting a surgery n if shit goes wrong I'm worried it's like gonna put me over the edge
He has cancer n this shit has happened before but I've always been suicidal so losing him could really put me over the edge so like I'm tryna prepare myself
Basically he had a surgery before that went fine but they said the cancer had spread
N I almost killed myself that night
Only didn't cuz he was still alive n I hadda live for him
That was 3 years ago
But yeah u can see why I'm worried if something goes wrong with this surgery n he actually dies
I won't have the same reason to stay alive
I got other reasons but I'm like worried what I might do just on impulse.
I'm scared af all the will to live that I've managed to build up is gonna fly out the window so fast man.
