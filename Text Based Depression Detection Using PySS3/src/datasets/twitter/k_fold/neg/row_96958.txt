At this point I am absolutely certain that I will never be free of depression. Why keep living?It's been more than five years since I accepted that I was depressed and tried to get help. A few months ago I stopped seeing my psychiatrist and therapist. Almost five years of nonstop medication with precisely no success whatsoever, and four years of going through over a dozen therapists and never feeling like a single one of them actually knew how to help me, if they even cared at all. I thought that I'd eventually just get used to it, but I never did. Every day is somehow more miserable than the last.

Nobody would miss me at this point. I haven't had any friends in three years, and my family stopped talking to me after I moved out. They were never shy about expressing their great disappointment in me, anyway. Cutting them out of my life was for the better. I've never had a relationship and certainly never will. The only people in the entire world who would even notice I had disappeared would be my boss and my landlord.

The only advice I've ever seen is to believe that my depression will be lifted someday. I can't believe that. I literally have no hope in it anymore. So what I ask is this: assuming that I will be depressed for the rest of my life, why shouldn't I just kill myself now?
