So here I am..Lying again in my bed, thinking about death.. Told my best friend that (she knows that i have a bad "phase" since years) im actually ok with dying and that the only thing thats holding me back is my family.. Yes Im one of those wimps, who have a supportive family, a good college degree and work (which is ok, cant complain) and a good handfull of friends. I know there are a lot of people out there who have it way worse..

Im a very logically thinking person (i still do a lot of things spontaneous) and i can't see a reason why death should be feared and not be embraced.. If I would be hit by a car, i would actually die happy, knowing that i reached what i want, without being the reason for hurting my closest family. If u think that idea one step further, actually why should i care what other want (and still i do) and thats where im in conflict with myself and getting breakdowns..

In the end i should probably just suck it up and grow some balls and stop thinking that much. It just isnt worth it. 

Thanks for listening..
