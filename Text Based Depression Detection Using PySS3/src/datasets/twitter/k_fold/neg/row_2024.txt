I donâ€™t know what to doI donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Itâ€™s not like I have a bad life, Iâ€™ve got good parents, friends and a boyfriend. I go to a decent school and Iâ€™m kind of smart, except I have no motivation to try in school so I donâ€™t do very well. No one seems to understand what Iâ€™m going through or take me seriously. Iâ€™ve tried talking to friends and my mum about it but they usually dismiss it. 
The thing is I canâ€™t actually kill myself. Which is the problem. I have no options, not even the worst option. I donâ€™t want to hurt the people I love by doing that. But Iâ€™m so sick of living and feeling like this. I feel like a burden to my boyfriend because of the way I am. 
I feel so helpless because I know no matter what I do, this feeling will never go away. My boyfriend suggests therapy but I tried that a few years ago and hated it. I struggle talking to strangers, especially about this stuff. 
So to summarise, my biggest problem is that I honestly donâ€™t know what to do. I feel stuck. I feel so helpless because Iâ€™ll be like this forever. This sort of stuff canâ€™t be cured. Iâ€™m stuck having to live like this because I canâ€™t end my life. I really wish I could.
