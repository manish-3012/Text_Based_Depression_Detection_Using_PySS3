Itâ€™s nearing timeIâ€™m absolutely useless to everyone around me. I have a two year old that I am not mentally or financially fit to take care of whoâ€™s father is not involved. My mother basically raises him while I live with them because Iâ€™m too wrapped up in my depression to do anything or care. Every relationship Iâ€™ve ever had blew up in my face and my last just ended and Iâ€™m pregnant and canâ€™t fathom having a baby with him or keeping it and the hole being dug even bigger, and termination is terrifying for me. 

Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a long time, but itâ€™s finally starting to feel like something I *need* to do. My son doesnâ€™t deserve to see his mother fail and love this way. I am a physical and financial burden to everyone I love. I can hardly hold a job anymore because Iâ€™m fucking miserable and I bend at the chance of any short lived happiness, often times my jobs causing direct misery in my life. Itâ€™s too much. Itâ€™s all just too much and I canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™ll always be poor and exhausted and run down and unhappy and I donâ€™t want to live this way
