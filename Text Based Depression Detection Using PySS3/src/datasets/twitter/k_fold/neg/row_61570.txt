I just want the hurt to fucking endwhy doesn't it stop shy doesn't it stop I just can't do this anymore. I was born broken. I've been broken since the very beginning. I'm in pieces. I'm a faulty human and I don't work. I can't talk to any body without coming off as inept and awkward. I hate everybody I meet. I'm a phobe of everything - I'm scared of immigrants, I'm scared of queers. everything frightens and disgusts me. I'm so tired of hating everything and I'm tired of hating myself. why won't it end
