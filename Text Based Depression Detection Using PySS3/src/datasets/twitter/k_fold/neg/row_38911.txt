Well, my journey is over. ER is utterly useless.If you have been following my posts and stuff, i said yesterday that today was the biggest day of my life. I did everything i planned i called 911 (first time in my life) police came, handcuffed me and put me in a police car (also first in my life) and took me to hospital. Over there, i talked to like 12 different doctors each one saying the same questions like my name and my age, are you having suicidal thoughts and for how long? my asshole dad came and started crying trying to improve himself. Of course its hard for me to forgive him for all the toxicity all the years. doctors didnt do shit prescibed me some nasal spray shit because i said i had a stuffy nose (at this point GIVE ME SOMETHING ANYTHING I TOOK ALL THIS RISK FOR FUCKING NASAL SPRAY) and yeah my journey from last summer ended. For the past year i been on this road to get help, from going to r/suicidewatch and 7cups.com to going to suicide text chat and calling the suicide hotline to fucking do this shit today. Idk where to go at this point, but atleast this shit is off my back and I dont have a countdown timer on my ass. I have some psychiatric mental health appointment tomorrow i have to go to and idk what else after that. so yeah wtf to do now... (this is a repost from a month ago btw)
