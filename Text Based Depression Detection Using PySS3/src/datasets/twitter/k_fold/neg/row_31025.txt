fuuuck. i think i found the key to my dad's gun safe, and my parents are gone for probably some time.i just- fuck, i don't know what to do anymore. i don't think i'll attempt today, because i haven't written a note and i don't want to leave a mess and i don't know when my parents are coming back and i don't want them to find me in the middle of shooting myself, but just knowing the option is there is sorely tempting, and, tbh, if my parents were gone for a day or two, i'd almost definitely kill myself or at least try, and the idea scares me but also really tempts me. like, back when death was just a hypothetical, i'd almost definitely want it, but now that the possibility is *real* and i could do it *now* i just don't fucking know anymore.

fuck, i'm sorry for dumping this on y'all lmao, you shouldn't have to deal with me being indecisive about whether or not to shoot myself when there's so many other people here dealing with way worse shi.
