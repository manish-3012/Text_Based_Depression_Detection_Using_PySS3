I canâ€™t go on anymore13 y/o M here. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I have shitty health diseases. I got raped by my brother. I have OCD, social anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder. I also live in a poorer family, I love my parents though. All my friends do fun things all day, they have perfect mental health, good health, happy families etc. I live near nobody my age. Itâ€™s hard for me to socialize now because of my social anxiety. Everyday is just pain for me and I donâ€™t know how a kid my age can go through so much heartbreak. I know probably no one cares but fuck it Iâ€™m posting this.
