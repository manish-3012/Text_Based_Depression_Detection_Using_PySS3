I'm so tired of constantly feeling inadequate.I'm so bad at everything. I can't read fast anymore, my math skills are awful, I sold my trumpet because I could barely play it anymore, I'm terrible at video games, even the ones I like and play a lot, my people skills are so horrible they're not even worth discussing - the list goes on. It's like my brain just gave up on working properly a few years ago, and now I'm this perpetually below-average loser.

It's not that I haven't tried. I try harder than I used to for way worse results, and it'sunbelievably frustrating. *Everything* frustrates me now. It seems like I'm going to spend the rest of my life being this embarrassing failure no matter what I do. I'm such a pathetic piece of trash. I used to be so *good* at what I did, but if this is who I am now then I'd much rather just end it and save myself the pain.
