I keep telling myself that if things ever get too bad, I can always kill myself.I don't know if I'd ever follow through with it, but it's a thought that I can't shake. I can use it as a last ditch effort to end all my emotional pain once and for all.

It's still terrifying to me and maybe once I go to therapy I'll rethink my stance, but this is how I feel now.
