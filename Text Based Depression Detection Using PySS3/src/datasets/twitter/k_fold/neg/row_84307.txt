IT HUUURRTSS* no support group, no friends
* THE WORLD IS AGAINST ME - I've always been discouraged from being myself + my values don't coincide with cultural values - basically I'M FUCKED
* ALONE
* lost in &amp; alienated from society
* I have absolutely no freedom (not even freedom of expression) due to being a minor &amp; having to live with parents
* I always do everything wrongly no matter how hard I try, and I'm not exaggerating. I am confident and love myself, but that doesn't hide the facts. I'm honest in nature, so I can't just *pretend* I am "good" at things.
* Life is monotonous. I do the same shit everyday because I can't do anything else due to parents. My mom's "dietary" food is tasteless, lifeless and boring, and I starve myself whenever I can instead out of lack of options. I can *try* to cook food but I fuck up every time - see previous bullet point.  
* I am unwanted, unappreciated, unacknowledged no matter how much I help others.
* I'm broke af - I have to start being independent soon + I have to figure out wtf to do with my life soon - I couldn't be more clueless.
* The environment around me + circumstances are SHIT, and yes, I've tried "making the most of it" and other fairy-tale wishful thinking shit.
* Cannot follow my passions full-time because they are "unrealistic and idealistic" and [non-violently] illegal for the most part.
