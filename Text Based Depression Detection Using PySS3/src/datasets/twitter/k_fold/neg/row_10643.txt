i wish i could just die already so my mom could be happy, iâ€™m just extra weight in her shouldersmy mom is a very sweet person, she tries her best to take care of me and my family and all i do is just sit around and do nothing to help her, i feel bad for my mom and i feel that dying would be the best option to help, i have aspergers so iâ€™ve already failed her from the start

sorry
