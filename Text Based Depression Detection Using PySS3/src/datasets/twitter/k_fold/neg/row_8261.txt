I want to die and feel like no one understandsToday I saw some of my friends after a long time. We had a lot of fun but after going home I just felt worse than normally. I don't know why. I attempted suicide about three weeks ago and every day I'm reminded how I couldn't even do that right. I really want to die and I stay awake every night just feeling sorry for myself. My friends have said that I can always talk to the when I'm feeling bad but I just can't. I don't know how to talk about my feelings. But even if I did, I feel like my friends don't understand that I'm 100% serious about it. Until I slit my own wrist they thought I was just a bit sad and joked about suicide.  
I'm too afraid to even tell my therapist that I actually want to die because she'll just ask why, why, why. I don't know! I don't even care! I just want to not feel like shit all the time. But I'm afraid that if I kill myself my little sister will follow, because she seems depressed, so what I've been thinking is disappearing without a trace and then killing myself somewhere where I will not be found.
I don't know what to do. I don't want to live. I don't want to put my family through all that grief that my death would probably cause them but I was never a good child and didn't get along my parents when I was a kid, I just cried and got mad and broke stuff. If I died, it wouldn't be the end of the world to them. I don't know if I should tell my mother that I want to die. I don't know if I can continue studying. All I ever do anymore is lay in my bed or get absolutely wasted. I'm hoping one night I'll just pass out drunk outside and freeze to death.
Ah well this was a long vent. I'm tired but I can't sleep.
