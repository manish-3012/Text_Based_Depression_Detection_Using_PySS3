I can't beleive I'm posting this...If anybody knows my username IRL , I'm screwed. But I cannot take it anymore. I have been secretly depressed for so long I cannot remember being happy , and not the fake "happy" crap I pull everyday. I've been suicidal for a long time and I'm planning to end it in 19 days. The problem is I can't stop thinking about how I'm going to hurt my family and friends- which makes me feel worse.. I want to die, I would do it now if these two upcoming weeks weren't so important to my family. I want to jump off a bridge, it's a shorter highway bridge (maybe 17 feet high- is that enough to kill me?)  im thinking the concrete impact will be enough but I'm not sure. I'm crying now- then again I cry everynight , and I hardly get sleep. It used to be I could control my thoughts of death duringvthe day , but for the past month they come. I'll be sitting in class , doing work when it all hits me, it takes every part of my not to cry right then. Tell me - will this fall kill me? I honestly hope so..  I'm really scared to post this , I'm not sure if anyone in rl knows me.. If you do- please leave it alone.
