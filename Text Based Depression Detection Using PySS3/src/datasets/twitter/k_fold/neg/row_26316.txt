I'll end this my way.Fuck living in this word. I just can't reason out why I would want to wake up tomorrow? I've slipped so far and therapy is a joke. I've never been treated with any kind of respect. I'm always alone. Now more than ever. All of my family is dead. Last girlfriend cheated on me when my mom was dying in this hospital. Before her I was falsely accused of rape. Glad her story fell apart and she admitted she lied about it. Still lost my job at the time though. Don't even know why I'm sad about my mom's death. When my dad died 26 years ago my mom walked out on me. I was only 13 but had lost it all. No one has ever been there for me. I'm all I ever had. All a therapist can say is "That's why you're depressed..." Stupid whore I was dating while my mom was dying tried to contact me 2 months after my mom died. She wanted to meet me face to face to apologize. How the fuck is that going to fix the extra grief she caused? How stupid do you have to be to not get how much worst that would make dealing with the death of a parent?

I live in such a horrible world. I can win thought. I can kill myself. I can end this on my terms. I'm not sharing a place where people that threat me, live.  I've wasted enough time and money on therapy. I should have blown my brains out months ago.
