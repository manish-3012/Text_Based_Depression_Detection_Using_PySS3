Fuck the dating gameIn order to succeed, I have to be everything I'm not. I have to be:

1. Confident. I have to be able to gave opinions, strong one's too, despite the relativity. To call something any adjective or adverb, I have to ignore the plethora of evidence stating otherwise. I have to agree with views, or even form some, and ignore everything else. Who wants to be with someone who can't confidently call something orange?
2. Dishonest. If I tell someone I like them, now I'm creepy, clingy, no effort. I have to play games. I have to walk past them without even noticing them 1/2345324th of the time. I have to lie. Who wants to be with someone easy?
3. Outgoing. I have to have friends. I have to have other people want to be around me. I can't have had my past friendships which ended sour. No one wants to be with someone nobody likes. Who wants to be with someone no one likes?
6. Witty. I have to say the right things at the right time every time. I have to talk in the right tone. I have to be funny. I can't blurt shit out. I can't talk in the most natural way for me. I have to constantly monitor everything I say or do. Who wants to be with somebody obnoxious?
5. Trendy. I have to like what everyone else likes. I have to watch the latest tv shows or movies. Who wants to be with someone out of touch?
6. The Best. I have to prove my worth. I have to be better than my peers. Mediocrity is not an option. Who settles for losers?

I can't be me. And I'm so tired of doing anything without ever having anyone to share it with. Its so pointless and empty.
