My first cousin (and the only one who I live near and am close to) just killed himself today.He left a suicide note for his wife and two kids. He went out into the woods behind his house and killed himself. As a close relative, he never said how much financial trouble he was in. I am devastated and I don't know how to deal with this. He was also my Godfather. He always seemed so successful and rich but I now learned he lost his job over a year ago and sat at home drinking all the time. He lied about this to me. How can you be so proud that you wouldn't ask for help before doing something like this? I just can't believe it. 

I posted this on the wrong subreddit earlier and got told to get off my computer and interact with people. I'm definitely doing that, but I only just started looking at reddit recently and I am amazed at the community on here, so I guess I'm just looking for another source of advice.
