My suicide is logicalI have no job, no friends, never had a girlfriend. I provide no value for society. 

On the other hand, my death would save resources and be more environmentally friendly.  Someone of use could have the resources Iâ€™m currently wasting. 

But because people are slightly uncomfortable by death, Iâ€™m forced to keep suffering until I can find a reliable method to peace out
