I was on top of a tall building today and I didn't jumpIt was 16 stories, more than enough. The railing would have been a cinch to get over. There was a party going on, but I'd have been over the rail before anyone even noticed I was missing. Aside from there being people around it was a perfect opportunity. And I didn't do it.

I don't know if that's good or if that's bad.
