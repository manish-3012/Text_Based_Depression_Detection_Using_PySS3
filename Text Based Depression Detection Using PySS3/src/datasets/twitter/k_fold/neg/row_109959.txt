I really don't want my impulsivity to kill meSo, Im in a new country for the next 6 months, with a different langue that I only sorta know, which has impacted my ability to make connections. I currently can't text, so I can't reach out the suicide help lines in the US. 

I have a really hard time not over analyzing people's reactions to what I say or do, so Im always arguing with myself about whether people like me, and how much I care if they do. In general Id say my self esteem is shit. Before I started my medication, I had a bit of a temper. I felt so justified at the time, but now I have lingering guilt and shame about it. I pushed away a lot of people, wasn't always understanding. Even without the anger, I still feel like the odd one out.

 I have Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, GAD/social anxiety and some lingering cPTSD/PTSD. Im taking meds for the bipolar disorder, but it's not perfect. I can be pretty impulsive, but before today, I've never considered myself a danger to myself. 

When I think about it, I always come to the conclusion that I want to live, and that I have a lot to live for. I have a lovely SO, my sister who's my bestfriend, and some cats that I'm looking forward to coming home to. I want to come home, and I want to do well here. Unfortunately these motivating thoughts don't always precede stupid impulses. 

I need some sort of mantra, or new thought pattern to keep me afloat and alive. Something that can precede or intercede an unsafe impulse. Any and all advice is appreciated.
