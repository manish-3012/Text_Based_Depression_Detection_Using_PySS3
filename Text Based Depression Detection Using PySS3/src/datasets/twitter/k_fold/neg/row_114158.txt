anxiety and insomniaI've been battling anxiety for 2 years now. It comes in waves, some bad months, some good months.
Another wave is here. This time I get nights when I just can't fall asleep at all. This has never happened before. 

I really fucking hate dragging myself through yet another workday, dead tired, because my idiot brain decided to skip sleep.

What's real funny is that I have two bottles of a "magic potion".
If my fucking brain decides to skip sleep for another couple of days,  I might just get irrational enough to disregard family and friends and just chug the potions down.

One way or the other, this brain WILL sleep.
