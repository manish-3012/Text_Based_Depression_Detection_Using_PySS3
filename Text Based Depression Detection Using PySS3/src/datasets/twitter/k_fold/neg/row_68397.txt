We are the universe experiencing itselfLife is worth it. It can be hard, difficult, seemingly endless. But it actually is very short. More or less eighty years, it's all we got. We were dead before for millions of years, and we will be dead for millions of years afterwards. Seems a bit boring, no? :-) But right now, we are the universe experiencing itself. We are star dust that gained self awareness. We get to see how beautiful our planet is, how beautiful the stars can be. We can feel the warmth of a hug, and sometimes we feel what it's like to be in pain. The chances of both you and me being here, the chances of you reading this, the chances of me writing this, they are astronomically small. And yet, it happened. Don't throw away those eighty years, live them. Life is not a lineair path to happiness and you will suffer, but you will also smile, laugh and dream again. Because life and the universe are in a permanent state of chaos: it changes constantly. I just wanted to say this.
