[2nd post] If pain is what's required, I'm close to supplementing it with physical pain.I'm the same person from https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4vgm8n/on_the_lowest_disability_pay_in_the_country_my/

I'm in excruciating pain, inflicted by having to accept reality is what society wants and needs from me and nothing less.

I'm close to thinking if I have to suffer pain, I have to compliment it with physical pain.

Nobody wishes to speak to me due to lost trust. Nobody wants to speak to me cause they all think I'm stubborn, but in actual fact it's a combination of Asperger's and other factors that make me the way I am.

I really don't want to supplement the pain "I have to suffer" with physical pain.
