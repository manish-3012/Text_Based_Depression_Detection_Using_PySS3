Upset about my lifeFor the past years in college, I've been alone and I've been content with it. I sat down and played video games or watched TV whenever I got free time from work and school. Basically, oscillating between the two. Didn't bother me much. 

I'm not bad with people. Whenever I'm in a group with someone in class or at work, I usually can make great conversations with them. Unfortunately, I do not keep in close contact after class or work and I don't make any real friendships. I'm so angry I don't do that. 

It doesn't mean I've never made any friends. One of which I talked to everyday in class but I didn't do well in that class cuz I was talking with him constantly and I did not really talk that much to him anymore.

Due to all this, I haven't had a friendly conversation with some face to face in like 2 months (not to talk about work). I feel so lonely and empty. Also I was dragged on a trip with my family and a bunch of old people for fifteen days. I feel like that affected my mental health severely. I don't like to talk to people a lot older than me.

Last thing and probably the most important, I've been recently reading stories of victims of mass shootings and being captured by terroristic organizations. Reading about these beautiful people dedicating their causes to religious organizations and helping people, only to die in a horrific fate at such a young age made me cry. It makes me reflect on what useless sack of shit I am and the world would be better off if they were on earth and not me. 

Sorry if this came out as disorganized, trying to organize my thoughts it difficult right now, a lot is going on.
