Destination, anywhere but hereIt feels like I'm drowning. All my go-to people for sharing my depression are closing themselves off to me, or am I closing myself off to them? I don't know, but whatever I'm doing isn't working. It's all getting worse.   


A breath of air would be lovely....  


I've been meeting with a new counselor, they seem great, but they definitely triggered some stuff this week and I feel I've been in a tail-spin ever since.   


My partner is mad at me for double-booking and having to cancel some plans next week, and they don't seem to want to talk about it--just giving me the silent treatment.   


One of my best friends is thinking about moving out to be closer to work and cheaper rent; I know it's nothing personal but it feels like a form of rejection.   


*Why does the ground seem to be moving so fast?! What happens when I collide with it?! I'm scared.*
