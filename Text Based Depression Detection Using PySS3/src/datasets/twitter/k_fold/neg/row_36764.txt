Not worth helping.When is it ok for a man to take his own life? I used to say never, that's all changed now. I'll keep this short. My gf has wronged me a ton. She has gone full craZy when I have tried to leave her. She dosent have anyone else. I tried to help her, but she kept pushing me and wronging me. I wronged her back. After a year I started hitting her. Yeah I beat my girlfriend. More than once. I'm not very proud to admit it since you are only one who knows (she'll never tell). I can't stop doing it. I've tried, but I'm always mad, and now she dosent even deserve it.. Like today. She's already yelled at me and taken me back. I just don't feel like I deserve to live. I used to ridicule people like that, now I am one. So this is my first time here so I'm just going to assume that this this sub is filled with people not like me, but with good people that usually have fallen on hard times. So as a horrible person should I just end it?
