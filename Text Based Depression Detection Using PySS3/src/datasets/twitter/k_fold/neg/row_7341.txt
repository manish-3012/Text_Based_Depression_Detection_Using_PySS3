I opened up to someone about how I almost killed myself. Theyâ€™re response why would I do something like that?Why would I do something like that? Why wouldnâ€™t I? Iâ€™m a bipolar alcoholic who had a traumatic childhood that Iâ€™m still trying to move in from. Iâ€™ve been unemployed since March and Iâ€™m not sure when Iâ€™ll work again. Iâ€™m not completely broke but money is tight right now. My husband and I constantly fight over the stupidest things. I have no sex drive anymore so I feel like Iâ€™m broken even more now. My favorite brother wants nothing to do with me. I called my best friend to talk/vent about what I was going through, she told me â€œI donâ€™t have time for your bullshitâ€. I feel like a burden and nuisance to everyone in my life. So why wouldnâ€™t I do something like that? My life is absolute shit right now and I donâ€™t see it getting better.
