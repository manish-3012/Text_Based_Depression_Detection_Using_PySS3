Why is everyone trying to keep me alive?Why is everyone trying to keep me alive but not helping me get better? When I speak my mind and tell them I'm actively suicidal, all they can say is "what about me? Don't you know I'll miss you?" yet they never ask why I'm suicidal. They never ask how they can help. When I'm on the edge, crying and pouring my heart out to them, I get met with hostility and I'm scolded for "acting" mentally ill. I've been begging for help and all I get told is that happiness is a choice. Give me one solid reason not to kill myself. None of that "it gets better shit" but that's not true.
