Why can't you see what you do to me?I wish I were dead and it's all your fucking fault. You did this to me. You fucked me up. You're the reason I can't sleep at night or eat. All because you were everything to me and I was fucking nothing to you. 

Fuck, I wonder what you would say if you got the call saying I finally did it. Knowing that I won't come back to you this time, even if I wanted to. Maybe you would change the way you treat people. Maybe you would actually be able to feel emotion not involving your over exaggeration. 

You don't get what it's like and I really hope someone kills you inside one day. Because it's exactly what you fucking did to me. You're the reason I smoke and drink. You will never understand.

You will never know how hard it is to live when you're dead inside.
