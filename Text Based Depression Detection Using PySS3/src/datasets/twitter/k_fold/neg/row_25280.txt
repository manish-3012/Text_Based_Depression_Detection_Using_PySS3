When to go to the hospitalHello Reddit. I've got the action-packed combination of ADHD and bipolar disorder. 

My medication regimen was going great until my ADHD medication needed raising; I can't do my job or function without it. However, when the medication starts winding down for the day I start to become really unstable and have a lot of passive thoughts about suicide and, more pressingly, hurting myself.

I don't have plan and haven't taken steps to pursue those thoughts but they're still causing me an acute amount of distress. I've never attempted suicide. That being said, I'm not comfortable saying that I'll feel this self-aware tomorrow or then next day.

Should I go to the hospital or urgent care? I don't want to be committed but I don't want to feel this way for the next two weeks while I wait for my next psychiatrist appointment. I have no idea if this is serious enough to considering going. 

I'm probably hypomanic right now which is why I'm so calm and blasÃ© about it but trust me, inside I'm panicking.
