I dont see the point of living. I cant help anyone else or myselfI joined this place about 2 hours ago to try to help others, but reading their stories and not being able to offer more than a listening ear made me feel more helpless than ever.

I've been getting sadder and sadder for about 3/4 years now and been depressed for about 2/3 months and it's only been getting worse and worse. I dont see any reason to live other than helping people who dont have it well either. But there's no way i can help anyone here.
