Is choosing suicide a free choice?In our world we are forced into jobs we donâ€™t enjoy. Then we are expected to start a family. This is the basic structure of society. I am aware that there are exceptions. But for the average person, job and a family are required. If you do not comply youâ€™ll live on the street, be poor, shunned, and taken advantage of etc. 

When I was in high school I remember learning about totalitarian dictatorships and how they forced the citizens into labor etc. But then I thought about the capitalist structure today and how my life was dictated by it (I know itâ€™s less extreme and violent). 

In the confines of society how can we be free? What if choosing suicide is the only free choice? Free of this world, free of pain, free from control.

Iâ€™m not advocating for suicide. Just as a depressed and suicidal person these are just some thoughts Iâ€™m having.

If you canâ€™t control the story, deciding to stop reading it is the only thing in your power to control. 

In a horrible, hopeless world, is it not better to not exist, then to merely exist as a robot carrying out others will? 

Sorry, Iâ€™m just constantly plagued by these types of questions.
