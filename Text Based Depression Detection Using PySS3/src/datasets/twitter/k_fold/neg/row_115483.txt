I wasted my youth, and my one shot.Itâ€™s not a particularly pleasant reality, but as a woman you know that your value in the world is based on your sex appeal. Your youth. Your looks. Iâ€™m almost 26 now and just moved in with my boyfriend of 6 years. Iâ€™ve realized I donâ€™t want to be with him. If I stay Iâ€™ll be miserable. If I leave Iâ€™ll be alone. Men donâ€™t want a woman in the mid 20s. They want some 21 year old. Iâ€™ll probably just end my life so I can avoid this.
