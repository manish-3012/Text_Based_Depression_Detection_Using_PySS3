Hopes up, and crushed epically.I've been suffering with depression for as long as I can remember. I have stopped taking any meds two months ago because of how they make me feel, so keep in mind I wasn't in a good place to begin with, already inches from swallowing all 19 bottles of pills I have.

A few weeks ago I was encouraged to apply for a promotion at my work, and I interviewed really well, according to the interviewer after I asked later on. He even had me do acting supervisor for a few days while no supervisors were available. So I was told by the other supervisors they are 100% sure that means I got it. Get in to work today and check my email, to find complete utter denial. No explanation. Nobody else applied for the position. Tonight I am taking all of those pills I've saved up. 

I'm worthless. I'm 100% worthless. I don't deserve to live. I have nobody. I have severe PTSD from being raped in the military twice, and once after I got out a few months later and given HIV (25 yr old male btw). I don't want to keep living. Maybe I'll swallow those pills. Maybe I'll jump in front of a train. Maybe I'll even just bleed out. I only have ten years left to live anyways. Nobody would care.
