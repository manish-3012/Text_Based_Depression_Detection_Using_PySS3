Losing myselfI'm here again, and my biggest fears has come to past. I was scared that after all the happiness I got this month it would propel me back into my life but alas it's gone to no avail. I'm down the spiral again and I can't get my life back on track. I'm failing at school, I'm destroying my mental health, my relationships are crap, I'm sleeping most of the time. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so lonely and I can't help but feel utterly useless. The only thing that I have drive to do is my goal on losing weight. It's the only thing that I truly am proud of, but now I'm losing my interest again. 

I want to be happy really... But I can't.. I just cant.
