I tried to do it last week and I want to try againI had enough and ended up taking all of my pills. Ended up in the hospital and then psych facility for ten days. We came up with a recovery plan, everyone thinks Iâ€™m optimistic about the future. Fuck that. I feel horrible, I wish it worked, I wish this was all over.
