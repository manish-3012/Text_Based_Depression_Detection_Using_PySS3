I cant go on like this...I've been depressed for so long. I dont want to face another day. The only thing holding me back is the responsibility I have to my family, but even now that's starting to not matter as much to me anymore. Im 26 years old, and Ive struggled with mental health issues since I was in middle school, the loneliness, the isolation, the fear of abandonment. My biological mother died when I was 2 years old, I never knew my father . I was raised by my grandparents, last year my grandfather was given a terminal diagnosis of cancer in his throat, and I was his caretaker. It was hell. He declined to the point of being nothing but skin and bones, he was afraid, and crying and I still have nightmares about it even after his death. I cant get over it, his death was so traumatic to me (i feel selfish even saying that, imagine how traumatic it must have been for him) and I just cant let it go. I cant open up to people, I cant figure out how to make friends. I tried (being the fucking idiot that I am) opening up to one of my coworkers but shes been giving me the cold shoulder since I opened up (and told her all of my fucking business). I dont think I can trust anyone anymore, thats it. i have no one to call, Im not even angry about it anymore. I just want to leave, and i hope I never come back.
