I just wanna die tonightIt seems like no matter how hard I try I just donâ€™t go anywhere. My antidepressants donâ€™t work, I canâ€™t find a job, I do nothing but deal with the pain I caused people when I was hooked on meth. Iâ€™ve been clean for 6 months went through EMDR PTSD therapy for my drug use and my abuse filled childhood and I still just canâ€™t be okay. Iâ€™m good for nothing I donâ€™t do anything productive I just wallow in pain day after day. I donâ€™t have anyone to go to because everyone I had I screwed over during my meth use. I was a very bad person to all of them, all my family, my girlfriend. My new therapist doesnâ€™t even listen to me. All I get from her is â€œyeah thatâ€™s toughâ€ or â€œyeah must be hardâ€. I drank tonight and I slashed my wrists and even though I know itâ€™s wrong and not helping anything, itâ€™s the most calm Iâ€™ve been in a long time.
