Life sucks, then you dieAlcohol helps, mellows me out, and gives me something to look forward to each day.
Reason to work? to afford alcohol, reason to look forward to tomorrow, alcohol.
Can't drink if dead.
I feel your pain, go get drunk, repeat, stay sober for work.
Never know, things might change, if not, there is always tomorrow's alcohol to look forward to.
Works for me......
