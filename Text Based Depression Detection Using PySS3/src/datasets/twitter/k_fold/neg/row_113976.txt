Seriously, why not? I can't rely on God, he doesn't exist.
Other people don't care about me, one of the girls I dated and had real feelings for, even wishes I was dead, and she's probably right, she had to get a restraining order against me which means I'm a real shithead. Fuck me and my life.

I guess I am good at some stuff but the problem is I always take on very challenging tasks and experiment, just to see what happens. Like when I took a bunch of AP classes at high school and couldn't handle them so I failed. Or did heroin. I think I just have unrealistic unexpectations, and extreme confidence unsupported by reality but I don't know how to lower them. But then again, I'm generally fine with sleeping on the street or going hungry for days (I've done both), but I prefer not to. 

I'm just like really tired of myself being an asshole to everyone including myself and would like this all to end soon. And if I'm tired of myself, how much are other people tired of me?

For now I feel like the only two things that are left in my life are drugs and art. I can't trust other people because I feel like every word I say scares them and makes them miserable, and I'm probably right. I can't even talk about these problems with anyone because I'd be labeled a junkie and have even more problems.

I guess I'm at the point where I just don't care anymore, I just want to be high all the time and shut up my annoying mind. I'm not at the point where I have to waste ridiculous amounts of money on my habit, but I feel like it's going there and the perspective of being a full-blown junkie scares the living  hell out of me.

I really don't know what to do. Everything just moves so quickly, I feel like I have absolutely no control over anything.

Haha now I can understand why people inject heroin. You just feel so fucking down and worthless you don't even care if you od or not, or if the vein's gonna collapse, or if you go to prison. You just want all your problems gone instantly because they just FUCKING HURT SO MUCH.
