I am a narcissistic teenager but I want to kill myself because of othersFor the last 3 years, I've had suicidal thoughts every once in a while. I've been depressed since I guess hormones kicked in, the last year I've used various drugs to try and change how I think, and it works, but I can't get a job and I'm worried if I continue doing what I'm doing to get money I will get in serious trouble. I hope this isn't taken the wrong way as I'm grateful that I live in a first world country and I'm a fully functional human being besides my broken arm at the moment. 
I'm waiting for the moment I do something stupid trying to get money and end up dying. 
I constantly think very high of myself and I feel that others lack basic common sense and knowledge, I also constantly feel like no one is on my side and think someone's always trying to plan something against me. This includes my mom, my family, and few close friends. They make me want to kill myself and have been for a while

My mom has been doing small things and I don't know if it's in purpose but it just pushes me more slowly and makes it worse than anyone else 

My family are a very conservative Christian family, which I have nothing against at a point blank perspective as I am a Christian, but they are such ignorant, hypocritical people who are always on their high horse 
My "friends" I feel are using me for stuff they cannot afford and suspect one of them even stole from me, I'm in a place in life where it feels common to everyone and you just have to go with it, but I don't want to.

I just want to understand why and how I can stop thinking like this and how I can better myself,
