I wish I could die in my sleep, but also make "practice" attempts (passive vs active suicidal?)I'm usually passively suicidal and wish that: (1) I could sleep forever and never wake up, (2) I was never born, or (3) I could die peacefully in my sleep. Sometimes I feel like a burden on my family - like they deserve better than me - but I know rationally that taking the final step would crush them, so I won't do it. On paper I have a good life and lots of opportunities, and other people out there have much worse, so I have no right to commit suicide anyway. 

I've been fantasizing about a comforting, peaceful death for a while, and recently started learning about different methods. I used to take the pill bottles out and just stare at the pills before putting them away. Today on an impulse I tied a sheet around my neck and tied it to the doorknob, but untied it right away, before it even started to get tight. So basically "practicing" how I would do it, even though I genuinely do not plan to attempt or put my family through the consequences of an attempt.

(yeah, I'm so useless I can't even find the guts to make a proper attempt).

Is this still passive suicidiality? Has anyone else experienced passive ideation but still "rehearse" for an attempt you never plan on seeing through?  Am I the only one who finds this practice to be comforting, even if it serves no purpose? Would admitting this behavior to a therapist take me straight to the hospital? Maybe nobody will answer, but I thought what the hell, might as well make a throwaway to ask.
