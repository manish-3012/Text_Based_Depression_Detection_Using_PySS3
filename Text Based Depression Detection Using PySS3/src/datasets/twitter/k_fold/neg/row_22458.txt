This is a rant...It irritates me when people say, "You have so much to live for."

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah?  Like what?  Name one thing I have to live for and I'll stop considering it.  Let's be clear here.  We're taking "love ones" off the table, because everyone says suicide is selfish...so I'm selfish.  And actually, I don't see it that way.  I'm a fucking burden on everyone that I personally care about, so that doesn't fly.

&amp;#x200B;

So...name a single thing.  I'm unemployed.  I live with my mother (see burdensome above).  No kids.  No girlfriend.  No one wants me romantically.  I have a cat, but it's fuckin' cat.  I can give her to someone who will take better care of her.  I have no real talents.

&amp;#x200B;

Name one...god...damned...thing.  Just one.
