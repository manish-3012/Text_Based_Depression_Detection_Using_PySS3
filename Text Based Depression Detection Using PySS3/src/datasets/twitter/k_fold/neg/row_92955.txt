When you can't even commit your own suicide.My story is one of a promiscuous father, several wrongly prescribed pills, and a series of first world problems.  I am 14 years old, and first tried to commit suicide at age 13.  The roots of this pain could trace to the aforementioned occurrences, but I'd like to start from the beginning.  When I was 13 my best friend's father died.  Just like that.  One night he was there, the next he was not.  That was when I realized how short life truly is.  Around that same month, I received a text from my father that said something like "the wifey and the kids are gone tonight, let's have some fun".  After further investigation on my part, I learned that he was not only cheating on my mother with one woman, but several.  My perfect american dream of a childhood was crushed.  Of course, in my family, we delete our texts after we send them, so he never realized he sent that to the wrong person.  In those times I lied to my parents about everything, the fact that I knew, etc.  The pain when my father would tell my mother he loved her, it was so heavy.  Around that time I was prescribed insomnia pills, which made me more depressed, but that's a different story.  My mother became stressed and upset, she didn't know about my father, however I think she knew something was up.  I was the difficult child, and once during an argument she let slip that she loved my sister more.  That was the last straw.  That night I attempted to commit suicide using a random mix of pills from the medicine cabinet.  I think that the worst most awful thing was when I woke up.  And had to get my body pumped at the hospital.  Because no matter how much of a screw up I was, I never thought I would fail at committing my own suicide.  Well, that was added to the list of things I was unable to do.  I was put on 72 hour watch, got a therapist, who does not help me in the slightest, and now attempt to live as normally as possible.  But you can't hide the fact that my dad is in Vegas on "work" when his company has no partners on the west coast, or that my mom still locks the medicine cabinet at night.  And I still go to school each and everyday to the taunts of my peers, who think that they know me, but all they see is the quiet nerd in the back of class.  They don't see the glass scaffolding which holds up my walls.  I'm about to break and there's nothing I can do.  I have about two people who I can talk to, including the girl who lost her father, and she has her own problems, and a boy who is heart-broken over his lost love.  I'm nothing in this world.  And there's nothing I can do about it.
