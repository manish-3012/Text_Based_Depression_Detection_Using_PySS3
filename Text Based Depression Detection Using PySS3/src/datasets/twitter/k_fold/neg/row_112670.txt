I literally think I'm gonna kill myself because I have no friends.Not today, so no need to worry (would anyone really worry tho? I don't think they would) but I'm thinking in January or February, April at the latest! I'm planning to OD on an undecided substance so my family will think it was accidental and I don't make anyone too sad. But the main cause for my death will be because I have no friends. I can learn to live with everything else wrong in my life (only by using drugs tho.. I'm pathetic) but not the no friends part... I've tried making friends and yea never works! No one cares about me or If they do I find a way to fuck it up! Every. Single. Time. I'm always too boring or needy or annoying or something. Idk why I keep posting here.. I do it way too often... sorry about that. I guess it's this part of me that doesn't want to die so I keep hoping I will make a post and somehow be convinced to keep living but never happens unfortunately. I just take people's time away from helping other people because I'm selfish I guess I dunno. Sorry for posting again.
