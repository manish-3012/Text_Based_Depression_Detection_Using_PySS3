Mistress of the UnknownThe breed of misfortune, Mistress of the Unknown,
Treading through the halls of hell; the wretched plains of death - ashes never to be mourned.
Ashen-haired "menace" to once be named a "star,"
With Luminosity; fading over-fast - exposes all her scars. 

A fading star that once shone on and brightened many a lives,
Happy she is in the knowledge: that happiness she bade thrive.
A single prayer - but only the simplest of favors she begs in return!
When in times of peril and distress, have this crumpled little flower of hope to your mind returned.
