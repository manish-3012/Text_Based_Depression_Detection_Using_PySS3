An angry letter to myself.They're right about you. You don't matter. Your friends don't care about you, and they always leave you anyway. Do not get attached. You are not worth other people's time. You are a burden on those you are close to. They should beat you senseless and leave you in a ditch. Nobody wants somebody who can hardly function because of crippling anxiety. You aren't worth the time and effort you take up. You are a waste of space. You're sad all the time and nobody wants to be around you. You are complete and total garbage. 


Your gender does not exist, not in the eyes of anyone in your family, at least. You are a confused girl. Nobody cares that you're genderfluid. Get over it and live with what you have. Commit to something. Stop with the fluctuating dysphoria that nobody else seems to deal with. You will never have the power to change your body at will, no matter how badly you want it. You are either going to live with tits or top surgery and you will not be able to switch in between no matter how much you desire it. Get over it and commit to something. Be a man or be a woman. You disappoint your family with the freak you have grown into. You will never meet the standards you have for yourself. They are impossible on every level. 


Your brother is right. You are broken. You are a freak. You shouldn't be allowed to express your sexuality. You know you'll never be able to bring a girl home without scrutiny, nor find a man you are attracted to who isn't either gay or taken. If you can't fix it, off yourself. You should have done it a long time ago. Your family views you as a blemish. Your friends are nearly nonexistent. You have been alone nearly eighteen years and you will be alone for all the years to come. You should have died already and you are a coward for not offing yourself. You would save everyone a whole lot of trouble, embarrassment, and false pity.
