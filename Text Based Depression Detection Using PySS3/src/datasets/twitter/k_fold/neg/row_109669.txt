Piss poor decisions - story of my lifeHave you ever sat and thought about all the times you have messed up royally in your life until you are actually sick to your stomach?  I think back over times in my life and am amazed I am still alive, so grateful I haven't hurt anyone else, and in awe my husband has not left me!  

I have made so many piss poor decisions, I have dug a hole for myself I am not sure I can climb out of.  I always think I am doing the right thing, what has to be done, at the time but later, looking back, see how wrong I actually was...
