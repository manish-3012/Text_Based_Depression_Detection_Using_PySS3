I am eventually going to kill myselfI'm not saying it will necessarily be soon that I kill myself, but it's how I want to go. I'm a horrible person, I always lie, I only have one friend who I feel I can talk to about my problems and I just got really pissed at her a few hours ago because she was talking about how I'm covered in scars. Life just isn't for me, even if I won't be depressed or anxious or bipolar or borderline or ednos or self harming forever, it won't change the fact that life just isn't for me. I just have no ability to deal with having to work and be a good person and deal with life, I'm simply too weak. Some people just aren't cut out for living, and I'm one of them. It isn't a big deal, I just want to die at my own hands, I don't want to die unwillingly and I don't want to have to deal with life.
