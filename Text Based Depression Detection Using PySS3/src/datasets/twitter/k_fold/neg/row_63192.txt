There isn't really a reason for me to live.My life is shit. My adoptive parents are emotionally abusive. My biological mother hung herself last year. My father left me for his step daughters. I was sexually abused when I was little. I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and self harm for years. I know I'm going to kill myself one day, and it's going to be soon. I'm home alone right now, and there's a loaded gun in the other room. I need help.
