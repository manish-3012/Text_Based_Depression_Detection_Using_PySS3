In the hospitalFirst time hospitalized ever, including suicide attempts. Looks like theyre involuntarily hospitalizing me... fun.
Im super relieved though. When I was walking around, getting ready to find a place to do it, and it was totally cathartic, I felt good about my decision. Usually I'd get anxious, and coward out, but this was just so simple for me. But someone found me hours later apparently.
Iwas worried if I did wake up, my parents would be upset like when i was younger, looking for answers and crying. But really theyve just been chatting normally, staying with me before the doctors move me. I still don't feel any different, just empty, except for general anxiety. I had tried to mentally prepare myself for this, distraught parents, me crying, etc like my first attempt awhile ago. But its been casual so far. I actually prefer it.

But I just want to ask: what exactly does involuntary hospitalization include? I was in outpatient beforehand, and all we did was group sessions, color, sometimes talk to a psychiatrist, but that was a childrens outpatient when I was 14, and now I'm 20.
