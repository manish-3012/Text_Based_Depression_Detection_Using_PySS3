Life is pain. 21 (m)My life story is long, upsetting, and frankly a little unbelievable at points, so Iâ€™ll spare all those details, despite the fact that they give context to my suffering. 

The point is, is that recently Iâ€™ve moved states, because I wanted to leave a very stressful job I had elsewhere. 

I now live with my father, who is mostly insensitive and mechanical in regards to my existence. 

The extent of his relationship with me seems to be him asking why I donâ€™t make much money, and constantly telling me to get another job and suggesting random jobs for me to do. 

He also says I should just get up and go, even though I have no emotional motivation. 
 
Unfortunately, I now have a tedious and mundane job working at a call center, and it feels as if my mind has been put through an incredibly dull blender. 

The majority of my co workers are in their sixties or more, and what few people I can relate to donâ€™t care enough about me to remember I exist outside of the office, so I donâ€™t have a strong  friend group or support system. 

Whatâ€™s more is that I was recently diagnosed with genital HSV-2. 

Iâ€™ve had two sex partners my entire life, and I know I got it from my first one because we had unprotected sex once and the infection is localized to a point that is usually covered by a condom. 

She decided to ignore me a long time ago, so I canâ€™t tell her about it. 

Anyway, with a lack of money, a car, friends, and now the end of my hope for a sex life, I no longer want to live. Iâ€™ve felt that way for some time now, but the feeling is especially strong now. 

I have been diagnosed with clinical depression in the past. 

No offense, but I donâ€™t need to be told that things will get better and that I just need to hold on. 

Are there any suggestions as to what I can do? Iâ€™m not stoic enough to put myself through rigorous daily exercise. The pain of it outweighs any other feeling I get. I do take a lot of long walks.
