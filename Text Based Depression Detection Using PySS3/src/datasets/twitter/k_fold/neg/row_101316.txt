I have no friends, depersonalization disorder, a broken dysfunctional penis , and im an alcoholic.It really sucks. When things were shitty I could always at least fall back  to feeling good by masturbating but I have had pelvicfloor problems for years that have gotten worse over time that basically make masturbating/orgasms feel no good sensation at all. sorry if that is graphic / too much information but its a large reason why im suicidal. on top of that about 2 years ago i developed depersonalization and have had it ever since, which basically makes everything seem unreal, cant feel emotions, all entertainment (music, movies, video games etc) has no feeling or purpose.. also im incredibly lonely and lost my last friend over 2 years ago as well and now dont talk to anyone except my parents (who are amazing) I also cant seem to stop drinking any time I get money i have zero willpower and go on auto pilot to get booze to feel slightly better temporarily but then worse for a day or two after. my willpower to not drink is virtually non existant since i got the depersonalization disorder also..

I dont know how i ended up like this but it really sucks. I dont even know what i expected from posting this but I feel like i needed to get it off my chest.  i just turned 30 and i dont see a way out of this
