Anywhere to actually fucking talk?I live in a place where there's bullshit involuntary psychiatric commitment laws, which have absolutely 100% kept me from attempting to receive help over my many years of suicidal ideation, because it seems like every fucking chat room will contact your ISP and every hotline will call the police. 

Anyone know a good place to talk to someone without risking having your  BASIC FREEDOM stripped from you?

Chat rooms preferred.
