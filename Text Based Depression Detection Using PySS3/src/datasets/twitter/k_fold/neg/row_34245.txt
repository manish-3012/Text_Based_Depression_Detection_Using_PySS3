A big ass pity partyAm I the only one that is literally ruining relationships over sob sessions. Like full on fetal position on the floor in the bathroom headache crying. I had a manic afternoon yesterday. Iâ€™d like to say that is was triggered by nothing but Iâ€™m PRETTY sure it all stemmed from anxiety which was me over analyzing the fact that someone I really like has slowly decreased in interest for me. In all reality I canâ€™t tell if they genuinely have bc of my constant pity partyâ€™s and the nasty feeling of internal dread that Iâ€™m constantly complaining about or if thatâ€™s just what happens as time goes on, they are less interested in what i have to say, no more good morning or good night texts, basically just comes around to fuck but weâ€™re dating? Idk all in all I know people get sick of my shit. Maybe not the fact that I suffer from these episodes but I genuinely will not do anything to change it. My whole lifeâ€™s a fucking mess (I mean itâ€™s not the worst it could be, I have my own place and have a job that Iâ€™m slowly fucking up also) but the subtle changes that I panic over usually tend to be them drifting away. I can feel it. I know when people lose interest in me.  And Iâ€™m coming to terms that itâ€™s completely my fault. I went to the river to kill myself yesterday. In all reality the whole walk there I kept thinking about all the reasons I shouldnâ€™t and subconsciously knew that I totally wouldnâ€™t jump off a bridge but for some (attention seeking) reason I still walked there at 10:30 at night and sat there for like 45 minutes and fed off of my anxious thoughts and sadness. In all reality It totally makes no sense. I have a constant longing to be loved all hours of the day and that is not fucking possible. I want someone to see me how I see them. I GLORIFY people. I always have. But it seems like making someone feel to good about themselves makes them feel less good about you. Or maybe theyâ€™re just sick of the pitiful dark conversations I start. Idk all in all I hate my head and I gotta get medication but I wonâ€™t because all I do is push it off and screw myself more and more everyday(((: this probably made no sense Iâ€™m sorry but please give me any type of suggestions
