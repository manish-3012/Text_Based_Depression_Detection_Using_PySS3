I'm committed to life but sometimes i wish i was deadHi im 17 and a junior in high school. For the past 4 months ive been trying to kill myself because I hate my life and I feel pretty worthless. I've taken aeound 34 pain killers at one point and woke up in a emergency room. I've contacted the suicide hotline multiple times and it helps but something in me doesn't feel quite right. If you have advice could you help me get through this.
