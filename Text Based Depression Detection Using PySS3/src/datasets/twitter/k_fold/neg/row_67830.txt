Everything is getting worse againMy anxiety, my dysphoria, my loneliness. Everything is getting worse I don't want to be transgender I want to be normal how come I could just ignore it for so long and then bam it all blows up in my face, the dysphoria is making the anxiety worse, I just want everything inside my head to stop I want to let my soul out through my wrists.
