It has been 14 long years and now I'm ready.I was trying to stay as positive as possible. Things have gotten worser and worser. I'm such a faggot. I have no skills, I'm not good at school, no friends and family... who isn't really a family.

The thing is - I don't wanna wait in vain for other people's love (thanks Bob Marley). I'm so ready. I'm just posting this out of curiosity honestly; I just want to see if somebody will recognize who I am when I'll be no longer here, so here is something about me:

I'm M. Born in January of 2005. The one you hated for no reason.

I'm so ready. Bye. I'll tell y'all if aliens exist, someday.
