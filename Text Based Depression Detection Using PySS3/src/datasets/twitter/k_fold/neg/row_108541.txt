I donâ€™t want to die but Iâ€™m so tiredI feel so tired all the time and everything is so hard. Life is terrible you have a million responsibilities and everyone expects you to be perfect. On top of all this nonsense that is life I get made fun of for how skinny I am. My family, every single kid at school and even random strangers tell me every single day how skinny I am. It bothers me so much and my mom keeps telling me that I seem sad all the time and asks me why, like I get made fun everyday and Iâ€™m stressed over school 24/7 why do you think im sad? I donâ€™t want to die, even though I donâ€™t think they would be that sad if I did, but I donâ€™t know what to do.
