Betrayal makes me want to dieI'm an idiot. A huge one. No need to tell me that ever again.

I'm just gonna get to the point, I'm sorry if it reads weird or if it doesn't belong. My bf of 2 years posted my nudes online. With my face and name. Thought I wouldn't find out. I did. Que huge fight. Make him file take down requests for every single one. Delete everything. No more nudes. Until, we talked about it and we came to a compromise. No face, no name. Until he did it again. Delete it all. Want to break his phone and computer and literally his face. Can't because it would be illegal. Can't move out because literally living paycheck to paycheck. Family over an hour away. No car. I want out of this situation, NOW. I don't really want to die but my heart is aching and I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel.
