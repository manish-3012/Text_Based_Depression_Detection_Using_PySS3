Hiking solo tomorrow and going missing for good.I'm done. Fuck this god damn life that continues to pay my efforts with even more pain. I've reached the point where I see no way out other than ending it. 

It's taken a while to sink in that I've actually gotten to this point- it feels so surreal, yet so familiar. Like I've lived this life before and the ending was always tragic. 

Throughout my life I've had a reoccurring dream of being abandoned, living in extreme emotional pain, and finding no way out. Like being lost in a maze of sorts. The dreams have always ended with me waking up before things changed for the better. 

This is no dream, and this time I'm not waking up. 

I have no reasons to go on. My ex wife destroyed me on her way out of the marriage. I have no job, no friends, and a family that shuns me from their cult. It's game over.. at least I can say that I gave it all I had.
