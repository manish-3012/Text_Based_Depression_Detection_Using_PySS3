I understand now why so many people don't leave a note.I've been racking my brain trying to write something that made sense for a long time. And to leave a letter to each person I care about. And I've realized it's almost impossible to put your reasons why into written word. There's no way to describe these feelings to other people because no l matter what they won't understand. There's no way to translate the guilt, pain, anguish and sorrow into written text. How in how are you supposed to adequately explain and apologize for what you've done with a fucking letter?
