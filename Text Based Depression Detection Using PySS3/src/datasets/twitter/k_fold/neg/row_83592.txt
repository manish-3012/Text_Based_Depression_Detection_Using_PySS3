insomnia, loneliness, the usual. would love some skyping company.I'm a postgrad in the city, trying to find friends and a job, but mostly just having sex with guys i don't care about/care about too much and blowing my money on business clothes for the internship i suck at and overpriced drinks at bars i don't have fun at. i know these are normal problems for a 20-something year old artist, and I'm currently on medication and seeing a therapist monthly, so i've made progress since my last post. 

But the thoughts of suicide are back and I think about stepping into the tracks all the time. I feel like I can't focus on what people say to me, and every time I have a conversation with someone, even a stranger, i can feel myself slipping out of my perky exterior into a convoluted monologue of nebulous pain and self-pity. I dread walking through the L train passageway from the 123 trains because the fluorescent light is all consuming and i feel it physically overwhelming me. I have never attempted suicide because I know it would hurt my family and my friends. I wish I could kill my consciousness so that I would still be alive for them but I wouldn't have to experience that life. 

I don't know why mundane concerns become cosmological quandaries, and I wish I posted something on reddit besides goddamn come-save-me-with-skype posts, but please call me. I think I'm imaprincessgrr on skype.
