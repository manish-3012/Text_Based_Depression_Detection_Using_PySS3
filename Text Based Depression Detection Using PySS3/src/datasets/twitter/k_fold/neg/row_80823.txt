Things are fine...That's all I seem to say these days. I have an AMAZING new job, a person who loves me, and honestly, I am fine. 

But am I? Suicide is always on my mind. Whether I'm thinking about the logistics of it, if I could even do it, or thinking about the dreaded *why* I want to do it, it's always lingering in the corner of my brain. 

I feel like such an asshole. I don't have room to complain. I have what I asked for. I'm still not happy. 

People like me aren't meant to be, is what my theory is. Never should have been born to begin with. I wish my life could go to someone who would enjoy it, and appreciate every moment of it. 

Instead I'm just wasting away, wishing I could be gone for no reason significant enough. I'm sorry for that. I'm just, sorry.
