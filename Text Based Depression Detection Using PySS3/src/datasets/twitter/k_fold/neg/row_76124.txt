I cut myself again today...My shoulders and upper arms are a mass of red. I'm just so tired. All the time. Fuck. I don't even know what I'm doing posting this right now. It's 2 AM and I haven't even started studying for the chem test tomorrow, which I need to ace to get the grades to convince my dad that it's worth it to send me to college...away from him. Away from everything. And I have to think of props to take for the yearbook committee. Which I know I will forget. And I have to slog through another day of school, and pretend everything is fine, which it is, except I'm not. I just feel like I'm falling apart sometimes. And then I feel guilty for being such a shitty human being. I don't...I can't lose myself in books the way I used to. I can't write, unless it's about death and love and loss. There's so much I have to do, and I can't...but of course I can. Because I'm a genius. I'm the responsible one. I can handle it. I can do anything. Except I don't want to. I just want to sleep. And not wake up again. 

Again, I don't know why I'm posting. I've written way more than  I should have, but there's so much more...but I have to hit the books. Chemistry. And I'm so sick of crying. I'm such a weak human being. I don't why I have to cry at every little thing now. It just takes one offhand remark to set me off, while I'm alone. And then my parents see me and they call it a tantrum. Which maybe it is, I don't know. I just know how I tired I am.

Sorry for the rambling and incoherency...
