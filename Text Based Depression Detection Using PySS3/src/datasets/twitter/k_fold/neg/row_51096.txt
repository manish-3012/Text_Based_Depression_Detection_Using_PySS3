Feel like I missed outSo, I'm about to turn 23 next month and going to graduate college with a Psychology BS this May.

I now currently feel like I've missed out on everything.  In HS I was very focused on a goal of mine, only to have it basically robbed by someone in authority at the school (I won't go into details, but the goal meant EVERYTHING to me).  I sacrificed my social life and everything for it.

I failed at that, ending up at one college and transferring midway to another.  In college, I have made very few friends and only met one girl and had a relationship with her (we were fwb's).  She is the only girl I had a relationship with in my life.  She and me are now friends (and basically she is the only real friend I have, and she hasn't been the best of friends lately for me).

Now, I am finally taking charge and trying to get my social life together.  I'm actively trying to talk to people.  But it is now my last semester.

I feel like I missed so much.  I never had flings in my undergrad days.  Never met lots of girls that I could have.  Never got to experience those things at that age.  

Maybe this sounds stupid to people, but its extremely depressing.  I almost do want to kill myself at times over it.  

I missed out on so much, and there isn't a rewind button that I have been able to discover yet.  So now I graduate in May and seeing that I basically missed out on all the fun.  And even if I went back to college during grad school in a few years, I don't know if I would get a chance to be with 18-20 year old undergrads.

This truly isn't a joke post.  I'm sure many will think it is though.  I see no point or hope really anymore.
