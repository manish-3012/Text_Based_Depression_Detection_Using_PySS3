My social anxiety and depression never goes away. Fuck my life.Why do I have this? I'm so sick of it. It never goes away. It just stays in my head 24/7. I try to ignore it but it always stays there. I've had it since I was 13 and now I'm 15. It's not just something every teen has, this is literally making me want to kill myself.

Everyday I always get jealous and depressed seeing someone my age having fun with their friends because I can't do that. My social anxiety and depression doesn't let me do that. I don't think I have low self esteem, it's more of me being anxious in social situations. I'm too anxious to ask someone if they want to hangout or go somewhere, I just can't. It's so hard to explain, it just stays there in the back of my head and never goes away. 

I'm going to be completely honest with myself. This summer I haven't done anything really. I've been wasting it by staying in my room, isolated. I don't have any hobbies, I don't have any "real" friends (none of them text me anyways or ask if they want to hang). We don't really have anything in common, I've been hanging out with them for years but we've been slowing losing our friendship because of my disorder. It really takes away everything.

In grade 7, my anxiety and depression was so bad that I missed tons of school (almost half the school year). The anxiety and getting out of bed from depression was that bad. The guidance counsellor had to get involed to ask me what's wrong but I said that "everything is fine". (It wasn't). My mom was even wondering what was wrong with me and she asked me if I had depression (she asked me before as well) and I just said no. I don't know why, but I just didn't say anything. During grade 7, I started developing near like anorexia. Everyone noticed that I was really skinny and I wasn't healthy. My anxiety started to effect me physically that bad. 

This year there is this amusement park that comes here every year and everyone goes there for fun and entertainment and I want to go. For the past 3 years I didn't go. My family goes there every year and they ask every time if I want to go but I just say no. I beat myself up everytime and just stay home while everyone is having fun. A friend of mine asked if I was going to it but I just said no. 

You know how things will get better? They haven't. It just gets worser each year. I can't fucking ask for help because I'm anxious and I'm worrying what my parents will think. I don't want to disappoint them that I have this and my siblings. 

Why does this happen to me? I'm just a 15 year old guy, I don't deserve it. Only thing to help with my disorder is alcohol

EDIT: It's 4AM currently and I had the confidence to finally say something. I texted my mom if I can set an appointment with my doctor. Hope everything goes well. I'm going to completely regret doing that (my anxiety is going to disagree with me). Hope everything goes well. Thank you so much everyone for the help and advice. I read all of your comments and I really apreciate it. Wish me luck guys.
