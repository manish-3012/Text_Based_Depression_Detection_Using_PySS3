I'll come put to my parents as trans now, if it goes bad I'll end it. I have no enegery left to fight for acceptance.Title basically says it all. I've known I am trans (ftm) for a few years now and since then I tried just being a lesbian but it doesn't work. It just doesn't work.
I came out while on pain meds once and my parents cried and yelled at me calling me a discrace. Then my Mum found my bindern and yelled at me for hurting her feelings and called me sick. She said online forums brain washed me into thinking I'm trans and took away my phone to cure me. Didn't work.
Nobody knows I'm suicidal. I got very very good at pretending to be happy and a girl. I have no emotions, but I know how to fake them very well. The only good thing about depression is that I also cam't feel gender dysphoria anymore. I just feel nothing. 

So today is my last try. My last effort. If my parwnts show even the slightest hint of wanting ro accept me I'll stay. I'll fight. It only has to be a little bityjust a shred. But if it's crying and screaming again that's it. I'm done. 

Maybe I'll post again tomorrow. Maybe this is goodbye. Reddit was my only escape. Thank you, for everything.
