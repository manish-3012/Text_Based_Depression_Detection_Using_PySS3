Iâ€™m dreading living another yearItâ€™s December and Iâ€™m still alive. While Iâ€™m grateful I was able to get through another year, I find find myself wondering if I want to do this all again. This year was bad to say the least. Was it the worst year Iâ€™ve ever experienced? Probably not. This year was a very bad year for my eating, but I feel like if I hadnâ€™t done that to my body I wouldâ€™ve been an even worse state of mind now. I donâ€™t understand why it had to come to doing that to myself to make my parents understand that itâ€™s not a joke. But did I ever get help? No. And even if I did, what difference would it make? I hate my life and simply talking isnâ€™t going to fix anything. I constantly go through double depressive episodes, and I know for a fact my dysthymia isnâ€™t curable. I see a psychiatrist 3 times a year, but he doesnâ€™t help. I lie to him because I hate him so much. Iâ€™ve been going to him since I was 10 and Iâ€™ve never told him anything because heâ€™s an old bastard that has no idea what heâ€™s talking about. Thatâ€™s not even an exaggeration; he told me I should have a phone and he put my sister on Lithium. A drug she REALLY didnâ€™t need. Iâ€™m not going into that though. As for my life, Iâ€™m not going to get through this. No matter what happens, this life will not end in my favor. My preferred suicide method would be jumping, but I donâ€™t know where I could possibly do that that would be high enough and private. Every other suicide method doesnâ€™t seem nice. I hate my family for doing this to me. Iâ€™ve always had a problem but I guess they thought itâ€™d go away with age. Well no, it didnâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to get better at this point I just want to die. I genuinely have nothing to look forward to, and while I could be successful, I donâ€™t see myself being happy. I donâ€™t want to experience life because it all seems so pointless. I hate my family so much I want them gone. My mental health is terrible but I canâ€™t do anything to help myself because Iâ€™m too young. I hated my childhood and Iâ€™m going to hate adulthood. I donâ€™t even want to try it. I havenâ€™t seen my family in a week now, and I donâ€™t plan on seeing them until Christmas but god I donâ€™t want to see them. I want them out of my life because theyâ€™ve done nothing but make my life a living hell. Maybe if they wouldâ€™ve helped when I was younger it wouldâ€™ve been fine, but not anymore. Iâ€™m tired of living like this. I donâ€™t want to go home. I wish I was 18 already so I could go away and test out life. Donâ€™t think Iâ€™d like it, but honestly I want to test the waters for a few days until I die but thatâ€™s too far into the future and the bad outweighs the good so fuck life and fuck recovery. I really do believe other people can get better, but I know Iâ€™m the exception. Itâ€™s all downhill from here. My writing is probably really bad but I donâ€™t care. I just want to stop feeling like this
