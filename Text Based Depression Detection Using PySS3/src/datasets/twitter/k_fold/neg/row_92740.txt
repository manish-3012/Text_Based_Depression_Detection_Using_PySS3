Killing myself tomorrow.Part of me doesnâ€™t want to do it, I guess I just feel like Iâ€™ll be letting my only friend down. But at the same time, I feel like Iâ€™m letting her down even more by staying alive and burdening her with my problems and things have only ever gotten worse for me so I might as well just do it now.
