If I ever get the urge to leave, I tell myself that I will write a letter to everyone I know explaining why it isn't their fault. It's really effective for me. I don't get the thoughts as often as I used too, but when I did I would tell myself that I would compose a letter to everyone I knew explaining why it wasn't their fault I left. 

Just the idea of it, would set me back on a not darker path because I couldn't take the idea of hurting them. I just thought I would share this.
