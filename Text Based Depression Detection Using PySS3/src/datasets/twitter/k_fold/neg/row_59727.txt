Killing myself to escape humanity?I often think I want to kill myself so that I'll never have to deal with another person ever again. The only times I am truly deeply happy are when I am alone in nature.
It's always been this way. I feel alive taking walks under starry skies, going barefoot through the moors and being surrounded by animals only. My mind and my body, just everything that I am, registers other people as a threat. True contentment and happiness can only be found in solitude.
I feel broken when I deal with people. I feel a constant sharp pain that makes me think sth is wrong with me. But here is the thing, all of this instantly ebbs away when I am alone in nature. Maybe I just don't belong in society? I'd be okay with that. I never asked to become human. I'd rather be a free animal tbh. So what can I do now? I just never want to see another person ever again. People are fundamentally untrustworthy and cause so much pain. I'd be myself and I'd feel whole living alone in the woods. It's either that or killing myself. Both are valid options to escape humanity. Suicide would also mean that I won't be a person anymore, which is my biggest wish.
I know I'm supposed to enjoy being alive. I know I'm young blabla. I miss the stars and solitude and I want to go into nature and just let myself die whenever I want to.
