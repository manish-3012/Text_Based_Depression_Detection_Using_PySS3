wowJust got out of high school and I don't know what I'm going with my life. 

My family has pushed me out because of college arguments and family problems. My mom and me got into a big fight my freshman year and nothing has been the same since. My uncle, who is a grade above me and who I grew up with, is praised for where he is going for college and what he does. Growing up asian and with a smart uncle made expectations high for me. When it comes to be it's like they don't care about me at all. A lot of my family went to my uncles graduation and celebrated. Only 2 of the family went to mine and that hurt. A lot actually.After high school I thought I had 2 close friends. I helped them through everything during high school breakups, family deaths, just about anything. But when I needed help they didn't do anything. All they would say is "oh that sucks." Recently my grandfather died and it hit me pretty hard. I told the both of them but they sorta just ignored me after I told them. I feel like a nuisance to them when ever I hang out with them so I haven't been talking to them much. I miss them I love them but if they don't want talk to me I don't want to force myself on them.

When I'm with people I'm social I like to talk and be active. But when I'm alone, I'm depressed. I used to take pills for it but I stopped taking them freshman year. I smoke a lot I drink a lot. I just don't care about living anymore. I don't want to live in pain anymore. I thought things would change after I graduated and they got worse.

I've just feel like a nuisance to everyone. My family will probably be better off without me. My sister can grow up without a brother but she's young she'll just think I went to college. My friends will probably be sad but they'll get over it. Deaths are sad but people get over them with time. I know things will change if I die. For better or for worse I still want to kill myself.
