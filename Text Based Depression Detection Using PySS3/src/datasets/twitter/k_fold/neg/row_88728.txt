I don't know what to doI feel like my life is worthless and I have no options. 

I just turned 40 this year. For the past several years I have been unemployed, living with an elderly relative (who has dementia) as their caretaker. They're close to the end, and I don't know what to do. In the back of my mind, I've been picturing jumping off a bridge after she passes.

I've given all of my 30s towards caring for her. I feel like I've let my chance to have a family of my own just slip out of my fingers. I've let myself go, physically, to the point where I can't bear to look at myself in the mirror. 

I feel like I have no options. I haven't worked for years. I've withdrawn from all my former friends and contacts. I have a mountain of student loan debt (hello, useless master's!) and no prospect for paying it off anytime soon.

I am terrified of being homeless. I have no health insurance.

I am deeply depressed, and no one in my life knows how to respond. I get a lot of "Things could be worse! You could live in some war torn land or something!" 

I dream about the bridge, sometimes.
