I wonâ€™t make it to 22I wonâ€™t make it to 22.

I donâ€™t have a proper job. Only part time at a supermarket. Itâ€™s depressing. My friends my age are travelling or are in relationships and Iâ€™m just so behind on all of this. I feel like Iâ€™m just becoming a routine slave to this place that its my only income. $230 a fortnight and with that it goes quickly. How can I travel how can I explore, lifeâ€™s so short Iâ€™m wasting it working for someone to get a mere cent to get a whiff of life. Itâ€™s ridiculous. Iâ€™m feeling as if a lot of people are ahead of my age. I live with my parents and they understand I want to achieve many things. I really do. I just feel like shit. Day after day. Iâ€™m also virgin and have never kissed a girl in my entire life. Iâ€™m also gaining weight because food seems to be my only â€œgood feeling habitâ€. The other day it was dark and I was just in bed looking at the window, contemplating how shit my life is. People travelling doing amazing things. Even if I did itâ€™d take me years to even get to one place until another 4 years. I fucking hate this routine shit life whoever fucking planned all this shit out for me is an evil fucking bastard
But letâ€™s get real. Iâ€™ve been bullied relentlessly through high school. I donâ€™t see the fucking joy in living then and itâ€™s only got worse. I thought college would be better, it wasnâ€™t. Just a bunch of heys and Byes but never really a solid friendship. Even my 22nd birthday is coming soon and all my friends are busy or just donâ€™t have time but rather go to other more important events. Iâ€™m just so confused as to why life is treating me this way. Everything I do is just so fucking half hearted thereâ€™s really no point in living. I believe suicide will end all connections to people the world the universe. Once Iâ€™m dead hanging Iâ€™m glad I chose the option because I just got the whole package of a fucking loser. Goodbye.
