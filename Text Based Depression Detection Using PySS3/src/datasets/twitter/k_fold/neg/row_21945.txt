Can't tell if he's upset that I didn't do it or that I told him I was considering itReally messed up last night, I felt really alone, unloved, useless and frankly suicidal. I was messaging a friend and he was getting annoyed with my depressing talk, saying the usual, you don't mean that, it's a phase etc. So I turned off my phone to allow myself time to think and try to calm down. It turns out that was the wrong thing to do, my friend managed to get a hold of my brother on FB and get him to phone my Mum's house to check on me. I'm annoyed that my family got involved as they don't understand my depression and handle it very badly, which usually ends up making me worse. But now my friend isn't talking to me because "he was genuinely worried" and "how could I do that to him". So now I feel even more alone and I hate myself even more. 
Sorry if this isn't the right place...

I know I'm too cowardly to end things
