Nobody would care if i was goneI don't have any family, i don't have any friends, i don't have anybody. If i died right now nobody would notice. Life is miserable and i want it to end. I'm going to kill myself someday soon, i can feel it already. I wish someone cared about me but nobody does. I will forever be a total nobody. I wasn't meant to be born and my life is a giant mistake. Nobody will reach out to help, nobody will care, i'm just a bunch of pixels on a screen. A few people will say generic copy-pasted advice like "go outside, join a club" then pat themselves on the back that they "Helped someone out today". I wish i wasn't here.
