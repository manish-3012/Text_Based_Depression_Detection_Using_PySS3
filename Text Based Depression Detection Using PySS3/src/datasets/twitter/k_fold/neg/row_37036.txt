A date is set.I've finally committed to it. I've been telling people I wanted to graduate, so I will. On the night of May 6, I plan on overdosing on ibuprofen to which I am allergic. This will cause anahylaxis. Maybe I can go through with it? Maybe I'll just wake up in the hospital? Hopefully with amnesia if that's the case...
