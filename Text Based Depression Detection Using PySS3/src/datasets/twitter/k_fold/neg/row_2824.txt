considering againit's been so long since ive genuinely wanted to kill myself and suddenly it all comes crawling back again. I just want to die. im always going to be a bad person. nobody understands that it's hard to change. is there any point in changing when everyone already expects me to be evil??
and the worst part is i caused this. i was the one that steals from everyone and made my whole family hate me, its all my fault. I feel like there's nothing I can do to change and that I might as well end it. It's so hard to deal with I don't even know what to do anymore
