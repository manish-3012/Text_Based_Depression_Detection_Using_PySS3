He wanted to push me off the edge, I want him to find my bodyThis is for sure the most destructive I ever felt in my life. I have a chronic disease, lost my career and everything I had built. I had invalidity insurance but they cut me off (cause that's what they do) and I don't have the strength to fight for it anymore, so I'm living on credit until I loose my hard earned house.

I'm an ugly women so I've never really been loved, but I met a man last year and it turns out he was a fraud. He lead me on for a year with beautiful lies and brutally discarded me right after we slept together for the first time.  I think it was really just out of pure sadism or power trip, but I'll never know why he did that to me as I was already so damaged by life.

Some people's cruelty has no limit.

I've been seeing a therapist but I just can't get back on my feet.  I think he actually wanted to push me off the edge for me to kill myself.

He's the last push I needed to feel enough of this intense unbearable sharp pain in my chest and heart to find the strength to go park right in front of his place and get the carbon monoxide going. I'll be free from my misery and maybe I'll save someone else if that's enough to make him realize people's emotions aren't a game.  I suspect he might be a psychopath, so he might actually enjoy it.. but either way I won't be there to care anymore and I rather have him find me than a relative or an innocent stranger.
