Mom makes me want to kill myselfI'm done. I'm not even allowed to have my own feelings. It's like walking on thin ice. I'm tired of having to say things a certain way incase she lashes out and says something hurtful or threathens to kill me.
She says I'm getting worse as a human being. That I'm falling apart by the second and I'm not the nice girl I used to be.
When we're getting along, she's suddenly the most understanding person
When we're not, suddenly I'm a bitch,lazy,coward and sometimes she'll act scary and threathen to hurt me like she did when I was a child.
My little autistic brother has ptsd from all the yellinh.
She thinks I'm shallow and I have no right to point out her bullshit because 'I'm no saint either'.
I KNOW I'M FUCKING DISGUSTING. I KNOW I'M USELESS. I KNOW
