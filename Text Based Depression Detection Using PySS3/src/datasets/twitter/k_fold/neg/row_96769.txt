Should i self admit at the cost of losing my army careerThroaway account for obvious reasons.bI am at my lowest. I considered self admission to the nearest insitution, but i do not want to lose my army job forever. It is my dream job. 

I am most likely situationally depressed. I am currently going through sgt sch. Trainings only getting tougher, and the weekends I need to unwind is always ruined by my narcissisitic, abusive and toxic mum who cant go a fucking day without saying that she misses me through text. I never had a good childhood. I chose to forgive my mom for her terrible actions back then but i feel that she never learnt and it is opening old scars that i thought i resolved.  I feel that this has definutely leaned me closer to clinical depression. 

 Worse, i have no one to talk to because they cant understand how i feel. Parents, civilian friends. The army counsellor suggested talking to my platoon mates but this is work after all. I dont want colleagues to know something so personal.  Wish i have a girlfriend.

I feel isolated. I know i need help. But i dont want to lose the career i worked so hard to land! I will have no money! No savings! My dad will literally disown me and my mom will rely on me forever! Help! I cant stay silent for so long! I just want the pain of loneliness to end.
