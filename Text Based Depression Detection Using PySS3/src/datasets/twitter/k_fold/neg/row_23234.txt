Why do people look down on those that want to commit suicide? If someone isn't happy or not having fun and they just want to "check out of the party", why shouldn't they be aloud to?Me, I'm done!  I've done my time here and am completely ready to check out.  Sometime in the last week or so I started framing it like leaving a job you hate and well pretty much gave my notice!  

I plan on wrapping up as many of my "loose ends" as I can this year and start liquidating my assets with a goal of being able transition out sometime around November / December.  Since saying it out loud I've felt nothing but relief and happiness, like a big weight has been lifted from me.  For the first time in a long time I have something to look forward to!  

The only thing that sucks is that I wish others could be happy for me!  I mean, I want this and I'm working hard for it so it goes off just right without burdening anyone.  I'd also like to do it cleanly.  I'm in Canada and while we do have doctor assisted suicide laws you need to have a terminal illness for a doctor to help you out.  I don't have anything terminal, I'm just done!!  Any suggestions would be great!!

Thanks!!
