I don't see the point.I feel lonely all the fucking time, and it always peaks in the weekends like now. No ever seems to care or stick around in my life and without people to share it with, I can't really see how my life is worth living.

It feels like people have left me my whole life, with the occurrences becoming more and more frequent in the past few years, and I just don't see the point in sticking through it all.
