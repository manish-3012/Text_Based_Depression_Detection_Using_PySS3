I give up.I'm 19F living in the Midwest and I'm thinking of just giving up.
 I'm either going to be homeless in a month or I'll have to move back to my extremely toxic household since my lease is up. I've found three different potential roommates but each one of those fell through. I barely have any friends left anymore and I feel alone. I start college in the fall and I'm
incredibly scared that the stress of everything will get to me and I'll drop out. I don't have any insurance so I can't afford to fix my teeth or go to the hospital when I'm sick. I'm just so tired of trying and trying and I just want to give it all up.
