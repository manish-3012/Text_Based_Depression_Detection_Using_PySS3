Alone.Itâ€™s so weird that everyone feels alone and Unwanted and shit, because like hell. Iâ€™ve read shit on here time and time again that shows me that we think similarly: could we not contribute this to a disease and not ourselves? When however many people that follow this feel the same? I donâ€™t think it is us as a person, I think we are sick and need help. (Just drunk ramblings sorry)
