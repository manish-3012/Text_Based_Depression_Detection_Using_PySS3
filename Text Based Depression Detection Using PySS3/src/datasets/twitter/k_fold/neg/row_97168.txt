Need help/advice/someone to talk too.  Hey, so over a month has past since I last made a post here when I was feeling extremely suicidal.  Not much has changed since then, just things have gotten worse.  Within that month I have attempted twice, both by mixing benzos, sleeping pills, and alcohol.  Both with the same result.  My cutting has been off and on.  With me cutting on Tuesday after not cutting for like a week maybe less than that.  I have been seeing my therapist still but not much has helped.  She just doesn't seem to be helping, and keeps telling me that I am not trying hard enough, and to keep doing CBT despite it not helping with my main symptoms.  I stopped my medication probably like the middle of August maybe.  And I have been on well over a dozen medications.  Here is a list of medications:

* Citalopram
* Clonazepam
* Diazepam
* Duloxetine
* Escitalopram
* Fluoxetine
* Fluvoxamine
* Haloperidol
* Lorazepam
* Olanzapine
* Quetiapine
* Risperidone
* Sertraline
* Trazadone
* Venlafaxine
* Ziprasidone
* Zoplicone
* Zygess

So, what are my issues/symptoms.  From previous posts that I have made here, you might remember probably not though.  I am a 20 year old male, that is diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder (Linked to my OCD), and Borderline Personality Disorder.  I also believe I have an undiagnosed psychosis issue, as I routinely and constantly have intrusive paranoid thoughts, delusional thoughts about people reading my minds, and that the government is controlling my thoughts and OCD.  Along with those thoughts, I sometime believe that objects are talking to me, and that I hear things.  I feel that I am slowly slipping back into a psychotic state, because I am having an increasing difficulty telling my thoughts apart.  The reason this is so unnerving to me, is that the psychotic thoughts generally involve me hurting myself.  For my OCD, the only thing that is a major concern as I generally don't care about my other OCD symptoms, at least not to the extent of my main obsession.  The obsession that really drives my crazy, causes emotions of guilt, and anger at myself is having extremely violent mental images of hurting myself or others.  These thoughts in turn cause me to be extremely depressed and are a major reason why I am feeling extremely suicidal.  

I know that I should be in a hospital for my own safety.  But, in the past I have been hospitalized 4 times.  Two of those times were against my will, brought in by the police if that matters.  However, all 4 times I have general come out worse then when I go in.  I just end up lying so I can get out of there as quick as I can for a variety of reasons.  The major reasons because as stated it just doesn't seem to help me, I tend to have more anxiety/paranoid/psychotic thoughts.  My average length of stay is usually 1 month, during which the first 2-3 days I am essentially catatonic and black out.  Followed by the next days/weeks seeing psychiatrists and therapists everyday.  Nothing really helps, it is mainly just re-telling everything over again, them giving me medications.  Then due to me just not getting better, and finding things getting worse I end up lying saying that I am feeling fine, and usually within 3-5 days I am out of there.  So, me going to a hospital just is not going to happen.  And as cliche as it sounds, if I were to be picked up by the cops it just wont end well.  

This leads me to question why am I here?  The obvious answer is I want help, because I don't want to die.  I just want to have these thoughts stop, and I need answers other than hit gym, give it more time, or pseudo-science bullshit.  But, even knowing that I have OCD I know that things wont stop, that they will always fucking be there.  So, I guess what I want is not possible.  Maybe I need a better way to cope with these thoughts, or for something to fucking work.  But as I have mentioned CBT hasn't been helping with these thoughts.  So the idea of trying to distract myself and re-focus is not helping with the main symptom.  Nor, do I even know what to do with the psychotic thoughts, since all the psychs/therapists I have seen tend to think that I am just paranoid and shit because I smoke cannabis.  Which, honestly to me is not true, because no matter how many times I tell them that when I smoke, all my symptoms are pretty much taken care off.  Or that when I stop smoking/drinking for 3 months, and they are still happening, they dismiss it and say well if they are still there within a year or so then we might have too take a look at that.  I am basically at the end of my will to live and to keep trying to get better, but eventually things get too overwhelming.  I know that suicide is a solution to a temporary problem, but when your problems are pretty much there for life, and when I don't ever have a true relief from them it becomes more appealing despite me knowing that I shouldn't do it.

I think that covers it really.
