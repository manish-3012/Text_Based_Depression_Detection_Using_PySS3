extremely suicidali hate lookin back at my life and realizing i became a mistake. the worst part is that i didn't have to let this happen i just made a lot of weird mistakes that festered and i eventually became the monster that is me. i constantly have panic attacks replaying all the simple stupid mistakes that added up in my head. i lost all my friends, lost out on girls that liked me, lost my parents trust and went nowhere career wise. i feel like an absolute mental case and i wish more than anythin i could go back and do it all diffrent. that is the only thing i want in life and i cant have it. so it feels like suicide is the only way out i feel trapped.....
