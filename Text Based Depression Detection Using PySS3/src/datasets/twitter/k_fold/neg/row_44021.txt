Where to start?!Hi,

I don't know how to start this thread, I'll try to be as honest as possible, maybe there are others like me :) :| :(

I never talked this kind of stuff besides with my wife and a close friend (but he died in a car accident ages ago).

I'm married with 2 children (4 years and 1 year old), I love my wife, I'm a freelance software developer, I do sports, I'm healthy, I have a home, a car and so on... 

The issue is that, since I died (I was around 3 years old, did after that years of Phenobarbital and brain scans and so on) something changed inside, something which I call "Ust Nasad", it is a kind of a parallel world much more rough than this one. It is a kind of perpetum dream (I sleep here I end up there, I rest there and I end up here). Since I was 20 (I'm 32 now) I studied (as a hobby) psychology a lot so going to a practitioner is .. actually useless as I know the strategy they may use. 

The true issue is that, with the time passing by, I'm more and more tired, wasted of energy. It is not physical energy that I lack (if I go now to the court I can play basketball without any issues 1-2-3 hours) but a more subtle energy, a kind of life force, the one that keeps you hoping, the one that keeps you alive. Nowadays, if I can sleep 2 hours per night it is more than enough to be ok for the rest of the day. But the sleeping time always went down no matter what I do (pills, teas, no blue light, no distractions, no X ... ). This causes slips with the "Ust Nasad" which is not really a pleasure. I'm not hurting anyone as when "I slip" I'm really really sleepy and I even nap for few seconds (but those seconds seem like hours).

Nowadays, I feel like the life has no meaning at all, that I don't really desire to do anything here at all. I started to force myself to do anything. I'm writing this message for the sake of my wife.

Thanks for reading this.

Sorin
