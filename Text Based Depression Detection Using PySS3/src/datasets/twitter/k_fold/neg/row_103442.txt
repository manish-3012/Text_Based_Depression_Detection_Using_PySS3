I decided to help myself.  The help just made it worse.I'm 25, and a checklist is the best way I can put this.

* Overweight
* Live with mother
* Want to be a game designer (Every professional I met hates most employers)
* My father abandoned me, not sure if he even considers me his son anymore.
* The only job experience I have is in technical support, which gives me nightmares still.
* Broke.  I don't even have $1 in my room.

Anyways, decided I'd make the trip to the doctor's office to tell them I had suicidal thoughts, and that I wanted to get back on track and feel motivated to do things again.  Telling a doctor, the first person I've ever told about how I feel made me extremely nervous.  I told him I needed medication to help me through it, to make me feel active and interested in the world again.

Roadblock.  Not only did I not get medication, but now I've been BLOCKED from getting medication, including sleep-aids which I need (racing thoughts every night keep me awake, takes 1-2 hours to fall asleep).  I have to now be on a 2-month waiting list to see a Psychiatrist to get medication to help me.  My insurance runs out in 1 month exactly.

The experience made me feel a lot worse about how I feel, I went from being nervous to completely closed.  I don't want to kill myself, I want to live and enjoy life.  Though I can't help but feel suicidal every day.

TL;DR: Finally decided to get help, made things worse.
