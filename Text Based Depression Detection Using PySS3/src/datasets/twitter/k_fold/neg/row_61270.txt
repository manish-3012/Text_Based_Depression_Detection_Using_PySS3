I Haven't Brushed My Teeth in Over a MonthI haven't brushed my teeth in over a month and the last time I took a shower (a week ago) I forgot to wash my hair. I smell nasty and I feel nasty but nothing feels as good as lucid dreaming for 12+ hours in bed. I've been binge eating the past two weeks and have just noticed the stretch marks zig-zagging across my pelvis. I feel like a failure my head hurts
