i don't fucking know what to live forthe only thing that keeps me alive is the guilt i might feel for leaving my family behind. if i could i wouldn't be here. i cannot push through this feeling that nothing matters. i often think about the relief of shooting myself. i used to have intrusive suicidal thoughts like this a year ago but i had just started lexapro then so i thought it might have been one of the side effects. i can't stop talking about my issues with other people either. it's all i want to talk about. i don't know what else to do when i'm supposed to be enjoying my time with someone when i can't stop thinking about suicide. then i start talking about my mental health and i feel like i have nothing left of me. i don't even know how to exist without subconsciously judging myself and my thoughts. i used to be able to hide everything and pretend to be something at least, now i try to be honest and transparent but i still feel scared and alone. i don't do anything besides smoke, try to impress my friends, and worry. i always fall into bad habits like comparing myself to others on social media for hours, or doing something excessively like smoking or masturbating, whatever i can do to distract myself. i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder last year and i was going through dialectal behavior therapy but my therapist doesn't take my insurance anymore, and it's really hard for me to form a new relationship with another one. i feel like i will never be me again. i don't like this me, i really want it to die. i wish someone would do it for me. i wish i could get what i deserve for being such a worthless, lazy, piece of shit. i know there's a possibility of me getting somewhat better SOMEDAY. but i don't know where to even start.. i feel lost.
