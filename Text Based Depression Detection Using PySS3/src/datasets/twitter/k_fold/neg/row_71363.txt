Disconnected . Please helpI haven't been taking my antidepressants.  I've been cutting again and I don't care . I haven't been eating and when I do I throw up. I feel floaty all the time. I don't care about anything . I really want to die. I deserve to die. But I also want to feel again. I haven't felt emotions in days. That's why I cut so I can feel pain.
