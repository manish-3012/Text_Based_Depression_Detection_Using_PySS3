Not sure whether I want to liveI'm not sure if I want to commit suicide or not. I am 15 (male) and I don't feel any emotions anymore. I try doing other activities but they don't really help. As you can see by my user name I will be taking Calculus this coming school year, I get all A's in school and I am a physically active person. I am on the cross country team for my school and I ran a 19:15 5k Freshman year and a 5:20 mile during the spring track season. I still just don't understand why I don't feel emotions. I feel like I should. I feel like I'm depressed but I don't feel sad, at the same time though I don't feel happy either. I feel like I live a relatively good life compared to some of you guys on this sub but I don't know if I can take it. I don't really open up to anyone very well because I lost trust in my parents and my small group of friends because of past experiences with small issues, because of this I have trouble opening up to people until something happens that proves I can trust them. I feel like whatever I do my parents get mad or are just disappointed in me. I guess I feel good about my achievements but it just gets shut down by me saying it's not good enough. I started cutting my hips (not wrists because we take our shirts off at cross country and everywhere else is pretty noticeable) to try to feel control, I just like that feeling of seeing blood and whatnot but I don't get the satisfaction that I want and I don't have a sharp enough knife to cut as deep as I want too. I just go with the societal norm and laugh and smile when I'm supposed too but, other than that I don't know if I want to feel emotion. It's gotten to the point where I've forgotten what normal feelings feel like.
