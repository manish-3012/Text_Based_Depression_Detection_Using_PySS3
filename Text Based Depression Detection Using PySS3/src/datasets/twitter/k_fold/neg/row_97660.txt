A year after a close call, I still wish I had jumped.About a year ago, I was in a different country, where I nearly jumped off a cliff. The reason I stopped myself is that a friend saw me and I didn't want to do it in front of her. Nearly a year later, I still think about it a lot. Recently, I looked back on this year and realized that nothing has made me particularly glad that I did not do it. In fact, I often wish that I had jumped off at that moment, especially right now. I've tried medication and counseling, but I really just want to die. I feel unhappy and unlovable, that I will die alone. This last year just feels confirmation of that. I'm not sure if anything will hold me back much longer.
