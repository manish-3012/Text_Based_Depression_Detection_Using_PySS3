Iâ€™m at the lowest point in my life.I had a good life, had a good position at a job I liked, had an amazing girlfriend, and several friends. I ruined it all, I got fired, she broke up with me because I was incapable of changing, and I ruined my friendship with her and my other friends. Itâ€™s been over a month since we broke up, sheâ€™s gotten over me with the help of my best friend, and now theyâ€™re so close that it seems like theyâ€™re more interested in connecting with each other over connecting with me despite barely meeting maybe 2-3 months ago. Iâ€™m the middle child, the one that has all the expectations thrown on him because his sister screwed up. Iâ€™ve never been close to my family as Iâ€™m the only boy in it and they never really knew how to interact with me because theyâ€™re disappointed my only hobby is playing games. I feel like I have no one left with this huge burden that I placed on myself. Iâ€™m looking for a reason to not do it but I feel even more hopeless as I see my old friends having fun together without me. For me I feel like I donâ€™t matter to anyone.
