I'm doneI can't seem to maintain relationships. I try not to be an asshole, people have told me how nice I am. They also tell me I'm not fat or ugly(if I ask), so tf? Why can't I seem to maintain a romantic relationship. I seriously don't understand why and when I ask my friend, they "have no clue". Its frustrating as hell and I'm currently considering suicide because of it.
