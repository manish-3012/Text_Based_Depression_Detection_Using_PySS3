People like me were born to kill themselves.Not many people understand what it feels like to feel this way all the time, with no reprieve. There is no hope. I have no value except whatever money or services I can offer others. No amount of therapy or medication can change the cruel reality of it all. 

Nobody cares. Doctors least of all. I need more help than anyone can give me. Nobody bothers to take the time to listen to the whole story. I can't even function because of the tremendous amount of stress it has on my body. Just having to do something means I can't sleep in anticipation of until it's all over. 

There is no end to the pain. I have no one to confide in. A romantic prospect could change everything for me, but she won't. Because she doesn't exist.
