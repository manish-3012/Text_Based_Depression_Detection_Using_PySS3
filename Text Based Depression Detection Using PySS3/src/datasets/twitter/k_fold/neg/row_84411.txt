Feel like I just don't belong anywhere.Every group I've been apart and every person I've met has eventually realized who I am and no longer wants anything to do with me. Its always then same end result no matter what I do. I'm a decent looking guy who can be charming and funny and I've had numerous opportunities to excel and maybe finally become happy. Unfortunately this personality I take on never lasts and I just end up crashing and burning. People begin to notice something is off with me and notice how socially awkward and stupid I really am. I then realize this is become isolated and depressed. People always seen to love me first which makes me  feeling even worse when they just become frustrated and want to avoid me. I'm 25 and feel complete alone and unwanted. I can't get out of this cycle and I think everyone believes I'm autistic or just retarded. I'm always told "who cares what other people think" but if the majority of people I've met see something wrong I must be the problem. I feel like nothing will ever get better. I don't think I want to exist knowing I'm like this. I've never been happy and I don't think I ever will be. I'm struggling to find reasons to carry on, I just can't take being a constant disappointmebt and being "different" from everyine else.
