What is there to live for?For the past few months, Iâ€™ve lost all interest in life, and questioning what I have to live for... one major reason for this just wanting to find someone that will love me back.

Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend before, but Iâ€™ve had many girls who Iâ€™ve been interested in; all were not interested or just another roadblock would arise. I met a girl several months ago, and things have been great. We have a genuine connection, and we bring out the best out of both of us. The problem is, she is not single, yet I cannot seem to get over my emotions for her. I really do think sheâ€™s the one, but I realize this is something I should not pursue. I love her, and theoretically, if sheâ€™s happy (which she definitely is), I should be happy too, right? I want the absolutely best for her. Unfortunately, that isnâ€™t the case...and itâ€™s really been destroying me mentally. I know sheâ€™s happy, but I just hate it isnâ€™t with me; Iâ€™m mad at nobody but myself. I completely get that thereâ€™s a million girls out there, but man, is it so frustrating. We both have bright futures (she is currently a Ph.D student and I will be a 1st year med student), but I hate how our futures will not involve each other. Iâ€™ve tried different options to reduce/limit my depression, but itâ€™s gotten to the point where I do not know if I can control it any more. Iâ€™ve had very dark thoughts about ending it, but I realize my problems will not end; they will go to my family members who I do not want to hurt. I just donâ€™t see a point in living anymore if my life is just gonna throw girls in front me who are all not interested. Iâ€™ve always want to spoil my wife and kids, but as Iâ€™ve gotten older, Iâ€™ve realized money really does not buy happiness....


I completely get that Iâ€™m still young and I will meet lots of cool, interesting people in my future. Thereâ€™s a cool physician on social media that I follow who happens to be single and is living an amazing life. Comparing yourself to others is usually a recipe to disaster, but he is a very good looking man who will have no trouble finding a S/O. And thatâ€™s the problem for me. Iâ€™ve always been confident with my looks, but from a rational POV, I realize Iâ€™m way below average and thereâ€™s much better looking, more interesting guys out there who always seem to get the attention. I would always be the guy who would try to chat casually to people, but they always move away to me to other people like Iâ€™m nothing...

I know this is all in my head, and ultimately itâ€™s up to me if I want overcome this obstacle, but damn do I feel defeated. I want to make a difference in other peopleâ€™s lives, but how can I do that if I canâ€™t even fix myself?
