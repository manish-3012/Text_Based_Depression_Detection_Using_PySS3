Some daysSome days I wake up and Iâ€™m fine (by fine I mean not a total living hell) and all day is â€œfineâ€ and then in the matter of seconds everything is horrid. Iâ€™m lonely, I take so many different kinds of medication for mood, nothing works for long. Iâ€™m lonely, on the verge of a panic attack. Anyone who would look at me from the outside would think Iâ€™m the happiest person but the version of me people see is never the version of myself when Iâ€™m alone and wishing I couldnâ€™t feel anything anymore. 

The only thing that doesnâ€™t stop me is that either my roommate Iâ€™ve known since 3rd grade will find me or my younger sister will. If they ever saw me like that I just hope theyâ€™d live a normal life after seeing my dead body.
