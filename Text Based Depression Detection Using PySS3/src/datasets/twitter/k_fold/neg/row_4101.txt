I can't do this no more, I'm a burden on everyoneI have burned every bridge I have, I pushed everyone that I love away. When I get to the peak of my depression I get mean and distant and say things I shouldn't. It's always ended with people giving up on me, it's like any hint of happiness I can have it sabotage it. Right now I'm in a 1+ year long relationship with the sweetest man, who loves me so. But I know I'll bring him down like I always do, in fact I already am. He sees that there's nothing he can do to make me happy and I take out my sadness on him. No one deserves me in their lives, I just want to run away and end it. But I'm scared, but I just can't do this anymore. 

Sorry for formatting on mobile, also sorry for the hot mess of a post my mind is racing. I just don't know what to do anymore...
