A month ago, I lost a friend to suicide. Today, another friend died of an accident.. I am so grief stricken. I want to die.I lost two friends within a month. This is my first death experience. I feel so hopeless and sad. I know that life could get better with time but I donâ€™t want to wait for that. I donâ€™t have the patience or strength to endure any more of this pain. I just fear that my attempt will be unsuccessful. What are your thoughts?
