Can anyone offer relief for suicidal thoughts scarring meLong time sufferer of depression and anxiety
Recently found out I also have a bit of ocd
Also found out Iâ€™m an ultra rapid metabolizer thatâ€™s why medications havenâ€™t worked too well and that my serotonin receptor or something absorbs serotonin slowly
Also thatâ€™s itâ€™s susceptible to side effects
Iâ€™m currently trying to find a good psychotherapist to help with my existential depression and other issues 
However when I think about how frequently I feel suicidal it scares me more that â€œhey is this how suicidal people feel before they do itâ€

Iâ€™ll take movies quotes videos or any advice from people I donâ€™t want to call anywhere because I donâ€™t want to talk about it out loud. I have a support system but I donâ€™t want to always bother them too

I donâ€™t want to die itâ€™s just been two years of really hard struggles Iâ€™m growing impatient especially when I feel bored but my anxiety prevents me from going out and working regularly too. 

Iâ€™m just exhausted and fearful of waiting my my current sertraline increase to work and the fact that I need more dose but it takes longer to work makes me feel tired 

Iâ€™ve practiced meditating for a while there and it helped I just have trouble accepting these thought about suicidal feelings
