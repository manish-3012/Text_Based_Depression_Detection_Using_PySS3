depressed about not being able to commit suicideMy suicidal thoughts are getting stronger and stronger and I don't know why. Every day I wish I could just stop existing. Even when I'm in a good mood, there's always a part of me that just wants to disappear. I'm just so ready to stop living but I know I can't kill myself because of my family. It would devastate my mom and sister. And knowing that I'll never be able to make myself disappear unless they both somehow died is tearing me up and making me even more depressed which makes the suicidal thoughts even stronger. I don't know how to deal with it. I almost drove myself to a psych hospital today because I felt so overwhelmed with thoughts of killing myself but knew I couldn't do it and it was starting to drive me crazy. I have since somehow calmed down but still can't stop thinking about dying. I just wish I could die in an accident or from an illness or something so that it wouldn't be my fault. I just feel like I'm a burden whether I live or kill myself.

just had to rant.
