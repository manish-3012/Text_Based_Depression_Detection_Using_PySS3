I am being blackmailed into not killing myselfThank you so much for coming into my life and making me actually give a shit about being here and discovering that love exists and that life can be fun and unexpected and wonderful even though it might be nerve-wracking and confusing and might not make sense while making total sense, thank you for deciding that money and income are more important to you than the boy who loves you, thank you for not communicating with me, thank you for blocking me, thank you for making me cut myself again, thank you for the continuous flood of conflicting feelings and thoughts and emotionally-charged mournful dreams, thank you for the suicidal feelings that come up out of nowhere and hit me like a brick wall, thank you for helping me see the duality of life and existence and the ultimate illusory and impermanent nature of it all, thank you for abandoning me and making me want to end my life, thank you for making me promise not to end my life, thank you for blackmailing me into not killing myself, thank you universe for keeping the drama alive. The show must go on...
