Do I need to go to hospital?Earlier today I impulsively took about 500mg of Effexor and about 14mg of Valium (I'm not sure if those numbers are accurate, I just kept swallowing pills). I stopped myself before I took anything else. I don't feel suicidal any more (it was really just an impulsive minute or so) but is this something I should go to hospital for? I understand that I didn't take a toxic dose of either drug, but I mean in a more protecting myself from further impulses way. I have a bad headache and a bit of nausea (no vomiting) and some sleepiness (no doubt from the Valium). I could also possibly contact my therapist.
