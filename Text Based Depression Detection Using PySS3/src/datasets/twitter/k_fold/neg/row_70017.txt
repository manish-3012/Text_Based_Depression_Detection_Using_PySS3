No more.I posted on here before, maybe close to 2 years ago now. People were helpful, but no one really stayed in contact. That's fine because that's kind of how people are with me. I am still in the same mindset that I was back then, but maybe worse. There's nothing holding me here at all anymore. My birthday is next month, and I just can't face another year of this. I haven't made definite plans but I am on my way of doing so. I wish there was another option, but I don't feel that there is at this point.
