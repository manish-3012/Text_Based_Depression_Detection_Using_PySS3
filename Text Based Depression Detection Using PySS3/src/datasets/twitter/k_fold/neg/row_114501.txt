I'm a failureHell I don't even know where to start. I'm almost 19 been diagnosed with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) and Anxiety since I was 14. Been hospitalized two times for suicidal thoughts and self-harm. Getting back on topic I feel that I have let down everyone in my family. Since I am too scared  to get a job my mother has to pay for all of these bills and medication. She works two jobs to stay afloat. My great Grandma also lives with us and helps her out. I believe that if I was dead everyone would have a much better life. My family would no longer worry about me, My mother would not have to pay for any future medical bills. I love my family and don't want them to go through any pain, and I know my death would cause some pain, but I feel that it would make their life's so much easier. I believe it is time for me to make a choice, I am scared on how things will end up. I will either have to get over my Anxiety and get a job/go back to school,  but I know things would still be hard and I don't believe I am strong enough to handle the future, or just do the inevitable and kill myself. This is the first time I have opened up about my feelings. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like suicide is how I am going to die I just don't know when.
