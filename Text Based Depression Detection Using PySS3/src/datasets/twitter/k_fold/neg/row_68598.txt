I am not allotted a lot of annatto but the bottle will coddle a throttled brothelSick of this shit. That's what it is: shit. 

My brain perpetually cycles to this stale disregard for everything; An autonomous disdain for everything and everyone. My go-to thought is to 'go away,' doesn't matter the scale of the events or states of life involved, I just would love to be removed from it.

Decided that before I give in to the inevitability of death, I will reach out to as many people I can in this world, living in ways producing results that I want for myself. Asking for nothing more than experienced response, my letters will reach out to clothiers, space exploration hiveminds, those elevated souls that I want to better understand and not tread water in this shallow pool of cynicism I find myself struggling to separate from. 

All I want more than anything is to be used and to be useful. 

I will let you know about my struggle, lovers. None of this life is concrete, no matter what my mind tells me. Nothing is definite. My thoughts are not my own. 

And as much as I want the ultimate hiatus, I also resolve to define aspects of my life, with my own words, my own understanding.
