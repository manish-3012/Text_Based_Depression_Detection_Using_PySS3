Nothing works M23 
Ive been in this state for awhile now, and i think its to late for me. Everyones gone, i dont have anyone to talk to , most people never text me, end up getting ignored, i dont want to sound self absorbed or anything, childhood was rough basically anything that shouldn't happen to a kid happened. Loss of multiple family members, suicide attempts,abuse,you name it. Ive only had a few close poeple in my life and there gone now too, everyone ends up leaving, im wondering if anyone will ever stay with all this weight i gotta carry around 
 Once i open up to people its like they leave suddenly.Im tired of everything everyone coming into my life and fucking me up a little bit more everytime someone leaves. And i feel like im at my tipping point

 im coming to a sad realisation  that nobody turely gives a shit till your gone.
