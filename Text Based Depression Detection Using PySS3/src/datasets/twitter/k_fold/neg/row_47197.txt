i wanna escape for goodmy life feels useless. my parents are constantly disappointed in me because i've been manipulating them and lying to them for the past 6 plus years, and they dont trust me because of it. i've fucked my life up so much by doing things i wish i could do to just escape for even a few hours. ive stopped going to therapy. it doesnt help me. i had gone off and on for the past 3 years but its never helped. no ones advice helps, no ones empathy helps, nothing fucking helps. i feel like i dont even wanna get better. i did this to myself. i deserve to be unhappy. i cant go to my friends house, i cant be home alone, i cant even walk around my fucking neighborhood for gods sake. i dont have a phone until im 18 im getting it back. im sneaking around again and having pointless sex. im objectifying myself so much. i feel like nothing but a fucking worthless ragdoll. i have no purpose. i manipulate practically everyone i know. ive attempted to kms 2 times with painkillers, didnt work obviously. ive been cutting myself since i was around 10 or 11 (im 16 now). ive planned my suicide. i have a note memorized. when i told my parents i wanted to kill myself whilst mid breakdown in the middle of the night, they laughed and said i was lying because i want attention. they did the same thing when they found out about me cutting. my dads already told me i should just go be a bum on the streets and overdose on fentanyl if i wanna die and leave so bad. i dont feel any emotions anymore. i can barely cry a little tear. im absolutely worthless
