I want to kill myself tonight.I really do. I want it to happen. It probably won't, but if it could happen, I would do it in a heartbeat.

I was already feeling worse than usual for whatever reason. Sometimes it just happens. But then I learned that All-State band, choir and orchestra results came out for my state. I used to have dreams of making All-State, but they were dashed after I got braces which messed up my trumpet playing. So one of my friends said how she was so excited to get into All-State choir, so I told them about my dreams of making it and how they were dashed. A few minutes later, her sister talks in a different group and says that people should congratulate my friend. I started to talk about my All-State dreams again, since these were different people, and I wanted them to know how they impacted me, but she cut me off and said "OP, please, not right now. She worked really hard and your conversation drifted away from that really quickly."

I don't know why, but that hit me really hard. I immediately blocked that person, and self-harmed, worse than I ever have before. I stopped talking to everyone for that night (which didn't matter, nobody tried talking to me anyways), and after I self-harmed, I searched around my house for anything I could possibly use to kill myself.

Unfortunately, I can't find anything that would be lethal, and my fear of surviving but being disabled for the rest of my life is also just another thing that's holding me back. So it probably won't happen, but not only do I want to be thought of fondly for once (because that will only happen when I'm dead, most of my friends don't even care about me to check in on me), but I also want my friend's sister to live with the knowledge that she drove me to almost kill myself.
