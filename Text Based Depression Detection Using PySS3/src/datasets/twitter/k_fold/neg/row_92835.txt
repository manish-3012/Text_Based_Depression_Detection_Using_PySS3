Its better not living....Ive failed everything. I am nothing. Im a failure. Im a nuissance. Im an ebarassment to anyone who knows me. Im a problem to everyone who knows me. How i wish i could go to sleep and never wake up. Forever gaze into a endless void and reminice my life and see nothing wonderful. Without me in the world, everything seems better.
