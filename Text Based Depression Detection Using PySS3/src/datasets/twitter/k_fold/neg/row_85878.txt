Unsure if my state counts as "suicidal"I don't want to kill myself. But if I don't get better any time soon, I will have to. The level of suffering that my list of mental illnesses cause me is just not bearable anymore. I can't live this way much longer. 

I'm scheduled to begin an intensive inpatient clinic for daily therapy sessions, and it's my very last hope. The way I see it, I'm going to do everything I possibly can to be as productive in therapy as possible and learn as much as I possibly can to cope with my insanity, and if it doesn't result in any long-term improvement, even mild improvement, I will have no other option than to end it all. I'm not going to do it today or tomorrow or the next day. Not even next month or the one after that. But I highly doubt I'll be alive this time next year if I can't make any improvement. I haven't told the clinic this, because they don't take suicidal patients. I doubt they'd take me if they knew what the stakes are for me. 

A lot of suicidal people report that making that decision provides them a lot of relief, but so far it's just made me even sadder because I think I had a fair amount of potential. It would be sad to have to end it, but it is definitely better than living the next few decades dealing with the torture that is my mind.
