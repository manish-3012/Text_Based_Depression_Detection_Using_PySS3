fuck thisi was on a long car ride talking to a friend who knows i'm suicidal and who i thought i could trust. i end up taking a nap and i wake up to a call from my best friend and a text from a teacher. i realized that someone anonymously reported me using the system my school district had available. i know it was my friend bc i didn't tell anyone else, but he denies it until later bc he thinks i'll be mad at him. they tried to contact my mom and i but neither of us responded, so they called the emergency contact, my best friends mom. anyways then my mom answers the call after i've woken up and i only hear her side of the conversation. i can tell what they are talking about and i'm shaking the entire conversation bc i've never talked to my mom about this but she's very serious abt suicide bc my father died from it. then, she mentions that the report didn't say if it was male or female and i start internally freaking out even more bc the friend knows i'm non-binary but my mom is 100% not supportive and for a second i think i've been outed, which would have serious repercussions, such as having to be homeschooled and the taking away of my phone or computer. luckily the conversation moves off of that. after the call is done, she says she wants to talk but my grandpa is in the car so she pulls over to a gas station and then she has a conversation with me. she says we're not finished with the conversation yet and i have to have a call with the school counselor tomorrow. also she's making me sleep in her bed tonight. now she's saying she's going to force me to go back to school in person when it reopens, which is not helpful because i get anxiety just thinking of it, but she thinks i'm only shy around people because of being isolated for so long. this is bullshit. why can't i decide to end my life if i didn't ask to be born? i'm so done here but i can't leave bc i'm being monitored now
