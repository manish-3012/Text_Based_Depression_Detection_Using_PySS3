I canâ€™t live with my parents for 4 more yearsIâ€™m 14, in high school. 3 days ago my grandfather died from cancer. He was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer 6 weeks ago. He was very important to me. For the past 6 weeks I have felt very unmotivated, I donâ€™t feel like doing anything at all. 10 minutes ago I got my report card back. 89%, 89%, 83%, and 70% are my marks for my classes so far. The 70% was for math class. My parents were extremely angry about this (mostly my mom) and started screaming at me about my marks. I averaged a 94% until I messed up on two tests (due to having someone close to me fucking dying), and apparently that makes me some sort of worthless sack of shit! My mother is the source of a LOT of stress and anxiety in my life. I want to move out at 18, because she makes me so unbelievably depressed. Anyways today has definitely been the tipping point for me. Depending on how the next few days go, I may kill myself, or I might not. Either way, I want all this unnecessary suffering at the hands of my â€œmotherâ€ to end. I give it a 10% chance that Iâ€™ll still be living by next week, and thatâ€™s if I donâ€™t tighten the noose enough. Well thanks for everything Reddit, Iâ€™ve always had comfort in talking to some of you lovely people.
