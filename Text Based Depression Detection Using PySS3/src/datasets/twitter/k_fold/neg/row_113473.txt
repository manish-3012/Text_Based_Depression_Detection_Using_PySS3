EmptyI heard people say that Empty is like having no feelings. I donâ€™t think that true. I feel empty because I donâ€™t want to do anything in the future. I feel empty because I have no one to confide in. I feel empty because even when everything is fine it all seems pointless. I feel empty because I donâ€™t see myself happy in any scenarios. 

I donâ€™t want to get better because I donâ€™t think I can. I donâ€™t understand how people still live knowing that nothing has meaning. Nothing bad even happened to me, Iâ€™m just fucking made like this. I want to be erased. I just want it to end. I want to go back to nothing.
