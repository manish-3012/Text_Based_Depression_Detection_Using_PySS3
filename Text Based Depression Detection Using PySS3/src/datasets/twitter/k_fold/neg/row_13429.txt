Why am I hereMy whole life is pointless and I don't think anyone cares. I went from having friends who physically and verbally bully me to none at all. I push myself away from anyone with out meaning to. My GPA is dropping and I don't seem to care about it or anything else anymore. Almost everyday is torment for me, I subconsciously plaster a fake smile on myself just so I can remotely fit in with everyone else. Whoever I thought was once my friend or at the very least seemed to care about me, ignore everything I say. I've been feeling sad, extremely self conscious and pessimistic like this for as long as I can remember. I have small moments where I remember something fun... But then I remember how horrible everyone made me feel for it. I almost killed myself last year. I wrote a suicide note and I was literally steps away from grabbing a bottle of bleach and ending it all. I don't tell anyone else about this because I'm so conscious on what they would say about me. I think about suicide everyday and I can't take this much longer. Im going to end it soon
