todayIâ€™ve posted here before but no one ever really reads these things anyway so I figured Iâ€™d might as well post for police or someone to find after.

Basically, Iâ€™m not happy and I havenâ€™t been for a while. I can never satisfy anyone, not even myself and I donâ€™t enjoy any of the things I used to. Iâ€™m using the last of the energy I have to do this and Iâ€™ll be gone by the time anyone reads this. I never anticipated living a long life anyways and Iâ€™m convinced this is the way Iâ€™m meant to die. There are so many more things I wanted to do, but this is my last stop. If anyone I love finds this, itâ€™s not you. It was always me and this is last time it will ever be me. Peace and love â¤ï¸
