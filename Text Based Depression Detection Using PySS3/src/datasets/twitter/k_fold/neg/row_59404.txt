nothing matters anywayliving is too much for me, I don't want to be here any more. I want to think that life has a meaning but I don't think it does. I know that for everything good that happens to me, i'll have to live through so many more days of this. It's too much all the thoughts and I've done horrible things that people don't know about and I don't deserve anything good even if it would make me happy. But nothing does anymore because I'm just faking the feelings because I like to deny it when something's badly wrong. My situation doesn't matter but I feel like the only way I could stay alive would be to fuck up my life even more and self-destruct until I die anyway. May as well end it when I want, it'd be so easy as well. I know people would be upset but it wouldn't affect me either way because i'd just cease to exist. I'm not a person who deserves to fix this anyway. I'm sorry i dont know why I'm posting here I'm sitting with a note written and a lot of pills and I'm still too scared to do it
