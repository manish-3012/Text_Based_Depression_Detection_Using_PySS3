Thinking about killing myselfHi, Iâ€™m Anthony, 23 M, living in France and drunk at the moment so sorry for the gramatical mistakes I might make. 
Most of my life Iâ€™ve felt alone. I was laughed at as a kid because I used to be fat, I guess thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve always had self confidence and trust issues. I managed to lose my virginity at 17 with a girl who loved me, I didnâ€™t love her. I was an asshole. I guess whatâ€™s happening to me right now is karma. 
In July 2018 I fell in love with a girl that I used to work with, we were together for about 9 months and she broke up with me because of my trust issues while I was in Syria fighting. 
Since she broke up with me in May 2019 I havenâ€™t had sex with anyone, except for a prostitute I fucked in Dubai a few months ago. In hindsight I feel like itâ€™s a disgrace to myself, I didnâ€™t even appreciate it.  
Since then Iâ€™ve gained a hell lot of weight, I started drinking, and spent my money on useless things. Bought myself a nice car, nice watch, nice phone,  nice clothes I that I feel unconfortable in because of the weight I took and I travel a lot, but all the money I spent brings me joy for a moment and then the saddness fills me again. 
I feel like Iâ€™m going to stay alone my whole life and this thought is horrible to bear. Iâ€™m someone who needs to be with someone. 
I used to be in love with my best girl friend, I guess I still am. I see her as the epitome of the best woman I could be with. I know I can never be with her, she didnâ€™t like me back 7 years ago, whatâ€™s changed now? 

These times I keep thinking about suicide, I canâ€™t deal with this loneliness. I donâ€™t feel like comitting suicide right now, but the thought is getting more and more present. 
My story may not make much sense, but Iâ€™ve told you more things than I ever said to anyone. 
Donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions.
