I don't know what to do Well, it's pretty short. I am a 14 year old indian boy . Since I was a kid I was considered as a good person, until my brother turned 7. He started acting like a retard and I would spank him to make him stop. I didn't even hit him that hard, more of a forceful tap. He would start writhing in pain, and I'm in an Indian household, so my parents are litteraly the hit and be hit type people.

 This has been going on on for a while now and my brother has been blaming me for things he did. And then the insults came hurtling in. I was called stupid, usless, a piece of shit, an asshole, etc. My grades started dropping and the mental and physical beatings got worse.

I feel like I'm trapped in a pit of anger, hatred, and despair. I don't know if I have depression, but it sure feels like it. Every time they hit me or scold me, I walk away into my room and go through different scenarios in my head where I would kill myself and my parents would be worried or something like that. I try to cut myself, but I can't. I don't have a gun so I can't shoot myself. I am telling this to anyone who can help me, but I cant handle this much longer. I am starting to think of jumping off a building and I hope somebody will finally realize my pain and try to help. Videogames are my escape from reality, and I am happy there. Thats the only reason I've lived so long. I would have killed myself long ago.
