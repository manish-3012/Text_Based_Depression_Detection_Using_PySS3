What is the reason for keeping me alive? Why canâ€™t society just euthanise me?Iâ€™ll never have a normal job earning taxes, Iâ€™ll never have a girl to make happy let alone children to raise, Iâ€™ll never have friends whose life to illuminate, the whole purpose of my existence is just draining resources through mental health funding and cash welfare. There is zero economic or productive utility in keeping me alive, let alone moral when this money can be spent on poor people in actual need. Millions of kronor could be saved if I just die, but when Iâ€™m too chicken to do it myself there is just no one who can rescue this money.

Maybe if I kill or rape someone Iâ€™ll be killed or locked away, reducing the cost a bit at least.
