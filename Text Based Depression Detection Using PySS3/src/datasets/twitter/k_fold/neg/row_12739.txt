Work makes me want to die...and I feel guilty for it. Like, everyone else just does it and I feel like a baby for not being able to handle it.

I quit my last job suddenly a few weeks ago and I'm gonna be working a 9-4 within the next week or so. The thought of even 1 day of working makes me want to genuinely just die. 

And I don't think it would matter what I do. I'm 19 so I only have had 1 job before this new one and it pushed me into self-harming and worsening my depression and suicidal thoughts. When I quit I began feeling slightly better. I stopped self-harming daily. But now the thought of getting back on the grind makes me wonder how in the HELL I'm supposed to do this for the rest of my life.

I always get more suicidal during the winter, so I'm trying to hang on to hope that maybe this will get better with time. But I don't know. I don't know what to do.
