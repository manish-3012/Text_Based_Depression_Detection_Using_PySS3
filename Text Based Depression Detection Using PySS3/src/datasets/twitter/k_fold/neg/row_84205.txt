I'm tired of living.Having lived through 22 difficult years of life I can finally say for certain now that I don't want to live for another 22. Life has no meaning, we are simply on this planet to reproduce and die. Having no desire myself, to reproduce my existence on this planet will just be a waste of resources. I have been trying so hard since I was a but a wee lass to find the things that made me want to survive every year I find less and less. I have literally contemplated suicide since I was about six or seven. I have kept going purely for the sake of those around me, those who love me but even that is becoming hard to do now. I feel so selfish for just wanting to give up but at the same time I just can't see myself holding on for much longer. I used to be able to pull myself out of the gutter for at least a small amount of time but now the cravings of death haunt me everyday. I want to make it look like an accident, no one will know that I took my own life, it will help with the grieving I figure. Life is slowly crushing me to death. I can't shake this depression. Someone help me please.
