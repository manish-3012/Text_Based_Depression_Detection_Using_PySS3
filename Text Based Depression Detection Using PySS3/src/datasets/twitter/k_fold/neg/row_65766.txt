Depressed Because of OrientationA year ago, I came out to a friend as bisexual. She had come out to me, so I felt comfortable. From there, I began to feel depressed because she was the only person I know, and everybody else I knew was straight. I hate myself because I like my friends - my friends are the kind of people to whom I am attracted - and I know I can never have a relationship with any of them. They're all males, and they would reject a relationship with me - even a non-sexual one - purely because I'm male. I hate that I feel this attraction, and I know that it's interfering with my relationships, and at times like this I just want to kill myself.
