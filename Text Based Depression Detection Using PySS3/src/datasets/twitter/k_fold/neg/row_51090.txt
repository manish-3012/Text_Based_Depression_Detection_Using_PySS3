I don't want anything out of lifeThere's nothing that I want. I don't want friends, I don't want a lover, I don't want to spend time with my family, I don't want to travel, I don't want any kind of food, I don't want to watch any TV, I don't want to change the world, I don't want any particular career, I don't want music, I don't want sex, I don't want fame, I don't want drugs, I don't want porn, I don't want religion.

Life can't give me anything. I don't see why I should bother with it anymore.
