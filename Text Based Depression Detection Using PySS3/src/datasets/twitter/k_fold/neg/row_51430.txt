im tiredim tired of feeling lonely all the time. tired of feeling like a loser. tired of feeling ok one second and spiraling the next. tired of questioning every single decision. i hate how indecisive i have become, too afraid to decide on the simplest of things. tired of thinking about depression and anxiety all the time. im just tired guys.
