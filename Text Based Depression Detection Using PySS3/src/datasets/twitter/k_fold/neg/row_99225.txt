I'm old and I've seen and been through a lot... But I just can't any more. This world is turning to shit and I don't want to be a part of it any more.I'm 50. I lived through all the bullshit that's happened, from Reagen telling us ketchup is a vegetable in school lunch to the Iran hostage crises to 9/11, the stock market crash in '08 to the wars in the Middle East... Ebola, class inequality, Trump, the government gas lighting idiots and idiots becoming a cult and now corona virus. There's a lot I didn't mention, but it's awful and I don't want to be a part of this mess. It doesn't seem like there's a way out. 

I was in an accident on 2012 that left me hobbled and killed a lifetime friend. I have children and pets and that's the only reason I'm here. No one would feed the cats and my children would be sad if I checked out. 

I'm scared and I have no one to talk to and it just seems like ending the suffering would be best.
