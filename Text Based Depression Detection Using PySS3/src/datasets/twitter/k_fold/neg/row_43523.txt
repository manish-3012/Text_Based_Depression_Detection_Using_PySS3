I need help.I need help.  Iâ€™ve had depression issues since I was a child.  I had things happen during my childhood that I just canâ€™t bring myself to talk about out loud.  My father died a few years ago after a lifetime of cheating, lying, and doing terrible things to my mom and two sisters and myself.  Ever since he died I have had more and more bad memories coming out of the dark.  I just canâ€™t handle any more.  

My husband and I both work but we just canâ€™t get ahead.  I feel guilty for just existing, eating, being.  I have cried every day since November 2017.  Things have always been rough but holidays are awful, as yâ€™all know.  But now itâ€™s March and I still canâ€™t bear to face the day. 

My husband is wonderful.  He doesnâ€™t have a clue how bad off I am.  He has no idea I daydream about suicide.  He doesnâ€™t know most of what happened when I was young.  No one does.  I cover my sadness with fake smiles, and laughs.  I hate to bother anyone.  

Any of my friends, family, would be so shocked to hear this.  I put on an excellent smiley, happy front.  Iâ€™m really, really good at acting like everything is great.  I force myself to complete the daily interactions needed of me.  Take the kiddo to school, Iâ€™m a PTA mom, head of class parties, the â€œsoccer momâ€ that has it together, but Iâ€™m honestly dying inside.  But my heart absolutely hurts.  I feel so broken with sadness.  

I need meds, I know I do, but itâ€™s $200 just for an office visit at the local urgent care.  I canâ€™t bring myself to use two hundred bucks on myself.  I want to run far away and just be done but I canâ€™t do that to my child and my husband, so instead I sit here with more grief and sadness than I know what to do with.  

Thanks for reading.  If I did it, I would jump.  Jump and drown.
