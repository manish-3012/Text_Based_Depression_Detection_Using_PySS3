I finally am happy with committing suicide and starting to plan for it .This is my first Reddit post so Iâ€™m sorry if itâ€™s not perfect or good, but for the longest time I(20M) have been dealing with depression and self loathing. 

I do take medication and it does help a little but for the longest time I just donâ€™t understand the meaning of my existence, I just feel like a mistake and everything I do just goes to shit. 

I lost my job yesterday and havenâ€™t even told anyone. I just canâ€™t see myself enjoying life or wanting to live . 

So I have made up my mind , when my last paycheck comes, I want to sell everything I own and that is to my name, give it all to my dad except the money for my funeral and just slip out of existence. 

My father was always the reason I didnâ€™t commit suicide in the past but now I understand that heâ€™ll get over it and hopefully my other siblings will help him get over it. 

I guess I just wanted to post my thoughts somewhere and it became on this Subreddit . 

Thanks for reading .
