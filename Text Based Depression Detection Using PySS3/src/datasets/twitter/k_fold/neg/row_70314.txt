I try so fucking hard but at the end something happenI try to put my miserable life in order, wake up early, study, exercise 30 minutes and all that stuff, sometimes I start to feel better but at the end i always return to the point where everything is a piece of shit and my anxiety and stress is so fucking high, really don't know what to do and I'm getting tired of life, sometimes I wish I never born, but other times I feel like life is something beautiful but I'm getting so fucking tired of that cycle

Sorry for my English
