Not worth itI was offered a under the table job and made a descent amount for.three days. But it's back breaking work and there's a reason why I quit my easy job there months ago , I'm tired of working . I don't want to learn about the truth , I don't want to get better or cope anymore. I'm going to just leave and go back to  being at the park, I don't wanna pay rent anymore. O rather rot and die at the park in a months time.
