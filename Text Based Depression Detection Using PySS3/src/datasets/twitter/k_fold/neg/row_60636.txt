Wrote this apparentlyIt sounds very pre-teen angsty but I just needed to share it somewhere. I found this on my phone this morning, I apparently wrote it while high. I've never found more suitable words to how I feel.

I feel like I'm floating just under the surface, I'm not fighting the current but I'm using everything I have.

I just want to push past the surface and break hold of the current, but no matter how close I get it always drags me down.

I am tired

The current makes me forget the times I was free of it. The fleeting moments shrouded by its strength.

I don't like this

I just want to hug

I don't want to cry

Please save me

From myself
