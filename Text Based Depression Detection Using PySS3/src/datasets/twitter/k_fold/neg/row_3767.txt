OCD, youâ€™re beginning to win.iv been dealing with obsessive compulsive disorder for most of my life. 
began showing signs when I was around seven, and was officially diagnosed sometime in middle school. 

Iâ€™m not a clean freak, Iâ€™m not a germaphobe. Iâ€™m pretty unorganized sometimes. 

Things I still do are:
â€¢re writing notes because my handwriting was too big or sloppy during the time of writing them.
â€¢begin touching items in stores (like touching clothe racks) and sometimes having to go back and do it again.
â€¢having to touch corners of a room.
â€¢having to write down specific phrase and time stamp  with said phrase.
â€¢trichotillomania of hair on my head (obsessive urge to pull out hair on the body, mine being from my scalp.)
â€¢excessive blinking 
â€¢having to repeat phrases in my head
â€¢knocking on wood
â€¢having to take a picture and say a phrase every night when it turns 11:11 

and more I can not think of at this moment.  

itâ€™s hard. I break down crying to myself because no matter the medication, or coping skills or help from others I still feel unsafe.
my ocd surrounds religion. iv had horrible thoughts of hurting God, saying horrible things about Him, and things such as that- things I would never do or say to anyone or any figure.
one of my most terrifying delusions is where I believed I had sold my soul (even talking about it is difficult) I honestly and truly believed I had in some way (even though I donâ€™t practice anything like that)
No one could convince me otherwise. 

My ocd religious fears most likely came from the many private schools I attended (Iâ€™m from the south) I was already emotionally unstable with a difficult home life. I hate myself for being afraid of religion. I donâ€™t hate religion, or God or anything- I donâ€™t blame the schools, I blame myself. 

This might sound ridiculous to some people. I am just afraid of negative things happening because of the negative thoughts about God.
Iâ€™m also afraid of any other religious figure (Buddha, etc.) I respect all religions but Iâ€™m absolutely terrified to think or even talk about them.

Sorry. Itâ€™s difficult.
