How easy would it be for me to just slit my wrists...This past month has been a shit show. One that I donâ€™t want to get through anymore. I canâ€™t do it anymore. 

My ex thinks he can rule my life. I fall for it every fucking time. He hits me and bites me and acts like itâ€™s okay. We got into a fight and I pulled out a razor and cut myself. It was deep, he freaked out and called 911. Iâ€™m surprised they didnâ€™t put me on a hold. I should probably be in a psych ward right now but they always make things worse. I come out knowing what not to say. Itâ€™s just a game. 

My head hurts sooo bad from him hitting me over and over. I donâ€™t get it. At least he gave me my razors back. I could do it. So easily. Not like many people would care. I know I canâ€™t care anymore. This shit is fucking ridiculous. I donâ€™t have a fucking purpose. How do you find your fucking purpose? Because I sure as hell donâ€™t have any, not even the most basic ones of being able to fucking reproduce. 

Fuck this. Fuck feeling like this, FUCK EVERYTHING.
