I donâ€™t know how to get out of this holeI work the night shift at a warehouse and my parents tell me i should quit because I come home really exhausted after 10 hours a night. I tell them I do it for the money but really Itâ€™s the only thing that keeps me from thinking of self harm and suicide all the time. I hate that it so much.
