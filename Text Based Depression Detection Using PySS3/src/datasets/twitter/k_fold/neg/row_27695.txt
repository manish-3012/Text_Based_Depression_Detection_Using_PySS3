im near my breaking pointi hate being alone all the time but everyone irritates me

my daily interactions are all small talk

i think im losing my sanity i forgot what itâ€™s like to have a friend i have nobody i didnâ€™t think that was possible

each morning i feel like i have nothing to live for

this hits me during the day and then i start crying and i hate it i hate living like this
