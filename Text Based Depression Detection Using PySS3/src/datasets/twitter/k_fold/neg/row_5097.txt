This world abused me to death and Iâ€™m going to die cause of itI canâ€™t believe the bad fortune I had sometimes.  Ruthless, dark, desperate will to survive every day.  Mom hit me, verbally emotionally abused me, dad abandoned me, brother regularly plotted murder/pulled knives on me.  I had health problems and random small town doctors I saw, when I didnâ€™t understand the distinction of competency of treatment and blindly trusted those w/PhD, irresponsibility did not refer my perfectly treatable illnesses to those who could help.  Iâ€™ve been on my own since I was 16.  NO ONE HELPED ME.  I EXCELLED IN SCHOOL WHEN I WAS IN (3.8).

Iâ€™m full of hate, revenge, and murderous rage.  Iâ€™m so angry!!!  I was always nice to others and was influenced by virtue and all that bs now I canâ€™t imagine having a good towards anyone.
