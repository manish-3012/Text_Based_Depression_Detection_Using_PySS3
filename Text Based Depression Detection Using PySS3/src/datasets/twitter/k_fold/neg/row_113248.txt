My wife left me due to my drinking. Random suicide thoughts are now popping up in my head.Ive had problems with alcohol that I didn't realize until my wife left me and is planning a divorce. She is not coming back and she's made that clear. I own 100% of the fault. I never domestically or sexually abused her but I did leave mental abuse unintentionally. I said horrible things to her that I did not mean. I was a weekend drinker only but I always over did it. I hate myself I just want to disappear. I'm going to start AA meetings soon to takle my alcohol abuse. 

I don't want to die but the thought of suicide brings peace of mind. I'm not a quitter but those thoughts just keep popping up. What makes things worse is that we work together. She's cold towards me and just so careless about my well being which I do not blame her for hating me. I fucked up it was all my fault. I just don't want to die, I feel those tendencies getting stronger.
