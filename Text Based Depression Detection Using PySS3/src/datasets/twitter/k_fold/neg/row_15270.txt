Canâ€™t hang onI had it all... a wife of 13yrs, 3 children, owned a house and a well paying job. We like any relationship have had our ups and downs. She decided she has had enough and has kicked me out about 4-5 months ago. I begged her to give me another chance but she wonâ€™t. I could never trust a woman again. I quit my job as I couldnâ€™t hold it together at work, I now live with my mother who has offered no support. All my friends are getting on with their lives(inc my ex who had a new man within a few weeks) i have no one to talk with and no one that cares if Iâ€™m alive or dead. I just seem to be spiraling down the drain. I keep thinking no one would miss me when Iâ€™m gone. Iâ€™ve stood on the top of a cliff(a lot lately)and stared over the edge with my feet half off the cliff and pictured what would happen if I jumped. Iâ€™ve written notes to my kids explaining why I canâ€™t continue with all this pain. I canâ€™t see a way out or a way forward. I have nothing left in my life and the only reason I didnâ€™t kill myself is I didnâ€™t want to hurt my kids. I donâ€™t care about anything and I donâ€™t know how much longer these suicidal fantasies will last or how much longer I can keep them at bay. Iâ€™m thinking now that the short term hurt for the kids would be better in the long run without me around. I just want the pain to go away forever...
