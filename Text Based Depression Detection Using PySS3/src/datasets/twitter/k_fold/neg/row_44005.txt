Pain and suicideI have an autoimmune disorder, spinal deformity, adhd, anxiety, and chronic depression.  Itâ€™s a party

I also am blessed with a sparkling personality, which I use to hide all my ailments. 

I am in constant physical, emotional, and psychological agony and itâ€™s only getting worse as I get older. 

I understand that suicide is maybe not the most responsible choice, but god damn. I am tired.
