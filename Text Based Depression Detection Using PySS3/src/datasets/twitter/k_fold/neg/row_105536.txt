I found an old post of mine from a throwaway. I read it and it feels like everything's gotten worse.I'm twenty slowly awating the day I turn twenty-one so I can at least legally drink myself to death. Or at the very least, the pain away. My situation with my parents and family has gotten worse. Both my parents believe that the other is cheating on them, and both are going through some retarded power struggle in an attempt to get the other to back down, admit fault, or anything else. Neither are capable of raising me or my brother alone. I had an argument with my father a few weeks ago. We are having trouble keeping up with our rentas both my parents manage money poorly. He wanted to move out as our lease was coming up. Wanted something smaller and more affordable. A two bedroom instead of a three. I knew inside my heart what that meant. That was a silent wish for me to leave. I told him what I thought. That I knew that I would be better off not around. I begged him to hit me. Just for confirmation that I was nothing more than a waste of space. My mother, who is home at best every other weekend, happened to overhear the argument. She told me she was hurt that I would say such a thing. I could tell from the lack of sincerity in her voice. She didn't mean it.

I've been unemployed a year and one month. This was about the same time that my family lost our home. We lived in a house, a real two-story front yard and back yard house for 8 years.We lost the house to some shady dealings, things that could have been prevented if not for the incompetence of my father. I hate living in a small apartment 3 years ahead of my time. I hate sleeping on a broken futon, in a too-small room. I've been trying so hard to find a job. I know I've been a burden on everyone aruond me. My girlfriend, poor girl, lost her job only a few months ago. She found a way to bounce back; use her artistic talent and start up a small, tiny ebay business. It's working out well for her. I have no such skills or talent and any such anything that could be possibly turned into income. I find myself borrowing money from her constantly. She pays for our food whenever we eat out, more often than I do. She sends me emails of job openings on craigslist. I emailed or left messages on every single employer. At best I get automated return emails, the equivalent of "don't call us, we'll call you". My girlfriend claims I don't try hard enough, that I should be calling these robotic machines or nobody-answerings back, begging for my resume to be read or my application to be noticed.When no one answers, I know that giving up was the best plan. I haven't the heart to tell her. 

I can literally count the number of real friends I have on one hand. And have fingers left over. I barelt have any acquaintances, barely anybody that knows who I really am. I like to pretend that my circle is intimate. That we're each others best friends. I keep up the lie to myself, pretending that people really care. My girlfriend is trying to throw me a party. We invited all the friends we have and even ex-friends who I were close to once. She told me that she might even tell them that they only have to see us this last time. If they hate us or never want to see us again, it would be after this. I see this as the ultimate sign of pity. I even have a feeling that anybody who shows up would do so for the fact that there'd be alcohol. Not because of me. 

Life is so hard right now. I so desperately want to give up. I keep getting told "it will get better" and I honestly, desperately want to believe that that's the truth. I'm considering posting this from my main account, just to see if people who know me would ever care to see it. I've been lying to myself about my happiness for the past two years. I know that everyone, *everyone* connected to me right now would be better off without me around. No question whatsoever. My parents would have one less mouth to worry about feeding, one less bedroom to need to find. My brother wouldn't have such a poor role model to look up to. He might see the mistakes I made as a sign to straighten up, to not end up like me. My "friends" would no longer have the obligation of having to be around me. I know that they only come because I am desperate for attention. My girlfriend could finally move on to someone better. Someone more successful. Someone who deserves her. Someone who isn't a total catostrophic colossal failure shell of a human being. Someone with worth.

It hurts so much. I hate it.
