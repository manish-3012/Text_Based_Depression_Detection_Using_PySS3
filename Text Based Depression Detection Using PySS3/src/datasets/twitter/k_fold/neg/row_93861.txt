FMLI cannot do this anymore. I hate life. I have thought about killing myself for years now, but today might actually be the day. Everyone hates me. Everyone at school, everyone at home. I am convinced that my dad knows nothing qabout me, even though I see him every day. I can't handle this anymore. I feel so sad, and I do not know why. I have no reason to be sad, but I am. I live in a nice house with a great family, and I am getting straight A's in school. Why do I feel so sad? What is wrong with me? I can't handle this anymore. The Zoloft is not working. I am going to end it. I just cannot handle this anymore.
