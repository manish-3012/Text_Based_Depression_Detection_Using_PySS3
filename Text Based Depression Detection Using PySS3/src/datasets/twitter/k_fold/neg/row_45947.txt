there is nobody left to fight for me, not even myselfI've just lost interest. I'm realizing that no matter what I do, I'll never feel like I've satisfied the hole in my chest. Nobody can fight my battles for me, and I don't want to either. I'm slowly pushing the boundary where the anxiety of death no longer outweighs the pain of life. And no matter how hard I convince myself or others try to convince me, I cannot convince myself that anyone loves me or cares. which, in turn, makes me feel like an even bigger piece of shit for seemingly casting all my friends aside. and I feel as though they'd hate me and feel betrayed if I ever said. I feel so alone it's crushing. it's absolutely suffocating. 

I used to think the best way to move on was to improve yourself but I don't even know what the point is anymore. improve myself for what? what am i hoping to achieve? what's out there waiting for me? it's more of same. nothing will ever change.

I know where my story ends, I might as well just finish it already. first chance I get.
