I'd rather die in America than be sent back "home"Growing up I always felt like an American. I see this country as my home, but legally I've never been an American. And I know in the eyes of many I'm nothing more than a criminal. 
I'm aware that I have no future either way, but I would much rather die in my real home, the U.S.
