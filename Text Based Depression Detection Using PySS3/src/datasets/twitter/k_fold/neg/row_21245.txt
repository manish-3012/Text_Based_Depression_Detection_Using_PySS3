I've never felt more ugly than I do tonight.I want to throw up. I hate myself. I deserve to suffer. I deserve the pain I feel. I cut myself really fucking badly tonight and it felt good and I don't regret it. I wanna do it more, I want to cut myself all over my body and keep going until every inch of me is oozing with blood. I want my body to be viciously mutilated. I want to kill myself in the most brutal way humanly possible. I want to punish myself for trusting, loving and caring when all that does is get me hurt. I want to punish myself for never being good enough no matter how hard I try. I want to punish myself for existing. I want to fucking die.
