31 and nothing lefti have been a very depressed person for the longest time.  i have drank so much over the last few years that i cant remember things.  i dont remember people who were once in my life.  i quit my good job of 7 years because i have learned to despise it because of the people in my department and how much money i was fucked out of and status.  i have been a bitch my entire life in corporate america and i hate it so much.  i cannot stop drinking and i smoke ganja now on a daily basis for one year and a half.  i have zero income and i have not heard from one friend all week.  i feel i am nothing but a dread on my parents.  my entire life has consisted of a black cloud that floats over my head and i don't know what i did to deserve this.  i have always tried to be a good person.  i am not prepared to kill myself even though i had thought i may this weekend.  i dont know what is keeping me from doing it.  i have lost much feeling in my body from abusing it as bad as I have.  its not the pain that fears me and I have excepted my death by ever beer that i drink.

i dont know what to do reddit anymore....no one else to talk to about this....tried talking with my folks and they know that I am serious but told me that they don't want anymore of these episodes.  I don't have any medical condition.  I just want to be happy....how do i find this happieness?  thanks for listening.  j 31 from ohio
