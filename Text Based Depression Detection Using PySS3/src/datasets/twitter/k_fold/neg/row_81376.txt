I just feel stupid all the time.I donâ€™t feel Iâ€™m worthy of anything. I want to be beaten. I want to be punished for even breathing. I deserve all of it and more. Why wonâ€™t anyone just hurt me like I deserve?  Iâ€™m a bad friend who canâ€™t do anything for others. Iâ€™m a terrible employee who calls out sick too much. Iâ€™m a god awful human because I canâ€™t help anyone. I just want someone to give me what I have coming.
