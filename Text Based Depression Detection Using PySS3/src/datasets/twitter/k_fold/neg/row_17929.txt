I'm not sure if this is an interesting titleI am getting so tired. I don't know why I want to die, but I'm getting tired of fighting it. 
I hated my job, so I got a degree in chemical engineering. Graduated this May. Big whoop. Nobody wants to hire a 38 year old for a graduate position.
I'm not really complaining about that. I just feel this hopeless feeling. The suicidal thoughts won't stop. Why won't they stop?
