My last attempt went unknown.Trigger warning: suicide attempts.



Most people think my last attempt was when I was 17, and boy was that a close one. Iâ€™m amazed Iâ€™m still alive for lack of eloquence. In reality it was last April, I wrote my daughter a small note telling her I loved her, and during work I tried to hang myself. I worked from home. The house was full. Nobody noticed me sobbing. Nobody noticed the red welt around my neck. It wasnâ€™t until last month that anybody knew, I decided to be honest with my medical providers about it. 

It feels so far away yet so recent. 

I donâ€™t exactly dwell on it but I know my own hand is how Iâ€™ll go.
