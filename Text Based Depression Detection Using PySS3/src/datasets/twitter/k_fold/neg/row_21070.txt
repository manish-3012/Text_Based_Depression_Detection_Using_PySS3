I hate my lifeI recently lost a friend (a girl) because I couldn't keep my feelings for her inside. I was managing fine until my asshole parents forced me to go to the choir I met her at (she doesn't go there anymore but it still reminds me of her.) She was my only friend. We have a concert tomorrow and I don't want to go but I'm afraid my parents are going to force me. Not only that but I am lazy and fat and I don't have my driver's license so I can't get a job so I have to rely on my parents to give me money. I'm graduating from HS year and I never wanted to fucking grow up. If I wasn't such a coward and knew I had a method that would be 99% effective I would have fucking killed myself already. I know my life is "great" compared to other people here but it doesn't feel like it.
