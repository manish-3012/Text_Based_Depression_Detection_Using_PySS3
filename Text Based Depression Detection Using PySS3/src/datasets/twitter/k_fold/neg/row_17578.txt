I am too scared to die but too sad to liveThis is driven by several things that i cannot get into... my sleep schedule is fucked, i cannot do any of my classes on time(i am 14), i was caught staying up late and my parents threatened to move my computer. I locked my door but i have something i need to get up for in the mornin g and no alarm clock. I am also worried they will just be more mad at me if i keep it locked and go ro bed. Please help me as soon as possible
