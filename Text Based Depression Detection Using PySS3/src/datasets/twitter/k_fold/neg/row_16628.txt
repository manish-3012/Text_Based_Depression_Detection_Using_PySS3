How do I talk to my boyfriend about my suicidal feelings?I have been having issues with cutting for the past couple years, and have attempted suicide once. I'm very glad it didn't work, but sometimes the feelings come back and I just want to end it all. When that happens, I try to talk to my boyfriend of a little under a year. He's really not much help. He either acts like he didn't hear me, or completely breaks down in a 'I can't believe you'd do this to me' sort of way. I don't know what to do.
