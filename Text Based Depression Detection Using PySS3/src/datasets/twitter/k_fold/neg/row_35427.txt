What's the point?I nearly did it tonight. I was on the roof of a parking garage. I was good and drunk, but I just couldn't do it. This woman, god damn it, I care about her. The only reason I was out or drinking was to celebrate her passing of a licensing test. I love her, but she doesn't love me. Once she finishes her degree, she'll be moving. In all likelihood, we'll never see each other again after that. But I couldn't ruin her night. She doesn't need me, she doesn't now, she won't after she moves. It's all *my* stupid emotions hanging me up, because I think it *could* hurt her. But I don't have anything I'm living for. She doesn't love me, regardless of where she lives. She could pick up any man with the snap of her fingers, I don't know why she wastes a second with me. Do I live for fleeting pleasure? Do I live to protect her from pain? Why can't I just die, why can't I do one little selfish act, one thing to stop the meaningless grind that is my existence?
