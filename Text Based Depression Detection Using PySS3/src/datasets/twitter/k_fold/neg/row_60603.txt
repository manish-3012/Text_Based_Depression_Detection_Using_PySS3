i want to end it all todaywe have a school break for a week but the school left us tons of works to finish over that break and it's too much, it's more than what we normally do in a week. i couldn't handle it before that and now it's another pile of undone homework. if i don't do it, i might fail my classes but i can't fail my classes because i don't want to disappoint my parents. i know it seems like a small problem to kill myself over, some might say that its just school problems but its more than that, i've had this urge for years and i've acted upon it twice this year but i failed, i found the perfect way to kill myself guranteeing me dead. for once in my life it's all so clear that i want to end it, everything, today.
