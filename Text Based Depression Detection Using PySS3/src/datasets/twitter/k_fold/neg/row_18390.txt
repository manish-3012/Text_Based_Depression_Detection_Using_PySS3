I am so tired of trying when no one caresI really need to get this of my chest. Everyday I wake up and I hate who I am. All I do is irritate everyone. I try to reach out for help, but everyone thinks I am seeking attention. I can't go on feeling judged and unhappy. Here is some background.  

I have had mental health issues since sixth grade. I was always unhappy during middle school even if I didn't realize it. Regardless of therapy or hospital stays, the suicidal thoughts keep coming back. That leads me to my current situation. 

I have just started high school. I thought that I would be better this year. I was wrong. The first week I already had so much work. I was so overwhelmed. I was always able to stay on top of my grades but for some reason it felt like to much for me. I started to not go to school. I have already missed 8 days in one month. 

This problem comes with many others. My mom and dad haven't lived together in years. During the summer I went to stay with my dad to build our relationship. Every time he is around me it seems like he is forcing himself. When I get lonely I go to my mom's house. 

She is supportive but judgmental. If I make a mistake it turns into ridicule. I now have to chose where to live. My grandmother's house has people in it who spread rumors about me behind my back so that definitely isn't a option. 

I am tired of it all. I am about to end everything. I know the place, the time, and the way I will do it. If people are going to continuously treat me like I am their acquaintance when I am their family then I have no hope.
