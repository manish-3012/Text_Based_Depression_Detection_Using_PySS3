How to get help instantly?So I'm feeling very down lately, to the point where I've had suicidal thoughts for a few days in a row. I've somehow managed to fight them off, but it's getting harder and harder. I just want help urgently, though I don't know how to get it.

I don't want any hotlines like Samaritans, etc, because they don't help at all. I don't know what I really want...I just want something to keep on going, because it's just getting worse, and I don't know how to go on.
