Sad, lonely, and longing for a time which never existedI feel like shit. I'm unable to cry, I think it's because of the antidepressants I'm on or something. Haven't been able to properly cry in well over a year and I miss it.
I feel incredibly isolated.

I'm trans and fucking everything reminds me of my gender dysphoria. Even things completely unrelated to gender. I don't like it.

School's going back in person tomorrow. I'm not looking forward to it. Online school was working for me. 

First thing I thought about when I woke up this morning was running to the kitchen and plunging a knife right into my abdomen.
