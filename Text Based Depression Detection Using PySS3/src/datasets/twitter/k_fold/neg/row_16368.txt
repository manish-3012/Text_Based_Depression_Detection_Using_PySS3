Does the hotlines show up on the phone bill?Not sure if this is the right place to ask. But I think I'm at the stage I need to talk to someone. Does the suicide hotlines show up as anything special on your cell phone bill? Or just another random number. And is it always free? Or do I need to look for free ones?
