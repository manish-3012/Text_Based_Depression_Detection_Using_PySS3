I had big plansItâ€™s so painful to feel like theyâ€™ll never happen.

How do you turn things around when you canâ€™t imagine things will ever get easier, or lighter to bear? I donâ€™t remember what itâ€™s like to feel in control. Iâ€™ve been in agony for months. No one knows. Itâ€™s hard to say. Sometimes I get so stressed I puke. I put on a front. Putting on a front actually makes me happier because then I can do the types of things that a happier person would do.

Iâ€™ve got debt to clear and I can either find a way to make it with my business or borrow it from my abusive, controlling parents, who Iâ€™m living with. At the moment Iâ€™ve got about $9. Iâ€™m not a kid. Iâ€™m an adult. Iâ€™ve just got heaps and heaps of shame that I just canâ€™t seem to offload.

Iâ€™ve lived here for years on and off, mostly on, and itâ€™s hard for me to wrap my head around how far off the rails Iâ€™ve driven my life. Suicide feels inevitable sometimes, even though the thought of actually doing it horrifies me. Part of me wants to develop a serious medical condition and just disappear within days.
