This is really bad...I drank and went to a party but I just came home and itâ€™s 3.50 am at my place... I feel so down and Iâ€™m really scared about doing something to myself.

My family cut me off a few days ago and Iâ€™ve never felt this alone before.... I tried calling a suicide hotline but it said all lines were occupied due to covid and that I could try later... but I donâ€™t know how long I can wait...
