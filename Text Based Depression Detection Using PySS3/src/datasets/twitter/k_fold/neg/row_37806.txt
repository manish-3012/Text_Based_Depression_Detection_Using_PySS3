I posted on Facebook about something, and I was corrected and now I feel ashamed and want to dieIt wasnâ€™t political, it was actually about parenting, and Iâ€™m not even a parent. I was quickly corrected with lots of friends chiming. They werenâ€™t mean, they just educated me. I simply didnâ€™t know, and I apologised and said thank you for enlightening me, I really just hadnâ€™t thought about it that way before. 

But I still want to kill myself for it. I feel so ashamed and disappointed in myself :(
