ACNE has ruined my life(my first post, but i've been looking around here for quite some time)

I care too much about what people think of me. It pretty much consumes me to the point where I become so conscious that I don't even want to leave the house. Case in point: the fucking devil that is acne. I can barely look at a mirror without cringing at myself. I look at the people around me who are my age that don't go through the same thing. And I'm left dumbfounded as to why out of all people I have to be the one to spend a shit ton of money ($250 A MONTH, and sometimes every other week) just to look half decent. (Keep in mind I am a high school student so my parents have to spend a portion of that for me). Because let's face it, people will still judge you no matter how much they say that looks don't matter. Even the slightest mention of my condition makes me feel so sad and helpless. And I give people the benefit of the doubt sometimes cause I'm sure it's all in good intention, but it just hurts. My character has pretty much changed and it just makes me sick because no matter how hard I try, how strict I follow a regimen, how much money spend, that nothing seems to work. I pretty much feel like a burden to my parents even because it's like they're wasting money on me. And whenever I talk about this sort of thing to somebody, nobody seems to understand the gravity of this sort of thing because they've never experienced it themselves.

There are moments where I'm just left to wonder if this will even get better at all. Yesterday was the first time where I legitimately thought about taking my life away. I locked myself in my room and got ready to just relieve myself of this suffering. But somehow I feel that there is still hope. And I need that hope as soon as possible. Because the last time I tried to remotely express how I felt, I was told that my acne will eventually disappear and that I was over-exaggerating my situation.
