I've been having daily suicidal thoughts since February, I'm not going to act on them but its just so tiring, and I'm at lost of what to do.I don't want to kill myself, I just want it all to be over and, I feel like can't tell my family, worred it might hurt them. 

I'm just so angry, at myself mostly, why me what have i done, i know it's wrong but i can help feel scared of what i might do.
Its every damn day too, no rest i can't even get out of bed sundays to attend the one thing i feel like helps.

I just want this to be over.
