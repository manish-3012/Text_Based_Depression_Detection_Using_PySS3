I don't want to kill myself, but I feel like I'm going to.I just want to know if I'm alone innthis feeling. I'm 34, married with two kids. I hate myself. My father shot himself in the mouth last year and it destroyed me, but I also feel a longing for that sense of completion that I hope comes with death. I guess I just want an end, but I don't want to abandon my children. I don't actually want to kill myself, but I feel like I want to die. I want to see my children grow up, yet I somehow have this feeling that it's not going to happen. Frankly, I fear that although I don't want to kill myself, I may actually do it someday. Every day it gets harder and harder to exist, and I think one day it's going to become too much for me to handle. I wonder if this is how my dad felt. Is this a normal part of depression, or am I seriously at risk?
