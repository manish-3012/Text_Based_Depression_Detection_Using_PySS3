Whatâ€™s Even the PointMy health insurance expires in half a year.  I wonder if I try to kill myself during that period if the docs will let me die since I canâ€™t foot the bill to recover.

The problem with â€œgetting helpâ€ is that the American mental healthcare system is barely functional.  I went to see a series of shrinks and they all blew me off and gave me the run around or tried to tell me all my problems are because of anxiety.  Then Corona hit and shattered any plans of getting better.

I was trying to get on welfare because of my issues but fat chance of that now.

Iâ€™m too high functioning for my own good.  Lets people conveniently ignore all the warning signs until I really do off myself.  Pretty much the only reason Iâ€™m alive right now is my family.

I feel like shit all the time and Iâ€™m tired of it.  People say â€œit gets better with timeâ€ but I can tell you from personal experience it only gets worse as you age.  Might as well put a bullet between my eyes.
