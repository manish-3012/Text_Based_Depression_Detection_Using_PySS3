The main reason not to die is the possibility that whatever process this is will have to start overAnd yet there is no clear indication about what it is we should be doing, or how we should live, other than be a good person and survive. 

If we are in some maturation process, there is nothing you can do but endure it, because the elucidation of its meaning or purpose is not indicated. The bulk of philosophy, spirituality, and religion is filling in the lacunae of what what it is exactly we're doing here. 

No divine agency conveys a life's calling or a true mission. All anyone has is: "hang tight, enjoy what you can, do a little good, and wait to die."
