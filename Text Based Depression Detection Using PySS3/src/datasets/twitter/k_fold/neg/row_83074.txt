I donâ€™t know what to doI am 15 years old. I have been thinking about dying since I barely even knew what death was. The past couple of years it has been the worst. School has just been rough not cause of the work load but because of how dumb I am I can talk to people very easily but when I do I screw  up and then when I try to fix it I screw up even more. Like I feel like my life has just gone down hill since I was a kid. every morning I wake up a different pice of me is gone. I have gotten grumpier and short tempered in the past couple years. I slowly feel myself slipping out of my family I feel like a burden on everyone I meet and have know. I just donâ€™t see any point in staying on this earth everyoneâ€™s life I have touched in anyway hasnâ€™t been in a good way. I just hate the way that I am. I feel like by just talking to people they immediately hate me. At this point I have had many opportunities to do it and all of them would have been clean no questions asked. And I donâ€™t see any of the people around me having a problem with it I am just one face waiting to be forgotten. 

Sorry about this poorly written paragraph it is late and I havenâ€™t slept much. I need advice to at least get through this year and I know my problems arenâ€™t as bad as some of yours and I am willing to help you guys I am here for you
