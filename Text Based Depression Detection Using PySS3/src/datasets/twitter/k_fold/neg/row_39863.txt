Hey guys...Iâ€™ve held in these thoughts for so long that I might as well just fucking spit it out already!!! I seriously cannot take it anymore, everyone and everything in my life just seems so pointless to me. Iâ€™ve always faked my joy and happiness just to make sure no one would notice anything wrong with me. I find it really hard to feel genuinely happy and pleasured anymore. Iâ€™m always in denial about the issues I go through, even with the ones that I am reluctant to trust. Iâ€™m so fucking worthless...

Honestly if I were to off myself right now, I wouldnâ€™t really understand why anybody would miss someone like me anyways...
