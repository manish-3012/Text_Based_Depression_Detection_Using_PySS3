Attempted today, no one to tell about it.I tried to jump off a roof today. It's my first attempt ever. I made my third note ever. I don't know if I'll attempt again.

I just don't have a person to talk to about it. It's been weighing on my chest. Don't know what much else to say. Gonna read through some posts on here now.
