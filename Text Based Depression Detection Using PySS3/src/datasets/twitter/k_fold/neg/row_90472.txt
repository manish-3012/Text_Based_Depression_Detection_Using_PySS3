13 years old and want to dieSo Iâ€™ll pretty much give you the story:

Iâ€™m 13 right now. When I was 11 I had few friends, was told by a counsellor I had depression. I tried to kill myself twice. When I was 12 I went to a different highschool to all my friends. I had no friends at that highschool, and I really hated it. In the second year of highschool, I left to go to the one my friends went to. I was really popular there and went out with friends a lot. Later in the year I stopped hanging out with the â€˜popularâ€™ people and more with people I liked. 
Now Iâ€™m in the third year. I have friends at school but never do anything social outside of school. 
I feel terrible. Iâ€™ve contemplated suicide so much and I feel like itâ€™s just a matter of time. 
My parents tried to get me to talk to a counsellor, after finding a website called â€˜lost all hopeâ€™ which lists suicide methods on my ipad. At the time, I was having an autism test done (I didnâ€™t end up having it) so they got me to talk to the counsellor handling that. The counsellor said it sounds like I have depression  I didnâ€™t trust her so I ended up lying and s forgot about it soon after. 
Nowadays, my parents and I have a terrible relationship. I slam the door a lot to take out my anger, and there are cracks in the wall. Iâ€™m a terrible son, but they are terrible parents too. 

A lot of people my age use depression like itâ€™s cool. Iâ€™ve never told anyone about mine because itâ€™s kind of embarrassing. 

Tl;dr: Tried to kill myself twice when I was younger. I have no social life outside of school and am hiding that I have depression from everyone I know. Parents and I have a pure hate relationship. 

Please point out a reason for me to live. So many people are against suicide but I donâ€™t see why, and I feel like hearing this reason might help.
