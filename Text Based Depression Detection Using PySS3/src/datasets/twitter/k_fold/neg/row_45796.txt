Having a tough time of things.At 19 I matriculated into an ivy league school, got sick halfway through my freshman year but managed to stick it out. Missed my sophomore year and had to have three major surgeries.  I was ready to get back, looking forward to returning to college.  On my 22nd birthday the girl I had been with throughout everything broke up with me, even though we were about to be going to school next door to each other. Now, back at school, all of my old friends have found their own groups and I can't seem to find my place; although I'm not sick anymore, the surgeries made it difficult to be a normal kid, and the weight I lost has really hurt my self esteem.  I don't think I would kill myself, mainly because I love my family a great deal. But I hate life right now and I'm running out of ideas to make it better.
