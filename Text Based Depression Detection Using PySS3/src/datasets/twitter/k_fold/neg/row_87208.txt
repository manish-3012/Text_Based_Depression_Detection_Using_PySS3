I'm not sure what to sayI want to die. I've struggled for 20 years with depression. I hate myself. I hate the choices I've made. I'm a horrible horrible human being. I've hurt people and lied to people. I never feel okay unless I'm talking to someone else. I want people to make me feel like everything is okay. 
I'm a therapist. I feel better helping other people. But no one actually knows about what's going on in me. Not my husband. Not my kids. Not my best friend. Not my family with whom I'm close. 
Who helps the helpers? Who listens to us? Who can I actually be honest with in my own life? 
I want someone to care. I want someone to actually hear me, to understand and feel my pain. I want someone to convince me that everything will be okay and that I'm not horrible despite my lack of perfection. I feel so vulnerable and isolated. I seek that reassurance out in others in secret. This has led to multiple affairs mostly because I just want to feel loved and heard. 
I hate myself. I'm a horrible person. I want so much to die. 
I'll put on a brace face and help others again today trying desperately to escape the pain that's burning in me.
