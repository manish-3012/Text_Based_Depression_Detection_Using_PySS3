The truth: Iâ€™m not alive I just existSome of us donâ€™t live the notebook; we live more than trilogy; more than a romantic comedic drama tragedy. Then thereâ€™s parts of us that cannot ever live at all. There are more words to the story than there are numbers in pi. 

My fear and how I was controlled and neglected - lead up to a lot of triumphs but not as many as rejected. The goals I dreamed have no more fire in them. I tried, and boy did I fail: subject to consequence vs chemicals vs heart vs no control.

I never moved out. I tried.
I never got him to fall in love with me. I tried.
I never got him to get clean, or a ring or even a child, he died. I tried.

But I never tried enough, so why try enough now? The truth is ugly but so very loud. My gut knew all along it was the end. I didnâ€™t even realize I was playing pretend. â€œYou will go on.â€ No I wonâ€™t.

For I am not alive anymore. I just exist. Thatâ€™s why.
