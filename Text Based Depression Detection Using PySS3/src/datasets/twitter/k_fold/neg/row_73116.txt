I'm took my dad's gun and I am going to drive somewhere far and end my lifeFirst thing. My dad might be a bit of an idiot. Why keep a gun in a house with someone who has tried to commit suicide twice? No lock or anything. Just in his closet. Or maybe he isn't an idiot, and put it there because he wants me to stop being such a burden.

I know I would like to stop being such a burden. My family tries so hard and I push them away. I feel lonely so much but it is good I push them away... or they would see how fucked up I am. 

I try to recover. I try to be normal and think normal and live normal... but it just... doesn't happen. I am not meant to be normal. I am not meant to be happy. Not meant to be alive. 

That sounded really depressing. I don't feel depressed right now. I feel happier than I.have been in a while knowing it is going to happen seriously this time. 

No one is going to spot me slitting my wrist and there will be no.liquid charcoal. It's just one bullet. Quick. And Easy. 

I graduated today(yesterday)

I have my mind made up and I am nervous but I feel relieved?
