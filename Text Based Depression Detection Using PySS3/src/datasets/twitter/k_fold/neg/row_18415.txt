Iâ€™m a 15 year old financial burden who makes her mom want to kill herself. How should I commit suicide?Hi. 

Im a 15 year old girl. Iâ€™m a sophomore in high school and Iâ€™ve been wanting to commit suicide since fifth grade. 

Iâ€™m overweight, after struggling with anorexia and bullimia  and having to put the burden of a 4000 dollar hospital bill on my working class mother. 

My parents divorced because of me, and my mother has to work all the time to support me financially. 

I do extra curriculars that require travel and 
money. 

My mother constantly cries about how shitty her life is, how we canâ€™t afford to do anything or go anywhere, and how the only thing she can buy for her self is food and beer. 

I have absolutely no friends, am seen as the weird and creepy one, and have such crippling anxiety that I eat in the bathroom.

I donâ€™t want to burden my poor mother anymore. Whatâ€™s the best way to kill myself with a 100% success rate and no hospital bills?
