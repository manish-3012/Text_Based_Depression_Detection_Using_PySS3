What's the point?I was hurt and abused by a former partner. I should have seen it coming. The red flags were there all along. I ignored them because I thought if I loved him enough, if I loved him the right way, everything would be okay. 

And now it's over, for my safety. Unfortunately my sanity is no long intact. It's been over a week and I just feel worse every day. I feel dead inside. Hopeless. Useless. I am a complete failure. 

I cant trust people or myself. I dont have the energy to heal from this, nor do I see a point. I'd rather just sleep forever and avoid dealing with this pain.
