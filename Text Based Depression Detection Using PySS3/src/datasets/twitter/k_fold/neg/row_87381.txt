Not all that important...It's been years since I've had any real internal reason to not kill myself.  I honestly can't remember any time when that's been the case.  Mostly I just don't do it because I feel guilty obsessing over how much it would hurt those around me.  Ultimately, I'm left to wonder how long guilt will be able to sustain me.  We're selfish creatures, when it comes right down to it, and if we don't have some internal motivating factor, then there's really no point when it comes right down to it.
