Today is my birthdayNow that Iâ€™ve passed the last of the good birthdays (21), thereâ€™s nothing to look forward to as the years pass. I ended up drinking by myself tonight because my friends are out of town. Iâ€™m living in a toxic household that I hate and my mind is consumed by my ocd thoughts and a lack of interest in anything. I know itâ€™s just a day out of the year, but god all I want for my birthday is to be happy for a day...
