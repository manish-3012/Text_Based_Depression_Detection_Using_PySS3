I dont always dream, but when i do, i commit suicideAt least twice a week. Same thing. Cinder block, rope, bridge. You get the picture. I'm really over life. All my issues are self inflicted; because of my character defects I'm unable to overcome them. I don't get pleasure out of anything anymore. I'm dead inside. Dual diagnosis--drug addiction and mental health issues. I'm about to be 35. I have no one in my life. I've been exiled. I've done nothing noteworthy in my life, nobody will give a shit if I was gone. I missed too many psychiatrist appointments and was removed from their scheduling. She used to tell, well there must be some hope because I keep showing up for appointments. Not anymore.
