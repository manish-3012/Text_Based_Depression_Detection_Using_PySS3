Randomly get Suicide thoughts and start cuttingI really don't understand it. I'm a happy and outgoing teenage boy. But when one thing pisses me off, I go crazy and start getting suicide thoughts. I don't want to sound like a brat, but whenever I'm not getting alot of attention, I feel worthless. Most of the cutting and suicidal thoughts came December when my 4 year crush turned me down. I got pretty close last night, and I'm worried I'm gonna do it tonight. Right now I'm not suicidal, but I'm worried something is gonna happen and piss me off. Please Help me.
