BPD &amp; PTSD arenâ€™t going to win so preparing to let go
I feel like the PTSD of being emotionally, physically and sexually abused when I was younger by my family and then again later on in my life, I could grow out of and let go of it but that emptiness and lack of love for life has never came back. The 10s of thousands of pounds of debt and the crippling loneliness as well as mental illness has eaten me far too long. 

I feel like now I can finally start letting go and get preparations done and this bizarrely has made me feel a glimpse of happiness I havenâ€™t had a long time knowing I wonâ€™t feel this pain anymore
Iâ€™m not going to let this win by making anymore years of my life miserable 
Donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting here, no one cares but this has made me slightly happy
