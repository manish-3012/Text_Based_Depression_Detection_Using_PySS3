I feel like I have an expiration dateSo for a really long time, like years, I feel like Iâ€™m just going to stop living at 19. Thereâ€™s no rhyme or reason to it, I just feel like thatâ€™s my time. 

People talk about how they can envision themselves at different points in their life(graduation, wedding, job, kids) but Iâ€™ve never been able to do that. The only thing I see is me walking across a college campus with books in my arm and my hair is in a ponytail and I have a backpack on. I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t really â€œseeâ€ myself past that point. Iâ€™ve told other people about it and Iâ€™ve gotten responses from same to seek help. I just donâ€™t know how I can make my mind think Iâ€™m going to live past 19. Iâ€™ve struggled with major depression and general anxiety for years(found out recently) but even when that stuff comes in waves the expectation date is always there. Iâ€™ve come close to attempting suicide before, didnâ€™t go through, but I donâ€™t know that I wonâ€™t just go and off myself. Usually I can ignore the general feeling like my time is running out but recently itâ€™s been in my thoughts a lot more 

The part that Iâ€™m kinda stuck on is that fact that I turn 19 this month. Iâ€™ve kinda started to get my life together(steady boyfriend, figuring out college, actually getting help for mental issues Iâ€™ve neglected) and I donâ€™t want my perception of my time to be a death sentence this following year. Basically I donâ€™t want to live this next year thinking Iâ€™m going to die. 

How do I get out of this mentality or how do I cope. Have other people had similar thoughts?
