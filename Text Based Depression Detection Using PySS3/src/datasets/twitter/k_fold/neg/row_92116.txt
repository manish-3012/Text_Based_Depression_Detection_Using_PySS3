I have very few reasons left to be here. Here's some to not.1) My year and a half long relationship just ended 
2) People.think im taking/lying about being suicidal. 
3) Family is splitting up
4) Sexual assault
5) School sucks

If anyone can talk?? At all??? Im so close. I want it to either go away or I'll make it go away. I'm in therapy. On meds (kinda) gone to my last resorts a few times (police and hospital)
