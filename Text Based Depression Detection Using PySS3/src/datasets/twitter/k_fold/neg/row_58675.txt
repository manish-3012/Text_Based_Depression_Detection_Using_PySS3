[M/18] I ruined my own life by being a lazy asshole and now I have no future and no reason to continue.I'm homeschooled. I take online classes that I'm supposed to do myself. For the past 8 years, I've been homeschooled, and have supposed to have been doing lessons every day. But instead, I sat on my ass every day on the computer, jerking off and playing video games without a care in the world, and now it's come back to bite me in the ass. I just turned 18, and only now am I realizing that there is no way I can catch up. Pretty soon all of my friends will be graduating high school and going off to college, but me? I have 8 fucking years to make up for. 

Unless I can kick my was into high gear and stop being so lazy (which won't happen) and maybe get into college by the time I'm 25, then I will be left behind as my friends go on to college with their whole lives ahead of them, including my crush and girl of my dreams who I will never be able to see because she'll be off in college with guys who aren't total deadbeats like me, even if I do ask her out and start dating her it won't matter because once she gets into college she'll have crowds of guys lining up to stick their dicks in her and I won't be able to do shit about it.

I threw my fucking life away just so I could play video games and watch dumbass youtube videos for 8 years straight. I have no future to speak of. All of my friends will abandon me and leave me in the dust and I'll still be here beating off and feeling sorry to myself and I will be alone forever. There is no more fucking point to going on. 

This is it. This is the end. I made my bed and now I have to fucking lie in it.
