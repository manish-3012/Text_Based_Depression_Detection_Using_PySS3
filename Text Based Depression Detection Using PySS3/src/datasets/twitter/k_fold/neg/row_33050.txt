My boyfriend committed suicide, and I think Im heading down the same road.My boyfriend of three years committed suicide about a month ago. His entire family and I were devastated. We never saw it coming. He was always happy and laughing and overall a fun person to be around. When he did it. I went into a deep depression. I was  still however was able to take care of my self. Last week I found out that Im pregnant with his child and just I broke down. I went even deeper into my depression. I just stopped caring about everything. I lost my job and had to move in with his parents. They were gracious enough to let me stay with them.  I don't what to do. I feel lost. I have been taking sleeping pills because I don't want to be awake. I just want to sleep through this horrible nightmare. I can't go to my parents, they disowned me after I started dating him.  

This pain that Im feeling is the most terrible emotion I've ever felt. I'm lost. I just want it to end. I can't go on living like this. I have suicidal thoughts almost everyday but I don't think that I could do it. I don't know what do.
