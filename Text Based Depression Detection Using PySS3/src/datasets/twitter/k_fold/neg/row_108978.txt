Going go trow my life away today.First off, i want to thank some people in this sub for helping me out last year. But i can't really endure it anymore.

I made a horrible decision and my mom unfortunaly had to pay for it. I feel very ashamed. I don't really want to talk more about that. But that's the main reason. 

Since i have no guns or something similar like that, my only choice will be to jump my self in front of a high speed bus, which i spent time studying the best way and time to do that. 

If i'm still here i will let you guys know, otherwise, see you guys in the other side (if there's any) peace.

Thanks for everything mom.
