What are we doing wrong that SO many of us are here?I just don't understand. 

For myself, there are no real situational causes. If anything, my life is better than it ever has been. I have a good family, a good husband, great children... finances are fine. Not much in the way of friends but I really think that's due to the depression and not the other way around. Over the past 5-6 years my life situation has steadily improved and yet each year feels more and more empty and pointless.

Why is that? Why does it seem to be the same for SO many people? What are we doing wrong in order to have a world full of people who are so unhappy?

Maybe I shouldn't be posting in SW... I have no plans to actually commit suicide, as I have little kids and do hold on to the hope that someday I can enjoy waking up and seeing them. I just wish, I guess, that I could go to sleep and skip again until that day. I'm so, SO tired. Physically, mentally, of everything. I just want to be done.
