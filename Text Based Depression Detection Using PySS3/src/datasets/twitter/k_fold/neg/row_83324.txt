I don't think I'll be missedI'm tired of pretending to be a good person. I'm not. I'm selfish and inconsiderate. If suicide is shellfish then I'm a crustyAsian (For context I'm overweight, a mouthbreather and sweat all the time. Fuck I can't even consider myself human most of the time. I'm repugnant). I'll just be known as that fucking scumbag idiot who caved in to his mental illness and did the cruel act of betraying anyone and everyone who ever loved him.  No one grieves for the wicked. I won't  deserve sympathy nor forgiveness nor deserve to be in anyones thoughts and I can live with that 

Well not really live but you know 

Damn it feels good to have this relevation
