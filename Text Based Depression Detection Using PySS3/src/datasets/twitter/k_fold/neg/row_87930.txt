The beautiful part about feeling Depressed and SuicidalThe beautiful part about feeling Depressed and Suicidal is the cold hard truth comes out. I was never really good at anything. I'm not really that cool or interesting of a person. I would never strive in anything I put my mind to. I'm such a burden, I'm so fucking worthless I hate myself. I've got nothing going for me, I don't expect anything good to happen to me. I'd be better off laid to rest. After 8 Electroconvulsive procedures which I think has amplified everything for the worse. I will never feel good about myself.
