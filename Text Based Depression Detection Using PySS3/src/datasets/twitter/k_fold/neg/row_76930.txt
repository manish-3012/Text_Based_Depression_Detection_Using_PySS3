iâ€™m scared of pain, not deathmobile so sorry for the format 

Iâ€™ll start off by saying that i donâ€™t encourage suicide or self harm in any aspect. im a 16 year old male and hereâ€™s my story. when i was in middle school my dad snapped on my brother and that made my life do a full 180. we went from having an amazing 2 story house to moving right back into an apartment (i live with a family of 5) all of the things in my childhood were just happy and jolly. but once i moves back into the apartment itâ€™s like that was tore away from me. i went into therapy because of my anger issues and how much i bottled up my feelings about my dad. it didnâ€™t help because every single day after therapy i would come home to my dad. the person that ruined my entire life. for the sake of my fingers weâ€™re gonna skip to my freshman year of highschool. i didnâ€™t even feel like myself anymore. my parents were going through the process of divorce and i was having breakdowns every once or twice a month. i was just so angry at everything and the position i was in. i quit basketball and that was something that even took me aback. i was so passionate about it in elementary and middle school but i just lost passion in it. my grades were absolutely terrible and i lost some friends. i stopped crying or even feeling anything. thatâ€™s when i started cutting. it was like a release for me. i finally felt something and just loved it. but of course i got caught. skip to my current year (sophomore). i havenâ€™t cried since last year. i lost my great grandpa who i was very close to and didnâ€™t even shed a tear. i had thoughts like â€œwell it was his time anywaysâ€ and â€œwish i could switch places with himâ€ which were pretty bad. iâ€™m very antisocial at school and extremely anxious. along with that, i hate the concept of school. i finally told my mom about my cutting and even about my overdose attempt when i was in freshman year. i honestly just want to fucking die. of course there are people that care about me but i just feel like if a person would rather be dead than alive then why try and force them to accept the fact that they are in a world they didnâ€™t want to be in to begin with. why not just let that person go and be free. waking up early as hell for school and having sleepless nights doesnâ€™t mix well at all. my teachers notice my depressing behavior and i donâ€™t even want to open up. i donâ€™t want to because they are mandated reporters or whatever. i canâ€™t open up because i donâ€™t want to be hospitalized. i want to just end it and off myself but iâ€™m afraid of pain. if i could swiftly take myself out of this hellhole that we call life i would but if i fail again then the side affects might hurt in the long run. i have people that care about me but i donâ€™t care about myself. what do i even do...
