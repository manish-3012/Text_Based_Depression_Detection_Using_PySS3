I can feel it coming soonToday is the day that I felt okay with suicide, like I'd be glad to do it just to get relief from everything in life.  I started planning how I would do it.  I started thinking about what I would say to everybody that might care.  I can feel myself slipping.  This is all I could think about today.  I'm scared more than ever.
