I love my daughter, but I canâ€™t keep pretending Iâ€™m not bad for herMy daughter is a perfect, beautiful healthy one year old. She loves me (30M) so damn much and the constant Dadadada screams warm my heart.

But Iâ€™m not meant for this. I should have stayed alone my whole life. I never should have joined the world.  At least my inevitable mental collapse would be a simple disappearance into obscurity rather than leaving something behind. I canâ€™t hold a job, I suffer from such severe anxiety it sometimes causes me to hallucinate. My little girl will lose me someday and I fear that day is coming sooner than Iâ€™d hoped. Iâ€™m lying in bed trying to get her to go to sleep and holding back tears.

Iâ€™m a failure, I always will be and my fiancÃ© (22), despite her love for me, would have been better off having never met me.

My mind races 24/7 to the point it physically exhausts me. It runs on so many tracks and so loudly that at itâ€™s best itâ€™s a dull roar, and at worst is an indecipherable screech. When I can comprehend my own thoughts theyâ€™re nothing but self loathing and second guessing. I have spent 30 years balling up my problems, shoving them down and hoping they would go away, but alas, no avail.

I yearn to be the person these two deserve, a functional and worthwhile provider that they can be proud of, and yet I find myself trapped in a place I hate, and without any job around that could hope to let us build the sort of savings weâ€™d need to go somewhere better. We live with my parents in one of the most rural shithole towns in the most rural shithole state.

Iâ€™m 30 years old, have no degrees and yet massive unpaid student loans (left college when she got pregnant, unplanned).  I also have massive medical debts and a credit rating in the 200s. Iâ€™m physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially broken and short of someone handing me about 200k straight cash I canâ€™t see a way out of this deep deep hole that my lifelong lack of insurance has caused. On top of that it makes the option of seeking help financially non viable.

I try so hard to be a good father, a good fiancÃ©, and good person. So much so that Iâ€™m a doormat, and have let people treat me like trash my whole life. Mostly because I think I deserve it, but also because my anxiety issues make me do it so I never run people out of my life, which is something Iâ€™ve went through before. I try too hard and it causes friction which leads to me sabotaging whatever relationship to snuff it out before I get hurt. Again. So much so that I did it to the woman I still think of as the one who got away.

I hurt, I struggle and I wish I could simply snap my fingers and either everything would resolve, or Iâ€™d simply stop existing. There is no rescue. No hope. When I did work I wished every day for some negligence based workplace accident to end me so my family could sue, fixing all of our problems.

I am not cut out for this world and I wish for nothing more than my daughter to have every opportunity. I wish because I canâ€™t provide. Such is life, a constant trail of disappointment and hardships.

Long read I know, Iâ€™m a pain in the ass.
