Why is suicide worse/more tragic than other deaths?Was reading an article about the Christchurch shooting that included the writer's personal experience with a friend committing suicide. They seemed to be weighting it as a greater loss than, say, losing someone to illness or old age. Death is death. Is it really worth ranking cause of death like that? For murder (like the shooting), absolutely. But when someone kills themselvesâ€¦I don't know, you could argue that someone dying of lung cancer from smoking has killed themselves. It's not particularly tragic. Just let people who want to die, die.
