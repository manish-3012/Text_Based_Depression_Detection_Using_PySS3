I don't want to be here anymore.I am trying to take legal action against some people for video taping me in the bathroom. I have a recording of people talking about this but there is a lot of static so I wanted my mom to pay someone to clear it up. Off the back she acted like it wouldn't be able to do that even though she doesn't know the price. She wanted me to pay for it. I am a minor still. 

Am I wrong for wanting her to financially support me in this? The people who did this to me are still running around while I am struggling with all types of mental health issues because of it. I just don't feel supported. I wish I could move out but I can't. I feel trapped here with someone who doesn't care about me. And it seems like the only way out is death.
