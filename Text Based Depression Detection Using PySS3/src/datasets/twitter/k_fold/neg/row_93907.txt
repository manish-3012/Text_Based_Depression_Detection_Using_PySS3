Does it ever get better? Do you truly get over people?I have a decent life. I work,i'm starting school soon,i have friends and a best friend that i'm lucky to have. 

I don't have much in teems of family. 

But at times i really feel sad,i feel like i don't belong and i fear i will never love again,or at least not in the way i did. 

3 years ago i met someone that changed my world completely,i was happy with her and it made me realize how life can be pleasant. Things didn't work out because she went back to her husband,which i learned about during the 3rd month of our relationship. 

I really loved this person,she was the one that i actually had alot of things in common with,i wanted to be with her and grow old and stupid with her. 

Ever since i have never loved anyone like i loved her. I had around 5 relationships since and they were all the same. 


This week has been particularly hard for me,i've hid in my room all week,skipping meals and avoiding my roommates,i just can't get her out of my mind and it's been 3 years already.

And all people say is "time heals all wounds"
