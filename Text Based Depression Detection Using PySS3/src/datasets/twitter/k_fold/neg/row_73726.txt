Never happy, never content, no way to get there. Waking up is too painful. It's another reminder that I never had a chance. At least I'd like to think I never had a chance. It is probably worse to think that at some point I could have made things different, but didn't. Either way, here I am, no choices, no options. Just an empty life. A waste. I hate myself in every way. I'm broke, have no family, my friends have either moved or drifted away. No college, no skills, nothing. Things wouldn't even be as bad if I at least had a hope of having some sort of connection. I don't. I'm male, but I'm transitioning. Unfortunately, I'm large and ugly. I will never love myself. I couldn't even hope for anyone to ever love me. No chance for love, no chance for success, no chance to not be miserable, alone, and full of self hate. Every day it gets worse. It's an irreversible path to ending myself. I want it to come faster. I don't want to wake up another day. 

This is hopeless.
