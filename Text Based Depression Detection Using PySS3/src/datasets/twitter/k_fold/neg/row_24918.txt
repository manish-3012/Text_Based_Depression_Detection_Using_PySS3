I have a story to share which I hope can help peopleI am a fifteen year old girl, and this weekend a boy in the year below me at school hung himself. A lot of my friends were particularly close to him, and on Friday in school the effect he had on everyone, even those, like me who didnâ€™t know him, was evident. 

His girlfriend was in hysterics, she could not believe what was happening, teachers were collapsing. It was a horrible atmosphere, however I can only imagine it barely compares to the thoughts that had been running through his head. 

My friends were crying all day, and his friends could barely walk. He was a popular, good looking boy with his whole life ahead of him. In the day of his suicide, he tried to seek help from school, counselling. 

I have not stopped thinking about him, and I can only imagine the devastating effect this has had on his family and local community, renowned for being close, particularly his 9 year old sister who found him. 

I want anyone who is esperiencing suicidal thoughts to please open up. I would never want any school community, family or friends to experience what mine has.
I understand how difficult it may be, having anxiety disorder myself. 

People are here to listen. People do care.

Suicide is not the answer.

Everyone has a place on this earth. 

Please stay strong, because I know u can do it, u can fight through these emotions, and I only wish this young boy had known this. 

Please stay strong, contact lifeline or a suicide hotline if u r on the verge, but stay strong.
