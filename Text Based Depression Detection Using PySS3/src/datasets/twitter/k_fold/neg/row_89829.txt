Part 2I stuck with it all after my last post in the end. That was eight days ago. For further context: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7b1khd/ten_years_later/

Since then I've just been feeling like complete shit. I can't sleep anymore; I've slept maybe 10 hours in a week and that's with medications helping me. 

I am in an ever-existing state of pain and depression. I kept going because my pets needed me. Last month someone poisoned and killed my cat. Yesterday someone ran over and killed my other cat. I rescued them from being drowned after they were born. Raised them by hand from a few weeks old and now they're gone too.

I just can't keep doing this. I need help. I've spoken to mental health services, crisis teams etc. It feels like nobody can or will help me. I'm sick of being alone. I'm fucking sick of being afraid to be happy. The fear of joy is truly the darkest captivity. 

Someone help me. Please. I'm begging you.
