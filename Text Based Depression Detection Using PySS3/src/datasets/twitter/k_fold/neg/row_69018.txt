29 [M] Lot to tellm a doctor (read: late replies) ethnicity: Indian; and if you already went through my posts you'll know that I'm not the usual kind you'll find online. 
I'm going through a lot right now and would like to have someone to share my thoughts with. Just something to cheer me up. I love dogs. Golden retriever is/was my spirit animal. 
Race/looks/age/sex is not an issue. 
I only have WhatsApp.

You'll have to guess or ask me :P (actually it's for security reasons)
