iâ€™m happy and iâ€™m sad at the same timeso a 5 month relationship just ended, it sounds bad but i was being emotionally abused and i always felt like killing myself. i recently started cutting and i canâ€™t stop myself. she forced and open relationship on me and i was too weak to stop it, i asked her time and time again to stop but she wouldnâ€™t, and i loved her too much to break up which led me to being emotionally abused, every time she would send nudes to another guy it would make me feel like absolute shit and made me depressed. iâ€™m happy cause iâ€™m not getting emotionally abused but i miss her so much. i think i might take all the pills in my medicine cabinet (stuff like adderall, melatonin, benadryl, advil etc...) so i guess this might be a goodbye.
