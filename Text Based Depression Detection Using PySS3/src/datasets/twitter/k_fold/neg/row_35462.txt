Suicidal ThoughtsI have 24 little red/orange pills sitting out in front of me. Generic wellbutrin. I don't know if it will be enough, but I can only hope. I could do it. no one would suspect a thing. I could do it and lay in bed and wait. I want to say goodbye to my loved ones, but i know i canâ€™t. I kissed my mom before i went into my room, i wonder if it will be the last. I donâ€™t know yet. I want to, but I donâ€™t know if I am strong enough. Maybe thats how I will go. Be strong.I have to be strong. I can do it. I need to do it. Iâ€™m so tired of being a burden on everyone. Especially dad. I know he hates me. I donâ€™t blame him. My past haunts me. EVERYDAY. i canâ€™t sleep at night. I canâ€™t stand being awake. I canâ€™t stand being alive. They say they love me, but how could they when I canâ€™t even love myself. I donâ€™t deserve love. I deserve pain and hate and death, and hell. Thatâ€™s what I deserve. I deserve to rot in hell. I canâ€™t even cut deep enough. what is wrong with me? What is wrong with me!I'm so useless, what's the point in being here. 21 and still living with my parents, not good in relationships, can't work or go to school because of anxiety. Im so fucking useless. I have an appointment with a new therapist on the 4th, but i can't tell her any of this... i can't be put into a psych ward, I can't have my family find out about these thought going through my head. I'm scared
