I'm really shy and introvert and my life sucks.The title says it all. I have never had much friends. I am not sociable. Nobody talks to me. I'm really alone. I see all those people on Facebook and Twitter who seem to have wonderful lives and I'm just sitting there, alone, and my life is dull and uninteresting.


Also, I'm ugly. I'm gay and I tried to go on Grindr (a gay dating mobile application). Some people told me flat out "you're ugly", most didn't even bother answering. And I am 18 years old and yet I am already starting to go bald. And I'm really short, only 1m62 (5 feet and 3 inches). That's really short for a male. I can't even grow a beard. I also have big anxiety issues.


I hate my life. It's unfair. All of this is unfair. Why me? Lately I've been thinking about committing suicide. But I'm really afraid to do it. I'm alone.
