15m, ego turned to shrapnel, I'm forced to explodeContext: I'm 15, from the UK. Haven't been in school for a couple years. No friends, no acquaintances. A lot of my family look at me with confusion, wondering how someone so young can be so sad and lonely. About a month ago I met the most amazing girl online. She lived about 60 miles away. We had similair interests, she was beautiful, she seemed into me. We met twice and kissed twice. I couldn't believe she was real. It felt like I'd been searching for her for the last 3 years.

Last Friday I tried to kill myself. Me and Emelia had an argument and I saw a breakup coming. The argument triggered a line of dominos. About 6 hours later (3am), I took a bunch of pills. I left the house and called an ambulance on myself. I got rushed to hospital and stayed there for about 12 hours attatched to a heart monitor. Heartbeat dropped a couple times.

About 2 hours after getting out of the hospital (4/5pm) me and Emelia spoke for a while, I didn't tell her about the attempt. She told me that her mother came in after school and discussed the negatives of long-distance relationships, and she listened. I doubt that her mom actually came in and did that, but I don't know if that's paranoia or the depression.

After the breakup, I was back to square one. I had never felt that bad. I didn't feel like I could ride the wave of heartbreak that follows for weeks after. It felt like the only thing that mattered was gone. All of the "I love you"s, the "I miss you"s, they were all fake. Part of me thinks "Fuck the bitch", but I can't help but miss her. It feels like I'll never find a girl I get along with as well as her.

I bury myself in research and fantasy, but when the computer's off and my head hits the pillow, I'm left thinking about what really matters, and what really hurts. Maybe that's why I'm so fucking sleep deprived. I want to die.
