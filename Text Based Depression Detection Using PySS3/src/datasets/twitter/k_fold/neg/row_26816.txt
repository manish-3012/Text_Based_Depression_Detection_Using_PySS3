My birthday will suck... againWell in a little less than a few weeks I will be turning 34 and I still have no one in my life to spend that day with. On top of it my grand mother was just buried this week. And my heart is heavy with losing her. She passed before I could make it to see her. Iâ€™m just devestated that I couldnâ€™t make it before she was gone.  She was very important to me and even though I knew it was going to happen I didnâ€™t think I wouldnâ€™t be able to make it before she was gone. The pain of losing someone like that is almost too much to bear without someone around. I just want someone to hold me for a while and allow me to just let it out and let go of the mental torment I have been in for the last few days. I almost feel like my time is drawing to a close and soon I will have nothing left and that fucking scares me. I feel like I will be homeless or dead soon. And no one will care not my parents nor the rest of my adoptive family. Anytime I mention Iâ€™m depressed my mother suggests locking me up in a mental institution god damn how can you put your kid through rehab for alcoholism and then continue to suggest that when they have been told by the rehab to be supportive and understanding.  Why? They donâ€™t care. They think pills fix everything even though itâ€™s been pointed out that is bullshit and dangerous thinking. I donâ€™t want pills. I just want out of this god forsaken hell hole that is my fucked up mind and shitty state that doesnâ€™t care about its people. I want to leave and never return. Stop the world I want to get off
