How come no one wants meGirls are the worst thing that ever existed, why do they waste your time leading you on, only to step all over your heart when you give it to them. I met this girl long ago, I thought she was the real deal. I liked her a lot, but I guess it was just a one way street. I thought she cared about me, but to her it seemed like we were never together. My heart is split and I can't take it anymore. I'm just gonna tie some rope, I can't handle this. I Gave her my whole heart, I guess she can keep it, I  don't need it anymore.
