If only i had a gunHello everyone, i am about to write down here what i have been saying in my head for so much time. I want to kill myself, and if i had a gun, i would be dead already. I am afraid of feeling pain before dying, thats why i need a gun tbh. I've also considered shocking myself with wires but you dont die instantly from that, do you ? I'm a 17 years old french guy that just dont feel the whole purpose of life. I feel like life is simply not for me, hapiness for me pretty much only depends on other humans, and i dont feel any of this 99,9% of the time. I dont understand what should i keep on staying alive when there are nothing that stops me from getting out of everything. I dont trust in any religions, death is only for me the fact of "not existing". Here's my question, why should i exist when i can simply not exist? Why should i keep on feeling pain when i could simply not exist ?
When i red of those posts about people having a lot of troubles in their lifes i felt like the problem a 17 yo guy is supposed to be nothing compared to them. But i mean here i am asking myself why i'm alive when i could be dead ? Lets admit i just gotta wait 5 years so i can finaly enjoy life or whatever. Why should i try waiting to enjoy when i can simply turn myself off forever. I think my brain is sick but i really mean it, i dont wanna exist anymore.

Thanks for ready this far tho.
