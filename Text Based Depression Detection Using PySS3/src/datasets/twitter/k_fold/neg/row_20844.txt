Turning 24 today. I think this year might be my last!Kinda depressed with it all - this life thing is a lot harder than I thought it would be!

I find myself crying to sleep every night and thinking about suicide quite often during the day. Has anyone had this? How have they tried to fix it?

Just feel like I need a friend who I wonâ€™t bore to death to be honest â˜¹ï¸
