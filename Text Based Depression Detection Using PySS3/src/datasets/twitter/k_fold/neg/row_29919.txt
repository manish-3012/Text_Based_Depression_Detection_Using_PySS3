Whatâ€™s the point in living?Iâ€™m just 18 and iâ€™m already tired of life, i feel like an old man just waiting for my turn to die.. I just canâ€™t handle life anymore itâ€™s boring and depressing. Lifeâ€™s just never been any good and iâ€™m just not sure if i wanna keep waiting for nothing anymore, iâ€™m tempted to just man up and end it. Iâ€™ve just had more than enough of all the loneliness and suffering..
