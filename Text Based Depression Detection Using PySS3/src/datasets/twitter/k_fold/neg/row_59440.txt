Seriously feel like I can't live any more, no one seems to understand my depression, please help [F/19]I've had mental health issues for about 5 years now but up till now I have always managed to cope. I had my heartbroken for the third time over Christmas and I seriously feel like I have come to my breaking point. I don't feel I can talk to my friends and family about it because the problem seems so stupid. Someone please help me.
