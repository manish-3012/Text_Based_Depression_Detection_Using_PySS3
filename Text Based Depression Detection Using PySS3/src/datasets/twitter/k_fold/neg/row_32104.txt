Writing â€˜thatâ€™ note latelyThe suicidal thoughts and attempts on my own life caused me to be extremely hateful and cynical to the people closest to me.

Recently one of those close people suggested to me that I should write it down and reflect upon it. This has pretty much turned into me writing notes for those closest to me for after I attempt suicide again, successfully this time. 

I never thought writing it down would help me, it only helps me prove how I feel and that Iâ€™m nothing but a burden upon others. I stopped talking to the girl I loved because I couldnâ€™t bear to have her or myself any more committed then we were. The feelings I currently have about myself and life are the worse Iâ€™ve had in recent memory and the only positive I see on the horizon is stopping myself from living.

So Iâ€™ve written my notes and the first chance I get when I have no other commitments to worry about, Im going to actually push the knife in this time around. I just thought Iâ€™d ask if anyone else has wrote â€˜thatâ€™ note and would like to share it with me.
