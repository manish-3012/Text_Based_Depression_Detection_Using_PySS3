For the greater goodIm a transgender woman. I have a child. My boys other mom lives with him in a very unsafe county for lgbt people (think the Wrong Turn movies), and refuses to live anywhere else besides her confederate family's house. The only way I can be in his life is if I move there, but its unfair to us all for me to lie about who I am. So I bought life insurance today. Now I have two years left to live.
