Might do it in a weekmoney issues + small but meaningful debts + depression affecting my work and my sleeping, general pointlessness of everything. I can't find any joy or motivation anywhere. Everything good feels guilty. Really overwhelmed by financial matters.    
I'm thinking how to do it and I think I'll do it in my favorite, public place and somehow mask it so no one saves me in time. I was thinking about taking sleeping pills.    
Before that I will sell everything I have and buy a ton of good food C: Mainly pizza
