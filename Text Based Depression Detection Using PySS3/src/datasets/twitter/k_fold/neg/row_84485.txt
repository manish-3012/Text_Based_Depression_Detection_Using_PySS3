Update: still wanna die. Still have no friends. Still hate my life. Atleast I can say I tried. I posted here about 2 months ago, and I still can't handle waking up in the morning to my shitty life with a shitty family and no friends and no future. I'm literally about to be homeless which is pretty much the end for me. So I guess I can say I gave it a try, not everyone can succeed, right?
