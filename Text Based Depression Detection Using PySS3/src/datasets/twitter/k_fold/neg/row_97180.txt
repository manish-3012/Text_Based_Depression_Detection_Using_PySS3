Dear Reddit.Someone, please. Give me three good reasons why I should stay here, going through each day like it's an act in a play that is a nightmare to have to witness. Give me three good reasons why I should keep smiling, keep pretending, lying through my teeth while everyone looks the other way. They don't care. So why should I?
