[Insert title here]Turned 20 recently. Depression and ADHD are really taking a toll. Iâ€™m currently a neet and have never had a job before. To get through everyday. I listen to music and play 1 specific video game, Iâ€™m slowly losing interest in music as there is only so much that it can wash out. Eleven years of this shit and Iâ€™m sick of it.

Iâ€™m kinda making it through I guess even though Iâ€™m only waking up to play this one game. Iâ€™m a liar and a faker so it helps keep convos and other things at a minimal to get through each day. Iâ€™m quite a creep too, but I live in an isolated area and rarely get out much. Itâ€™s for the sake of others I guess right.
