Really want to kill myself, but I can't even commit to doing thatI feel no real emotions anymore. I'm not even sad or angry, I'm just fucking empty. I hate every single aspect of my life. I have no empathy for anyone or anything and just don't care even when close friends tell me their problems. And I can't stand hanging out with my friends anymore. They're just so fucking boring and negative. My parent's relationship problems control my emotions. I spend all fucking day in my room, just refreshing the same pages over and over. I can't stop eating. I eat an amount so embarrasing that I can't even tell anyone. I'm so fucking alone and have never bothered to initiate anything because I'm so fucking disgusting. I'm literally so fucking fat and disgusting, but I can't pull myself to really care. All I look forward to is smoking weed and eating and sleeping and jerking off. I've lost interest in all of my passions. I can't stand work and don't want to go to school, where I'll probably just be trapped with the one manipulative friend who controls everything socially. I have no real idea what I'm doing with my life. I can't think of a single reason to live. I know "it'll get better" but I don't even care at this point. I'm gonna fucking kill myself.
