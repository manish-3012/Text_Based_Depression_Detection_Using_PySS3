I don't know what to do.I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. I've wanted to be a lawyer for so long and now I don't even wanna go to college. I don't want to live. I don't want to go on. I don't want to wake up early every morning like I do because I can't sleep normally. I don't wanna shake and cry and be alone. I don't wanna cry to my boyfriend about nothing because it is tiring for him. I don't wanna break down about nothing. I don't want to think about wanting to die. I don't want people telling me it'll get better one day. I want it to get better now. I have been suffering for so many years and I'm at my wits end. I'm tired of everything and I can't even see my future realistically. I wish I could just marry some rich guy and heavily medicate. I hate my life. I hate myself. I hate everything about living. I take my medicine, it is supposed to help me... it doesn't help enough. I wish it would all get better. I want it to all go away. Please. Please make it go away. I'm so tired. I'm 16. I shouldn't have to deal with this. Please. I want it to end.
