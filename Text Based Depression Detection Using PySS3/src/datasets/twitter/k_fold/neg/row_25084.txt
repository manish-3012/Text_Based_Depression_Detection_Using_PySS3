I don't like asking for help, but I need it.This is stupid but I feel like I have nowhere else to turn. I'm alone right now; my boyfriend works third shift. I had a panic attack and I've never felt so worthless and helpless in my life.

I lost my job, I lost my friends, my family is distant, my car may be dead and I just feel like I'm going nowhere and I am nothing. I don't want any more struggles, any more anxiety, any more fear. I want everything to just stop. I'm sick of crying, I'm sick of battling with myself, I'm sick of dragging other people through my shit. I feel like I do more harm than good.

I'm shaking now; I don't know if I just need someone to talk to or what but I am losing it, losing the will to live. 

It doesn't mean anything but ever since I was a kid I always had this feeling that my life would end at 21 or 22. I am 22 now, is it my time?

I feel so small. Help?
