I don't want to be alive anymore, no one should have to feel like this.I'm tired of living. I'm tired of failing to meet other people's expectations wether that's my parents, my support workers , my therapists etc, I'm tired of being too "fat" or "ugly" to be in a relationship. I feel like a complete and utter failure. I went out with my parents last night and we went out to get food and I actually managed to keep it all together, and then i get home and f*** it all up by having an anxiety based meltdown and worrying that we spent too much on our night out and other things. My mum said that I was ungrateful and that it was unfair of me to comment about worrying that we had spent too much , even though I was grateful that they bought me food and a drink, saying thank you at the time multiple times. No one in my family really understands how OCD works and it does kind of upset me when they think that I'm being deliberately rude towards them when it's not my intention at all, it is literally like there's another person (not in a hallucogenic way) putting the words in my mouth and making me say them.  I also feel like untill I try and commit suicide no one will actually realize quite how much I am struggling and I feel like it's sad that sometimes people need to be at their sickest around other people for them to see that they're struggling. Lastly , I feel like everyone else thinks I'm a weak feeble person for getting upset so easily , but really it's just because when I'm already in an anxious state of mind someone could literally make one little comment and it will send me into tears .
