Thoughts on lifeEver since I started smoking weed Iâ€™ve turned my vision on life, I think itâ€™s pretty dark and nihilistic, almost hopeless at times. It seems like the only motivation for me is money, just because I can travel and buy the things I like, but even that doesnâ€™t motivate me sometimes. I often think about crypto currencies and how I want to become an early millionaire just to avoid working and the social interactions involving that, and sometimes I feel like thatâ€™s the only aspiration I have, which I feel is kind of depressing but at the same time comforting.
