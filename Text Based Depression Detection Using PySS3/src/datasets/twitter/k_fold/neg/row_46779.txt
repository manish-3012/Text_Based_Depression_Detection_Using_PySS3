Holy fucking shit I'm depressedNot gonna kill myself so please prioritize everyone else. I'm just venting.

I have ups and downs, and right now I'm on one hell of a downer. I usually use drugs to hold me together, but I've been warned by my flatmates that I have to stop or they'll contact the police. It doesn't negatively impact my life, my grades are good, socially I'm good. I'm usually just content with how things are. They keep me stable.

Before I'd have said that I wasn't an addict because I didn't need the drugs, but now I think I am. I need them to stop my fucked up brain from falling apart. I've had a really shitty past and it's so fucking hard to put that behind me. 

Imagine a really beat up house, and there's a guy tirelessly trying to maintain it so it doesn't fall down. When that guy isn't there the house is just slowly falling apart piece by piece. 

Took a break from writing this to go and have a cigarette, saw my mate who's doing well with his alcohol problem. He seems so much happier, which cheered me up. I'm feeling much better now.
