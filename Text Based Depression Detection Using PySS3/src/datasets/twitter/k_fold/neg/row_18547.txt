Someone in /r/legaladvice might need some help.I hope this is not breaking any rules. If it is, let me know and I will delete the post.

I found this thread in /r/legaladvice: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3bw0fy/can_a_gun_dealer_deny_selling_a_gun/

OP is asking if a gun seller can refuse to sell a gun to someone who he thinks is suicidal. OP also has a post from a couple of days ago about severe depression. I linked him some of the resources I found here but in general I don't know what else I could do. So I thought I would post here.
