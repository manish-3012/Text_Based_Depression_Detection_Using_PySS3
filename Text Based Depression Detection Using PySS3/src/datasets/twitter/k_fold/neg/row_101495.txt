Good friend has been suicidal off and on for a year or so, offers ultimatum and I don't know how to help himIn essence the title sums it up.

Longer story, I just got a text from him after talking a bit about how he has been feeling apathetic and lethargic, and we and our friends have been hanging out but he says it hasn't been getting any better for him and he still is in a lot of pain.

He has been in multiple relationships during his depression and suicidal periods, and recently ended one.

Anyway I finally came here for help because I got a text.

"RutabagaSchmidt, I like you.  You're a nice guy and only person really trying. So I'll give you a heads up.  That script I asked your help with (he asked if he could send me an email testing a script, I figured it had something to do with all this but didn't press anything by asking him) is a part of some plans I made for myself Saturday.  Not normal people plans.  And since I like you, I'll present a deal.  If you can convince me to call off my plans, I'll stop it. By Saturday."

So it's Wednesday and I don't know what to do.  I am religious and I have been careful to not like try to convert him or anything but I did end up recently bringing it up because I really am at a loss.  We've been hanging out, we and our group of friends get together to play SSB and MtG and we regularly do stuff online when our work schedules don't allow us to hang out. 

Please help, I just don't know what to do.
