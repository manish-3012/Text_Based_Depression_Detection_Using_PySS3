Thinking about deathIâ€™ve been thinking a lot about death, and it scares me, but it seems like one way out.
I want to do a lot of things
And maybe Iâ€™ll regret not doing those things
But who cares in the end?
Thereâ€™s always a loss of potential, and weâ€™ve learned to live with that.
Maybe it ill be the same with me.
