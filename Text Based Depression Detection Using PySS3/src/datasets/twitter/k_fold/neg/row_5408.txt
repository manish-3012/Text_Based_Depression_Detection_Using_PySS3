Trapped...Reading a lot of posts on this sub I see so many people in such pain and I guess my story isn't going to be anything new here but I definitely have the same feelings.. I'm a 4th year university student with diagnosed OCD, depression, and anxiety but I just haven't taken care of myself and now am struggling with substance abuse issues. I have so much to be grateful for but I just hate myself and can't seem to see beyond my depression, and anymore I feel like my mind is a prison. I feel like I'm trapped in a body that isn't mine and I just can't believe what I have become. I really don't even know what I want out of posting here , I just feel so alone in this fight and I had to get some thoughts out of my head. Not sure if this will really be read but I guess I just wanted somebody to hear me for once..
