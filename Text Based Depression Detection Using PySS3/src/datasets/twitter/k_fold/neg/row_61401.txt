NightmaresI am going through a lot of shit right now.
Worst thing currently is a break up, and I don't know how to deal with it. It happened alot and I don't want to go in detail about it. I am currently in a psychiatry again, cause I went crazy and broke into her house. Whenever I sleep I wake up totally wet and shaking and I can remember every single nightmare I have.
Depressed.
Desperate.
Suicidal.

I don't know how to live my life anymore. And I lied to my therapist, so that I can get outta here. I prepared my plans on commiting suicide. Slow and painless with a lethal dose of nembutal.

I am fighting every single day. Not for reason to survive, but a reason to live a happy life.

I am just posting this to get this off my chest.
Thank you dear all people on this subreddit.

Best regards,
Leiskorn
