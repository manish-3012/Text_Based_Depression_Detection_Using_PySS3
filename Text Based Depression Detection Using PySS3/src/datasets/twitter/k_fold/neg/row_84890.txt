Iâ€™m so invisible, I canâ€™t even see myself anymore.Iâ€™m the person that gives the last of all I have because I know what it is like to have nothing. Iâ€™ll drop whatever I am doing to help another. Iâ€™ve been stolen from, beat on, used, time and time again. Iâ€™ve tried so hard to keep a positive mind and constantly make changes that are possible but I am at the end of everything. I canâ€™t do it anymore. Nothing is ever good enough, nothing is ever enough, no matter what I do or how hard I try nobody sees me, especially for who I truly am. Iâ€™m the pushover that will lend you my last few dollars that is bill Money, to not be paid back, then when I ask to be paid back Iâ€™m a bitch. Itâ€™s not just with one person, itâ€™s been SO many people. I truly feel like Iâ€™m here as a punching bag and provider to be disposed of. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m becoming numb again. I have made so many changes to try and better myself and my life but the fact is, Iâ€™m stuck. Financially in ruins because of other people. My mom used my identity the day I turned 18 and wrecked my credit before I knew what credit was. I had to have back surgery due to neglect as a child and am seen as a liability so jobs are hard to come by and of course with shit credit college is out of the question. I tried for loans and grants, itâ€™s just not happening for me. I donâ€™t understand why. I take so much pride in being a good person since I know so many shitty people. Iâ€™ve saved for years for it to be stolen, twice. Therefore, I find myself saving just to get afraid of it being stolen again which is stupid but I do it subconsciously. Since my nephew was born I have been there for him since day one, to the point I canâ€™t get him to stop calling me Mom. Itâ€™s a really fucked up situation and yesterday just really knocked me down hard. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I canâ€™t take the abuse. Mentally or physically anymore. I canâ€™t afford to leave this house and all I do is work, of course it has to be side jobs for whatever amount because again, liability issues apparently. Tons of applications out and nothing happens. When it does, it doesnâ€™t. Last night I went out and drove around for hours just debating on whether or not to go off a mountain side and end it. Somehow, I ended up back at Hell house. I want to die because I know Iâ€™ll always be stuck. Itâ€™s been years of the same shit, with me constantly trying and to just keep going. Nobody around me cares enough about me to see how broken down I am. It almost takes energy to force a smile anymore. I have nobody, I have nothing, I have nowhere. My eyes can barely stay open from crying and Iâ€™m tired of this feeling. Caring so much abt everyone else to not have one mother fucker even give a shit enough about me to notice Iâ€™m in so much pain. They maybe see if and just donâ€™t care because well, they cause it. After my mom charged at me and threw me down, I just had this epiphany and realized nothing will matter or change regardless of what I do or how hard I try. All over miscommunication, sometimes I wish I would strike back. I never do, though. I donâ€™t know why I always just take the hits. I am fucking 30 years old and all time has shown me is nothing I do will help. Ever. Nobody else cares so I figured I would say my goodbyes here on Reddit. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s in store for this world but I wish you all peace, safety, and happiness. Maybe my soul will protect some of you from something bad happening as thatâ€™s been my life goal, to help people. I canâ€™t accomplish anything in life so maybe in death I can. Goodbye.
