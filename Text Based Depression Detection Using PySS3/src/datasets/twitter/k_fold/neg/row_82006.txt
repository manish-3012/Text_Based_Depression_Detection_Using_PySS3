I don't give importance to what I sayDoes anybody here can say something like "I do not really like mi life. If I can end it, I would do it", not giving it importance?

It's a bad example. But, it's the best  example that I can imagine. Because I know it's something really strange  that you can heard someone stranger telling  you his intentions of dieying. 

But you can imagine  a specific situation, with a trustworthy  person. And the matter about suicide only show up, and then, you say something like that, "I don't like my life" or "I really want to dissapeared because I don't tolerate this society".

That person will  care about you.
That's ia my case. I can hurt myself or don't caring of my body by a hurt, or anything. 
I really don't think a lot of the consequences of my actions  for all I do myself.  Because I really don't care.

And I don't want to sound a bad person or anything, but when someone  worries about me (when I don't doing it), it's strange. It is a waste of time.
