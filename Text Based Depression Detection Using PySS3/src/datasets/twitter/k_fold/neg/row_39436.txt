Idk If I can do this anymoreSo basically I have a 6 month old with a mother of 2. Whom I was basically unattracted to to begin with. I was just wanting some short term companionship. Other 2 kids are spoiled rotten. Couldn't go through with an abortion(morally). I feel like I'm walking on eggshells in this relationship. I feel like I can never fully address how I feel to her without stomach rotting fear of losing my kid or a violent fight which has happened before. I literally live day to day with regret and anxiety. My only serenity comes from going to sleep, waking up and going to work and having my own time. I feel like a complete piece of shit for feeling this way. I try to love her and the other kids but don't feel like I'm ever getting anywhere. (manifesting attraction towards her)(being a father figure to her kids) I am living in a double life it feels like sometimes. I unconditionally love my kid but don't know how much longer I can do this. If we do separate she won't let me see my kid just like the last to father's of her kids. I'm afraid I might do something I don't want to do or that isn't of my character. I've never been one to give up but as the days progress I feel like suicide is being more of a clearer option. I've been wanting to talk to someone about all this bit haven't had the motivation or balls to until now. Wtf do I do?
