Class Shecule ChangeI had my schedule for next quarter planned out. Now one of them is changing times and conflicts COMPLETELY with another class and idk what to do now.

I'm a senior next year in university and I have a lot of classes to do to finish on time so I can actually go to grad school. I'm so scared and I just wanna kill myself because there's nothing I can do now to finish on time.
