I donâ€™t know if the things that kept me holding on are even relevant anymoreI used to think that my death would hurt my parents so much, and that was a strong force to keep me trying for a long time.

But I just turned 22 and Iâ€™m living with them, causing them so much pain with my mental health and panic attacks and physical health problems.

I love my mom. And I trust her when she says she loves me more than anything. But I just know that seeing me in so much pain must make her regret having me at least a little.

My parents wanted two children. And their first pregnancy was a miscarriage, but maybe if that baby was born (along with my brother), I wouldnâ€™t have ever had to happen. Or they could have adopted instead of having me they could have placed their love in someone who could deserve it and give back and not struggle like me.

My dad admitted to me that he thinks he was a bad father. If he know how I turned out, I donâ€™t think he would have made the same choice.

Iâ€™m so sorry they put so much into me. So much love, and patience, and finances into something that turning out like me. I love them and I try, but perhaps if I get out now, they can put all their resources and Love into a foster or adopted child who deserves it more and can fulfill them.

Iâ€™m so sorry for every pain I caused in their life. I wish they could have had someone better.

I wish I could be better. Iâ€™m trying, but i think I was a mistake. I think Iâ€™m parents regret.
