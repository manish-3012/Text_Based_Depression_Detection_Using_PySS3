I feel empty and alone.By all accounts I should be happy and grateful for my life. But I think about dying multiple times a day. Either through accident or suicide. I feel like I have no control over any of the aspects in my life. I don't feel like I get to chose what I do with it. I feel trapped in this bullshit just going through motions because they're considered something everyone should be doing. I feel hallowed out inside. Over the years it's like whatever inside me was good has just decayed. I feel that I've also become extremely bitter towards the world, wishing bad things on strangers for ridiculous things like a bad glance. I feel like my life is constantly hindered by my inability to perform up to anyone's standards. I'm constantly letting my wife down. I don't feel like a good role model for my daughter either. I feel like they would both be better off if I took a huge life insurance policy out on myself and just slit my own throat. At least then I could provide for them. Did I mention I'm 22?
