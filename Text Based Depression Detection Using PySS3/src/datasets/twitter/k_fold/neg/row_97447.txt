I think I need someone to talk toI don't think I can actually kill myself, but I wish I could.

I just want to suddenly snap. Now there are too many things that make me hold on to life. I wish I didn't care, since I'm really just hurting everyone around me, so I'm obviously not really "caring."

It's just so painful to face up to my failures. I wish that I never existed.
