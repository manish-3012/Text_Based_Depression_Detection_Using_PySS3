I just wanted to say the truth, somewhere.It's been three long years. 

As incredibly as it is, I remember few of my childhood. Faces, people, situations, it is all gone, or at least most of it. The only things I remember are those that have been marked into my skull, my hysteric mother screaming and tossing things out of the window, my psychologically abusive grandparents (which raised me alongside my mother), and those moments of my child self, sitting down in my bedroom floor, in a corner, talking to some dusty plushy dogs while I cried silently, repeating once and over again that they had helped me more than anyone else, being my only friends and listeners, as well as the only witness of everything. I was overall a good child, always had the best grades of the class, had a good hygiene, and was really obedient; but my family held high standards for me. They thought of me as someone that had to be good at everything and live up for their expectations, either in looks, smarts, or personality. I never thought much of it, and lived anxious of being unable to do everything they wanted. I had prizes in oratory and sports, was liked among teachers, learned how to write and read from an early age, as well as to speak a foreign language; but the truth for most of my childhood was a phrase I once said as a small kid, and remains until today: "There isn't a single day in this house in which I don't cry".

In secondary school, I was physically abused and bullied by my classmates, and later on, blackmailed and sexually harassed by whom I believed was my best, and only, friend. This, alongside my grandmother's scoldings about my "lack of guts", and the anxiety I built trough my childhood, resulted in me completely closing to people, and slowly but steady, loosing the few self esteem I used to have. My grades went down, problems in home went up. I still talked to stuffed animals and toys to calm myself down after the constant fights, but also started talking to myself, and fearing everyone. I never talked to anyone about what was happening, and always behaved the same around others, because I didn't trusted them; after all, my family was likely to punish and scold me for whatever problem I had, and the only person I opened up to, used that to blackmail me. This is the first one I'm telling any of this, to anyone. Soon enough my anxiety grew to the point of paranoia, I started locking and blocking my doors with furniture, shutting my windows and curtains, and even creating improvised mechanisms to alert me if anyone tried to enter while I slept. I was scared there were cameras on any photo of my room or my stuffed animals, or someone watching me wherever I went, hiding on my room or just plainly invisible, but watching. I started talking to this "watching being", yelling at it whenever I was alone in my home, begging in tears for it to leave me alone. I would always sleep with my head looking towards the door, never next to a window, hiding under piles of sheets, and always cornered in some sort, as that would leave me vision to all my room; closed doors from my closet were also mandatory, as I tried to seal them with fabric ribbons/thongs or belts. I still deal with many of this fears today, many years after, even when knowing they are plainly irrational.

Later on I would try to take back my life, but ended up taking extreme ideologies that would either deprive me from sleep for months, or make me over sleep. I went from trying to fill my schedule to keep me busy to do absolutely nothing. Neither of those worked. As time went by I sank into a worrying depression, to the point that **even** my family started to get worried. I would not laugh nor smile, and was generally apathetic towards others. I stopped doing anything I liked, I stopped talking to people, and would live making self-depreciating comments regarding my lack of usefulness, or my constant desire to die. So far I have written about 10 suicide letters, some which I keep on my phone in case I get to do it someday, and others I have destroyed in fear of my mother finding out. I generally hate myself and my life, even though im economically relaxed. I hate that even though I can  overall excel in anything with minimum effort, I am unable to bring myself to like anything, enjoy anything, or even try harder. Nothing brings me joy anymore, and each day that passes I realize that I start to think more and more about suicide. Many days IÂ´ve had impulses to throw myself off the window, walk into the highway, repeatedly hit my head with a wall until I pass out, hang myself with the laundry rope, shoot myself, stab myself, overdose, or simply wish to not wake up next time I sleep. I don't know what has been keeping me away from that, either those really wholesome youtube comments on songs to cope with depression, the idea of never eating a hot pizza while playing D&amp;D again, or maybe how traumatic would be for my sister to see her older sibling hanging from the piÃ±ata pulley in the front door when she comes back from school. And to be fair, I like the idea of being alive. I like this little pleasures that I feel once or twice in a month, a cup of hot chocolate when my mind is not overwhelming me, the smile of my far living brother when I see him talking with such enthusiasm  about the future of mankind; or my own, unreachable desires. I think of myself of someone that never really grew up, that is still a dreamer, that is still amazed by simple things as rain or snow, and that wants to love things, wants to love life and be better, that never ceases to be amazed by learning new and little things, and that really, deep down, really desires to become a scientist, to try and do something for this race. **I am still here**, my wishes and hopes are still here, but I feel how they are slowly being taken away by anxiety and self hate, how depression is winning. 

I would love to go back on time and hug my 8 year old self, tell her that she is loved, that someone cares, and to please hang on, please, hang on to your dreams. And even today I try, I try to imagine myself finally doing what I want, being who I want, and it brings tears to my eyes. So many obstacles, so many possibilites I have let slide because all my problems. And yet, this little spark is still in here, keeping me alive, telling me to hand on. 

I don't know what will happen to me, but for anyone that has come this far, whatever you are going trough, please, you too, hang on. You are loved, you are cared for, you are necessary. 

**I love you**. 

Even if you think you don't think you need it, even if you don't know me. I love you for being human, I love you for trying to seek for a breath, I love you for being alive, I love you for having come this far. That you are is enough for me to love you. Please, for yourself, for your true self, without so many problems and complications, for your dreams, for your aspirations, for what you once were or will be, please, look yourself in the mirror and say it to yourself: I, too, love you.
