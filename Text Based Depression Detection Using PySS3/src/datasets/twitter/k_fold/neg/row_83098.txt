The need to outlive your narcissistic parentI was just thinking about my plan to commit suicide in the future and  i thought to myself the only thing i had to wait for is my dog to pass away first and then it everything would be easy,after that i realized that there would still be people alive that have done nothing but ruin my life,i don't want to die before my parents if i won't know that none of them will get the news that i died and that they wouldn't be able to talk about me like they knew me,i just want to be remembered by my friends and the people that i met a couple times,this thought terrifies me now,will i have to live until they die and wait after that to finally do it? i just wish i could disappear and start a new life somewhere where no one would be able to know where i went or what happened,even if it means abandoning people i like,i'm just so confused and scared,being forced is much more terrifying that dying,i don't want that
