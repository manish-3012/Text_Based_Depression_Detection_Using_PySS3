I thought about it for a while and now..For like a month iam thinking about suicide. I put a belt around my neck but didn't push the chair and afterwards I became depressed unable to eat for 2 weeks. I finally sorted out my feelings and after a month it came back stronger due to various events and i might actually do it for real this time. I have no self esteem, no confidence, I consider myself boring useless and I feel like iam only used by people else Noone cares about me. No matter what anyone says it doesn't help. I had only one sided loves just like now and my heart is being torn apart every single day and it's aching and hurts a lot. Before asking just confess and move on its not that easy. Already confessed already got rejected and I just can't move on, even if I try to cut the contact she will find a way to do so and wants me to solve her every problem and be there to her, iam special to her but not special enough to be in a relationship. I try and help everyone with huge success while wearing the strong, everything is fine rely on me mask but iam at my limits, Iam certain now that i can't find happiness and I will never find it and never achieve it. My surrounding and friends are finding or already found happiness and I couldn't do it in 10 years even once. The only reason iam not hanging myself right now is bcos my mum is sleeping a few rooms away. But once she's away or at work I seriously might do it without a second thought. Before that happens please someone seriously help me. I am here crying unable to eat or drink.
