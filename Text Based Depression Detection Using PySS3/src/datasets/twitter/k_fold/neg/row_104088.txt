Worthless.I have been thinking about suicide every day since about last year's start of winter since that was when I realized that I'm too dense for this whole college/university thing, went and failed all my classes because I couldn't grasp the required mathematics and logical thinking required for my computer science classes. Now, that's a lie, I did pass my philosophy exam (not really sure why it was included in the curriculum) but that was only because I raised my hand during the lectures and asked the professor things to question his statements and what not, which usually spawned more discussions throughout the class and maybe he liked that and that's why he took pity on me on my exam and let me pass (which I barely did).
  
After I was officially dismissed from university I started to look for a job, I found one and worked there for minimum wage for about five months until I finally had enough. The job itself wasn't that hard, I actually liked making fast food, cleaning dishes, preparing materials/toppings, ordering them and drinks/alcoholic beverages. But the way the counter was set up meant that you had to socialize with the customers, always be friendly and all smiles, spearhead the conversations and, well, I'm just no good at that, I have never been and I never will and frankly I don't even want to. It is too mentally exhausting and not exhausting in a good way like after a long run of work out. What's the point of developing a skill that you'll never be good at anyway?
  
So I quit that job and haven't been able to find a job after that, hell I'd be happy if I could just find some dry routine cubicle work as a data entry asshole where I wouldn't have to interact with anybody at all but it seems like every fucking job in this country requires you to:
  
* Have a driver's licence
  
* Speak Russian as well because about 23% of the populace are of Russian descent, a left over from being part of the USSR
  
* Be physically strong
  
* Have a bullshit degree in something
  
* Have prior work experience
  
I have none of this shit and it's tiring, infuriating and it's driving me ever so much closer to this mental edge after which there's no returning, a point, where you're beyond it, the idea of suicide becomes the only, and/or, the best solution.
  
Right now I'm fine (*hah*) when it comes to having a roof over my head and sustenance in my stomach because I'm living with my grandfather and I help him out by doing things wherever they need doing but I can't go on like this indefinitely. My father's constantly calling me and asking me if I've been looking for a job and telling me *"You should stop looking and waiting for applications that need CEOs/Managers and what not!"*, which is obviously what I am doing because I am so alpha and self-confident that I can lead and manage people and socialize so easily as evident by all the cool clubs I've funded and managed in my teenage years and all the girlfriends I have had! (*The opposite of the last sentence is actually true, because you know, sarcasm.*)
  
I don't really feel like writing anymore, I fucking hate myself for not being able to do anything because I'm so socially, physically and mentally defective and am feeling that I'm pretty much beyond that edge and have been so for over a month, the only reason I haven't been acting upon my obsession of suicide is that I'm formulating a method that is quick, not too gruesome, with a high enough success rate and not too expensive and turns out I'm too fucking stupid to even figure this out.
