I'm broken &amp; I'm Sorry.I feel like the other half of me simply just walked away. I feel like the other half of me doesn't care or matter anymore. I don't know if this is even worth it to keep on trying to make someone fall in love with me. What's the point? 

All my life I was only searching for love, what I hoped and expected to be love. However what is there left? I have nothing. I don't have a family, they hate me. I don't have a relationship because I messed it up and she hates me so much as well. 

What's the point? What do I have left? 

When I can give everything that I am, that I was to this world and still be met with brokenness. I have nothing, I'm a sinner and God can judge me. I just want to die because there's nothing on this earth that can really make me feel any different than how I feel now. 

Why do I deserve love? I feel like I simply don't. That's okay. They always said self-love and self-care was the most important thing. Maybe this is my version of self-love and self-care. To finally end all this pain that is my life. I love myself that much that I'm willing to do it. And maybe, just maybe. I can finally find love on the other side, death. Death is my love.
