If there is a god, he doesnâ€™t care about me nor if I commit suicide.I wasnâ€™t one of his â€œchosen onesâ€ Ive done horrible things and have sinned in ways that are unfathomable to most people. This leaves me to believe I am not chosen by him and he has no problem throwing me in hell because of what Iâ€™ve done.
