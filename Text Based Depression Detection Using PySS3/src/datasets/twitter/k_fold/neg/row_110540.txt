wrote a noteI spent hours today drafting a suicide note. Years of medication, therapy, support from family all this work, all this patience, all the promise. Undone. I put on the bravest face for my siblings and fall apart all the time in front of my mother so there's a major lack of congruency in what they see/hear from me the last year or so I appear clingy and manipulative to my family. I've isolated myself I'm completely on my own now that they've lost patience. I've internalized the role of the toxic family member that everyone needs to leave but can't because that would be immoral cause I'm "suicidal" again after being "fine". Flip-flopping when it's convenient. I've blocked all their numbers to not suck them in then face the backlash of "being fine". I attempted suicide 38 days ago, no one knows this. I've gained weight since, I haven't maintained my appearance as usual. I pull my hat down to my eyes when I leave the house in the evening. My siblings seeing me in this state (again) would most definitely show that my problems and shortcomings are very real, but what does validating this do for any of us now? They've seen this before and it did hurt them, they have their own problems it's merely a brief realization for them and deep down they already know I'm troubled. I've already achieved distance from them now I just want to end this for all of us. It would be such a relief. In only a few weeks my objective has warped from desperately surviving to realizing my death. If I come through this they'll come down on me harder than ever for basically surviving. If I die, well it wasn't unexpected. I want to die now I can't face overcoming another downward spiral. I had my chance and I'm out of time
