I just got thrown of mental care for smoking weedI've been on sick leave for 3 months because of anxiety, and I got told today that it wont be lengthened because i tested positive for cannabis. They expect me to go to the work agency on monday and begin looking for work even if they know I am not able to work because of my anxiety. 

Today I feel absolutely shit and i just want to die as I know there is no way out. I had a panic attack when I met with the doctor and he asked me if I wanted to be admitted to the psych ward. I refused and he said they might take me in for LVM (Law of care of addicts) even if my cannabis use is negligible (2ish grams per month, then a 3-4 week break before i buy any more).

My anxiety has skyrocketed and I have tried taking my emergency medication but it didn't help, I even took a double dose of it. All that happened is that I fell asleep for a few hour and woke up feeling just the same.

I could just take the whole pack of my emergency medication (benzodiazepine 5mg pills) and be done with it, but I don't want my mom, who I live it, to be the one who finds me. She wouldn't be able to handle the fact that I died. I have no idea what to do as I'm no longer getting any help.
