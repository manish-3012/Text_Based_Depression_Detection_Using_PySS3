Life goes on.I remembered who I was again last week. Down the self hate rabbit hole again. Life is boring but at least the internet gives me great content for my sadistic brain. I am so close to 21, so my plan has always been to get super cross faded as much as possible until I just jump out a window. I wish I could be a ghost for one last high to see how people react to my death. If anyone wants to chat for once I'm kinda in the mood; we can circlejerk about how life gets better or about people's reaction to Kobe's death
