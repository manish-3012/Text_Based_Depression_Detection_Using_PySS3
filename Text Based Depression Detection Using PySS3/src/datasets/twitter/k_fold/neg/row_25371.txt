I'll never amount to anythingI hate being the physically inferior gender and knowing that if anyone wanted to hurt me, I couldn't do anything about it. I hate being so ugly and talentless. I know I'll never amount to anything. I know that nobody cares about me, they only pretend to when my mental health affects my appearance because they're ashamed of being seen with me. I look like shit.

 I see no point in living anymore, because even if mental health improves, I'm still a horrible person for reasons I'd rather not disclose. I'm still hideous and unlikeable. I'll probably get stuck with a job I hate because I'm too stupid to do something worthwhile. I'll spend a third of my life doing something I hate, and the world is already falling apart, and has been for a long time. I don't matter, and there's no point in living if I'm just going to be wasting time for the rest of it.
