Wish My Family Forgot MeThereâ€™s only 2 things keeping me in this prison; 
(1) the fear of hell 
(2) devastation from my family 


I just wish there was a way they could forget; I hate how I have to suffer so many more years because  of this . I wish I could know that my family will be alright after I die and I can sleep forever; unfortunately Iâ€™ll never know and have to suffer.
