StrugglingHi,

I am supposed to go home tomorrow after staying with some older friends. They asked me to come and stay after my community lost a 16year old to suicide.  This news tipped me over the edge after a rough time lately. I ended up in Psych emergency for self harm, ODing and suicidal thoughts. The next night I tried to go out to drink and self harm. The night after I did drink, more than you should when on valium and anti depressants and slept with someone.

I feel like a shit human who fucks up all the time. I feel like all I do is hurt and worry the people around me and they would be better off if I vanished. I create a vortex of drama that pushes those I love away from me for good. Being around me is a form of self harm for others. I consistently make poor and damaging choices. 

I have been on anti depressants and anti anxiety meds for almost a year. I have seen multiple counsellors over the last five years and am now seeing a therapist. People keep telling me to talk to my therapist. The truth is, why? Yes it helps. But it won't fix me magically.

These two kind friends took me in and have been stressed, worried and overwhelmed by my mental illness.  They need space to breathe and I love them for that.

But I am going to a flat filled with people struggling with mental health, with the guy I slept with who does not want to be with someone who self harms, and where it would be all to easy to shut my door and vanish.

Please help me to stay visible just a while longer. I know I can't give up yet, but I am exhausted. People keep telling me to breathe. But over 21000 breaths a day that feels so overwhelming right now

I have friends I love. A new job I will adore. A potential new lover. Children I want to see grow. Lots to live for, to see happen. I need to hold on a tiny bit longer and my grip is slipping.

Can you guys lend a hand?
