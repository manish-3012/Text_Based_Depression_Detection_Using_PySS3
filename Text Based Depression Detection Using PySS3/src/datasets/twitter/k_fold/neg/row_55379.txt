Become very apathetic in the past year.Hi!

Twenty years old. Young, you don't have to remind me. People do all the time, haha.

These past years have been very well to me. I have soared in my studies to the point of gaining work in my industry before having graduated college. Family's fine. I'm happy in my work; very passionate. 

Through my entire life I've been extremely anxious. Middle school, high school, college... everything's been tightly strung. I've wanted to die in the past for those reasons but stress has kept me through it; no time to think about it. 


Now, I've reached a point of certainty of success. There's no doubt I'll flying higher through the years to come if I keep the same effort I've had to this point. Everything's become unwound but I guess my mind hasn't.


People (friends and peers) have come to respect me and love me. I try my best to be positive and nice through all situations, and found myself close to a lot of people. Far more than my inner introvert would have guessed. 


I'm finding some odd peace that I "made it". and don't want to stick around to see the rest. Why would I? I'm feeling okay with that work being wasted to get here. This specific point is quite literally all I've been fighting to get to the past eight years.

Everything is starting to come in. I've been really out of it lately. People have been starting to pull me aside and ask what's wrong one-by-one.


The only thing making me really hesitate is the countless that'd be really, *really* hurt if I died. Though I'm unsure how much longer that'll keep me onboard.


Feels odd asking about this at all. I don't have any apparent external forces or dread pulling me out of it. But I'm feeling pretty damn sure that an attempt will be made after I complete a promised favour mid-April. Hm.


Thanks for taking the time to read!
