Fantasies about killing myselfI had depression for 5 years, but I was never suicidal (although I thought about suicide, I just knew I could never do it). I met this awesome guy and to make it short, he broke up with me after a year of relationship (it was our second and final breakup). Anyway, I thought I was coping with this whole situation quite well, until I realized I'm thinking about killing myself for the first time in my life. Not thinking, planning it. Buying a gun and shooting myself. Therapy doesn't do much, because I'm not depressed, I'm just miserable. And the only thing that can help me is talking to this guy. I thought about asking him something stupid like "hey want to save a life? just talk to me for like 5 minutes, please." I was fantasizing about sending him a text, waiting for an hour, then shooting myself when he ignores it (I didn't really try to contact him after we broke up, stalk him or something like that). 
ps. Please don't tell me "go on with your life" or something like that, I fucking waited for a year to feel better, I was working, going out with my friends, tried being with other guys, I had a therapist, and in the end of the day, I still couldn't find a single happy thought to put me to sleep. "Going on with my life" or whatever it means is not an option for me.
