I give up.I am ready to do it. Universe, you win. 

My mother has been abusing me. She throws shoes at me for existing. I am a human kickball. I get pushed around. I am ignored. I hate the holidays. I never get anything. The only toys I have are the ones found abandoned in the streets. My cousins are spoiled. I'm the only one no one remembers. I've never had a real birthday. I've never had holidays. I am severely bullied. I'm done. When I told my mother she said "Don't expect anyone to show up to your funeral." I told her last night.
