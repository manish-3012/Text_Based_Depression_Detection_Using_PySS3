what nowi don't know what to do i think about dying all the time and i've been planning something for a year and i really want to do it as soon as i can. i know i'm never going to be the best at anything or very smart or talented and i don't want to keep going i know i could go through college and have a good career and everything but. what's the point, though? if it's just gonna be like me being mediocre at everything and trying to fit into a world that's so skeptical and hateful towards me as a trans (non-binary) person.. i caught myself before i put myself in a dangerous situation yesterday and it felt. like i was ready to go through with it. i don't know why i'm posting here if there's nothing to say or if i'll probably just give up before i do anything though. it just hurts and if i don't do anything soon i'm sorry to worry you but i don't know what else to do. this is better than worrying my friends and family, which sounds bad but i'm not a good person so i guess that's fitting? haha. thanks for reading this, i appreciate it
