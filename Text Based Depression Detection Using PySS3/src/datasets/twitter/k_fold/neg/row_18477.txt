I want to be doneIâ€™m on meds. I thought they were working..
I have a therapist. I stopped seeing him because it got too expensive..
I know the helplines and avenues to be hospitalized . I just donâ€™t have enough want to go through that humiliation again.
I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore to feel this. Iâ€™m tired of feeling so insignificant and alone.
But Iâ€™m too depressed and shy to actually go anywhere and make friends or reach out.
I feel like I have nothing left in me to fight for.
