Iâ€™m struggling.Iâ€™m struggling to write this let alone what to think. 

I donâ€™t have a bad life but have struggled with mental health issues for years and there is a history of suicide and depression in my family. 

Since covid started Iâ€™ve been working from home in a really stressful job and the lack of interpersonal relationships has affected me somewhat. Iâ€™m usually quite an outgoing guy and like to chat to people but Iâ€™ve not been able to in the last 9 months.

I canâ€™t really see my friends either and when I try to speak to my wife about my work or feelings I get shut down in stupid ways. I know she cares for me but Iâ€™m not getting the caring or observant ear I thought I would have.  

Iâ€™m at a loss. Thereâ€™s no one I can speak to who can understand what Iâ€™m going through in work or life. Itâ€™s too complicated for me to write in a single post what I do and how I need to act at work. And I seemingly donâ€™t have anyone to connect with at home to work it through with. 

If thereâ€™s anyone out there. Lend a hand.
