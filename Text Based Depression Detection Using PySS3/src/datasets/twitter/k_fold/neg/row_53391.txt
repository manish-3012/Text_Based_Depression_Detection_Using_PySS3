Afraid to die. Afraid to carry on. Just want to stop.I don't know what to do any more. I've been homeless for months and I don't have a job. My "Friends"are all disappearing or ignoring my literal cries for help. My mum doesn't care about me and I hate her for doing this to me. My dad just makes me feel shittier every time i speak to him. The doctor system is broken and serves only to make me feel worse.

I'm still insanely hung up on my ex even though she caused so much insecurity in myself in the time we were together. I miss her so much and wish I could hold her every moment of the day and I'm not even certain how much i mattered to her any more. But her name is permanently scarred onto my body and I'm constantly fighting a losing battle to stop self harming. I've lost so much weight and wasted away so much money and destroyed who i thought i was.

I need others to help me get out of this hole but I'm just losing everyone I speak to now. i feel like the whole world is working against me, and i'm either poorly faking smiles to get by, or  falling apart and hoping i will die tomorrow. I'm so tired of thinking about jumping, i just want it to be done, but the high places are so far from here, and I'm often too anxious and unmotivated to even move towardsâ€‹ ending this even though it's all i want.

I'm afraid of being sent back to the mental ward. I'm afraid of all my ptsd shit. I'm afraid of myself. Of not being good enough. Of doing something stupid. Of making my sorry excuse for a life even worse. I just want it all to stop.

This might pass in a few days, and then I'll be able to fake it again for a week. But I'm so scared thinking of the next time it will come back. What if next time i don't hesitate. What if the time after that i raise my middle finger to the world. What if this time, tomorrow, or Thursday, i finally give up.

And even scarier right now: what if i don't.
