I messed up my life twice, might as well end itIt all started last year when I got into college. Took an engineering program and it went well till I just addicted into playing video games. This messed up my studies and by second semester I failed. 

I told my parents engineering wasn't for me and I went with architecture ( I actually enjoy the drafting part). But not even first semester I'm already falling apart. I felt so depressed and destroyed that I don't know what to tell my family and relatives. 

The only thing that's keeping me alive right now is that it's almost Christmas and I don't want them to have a depressing Christmas Day. Also my mom and dad is in a different country and I never seen them for almost a year. The thought of my family losing me through suicide is something I also can't imagine to think.

Right now I'm only waiting for after Christmas to end my life and a way to do it painlessly. Also probably to talk to some of my friends I never talk to in a little while.
