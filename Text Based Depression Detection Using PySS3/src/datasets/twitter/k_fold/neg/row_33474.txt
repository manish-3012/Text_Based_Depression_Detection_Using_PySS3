My worst fearSo I've battled with depression and mental illness all my life, but that isn't the reason I'm posting.
My greatest fear and shame is enuresis, which is basically wetting the bed. And I'm 20.
I grew up with my mother constantly crying and hitting me out of frustration, and while I know it wasn't something I could control, it has always been something that has troubled me, and something I've never been able to disclose to my councillors.
So basically I'm asking how I should go about disclosing this, preferably not in my will.
