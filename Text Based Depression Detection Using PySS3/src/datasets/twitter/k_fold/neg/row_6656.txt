Girlfriend of 1 year and my everything left me..I know 1 year. WOW SO MUCH TO CRY AND BE DEPRESSED ABOUT. I loved this girl since Day 1. She was my first for sex, as was I. She was my first long term relationship. Everything was going good.  


I'm 18 and she's 17. She was amazing.. She was everything I could have ever of asked for.. We've done everything together.. She helped me get my life back on track. Had her Dad help me get my car up and running, motivated me to go to school and graduate, she showed me how to love and trust again. She had the softest skin.. She was gorgeous in my eyes. And most importantly was her attitude... she always had a beautiful smile no matter if it was fake for that day.. She gave me life when I needed it most..  


I almost OD'd, hung myself, drove into oncoming traffic.. She was there. Every little bit of sadness I felt, she fixed it with kisses and custom therapy done by her. 

  
Ever since I was a kid and understood Spanish, my dad would always say "Don't be sad, never show emotion for anyone or anything. You're a man and men don't cry." Every since then I don't recount my feelings with anyone but sometimes I would with this girl.. Some days I would forget how lucky I am to have her and I didn't talk to her about my feelings.. She gave me the best she could do, as I did her with my fucked up situation. I tried talking but eventually pushed her away, due to my silence, my lack of opening up to her...  


My biggest mistake.. asking for nudes.. she didn't like that and now she's gone.  


Nicole, if you're reading this after I'm gone. I'm sorry.
