BlinkingI'm 35 years old and my life finally seems on track. Good things are happening, I have amazing friends, work is going well with new opportunities on the horizon, I'm taking better care of myself...and then it hits me out of nowhere. That old familiar tightness in my chest, feelings of despair and hopelessness. That insatiable void inside of me that's devouring every happy or positive piece of my world. And suddenly I would do anything to make the pain stop. 

I go to a Dr, I take the medicine I need, I practice self-care, I do my best to cultivate a balanced life, I know all the tricks to keep this from happening...and it still happens. Right now I'm writing this to distract me from making a bad decision. It's not that I want to die, I just want to stop hurting. It's going on 23 years now and I've had enough of it. In the last 5 years things got so much better and the pain went away for the most part. But when it occasionally pops up, like tonight, it's like getting the wind knocked out of you with a side of whiplash.

When my head and heart clear I'm left wondering if I'm just going to not make it through the next time. Presumably I have decades ahead of me, meaning hundreds of more depressive incidents. Someday am I give up and end it? I hate thinking that I could hurt all the people who care about me. They're my favorite people in the world I don't want to put them through that. I should write some letters to each of them for just in case.

Thanks reddit for letting me do this free write, I feel a little better.
