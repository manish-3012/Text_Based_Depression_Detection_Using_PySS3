I find myself considering suicide againI had been doing better the last few years not really thinking about it, I started snowing pot which seemed to help quite a bit but recently I was diagnosed with Celiac and since then it seems to give me headaches.

I am just depressed again and will lay in bed thinking about suicide and how wonderful death would be, everyday I'm just sad, nothing really makes me happy, I used to have a dog which made me happy but I had to give her away and now have no chance of getting another one

I'm 26 years old and I've never had a relationship, never even been on a date, but to be honest I don't know I would want to, I'm not attracted to men or women, which also makes me very sad since that means I will be alone forever 

My ei just ran out and I will have to look for a job again soon which makes me consider suicide even more, I hate going out in public and having to go out everyday is a nightmare for me


I keep thinking I will either hang myself or jump off the cliff near me

I just want it over
