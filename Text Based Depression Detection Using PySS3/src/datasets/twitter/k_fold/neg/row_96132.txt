I feel fine during the day, I really do. But when night comes, without fail I just feel like a worthless piece of shit.I interact with friends and colleagues every day, and during the day iâ€™m motivated and I feel awesome. But every night without fail I just feel like iâ€™m worthless. I spend most nights driving around listening to music and crying. I feel like a fucking pussy for even considering I may have depression, I mean I feel fine during the day, and have a good life. Iâ€™m in university and my family loves me. 

I almost tried to kill myself two nights ago. I was driving and had this uncontrollable urge to just do anything to hurt myself. To fucking FEEL something.

Ive half assed everything in my life. I donâ€™t even know who I am. I donâ€™t know why iâ€™m at university. I donâ€™t know why iâ€™m still alive. I have noone to talk to because everyone assumes iâ€™m some strong, independent man with his life in order. I am, during the day. Why is it that when the moon comes out I feel this other side of me. 

My dadâ€™s a physician. Ive contemplated asking him for antidepressants but I donâ€™t think iâ€™m depressed.... i just think I get extreme waves of melancholy at night. I donâ€™t know
