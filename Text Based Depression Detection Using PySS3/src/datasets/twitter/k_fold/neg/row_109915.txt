I feel like I should be happy.After a year of searching I found a good paying job, my relationship of five years is getting stable, I've been losing weight at a healthy rate, and I'm just starting college this semester. I feel like all of this should make me happy, but honestly I'm miserable. I feel like I don't really have a place in this world, nor do I feel like anything I do will make a difference. I don't want to die but I feel like I should stop existing all together. Has anyone felt like this before, because I am really scared of how I am feeling. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.
