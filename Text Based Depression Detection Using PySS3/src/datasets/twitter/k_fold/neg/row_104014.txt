Having an abortion made me realise how meaningless life isI don't feel as though there is any inherent meaning to life.  
And I think all meaning that people try to assign to life comes from a pretty egoistic and material place. Of course, in order to continue living in this material world (who really knows what happens when we die) we do need ego... but I feel as though people let ego blind them into thinking life has more meaning than it actually does.  


I have been having to make a conscious effort to find excuse after excuse to keep trying ever since I fell into a deep, dark hole back in 2014. I was faced with a breakdown of a toxic relationship and the trauma of being forced into terminating a pregnancy because of both circumstances and the guilt of burdening someone who didn't want a child. So I experienced first-hand how meaningless life actually is, and I tried to fill that void with reasons to try so that my experience and trauma wasn't in vain. But ultimately, I couldn't find any real good reason as to why I would have to experience such a trauma if the person I was unfortunate enough to have been involved with didn't have such a selfish disposition.   


I tried to think along the lines of "I had to make that sacrifice so that my life could be less painful"... which is true. But finding reasons to continue living as someone who has no dependents takes a lot more effort than if I had someone else to live for.

So, for the last 6 years, every day has been an inner monologue of trying to self-soothe, knowing that society's versions of success are completely egoistic and shallow... and ultimately pointless and not worth pursuing. The only reason that I can figure people stick around is because they have dependents. People have children, vulnerable friends, elderly parents, disabled siblings, terminally ill spouses... and generally just people who would be traumatised by their passing.  


I can see how, though, if someone didn't have dependents or anybody who would be severely effected by their death... how it could be very easy to just give up. And people do convince themselves that people don't care or would be better off without them all the time... I myself am not so naive to think that nobody would care and so one of the few things keeping me around is this guilt that leaving would hurt someone.  


I feel rather hollow and terrible and even guiltier when I stick around purely out of guilt... because it feels like I'm blaming others for my internal suffering. So the only thing that soothes this problem of feeling pointless is to paint/create visual art *purely* for the personal enjoyment of it. 

I think the human condition is just a egoistic illusion, and we are wired to want to create to stave off death. We create humans through pregnancy, and every other useless and destructive thing we've encumbered not only the planet but our own lives with... and if we find no reason to create, the drive doesn't leave and thus causes pain. 

So my personal solution for this is to create in a way that is just for me, and for whoever may enjoy it, and hope that staves off the feelings of guilt. I don't know how long it will work for, but I imagine if I can keep my ego in check and practice my art with meditation I could live long enough to die of natural causes and not hurt anybody with my own screaming ego.
