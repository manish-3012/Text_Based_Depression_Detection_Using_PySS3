Went to the hospital with pain and still left with pain I'm 20 years old so therefore doctors think I'm "fine" and "normal." Blood pressure of 160/84 is normal? Really? I haven't been able to eat, I haven't been able to drink much water either, I feel so dehydrated. Constant head pain, abdominal pain, chills, nausea and the hospital did nothing for me. I'm declared as normal. Walked home still in pain after the hospital visit.

Doctors don't even give a shit about you.

I'm done.
