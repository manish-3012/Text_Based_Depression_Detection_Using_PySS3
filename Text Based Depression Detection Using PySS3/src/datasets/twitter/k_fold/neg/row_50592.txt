my parents love me, and i'm a shitty sonmy parents shouldn't have had a child like me. I've done it all; almost every bad thing in the book I've done, I should've been thrown out by them I should've been disowned BUT THEY STILL FUCKING LOVE ME HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW CAN THEY. HOW CAN THEY STILL LOOK AT ME AND SAY I LOVE YOU SON, HOW CAN THEY DO THAT; HOW CAN THEY DESPITE ALL THE EVIL THINGS I'VE HOW MUCH LOVE TO THEY HAVE THEY PULLED ME OUT THE DEPTHS OF HELL THEY'VE GIVEN ME EVERYTHING AND I SPIT IN THEIR FACE.

FUCK I HATE IT. I hate how they manage to love me so much because I'm not worth a fraction of a percentage of the love they give me. I wanted to kill myself, I still do. I wish I was a better son to my parents because they're really the best. They love me with every fibre of their being and still there's more love.

I should've gone to America where I could've bought a gun, and I wish I shot myself.
