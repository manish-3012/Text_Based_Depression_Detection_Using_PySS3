3 hoursThat's how long I have before work ends and I'm going home to a loaded gun. I'm gonna send a couple apology texts just before I leave work to try and finalize it. I've posted here before but this time I'm using my main account because fuck it. If she texts me one hurtful thing before then, I'll just leave work early. I'm broken and I'll never be fixed, I'm always gonna want to die and suicide is inevitable. I don't want to go to hell, I just want to start over. I want a mind that isn't constantly tearing itself apart. I wish someone would just tell me that it's okay and not to be scared, because I'm scared. But I'm getting it done one way or another.
