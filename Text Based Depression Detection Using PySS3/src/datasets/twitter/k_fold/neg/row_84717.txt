It doesn't even matterAll I want to do is die. I tried to commit suicide less than 3 months ago and couldn't do it because I'm a coward. How can I die if I can't even commit to it. The world is so shit. I don't want to keep living for others - keeping up with this stupid act, stupid facade that I'm okay. I never asked to be fucking born, so why can't I just fucking die already! So many times I could've died, but noooo I'm still here!!! I hope I can go through with it tomorrow.
