I need help.Throwaway account. 

I don't really know what to say so I'll rant. I cry frequently I hate every moment I spend alone with myself. I'm a fucking grown ass man who can't handle the real world. I'm too afraid to live the way I would like. I have negative money which constantly stresses me out. My monetary situation hardly ever seems to improve. I'm so exhausted and angry from struggling to get ahead. I'm isolated yet surrounded. I'm consumed with hate for myself and the world around me but at the same time I love the world and humanity so much. I want to talk to someone. I want someone to tell me I'll get through this but I don't want someone to lie to me. I feel like peeling the god damn skin off of my face and riping off my fingernails. Pleas help me. I don't know how you can . I hate so much yet love so much. It's too confusing and I can't handle it. I don't want to get out of bead and go to work tommorrow. I would rather just kill myself. But I wont. Not tonight. Maybe another night. I'm scared to die. I'm scared of myself. It's like living in a room with someone who you know wants to murder you. I want to be institutionalized but I don't want it on my record. God damn what do I fucking do.
