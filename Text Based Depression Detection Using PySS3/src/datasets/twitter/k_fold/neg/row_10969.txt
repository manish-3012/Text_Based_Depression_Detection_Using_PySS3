Itâ€™s just boringI just want to go to sleep forever.  I would never genuinely kill myself because I wouldnâ€™t ever put someone through the pain of finding my body or the after math but sometimes I think imagine if I got into a car crash or whatever I know itâ€™s stupid 

I also hate opening up to people because I feel paranoid then that they will judge me or because theyâ€™ve heard my inner thoughts. 

I used to be so positive and happy and had such a zest for life and now I just cry all the time and feel tired
