Multiple sclerosis, cluster headaches, and fatigueJust posting this here as well then getting a shower, I just posted for advice in /r/Clusterheads, but I'm gonna quote it here too, since it's a bigger community here and I'm really desperate for help. Cluster headaches are their own monster and I'm not going to go into them in this post, but if you know them you'll know their nickname and if you don't, well, I'd suggest not reading into them too much if you're easily upset.

Anyway yeah this:

&gt; Don't think I've ever made a post like this before so sorry if it comes across as a bit self-involved in wording.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a 5 year ECH sufferer and a while after my first attacks started in 2013, I developed comorbid multiple sclerosis - CH and MS diagnosed in 2015 and 2014 respectively. My initial MS flare up is probably to thank for the neurologists giving my headaches the proper scrutiny. My first two years were total hell, and the last three haven't exactly been purgatory either - same old story etc, you all know.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I'm just wondering. I'm used to getting my life together between cycles, as much as I can. I normally get one around this time of year, and I think the shadows have started, which means I'm likely to go in soon. I'm just not ready. My fatigue levels in regards to MS got absolutely destroyed over summer. My quality of life's completely fell apart. I'm finding myself more and more not wanting to see family or my girlfriend or anyone. My girlfriend especially is a recently qualified ICU nurse and I just can't bear the idea that after work she wouldn't be able to switch off.
&gt; 
&gt; I know I have depression (fucking obviously though tell me who here doesn't), but I've made an attempt when I was a teenager and ever since have been deathly against suicide. So much so that I can't even joke about it. But the simple fact is it's becoming hard to see any logical reasons as to why it wouldn't be better and more moral to leave.
&gt; 
&gt; I've met some seriously strong people who suffer this kind of shit and they're still going. If you've had something similar and you've got it sussed what was it that helped?
