So tiredWhen you're so tired of life that you've spent the last year just going through the motions so you can at least save up enough money so your family doesn't have to be burdened with a funeral bill.

If I'm lucky I'll have enough by the end of the year to cover the bare minimum.

Though a lot of me wishes I would have just been shot dead the two times I was held up at work last year.

It's so fucking funny too because I'm always commended on how I never broke down about it and just holding back the urge to reply with "well when you've always wanted to end it the thought of someone else doing it for you is kinda relieving even if it doesn't get to happen" but staying quiet because you can't just come out and say stuff like that. Like, surprise, who would've thought a depressed, suicidal piece of trash like me wouldn't care if I was taken out from this world one way or another.
