I can't be a part of this world anymore. For 17 years I worked as an A/C repairman. I hated the job and even more I hated the customers. People are just horrible to be around. I was so burned out on the job, and dealing with people, last year I parked my van at work and told them I quit. I didn't realize that after 17 years of people treating my like shit and being unable to stand up for myself due to company policies, that I had developed a mental illness. I spent an entire year only leaving my home to buy food and other basic supplies. When I try to interact with people, I get this overwhelming feeling of hate and depression. Just the sound of another person's voice is enough to set me off. When I'm around other people I'm so depressed. I'm only happy when I'm alone. I feel better when I can just sit by myself and when it's been weeks since I've spoken any words, that's when I'm at peace with myself.  

I'm out of money and won't be able to work a job to make more. There's no where I can get to where I would be able to just be by myself. The human race is something I don't want to be a part of. 

I don't know why I came here. It's not like any of you can say anything to me to fix my problems. No one could come near me or talk to me. When people talk to me my brain just explodes with rage. I can't even listen to people. I just wallow in my own anger. 

I've decided to burn all my things and kill myself. There's no place for me in this world. There's no path I can walk without my personal demons attacking me along the way. In death I will be able have that peace I long for.
