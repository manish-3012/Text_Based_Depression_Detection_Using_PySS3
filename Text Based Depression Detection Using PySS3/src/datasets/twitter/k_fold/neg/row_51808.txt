I've given up.I no longer want to try and get better. I refuse to take care of myself and eat. I lie in bed all day, I might even get a UTI from refusing to go to the bathroom. My family urges me not to give up but I have. I no longer want to try. Medication doesn't work, I have nothing left to motivate me to do anything. I just wanted someone to know that sometimes we can't all be strong and continue on.
