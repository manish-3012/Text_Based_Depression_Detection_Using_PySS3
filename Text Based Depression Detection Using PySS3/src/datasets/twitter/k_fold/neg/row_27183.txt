Should I tell my friends' parents that she's suicidal?She told me that that would make her even more anxious. My instinct tells me that I shouldn't tell anyone as she has trusted me with this information and spreading it forward would break her trust.

She says she has gotten used to it and feels suicidal/depressed for only around 2 days in a month. 

She has tought about cutting herself but hasn't done it since she knows you can get addicted to it. I've tried to convince her to tell her parents or get help but she feels as though it would only cause stress for other people and that she's not worthy of other peoples love.

She's one of the nicest people I've ever met and always looks out for others. She's the last person I'd say has suicidal feelings. I'm not the only one to know about this but no one else has done anything about it.

We're both 13.
