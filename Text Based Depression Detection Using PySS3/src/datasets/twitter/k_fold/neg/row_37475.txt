just cant copeI literally wake up, put on a happy face with friends but when i'm buy  myself i cant fucking cope i just cant carry on feeling so bad every waking moment breaking down all the time not knowing how to get a single bit of joy out of life. abused by my father for 9 years and losing my only rock in life my mom. wtf am i going to do with myself im fucking dying on the inside. everyone has it so good and i can barely function as a human what is the fucking point anymore, but maybe im just pathetic and being a baby i dont know anymore
