I am at my limitI made a new account specifically for this because I donâ€™t want my family or people I know to see. I have pretty much reached my limit. There has been so much going on and I just need to talk about it. people in my life have heard me talk about it again and again but they never really seem to actually hear me. I want to explain everything but Iâ€™m not sure anyone will listen. Iâ€™m even in a mental health outreach program and I canâ€™t get anywhere with that. I donâ€™t know what to do.
