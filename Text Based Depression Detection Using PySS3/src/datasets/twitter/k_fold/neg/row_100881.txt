UpdateMy father came back, drunk as can be, we all stood behind his car and said "if you leave you have to kill all of us" because I cant imagine the blame all of us would feel if we let him go and he drank to death or crashes his car.

So we stood there until he got the hard liquor out of his car and came in the house.

We all confronted him on what he said and what he did and he denies all of it, so in that case he is now living downstairs and he is still gonna be drinking, and we are all gonna endure the abuse because we love him too much to let him go.
