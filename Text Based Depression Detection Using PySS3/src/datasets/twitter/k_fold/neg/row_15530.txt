Comfortable with deathidk if Iâ€™m the only one that feels this but Iâ€™ve realized that Iâ€™m not afraid of death but rather what would happen to those around me after I die. itâ€™s weird cause I had a hunch from a young age that I wouldnâ€™t make it past 30 but as I grew older that statement just got more true. I guess maybe Iâ€™m ok with not making past 30 cause at that point nobody really talks to you so you can sleep forever in peace. I mean I wish I had goals and ambitions but atm Iâ€™m just a robot living day by day.
