Tried telling a friend about my thoughts on Sunday, he promptly talked about his exI feel stuck. I had attempted suicide in middle school and got stopped on the day of. I used HP to get out of my depression, but it seems that that Harry Potter phase has been dying out for me since I have my Bachelor's already. I have what seems an unreachable future ( wanted to be a doctor, but don't have the GPA for it, nor have I done sufficient volunteer hours, haven't even attempted the MCAT). Talk of suicide in my family always leads them to call it stupid. My friend, the one mentioned here, talked about it when he had broken up with his ex and I was there for him. Now, the way he answered was by pretty much saying he is talking to his ex, and he found out two of his friends attempted suicide. It seems he doesn't reciprocate now that I needed him. I tried talking about it with my other friends but they seem to have problems of their own. I just feel like there isn't really a place for me. Everyone is slowly forgetting our friendship and I was always trying to be the one to piece it back together. I was always the one trying to figure out what they like, but no one in over 8 years has asked me what I am into or what I like, and slowly I have become so numb, angry at times, and empty. I keep telling myself that I'm just being overdramatic that others have it worse. It hasn't pushed the thoughts out though. Ended up deleting social media, because all I get are reminders from FB when I was happy and it just hurts, knowing that the source of my happiness is gone...it's funny no one noticed.
