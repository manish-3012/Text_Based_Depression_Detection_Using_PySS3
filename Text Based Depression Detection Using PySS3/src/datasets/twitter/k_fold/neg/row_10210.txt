I want to kill myselfThere are lots of reason why I want to kill myself. But the main reason is because my anxiety gets in the way of everything. I hate the way I look. I hate how I try so hard to achieve something and it never works out. I hate how when I was sexually abused, none of my friends believed me. I just feel so alone and like I canâ€™t be taken seriously. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m a joke to everyone. I donâ€™t know. I just really wanted to clear my head and so I wrote how Iâ€™m feeling.
