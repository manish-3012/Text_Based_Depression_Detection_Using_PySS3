Hi, suicidal thoughts/addiction helpI dont know what to do anymore. I have a good job and am 29 but no matter how much money I make I blow it. Iâ€™m sliding into debt basically because of my addiction. It isnt a normal addiction so I dont know who cares, I will go out once a month maybe, maybe more than that and have a few drinks and even though I know I shouldnt do it Iâ€™ll end up in a whore house, high, by the end they will give credit and I wake up and I am fucked again. 

Im typically a very anxious/worry prone person and this behaviour makes everything 100x worse....I am constantly worrying, I cant see a way out for my idiotic behaviour, I never thought of suicide before but now I am increasingly, I dont want to be a burden to my parents anymore and I dont want to worry anymore.


To those who say dont do what your doing...yes, i can go for weeks without drinking and then self destruct and blow all the work in a day, I fucking hate myself, my lack of willpower. 

I dont know what to do at this point so maybe this is just venting. I never took drugs until I started working 7/8years back either. 

I dont blame anyone else for this although as said before 7yrs ago I had never ever had any inclination to pay for sex nor had I taken drugs, I guess the late 30s/40s senior people I worked with were all into tha big time and thats what started it. But now I have developed a full blown issue.

So, thats it. I am on the train now, I know myself and I know that its a matter of time before I work up the courage. Iâ€™ve pretty much thought of this non stol for months..
