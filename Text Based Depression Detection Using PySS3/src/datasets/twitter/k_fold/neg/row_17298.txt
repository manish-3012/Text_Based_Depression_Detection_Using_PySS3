I have no immediate plans, but I think suicide will end up being my only option.For years I've always thought that I would eventually go via suicide. I have difficulties with mental health, and the last year has just been filled with horrible events which have just screwed with my head.
I chose to move to another country as a last ditch attempt to find some happiness, and then corona hit.
Now I have no job, no income, and bills to pay.
I am lucky, in the sense that I have a roof over my head and food on the table because of my mum.
However this just makes me feel worse. I'm dependant on my mum again, and I can't give anything back to her. I've never been out of work and Ive never felt so useless. This just strengthens my belief that I'm going to have to end it all soon, because I've failed at life, and have just ended up being a financial burden on those around me.

No advice needed. I just need a place to vent to strangers to have no connection to me ðŸ˜‚
