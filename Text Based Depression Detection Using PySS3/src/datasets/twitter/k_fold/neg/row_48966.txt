Please help me.My loved ones are leaving and abandoning me over my depression and anger. I've started counseling and doctor visits, but the stigma of what I said before during my spats and rants just made them leave me to work on this alone. I lost my girlfriend, my beautiful girlfriend, and her family members. I didn't lose my friends, but they don't exactly care about any of this unfortunately. Being abandoned like this makes it so hard. It gives me no motivation, and it honestly makes me feel worse the before. What's the point of all this if they're just gonna abandon me anyway? Why should I prevent killing myself right now? I can't get help from them, they think that ignoring me is the answer, but I just don't think it's right. Please help me. I feel hopeless, and on the verge of just giving up and going to sleep forever
