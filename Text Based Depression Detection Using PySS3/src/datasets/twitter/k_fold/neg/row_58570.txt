My life is spiralingIm 13, still in highschool, and tried to kill myself twice

I first got depressed when i was about 10, i hated my class, i hated my body, i hated my memories and i hated my parents. I was a fat, depressed, unfunny piece of shit with no meaning of life. So I tried to kill myself, i wanted to jump off a bridge, but i didnt have to balls to do it. 

It only got worse the next couple of years, and when I was 12, I got denied many things.  My first audition to become an actrice, which was fair, but I also failed an audition for a school play and I failed to get into a special english class, both I cared so much for. 

It only became worse when I thought of the future, I was sure I wouldn't get a job  and become a poor piece of shit. So I tried it once more, i came back to the same bridge, climbed over the railing, but I couldn't let go. I thought of my friends and even my family, which has caused me much trauma's.

This schoolyear was even worse, I got called names behind my back and I didn't even trust my friends. The whole year, every day, 24/7, i thought of the trauma's my family gave me. I can't trust my family,  I am too embarrassed to do anything when they are around, they laugh at me and my brother used to hit me everytime i stood up to him. 

I'm seeing a psychiatrist now, but it's not working. I can't go to her when i am feeling sad or lonely, and I sure can't turn to my family. All I want is to feel happy once, just once, i don't want to commit suicide, but if I'm spiraling more, I may just have to.
