My self esteem is practically non existantI wanted to kill myself because I dropped a basket of rolls at work. I wanted to permanently end my life over something so trivial. I can't say why but every minor mistake I make absolutely destroys my sense of self worth. I can't say why I'm like this but I just always have been. It's not like I demand perfection but when it's entirely my fault something bad happened then I can't handle it. I start to convince myself I'm a piece of shit and should just kill myself to avoid fucking up even more.
