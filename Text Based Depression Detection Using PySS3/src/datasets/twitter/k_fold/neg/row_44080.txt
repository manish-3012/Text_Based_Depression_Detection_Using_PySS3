Really can't see myself trying for much longerI feel like a burden constantly. I frequently get upset by people but I cant reasonably expect people to cater to me like that. I think I just wasn't made to be close to anyone. I hate myself so much for that, I can't focus on anything else and I can't ignore it any longer. I tried it a few times before but I know a way that won't fail. It'll be better for anyone in my life.
