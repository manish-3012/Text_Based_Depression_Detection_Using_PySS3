Not meant to live in this world, too empty.I feel like I was just not meant to be alive. To be born, to exist. I have always felt like I was a burden to everyone around me. I have lots of issues with me, emotional, mental, physical, all kinds of issues. I have too many negatives. I have never had anyone love me for who I am, I have always been an average friend to people. People are nice to me till they find how I look, or even if they dont know my negatives or my looks, once my personality comes out, I get abandoned. And the hate for myself increases. I have given up on myself. Nothing surprises me anymore. Even if someone leaves me for someone better, I feel like its only natural, even though it was just a friendship? In the end, I have never gotten rid of my wish to die. My family only loves me because I am their family, they can be disappointed, ashamed of me and still love me, only because I am their family. I am ugly, with no motivation in life, no life goal, all I can do is just live on, and wait for when I die. Why do people that want to die not die, but the ones that want to live die in random accidents and so? Why cant I ever die like that? so My family wont feel bad thinking suicide. I have had no relationships, only one online, that I wouldnt count. It was betrayal and a big lie. I feel like I am much better off dead. I am very empty, I have no desires left. I just want to cease to exist.
