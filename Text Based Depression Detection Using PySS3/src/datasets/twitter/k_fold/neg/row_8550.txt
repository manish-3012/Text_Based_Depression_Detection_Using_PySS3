tried to kill myself last night.Tried to kill myself by overdose, but a housemate managed to call an ambulance. After 12 hours waiting in hospital i kinda came to realise how stupid i was but also how grateful i am for my friends being there and how supportive the hospital staff were. 

I'm not trying to be preachy or anything here, but last night kinda changed how i look at life and etc. I actually feel like i can beat all this depression bullashit.
