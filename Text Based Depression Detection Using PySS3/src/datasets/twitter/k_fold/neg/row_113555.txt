I tried to hang myself last night but failed.I canâ€™t even kill my self. I took some Xanax to knock me out with the nose around my neck but I couldnâ€™t pass out or hold myself there long enough to pass out. Idk why it has to be so hard. People who want to live get killed everyday but people like me who want to die canâ€™t. Sick irony
