I don't want to live this lifeThis is maybe a ridiculous reason why I want to end my life but I am transgender, so I would want to live as a girl but I know that I would just be fooling myself. I can never be a real girl and I can never look as feminine as a girl should look. I am not able to love someone as a boy nor can I be happy with the things I can do as a boy. I can't look at my body or feel it without feeling sad. Many probably don't understand it but it really hurts me and I don't want to live this life.
