My friend in Poland needs help.As the title says, I have a friend in Poland. I'm not Polish myself.

Recently, my friend has been showing signs of depression and somewhat suicidal tendencies.

My friend told me that they have been thinking about suicide recently and that they're tired all the time.

I told them to seek help and see a doctor because it's not okay to let these thoughts fester.

My friend was convinced and they also told me that they had wanted to seek help but due to the Coronavirus pandemic, everything was closed.

So, the good people of Reddit. Please help my friend. I'm not Polish so I don't know what can be done in this scenario. I want to help my friend but I don't know how. If someone can tell me about some resources or something of the sort that I can share with my friend, I'd be very grateful.
