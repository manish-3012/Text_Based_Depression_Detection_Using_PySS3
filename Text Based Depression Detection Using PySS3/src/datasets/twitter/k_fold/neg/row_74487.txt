Fighting...All we do is fight. Todayâ€™s been the worst. Itâ€™s my fault because I canâ€™t seem to control my moods. They are swinging so fast right now. I canâ€™t keep doing this. Iâ€™ve been doing good. I was in groups at the local hospital (Monday and Thursday for I think 2 months) and when I was in a manic state I missed, I think,the last 2-3sessions) so they say Iâ€™m no longer allowed at any groups. (Because you have to be given a referral or something).. so no help.. the group leader called at told me I should go see this psychiatrist who saw me for 5 minutes 3 months ago because it was my first manic state.. I donâ€™t want to.. why should I. My relationship is in shambles..heâ€™s blaming me for how his relationship with his parent crumbled,  my apartment building is horrible, I keep trying and everything gets worse.. I refuse to ever go back to the ER after the doctor yelled at me last time, telling me I just needed to learn coping skills.. I learned some.. they arenâ€™t helping in this state. I would go to respite but I have a new puppy. I either need to be gone or here. But Iâ€™m fine right...
