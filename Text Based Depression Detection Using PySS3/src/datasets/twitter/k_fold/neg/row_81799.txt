Im too depressedI dont want to kill myself. But I cant get out of bed. Im about to lose my job and I dont care. I dont care about anything right now. I should care. But I cant vrng myself to. My job is the reason I got depressed again.

I keep being told to get out of the house and bed, but I dont want to.

Ive had a concussion and a respiratory infection as well so I really just feel like dying. Im just tired. The bags under my eyes are awful and I sleep for atleast 12 hours a day.
