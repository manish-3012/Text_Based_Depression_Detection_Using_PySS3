I can't hold it in anymore.I have about 2500mg worth of diphenhydramine for my allergy. I weigh more or less 53Kg. I probably already have 4-5 times the amount of the minimal lethal dose. If no one finds me, I'll surely die, right? About 2 hours of seizures and hallucinations and then I'm free, right?

I'm a worthless piece of shit. I feel alone and it's all my fault. I have no one else to blame. I don't want to go to work anymore. I have trouble getting up. I don't have energy to try to improve my current situation. I don't know how to satisfy my heart's wants as they're unattainable. 

I've been to several doctors but no one seems to take me seriously enough. I'm scheduled for lab tests to rule out physical illnesses but I don't know if I can even wait. I'm pretty sure my suicidal thoughts for the past 6 years and my hate for myself for the past 15 years doesn't have anything to do with my thyroid. Everything's been so expensive which is hard on me because I'm poor and yet I haven't seen any result. 

I want to take this opportunity when I feel miserable to have the courage to drink those pills.
