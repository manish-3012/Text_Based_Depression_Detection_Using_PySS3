LostIt just seems like things can't get worse. I don't wanna go into details of all the reasons but I'll share a few. At work I have the coolest person to work with, an I know there is a day when she'll leave to finish up her school. But, it makes it super hard cause I know that no matter how bad I'd like for our friendship to continue it probably won't. Because of her beliefs it's not really OK to see me on a social level. Which I understand, I just wish she knew it bothered me that I won't see her. So I have this kinda stressing me a bit. 
Now yesterday I find out that my wife has been cheating on me. We've been having some issues nothing outta normal I thought. Typical stuff between normal couples. The last month I'd say she has been distant. I asked an asked till the point I was sick if she was seeing someone else. She always said no I just went about our business. Well, when I get home from work I start getting messages on Facebook from a guy telling me about what he has been doing with my wife. I have never felt so sick to my stomach hearing stuff like this.
Now I just want peace. I know these things might sound like little problems, but I have no one. I don't have family to talk to or go see. I hate telling my friends about it cause it feels like it's a burden. They have their own issues an struggles. So I think it might be a good choice. I feel like most people I know won't care.
I can imagine it's like flipping a light switch. I dunno? I thought sharing some of my problems that are eating at me might help stop me.
