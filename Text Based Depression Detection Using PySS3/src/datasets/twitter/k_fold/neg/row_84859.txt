I can't care about anything right now. No idea why, but it's making me severely loathe being alive.I don't know how to make it better and the older I get, the worse it gets exponentially. I don't want to even make it through the night. Life sucks inside and out and I feel as though I've reached a state of equilibrium which is the equivalent of death in all but the literal sense of the word.
