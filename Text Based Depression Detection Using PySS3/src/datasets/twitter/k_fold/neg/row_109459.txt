Suicidal thoughtsIâ€™ve been depressed for the past 2 years and keep having suicidal thoughts whenever Iâ€™m alone. Iâ€™ve been busy with school so those thoughts were at bay. However, now that itâ€™s holidays and Iâ€™m alone at home, the thought keep occurring to me. My boyfriend is also busy with his studies.

Iâ€™m born in a not well to do family and the country that I live in has a high cost of living and where the government does little to make the income gap between the poor and the rich. (Ahem, million per year prime minister) So the only worry i have if i do it, is that my funeral will add on to my parentsâ€™ financial burden. I am not doing very well in school and therefore i feel like my future ahead of me is very bleak and uncertain. I know many people say that after awhile things will be alright, however, i just cannot vision myself being â€˜alrightâ€™ in society next time. 

It doesnâ€™t help that I donâ€™t have many friends. I donâ€™t dare to tell my parents because being asian parents, they will just brush it off as being stressed or being the side effects of â€˜using too much phoneâ€™ or â€˜playing too much computer gamesâ€™. I feel like one day I might not be able to take it and just take my life.
