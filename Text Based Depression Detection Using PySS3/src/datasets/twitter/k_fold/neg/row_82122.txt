HateI just hate my self so much I can't take it. My whole body is hurting so much because I'm tensing up completely and have uncontrollable spasms the whole time. There is a huge urge to gag I can barely think straight and all I want is to stay up, go out, get a clear thoughts and simply walk to the scaffolding, climb up and let myself fall down. That's the only thing I can catch a clear thought onto right now. And I'm alone, nobody is there, everyone is asleep busy or ignoring me although I anyways don't really have people to talk to. I'm done
