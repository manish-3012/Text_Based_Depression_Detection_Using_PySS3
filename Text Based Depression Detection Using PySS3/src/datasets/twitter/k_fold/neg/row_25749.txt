I quit.If you're reading this, it means this note I typed up a long time ago on my phone is being put to use and I'm no longer here. I've tried to hold out for as long as I could, but in the end, I just couldn't do it.

No one cares about me. They never did. I've been alone my whole life. Pretending like it doesn't bother me. 

But it does. 

They wouldn't notice if I suddenly vanished. They don't even notice me now. 

I began putting on a mask in public, but even that has become too much. I'm tired. Tired of being a burden, tired of dwelling in the past, and of dreading the future. It's like color has been draining from my life for the past 9 years and now all I see is black and white. I've never been able to fully trust anyone, and to be honest I don't even know why I'm posting this on here. I feel anxious, and awkward all the time, never knowing what to do, say, or how to act around anyone, like a normal person. 

I'm leaving my account open, but if you're reading this, it means I'm gone. 

Goodbye.

Forever.
