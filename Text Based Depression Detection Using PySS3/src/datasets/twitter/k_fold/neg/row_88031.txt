My suicidal ideation isn't imminently dangerous but I recognize the downward spiral in front of meI fear becoming dangerously suicidal in 1-2 months. I'm not in a great life situation now and things will significantly deteriorate over the next two months. I've always been off-and-on suicidal to varying degrees but it's been about 2.5 years since I last reached a point where immediate professional help would have been highly recommended. In fact, that was probably the only time where my mental state reached that point.

&amp;nbsp;

Nobody knows I'm suicidal. If I'm depressed, I don't experience some of the more obvious signs so attempts at self-diagnosis are difficult. My anxiety is through the roof and my ability to mitigate it is limited because I have little experience suffering from high anxiety. I'm spending more and more time in bed (which is easy when you're unemployed) and having trouble doing anything to fix my situation. Especially while unemployed, I'm not interested in seeing a therapist. 

&amp;nbsp;

Like a lot of suicidal people, I don't actively want to commit suicide. I'm being proactive about the situation because I know how my feelings shift. Initially (and this happens more often than I care to admit), I reach a point where I actively want to die but can't imagine the effect it would have on family. In those situations, I recognize my mental limit to follow through and I metaphorically throw my hands up in the air in frustration to the mental block. At that stage, I actively want to be gone but know I'm unable to overcome the mental obstacles.

&amp;nbsp;

After that stage passes, I become borderline psychopathic in the extent to which I lose empathy. I imagine the chemical shift in my brain must be interesting because I go from insurmountable obstacles created by empathy/sympathy to a complete lack of those same emotions. That's when things are scary, though at that point suicide feels more like relief than scary. To be certain (since psychopath is a scary term), I only mean it insofar that I stop caring how my death will affect others.

&amp;nbsp;

[*As a side note, I've always been curious if subsiding empathy is common in people as they become more suicidal.*]

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I see myself reaching that point in the near future. I'm not sure what to do. Writing this out helps marginally but I'm not sure what else would create a better situation. I recognize the silliness of outright denying some advice before it arrives (such as seeing a therapist) but my brain isn't in a space where I'm willing to do that. I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish by posting here but I can't imagine it can do anything but help.
