Just an adolescent complaining!I'm stressed. I've been doing exams for like a month and I still probably failed. Have done nothing pleasurable recently. I've got two more that I'm going to fail because I haven't studied due to having other exams to study for I may have messed up. In which case, my future is directionless because I can't get into uni and I have no idea what to do. I have a place in uni in a place I hate but I don't want to move to another country. I have no friends, except the one that lives in another country. I go through anxiety every day about how much I fucked up my life due to my own stupid fault. What I have going for me is money, but that doesn't make me happy. I'm just tired. The only thing that helps is music, but no one to make music with. I probably won't attempt, but I need to complain. I hope you enjoy and feel better yourself
