Who had a hard time seeking help?Its been several years since i was at a psychiatrist last, it wasnt a good experience for me... back then it was my parents decision, now im in my mid 20s, ive wanted to kill myself ever since i remember.. the struggle is getting too hard for me. ever since i remember i wanted to go seek help, but something is simply stopping me from doing so... maybe the fear of being judged, the fear of being a failure again.. something like that.. im not sure whats wrong with me, even the smallest of things completely crush me emotionally.. today, i spent several hours just laying on the floor, cuddled together in myself.. i have no friends to seek help with

TL;DR: i can't pull myself together to get help, what convinced you to do so?
