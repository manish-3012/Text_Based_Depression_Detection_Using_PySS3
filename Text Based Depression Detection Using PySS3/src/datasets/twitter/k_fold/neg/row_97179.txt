I'm not going to make it through this one.I live in Alamogordo NM, and this morning my boyfriend and I went to El Paso TX, and he left me stranded. He borrowed my phone and sent me inside. Told me to meet at the GameStop, I waited two and a half hours till I went out to the car, but it was gone. He was gone. I was left there all day. I got an old co worker to get her husband to come and save me. When I got home EVERYTHING was gone. I have no money, no vehicle, no phone. He took his dog and left the house key, clear sign he isn't coming back. I need help on what to do. He has not active phone himself. I went to a friend of his house to see if he'll talk to her since they talk on Steam. While I was there, I noticed my bike in their yard. We also have a roommate. He had to make a mortgage payment this morning, which is why he he asked to us my phone. I feel he may have gotten a notice of repo. I don't know. I need help! I'm not stable. I need leads. I'm not going to make it if I don't get answers.
