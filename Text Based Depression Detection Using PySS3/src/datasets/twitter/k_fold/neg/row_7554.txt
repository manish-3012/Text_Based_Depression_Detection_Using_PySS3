I came close to Suicide last night but I think I've finally come around.I've had a rough 3 months but my best friend gave me a long lecture after last night and I honestly don't think I'm going to try again, before it was just me waiting for there to be nothing left to look forward to and then I would end it. He said the nicest things and genuinely believes I'm gonna be something great. I won't let him down.
