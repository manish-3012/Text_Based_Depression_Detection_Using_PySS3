I just want to do it.I just want to end it.

My life is a never-ending cycle of disappointment, abuse, shame, and isolation. I was gang raped by my friends on my 15th birthday. I was raped for years by my cousin. I've been taken advantage of and used in every way imaginable. My father used me as his therapist for his sex addiction between ages 14-19. He would go in my sisters room to sing her lullabies, and then come into my room to tell me what made his cock feel good to send me to sleep. My mother has disliked me since I was a very little girl and has admitted to me that she loves my sister more than she could ever love me. When I told her about the rape she said it was my fault for hanging around those people. Nobody enjoys being around me. I moved away to try to heal but after 6 years I finally moved back home because I couldn't handle the isolation. I have been at my mothers house for 3 hours and have already been screamed at for asking if I could turn the heat down (from 80F). I just want my mom to love me. I just want her to look at me the way she looks at my sister. My dad is dead so that's a lost cause, but I cant take the complete absence of affection anymore. I have been molded into a bitter and resentful human who hates everyone and everything around me. 
I have been suicidal since age 12. They always say to stick it out, it gets better when you're older, people come and go, bla bla bla. It's been 15 years and nothing gets better. I'm so tired of fighting.

I've started looking into helium tanks and forming a plan. The only thing stopping me is that I have 3 animals, one friend, and eventhough I am intensely jealous of her, I do love my sister. I cant bare the thought of hurting them. But I cant bare to live this life any longer. I'm stuck and I dont know what to do. I just want to die.
