Just how?It's just been years. I'm not too sure of just how to cope. I've been through counciling, anti depressants and all that jazz. I have twchniques i've wprked on but just nothing works anymore.  I'd just like some help. If I don't speak up I just feel i'm going to end it and hurt so many people.
