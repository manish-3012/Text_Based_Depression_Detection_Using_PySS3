I don't feel safe anymore.I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately. I mean, I guess in a way that's nothing new, but the thoughts are usually fleeting. Now they're not - they're like one of those revolving doors you see in fancy buildings. They just keep coming around. I don't really know if I'm an actual risk, but I don't particularly feel safe anymore. I don't want to call any kind of suicide hotline and I don't want to check myself into the ER. I attempted last April and when my best friend brought me to the hospital, I ended up in a behavioral center for about a week. I'd much prefer not setting myself up to end up back there. Any other ideas?
