I'm functionally retarded.I should give up. I'm 26 and just entered graduate school; I don't feel up for it. Socially I'm retarded as fuck enough to be on a date without knowing what it is, and as such, failed at said social encounter. At the end of last year I lost the one relationship that had helped me view the world as less of a callous and banal place, after which I'd began abusing the prescription drug Ambien in addition to alcohol. This as hindered my cognitive abilities and my ability to now cope as any anxiety or depression is met with drinking.

In talking to people I am stale as driftwood while amounting to the great socially acceptable height of 5 foot 4 as a male. I've been told I am egotistical but when conducting inventory on whatever qualities I feel I do have, there's nothing that would support that kind of delusional self-love.

Realizing the sum of these things, that I'm absolutely terrible at academics, social situations and in how I value my own self I often think about suicide. It wouldn't solve anything, but it certainly wouldn't be a burden on others either.
