i dont think i can do another yearmy insides feel like theyre already decomposed. like for christs sake its like theres a big cavity where my intestines should be and the creeping dread and obsession with death is all that i can feel now. i cant really differentiate the days anymore and it all feels like one hazy blur. i dont want to stick around for another year of this. im ready to be dead.
