Why is life like this?I'm 17 years old and have been thinking of suicide since I was 12. At that age there wasn't even really a reason for me wanting to die, but I have a feeling I sensed that I just wasn't made for this world.

My dad killed himself 1,5 years ago and since then I have completely isolated myself. No friends, I only have my mum left and I talk to her only when it's necessary. I never leave my home anymore. I'm a social loser, never had a girlfriend and I can't talk to people that I don't know. When I was in school I had noone to talk to, people making fun of me every day, but just being ignored and looked at weirdly is way worse. Now I'm working in a kindergarten, because I thought I could get some life lessons out of it, but it only seems to make me more depressed. Seeing these innocent kids makes me want to be a kid again, reliving my life and making better choices... Not staying at home, making friends and being more open... If I die there's only a couple people that would even know I'm dead.

I don't even know what to do anymore. I'm scared of the future, but at the same time I see a chance, a glimmer of hope thinking I could someday become a somewhat normal person, but everytime I had the chance to, I would just fuck everything more up...

There's no way I could ever be in a relationship or have a true friend, I just can't open up to anyone. My father was the only person I could actually talk to but since he died my world died with him. Might just end it all soon.

I just wanted to get this off my chest, here's the only place I can open up to anyone. If you took time to read through this, thank you.
