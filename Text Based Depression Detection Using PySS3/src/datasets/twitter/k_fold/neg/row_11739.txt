I just took a lot of acetaminophenI know itâ€™s far fetched to die from ~4,00mg of acetaminophen but if I do end up dying, Iâ€™ve written a note. I didnâ€™t mean to take so many. I had a headache and got triggered and took a small handful. I hope it doesnâ€™t kill me. Iâ€™m 5â€™3 and 128 lbs if that helps. I will update if possible. Iâ€™m sorry.
