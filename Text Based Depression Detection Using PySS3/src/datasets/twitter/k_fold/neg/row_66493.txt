Suicide &amp; FamilyHello friends,

I'm just curious if all of you want to commit suicide but then you're thinking like "What if my family finds out?" you imagine them crying and being totally broken... Idk why I'm asking this, i've had many suicide attempts and I'm ready for another one but I can't do this to my family even if they think i'm a failure lol... Do you all think the same and how do you handle it?
