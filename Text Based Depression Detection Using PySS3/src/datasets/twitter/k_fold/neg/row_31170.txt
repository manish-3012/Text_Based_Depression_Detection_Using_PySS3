I dont know what to do anymoreMy family acts like I'm a target for them to take out their frustrations on, I don't know where I stand with one of the best friends I've ever had, and my uncle died of covid with my aunt soon to follow. I'm stuck in a cycle of pain, I thought I was getting better but nothing changed since last time. I want to die, I don't want to hurt anymore but I don't want to hurt the people who are actually good to me. I'm so lost, I'm so alone. Recently I've been having nightmares of my first love coming back into my life just to abandon me again, Im scared to sleep and being awake means more pain. Will I live to see my birthday in a few months, will I die young, am I gonna be just another number on a statistics chart. When will my life have meaning, I can't take much more.
