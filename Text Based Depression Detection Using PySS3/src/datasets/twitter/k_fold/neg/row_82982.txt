My life sucks. I'm thinking about hanging myself in the bathroom.It's hard to explain... Right now I'm a bit drunk just looking at dark reddits. I'm lashing out at my friends. I've just always thought that I've been totally beat down by everyone around me. I'm trying to be a more assertive person but it's so hard. I've always been so peaceful and I'm realizing that was wrong. I'm pretty much lonely and feeling like shit all of the time. I feel as though I'm not good enough for anyone. 

I've thought for a while about it (because my dating life is subpar).  I think about hanging myself in either bathroom or closet. I guess I'm just dramatic. I've always been so stuck. I think that people just don't want me to have a normal life. I guess I'm going to go drink more. That's my life. Time for work tomorrow :/.
