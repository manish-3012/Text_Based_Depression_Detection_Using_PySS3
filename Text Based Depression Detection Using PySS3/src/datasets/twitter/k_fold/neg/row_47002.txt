Forced suicide?!So heres my story i am willibg to share
So i'm gay and thats a really big deal for me and my family because NOBODY wants to tolerate it they are the opposite they hate it and put shame on it. there is a suspect that a cousin of mine is gay and my father said if thats true we break the contact with that evil fag...abd i just cant concentrate anymore everytime i get "hope" this thing always comes up my mind like : you are a fag ! Everyone hates you! Kill yourself! 
I even tried once but i failed. And the past weel i literally thought once everyday "why didnt i die" i just cant anymore and i cant tell why!!! I see no hope and good in my world anymore to be honest everything is not going right in my life anyways so what makes a difference if im not there my mother will have a operation. It could be possible that she dies if she does ill have a excuse for my suicide so..that was my plan..yes i know everything i just wrote sounds stupid but its not easy to be in my situation
