casually waiting for my boyfriend to break up with me so that i can have motivation to kill myselfi'm not doing anything on purpose to ruin the relationship since I love him and can't bring myself to. but i'm secretely hoping he'll get tired of my shitty self and will want to break up. then i can finally have that final push to jump and find some peace.

anyone else fantasises about being so hurt and heartbroken by a loved one that you'll finally kill yourself and be relieved? or am i just being dramatic?
