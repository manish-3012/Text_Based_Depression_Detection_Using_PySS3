Feeling nothing is better than feeling pain. I want it to be done.I'm looking for a place for it to be over. it's not going well, i don't have one. at least then it could be peace.
it hurts to never see people again, but most will probably be better off without me.

i keep thinking about my ideas and working them out and it just makes me very sad. but okay at the same time. at least it would be over.
