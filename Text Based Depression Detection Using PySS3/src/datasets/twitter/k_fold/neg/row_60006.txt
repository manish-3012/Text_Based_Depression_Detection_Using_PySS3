Why do teachers do thisSo in class we're talking about suicide and mental  illness a lot and they always say " if you're having thoughts of suicide talk to friends or a trusted adult" but what if we don't have either? I can't go to a therapist, school counselors don't help, and I don't have any friends/ a trusted adult
