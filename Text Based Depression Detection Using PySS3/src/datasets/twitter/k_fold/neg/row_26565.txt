I'm so tired of feeling depressed all the goddamn timeI think, too often, of sleep.
Of tired, aching limbs finding rest.
Of thoughts finally quieted.
I think, too often, of the impact of ground.
Of the feeling of traffic on my skin.
Of cold, pale weight swinging in the wind.
Of hunger satiated with rainbows of capsules.
Of the loudest brightness, followed by silence and red.
I think, too often.
I think, too often.
I think, far too often.
I think, too often, of nothing and how beautiful it must be.

I always want to kill myself. The feeling of dying is so constant and strong. Even when I'm happy and with people I love, all I can think about is taking my own life. I've been hospitalised twice now in my life. I want to be hospitalised again, but I can't afford it. I'd lose my job and be evicted from my apartment and fail my college courses. So I'm stuck. Just thinking about killing myself 24/7....
