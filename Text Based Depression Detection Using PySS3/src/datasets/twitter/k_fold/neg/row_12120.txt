I'm not sure about anythingI don't know if I even belong here. I wasn't even sure I was depressed for a while, but at this point i think i must be. I have suicidal thoughts at the best of times and i have for the last 6 years. My therapist says there's a good chance they won't ever go away. 

I have bipolar disorder, and I have episodes even when I'm on medication, which i have been sloppy about taking for the last month or so. I'm sure that's a contributing factor. 

Lately (the past week and a half, maybe?) I've been doing nothing but sleep. I can't get myself out of bed. I had one or two days that I made it outside, and only one where i made it to work. I'm essentially using sick days right now. I go to sleep, i wake up and take benadryl or nyquil until i sleep again, rinse and repeat. All day. 

I feel very purposeless and lonely, that's been true for a while. I feel like i'm slipping. It's not the acute, sharp, painful kind of depression but the numbing sort that drives you nuts. 

Anyway, I feel like I want to end it. It doesn't scare me anymore. I've essentially been suicidal for six years, and I'm not sure it's good for me to be this used to it. SO many good things have happened to me recently and I can't seem to hold on to any of them. I just feel like I'm stuck, and the only way out is down.
