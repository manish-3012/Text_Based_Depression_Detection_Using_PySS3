I fucking hate my friend so much.He thinks he knows every god damn thing about depression and suicide. He calls suicide selfish, and although it is, he bases depression on that one day that he was kinda sad, so he hasnâ€™t felt this pain, the pain of wanting to take your own life. There are a few reasons why Iâ€™m still here, but I wonâ€™t go into detail in this post. All you need to know is that one of those reasons is that my family would be sad. He will get mad at something I say and then turn the rest of my friends on his side by saying I was starting an argument. He has been annoying everyone in my friend group lately, so I hope he will be gone soon. I just want him out of my life so badly.
