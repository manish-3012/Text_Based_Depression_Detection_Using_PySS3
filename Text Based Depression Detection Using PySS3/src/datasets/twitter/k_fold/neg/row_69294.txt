small list of little dreamsranging from insignificant and simple to barely plausible, just a little list of things iâ€™d perhaps like to do before i die. iâ€™ll edit this and add/remove things later maybe:

1)go to a nice concert
2)learn to play the piano again
3)write a book?
4)write one good poem
5)lose weight
6)look someone in the eyes w/o feeling scared
7)get a 100 on a history test
8)make one of those pretty strawberry cakes like in an anime
9)get another potted plant (and keep it alive this time)
10)hold hands with someone i love, or someone i think i love
11)play the new animal crossing
12)graduate law school
13)buy more beanie babies
14)confess to my crush
15)improve my drawings just a little bit
16)get into a fight once
17)get more than 4 hours of sleep on weeknights
18)wake up before 3pm on weekends

its much shorter than i expected when i started this post, but maybe thats ok. keeping a little list like this might help me stay alive a little longer.
