I want to give upI canâ€™t do this anymore, I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I feel like a waste of space. Iâ€™ve been cutting so much that my wrist looks more like a barcode just to feel something again, I haven told anyone about the cutting or my suicidal thoughts. Because I feel as they will think that Iâ€™m doing it for attention but Iâ€™m not. I just want to be happy again. Even if it means not existing anymore.
