no titlei feel like my life will come to an end. i know how i want to go, everything is ready. this feeling is insatiable. its always there. how many times can I go through this. i only need one dya where nothing matters.

i think i know why im writing this, to push my end to another day. but after three years of fantastic progress, this fall hurts bad. i can only be afraid for so long till i give up.

i'll be back here when it gets tough again.
