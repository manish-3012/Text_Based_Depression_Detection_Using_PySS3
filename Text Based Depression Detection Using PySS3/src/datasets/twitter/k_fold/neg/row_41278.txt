Hanging myself tonight so I avoid my birthday and everything else25 years is more than enough.

Everything is wrong with myself and the world.

I have never experienced happiness.

People love me but it doesnt make the pain go away.

I'll never be like my heroes. 

I'm a disgusting transgender mutant.

I want to die just like Chester.
