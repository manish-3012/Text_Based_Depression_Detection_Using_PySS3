lonly but it gets harded and harded on mehellow 28 years old male here

since i was young i have had some issue which escalated in the last view years 

when i was young i was embarrassed a lot by everything, i was bullied at certain point, i don't have the natural talent that normal people have like:i have with mapping sometimes i lose the way to my house after finishing school or job so i need to use the GPS a lot, also could not figure out some hidden words in speech and losing the track of it (i cant focus for to long on speech and general talking), cant maintain long talk, can't be empathy all the time for some extent, my social skill is 0/100, i cant get talent with any new language i learn like the rest of people especially the verbal side(talking)

being creeby to all people around me even my family, in my high school i made a few freinds but now i have no one(to be honest i dont keep in touch with them even my family), 

im afraid of social gathering, follow routine that i compulsively can't break, 

hate travels and any new experience

 never forget procrastination+ i also compulsively  lie a lot

can't maintain self hygiene even my own apartment

i stress a lot about small thing especially which include people

my cope mechanism is creating a world inside my head(like anime but i'm the hero) + isolate myself more(introvert)

through the high school i went to medical school and now im ER doctor(resident) but things get worse and worse

i have never consult a psychiatrist about it so i know what is wrong with me

to the point that i need some relief and just to end it

(sorry for the grammar)
