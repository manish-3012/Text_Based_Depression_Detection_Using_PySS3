I wish I could end my life.I am 16 years old. I am a Junior in high school. I am not at all capable of commiting suicide or hurting myself but I just wish I could disappear. For one thing I have social anxiety and social phobia and its just hard for me to make friends. I also literally have no social life, I go to school and back home. I have also never had a girlfriend and it is impossible for me to meet girls because I attend an all-male school. There is also nothing I want more that to play football. But I can't  becuase my school is extremely competitive and you don't get a chance unless your like 6-4 250 LB. There are people who go there just to be recruited by top college teams and eventually many go to the NFL. I feel like an inferior person. I am 5-9 and chubby.  I tried playing football on Junior Varsity and only saw the field once and we were up by 30 points. Even in practice I would just stand around the whole time and never given a chance. I was made fun of and I stopped going out of frustration. I now regret that decision. Now it too late. I might have gotten the chance to be on Varsity even for just Senior year. But honestly I would give anything to ACTUALLY **PLAY** football. And to be honest I am jealous. I have started to hate my "friends" that are on Varsity and I wish for them to lose. That cannot be healthy. I am also ridiculed and seen as a second-class citizen becuase at least at my school, they place a high premium on playing a sport. 
I even tried other sports like wrestling, but I just didn't feel welcome there and the coach would roll his eyes whenever I talked to him. 
Persoanlly, I want to play football becuase I believe in being a well-rounded student, and staying fit is important. I thinks it's absurd to say you can either be great at school OR in sports, all of my heroes played football (Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Jack Swigert just to name a few) and I want to follow in their footsteps.  
I am also a very patriotic and nationalistic person and I think there is no better way to honor your heritage that to play such a uniquely American sport. I would give almost anything to be able to **PLAY** football and also be able to play in college. I could care less about the NFL, I don't think football should be about money or fame or rings, football should be about tradition and being able to go out and represent your institution. 

What angers me even more is I am many times associated with those guys that play video games and watch weird Japanese cartoons. I do not want to be associated with those people.
