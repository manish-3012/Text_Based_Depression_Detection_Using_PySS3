Theyve all leftWhy is it that I am cursed to lose everyone who I love? This past year my two bestfriends in theworld have commited suicide themselves and just earlier this week my girlfriend whom I love like no one else on this earth did the same. I don't have any family close to me anymore. I'm alone. I have a minimum wage job. I'm broke. Theyre all gone and I think im next.
