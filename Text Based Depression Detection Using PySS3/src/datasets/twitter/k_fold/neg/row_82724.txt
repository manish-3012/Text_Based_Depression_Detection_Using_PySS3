Near death experienceIâ€™m going to try and kill myself tonight. I think a near death experience might be the one thing I need to either give me a reason to live or push me over the edge enough to really  attempt it. 

I feel like almost dying might shock me out of how I feel and I can get on the road to recovery. If that makes any sense.

I feel so disgusting I canâ€™t take being alive anymore. 

Iâ€™m going to down a bunch of alcohol and slit my wrists in the bath tub. Itâ€™s a method of suicide that I can back out of if I change my mind. Iâ€™m really scared but itâ€™s the only thing I can do now.
