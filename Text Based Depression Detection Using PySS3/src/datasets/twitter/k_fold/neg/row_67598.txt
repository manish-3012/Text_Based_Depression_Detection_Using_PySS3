So many questionsI can't stop my thoughts.
I ask myself how this situation could be mastered.
I dream about how it could be.
I realize it won't come that way, it never has.
What should I do?
What do they think about me?
How can I succeed?
How can I turn off the voice?
How long will it take?
Haven't I tried everything in my power?
Is it possible to even change something?
What would be the best case?
Does it really matter?
Who would care?
Who would be sad?
How long would it take till they've forgotten it?
How should I do it?
What should I write?
Why should I wait?
Why not right now?
All those questions wouldn't matter anymore as soon as I'm gone.
