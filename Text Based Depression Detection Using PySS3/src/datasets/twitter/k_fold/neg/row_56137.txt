sorry to post thiswow i typed all that out,... and it got deleted. maye for the better it was really intense and emotional but now im stoned. I dont want to make you guys read that bullshit. 

fuck. I sholdnt listen to lil peep right now. haha

let me write a quick TLDR 

lost my mom suddenly, my family has never been the same. im basically all alone now. just had surgery, even my Doctor doesnt care hes taking all my pain meds away too rapidly.

psychologist fiance of 9 yrs left me when I was about to propose. (pain and injury stole her from me)
I have no food, im broke, no help, and I just found out my broken foot needs surgery to get better... too mch man

im tired of having breakdowns, im tired of blackouts cuase I dont want to think anymore. Im sick of my disfunctional family valuaing money over relationships.

Ill probably just take a ridiculous amounts of painkillers tonight to feel better, the temptation is there though...

Why does life have to be SO difficult for me when I KNOW my friends are living happy easy lives? FUCK. I had it all. Its gone.

I want to go to rehab to just escape and find people who care... fuck
