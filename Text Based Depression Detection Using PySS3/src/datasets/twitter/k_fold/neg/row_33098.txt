I cant take this life any more.I cant take it. Nothing I do is good enough for anyone. I always duck things up. I fin myself want to drink constantly to releave the pain. I dont want to go to work. I want to avoid most people. I am just done with life. So welp downed a bottle of clonazepam and am going to take a nice warm bath. Hopefully it works better than trying to cut myself, burn myself, hanging myself with a belt and then opening the door when it got too much, and chickening out of blowing my brains out. So if you dont hear from me ever it worked. 

If you do I guess my fat worthless ass isnt even good at offing myself.

My life is shit. No one gives a shit about me. Do here we go. Hoepfully at least I will be at peace  or at best have another great existsnce, or at worse face another mmore horrible fate. Either way hopefully I see my best friend soon who died almost exactly 5 years ago. 

Sorry everyone. I cant take it. I am sorry for hurting you, but i am just in too much pain.
