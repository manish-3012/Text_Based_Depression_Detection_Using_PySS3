Feeling out of itAlmost 30. 60 k in debt. No job prospects.

Still not done undergrad. Been working on it since I was 18. 60 k in debt. No jobs. No help.

Lots of friends and family very sick or dying.

Feeling really scared.

All morning been thinking about it. Bath tub. Sharp knife. Just start.

I'm more than a burden when I'm alive, I'm a sucking mass of worthlessness. 

I've never planned it out before. I have a date set. Been telling people I'm okay. No note. Just don't want to wake up next Friday and know that by the end of the day I'm going to be feeling how I do today. Because I will. Because this doesn't change. 10 years, no changes. No escape from that.

I just want to put that knife as deep into me as possible.
