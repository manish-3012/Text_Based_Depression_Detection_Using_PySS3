Im scared im going to do it todayI have four bottles of pills on my computer desk, and I really want to chug them all down. I dont know what to say. I wish someone could help me. I'm sorry if I'm being dramatic. I'm really not trying to get attention. I've emailed my therapist about it, but I haven't heard back yet.
