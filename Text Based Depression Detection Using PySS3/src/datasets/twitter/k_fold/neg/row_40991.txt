im going to commit suicide on my 17th birthdayi'm 16 years old, turning 17, planning to commit suicide on my birthday, i don't know why my life turned out this way, i was raised as happy and well loved kid who is an honor student in all of my middle school years, it was when i was in first year highschool that my parents divorced i was left with my mom who constantly abused me and blamed me for every bad thing that has happened to her life, i often end up running away from home, relying on alcohol to make myself feel better i became an alcoholic at a young age because of going out with friends who were bad influence to me but i didn't really care at that time, the constant failures and absences in school had me dropped out of highschool, my friends left me and i had nobody to lean on, i moved from sleeping at relative to relative's houses till i ended up sleeping at the park bench, when i turned 15 i found a small job by cleaning the toilet at a nearby restaurant day to day, till then the restaurant manager somehow seen what pain i was going through and said he would help me go back to school, for the first time in my life i felt a rare kind of happiness spark inside me, i felt hope i felt that i still want to live, but then when i finally got back to school, hell was waiting for me right there, i always feel like there are people constantly watching every move i make and talking about me behind my back. i made friends at that time we were a group of 5 kids but then they started to leave me after lots of heated arguments, i was bullied so much from September to February, and was constantly sexually molested by my science teacher and said he would fail me in his subject if i told anyone about it, all i can do was cry and pray to god for him to just end my life already. i quit school again, i left a small note to the restaurant owner saying i can't do this anymore and im so sorry if i was such a failure then i ran away again, fast forward to my 16th birthday i decided im coming home only to find out that our old house had been sold and i heard from people saying that my mom died a year ago by overdosing on sleeping pills, i lost all hope i had within me at that time and found out how meaningless my life had become i have no friends, no family, no home, nowhere to run, till i found another small job again by being a male prostitute, it was from prostitution i had the money to buy myself my first ever smartphone and i had enough money for food for a long time till now, i was still so fucking miserable and wishing for death every second that passes by. 3 days before my 17th birthday i decided to end being a prostitute and just end my life all together, i'm crying right now while typing this so im sorry for my spelling mistakes since i didn't get to go to school im so sorry
