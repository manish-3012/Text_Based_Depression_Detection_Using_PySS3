I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t want to live anymore.I know it sounds weird but itâ€™s how I feel, I canâ€™t really tell anyone bout it, my family wouldnâ€™t listen or say Iâ€™m just want attention, and my friends donâ€™t really know me (the real me anyway). I didnâ€™t ask to be born I didnâ€™t ask for none of this, I just want to end it I know no one with miss me... so why donâ€™t I?
