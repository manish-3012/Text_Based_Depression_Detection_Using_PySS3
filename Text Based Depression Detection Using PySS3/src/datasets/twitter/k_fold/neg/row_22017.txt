I'm tired of being rejected, never felt this suicidal in a while.I've been depressed for so long as so many circumstances outside my control have affected my life. I'm a kissless 23 year old virgin that spends about 18 hours a day in my room laying in bed. Recently I met up with a girl that i've always been really fond of and have felt I could open up to and when we met she was giving me all kinds of signs, later when I communicated how I felt about her she basically rejected me and said I should have made a move on her when we met. I also re-applied to admission at the college I had dropped out from and none of the advisors or staff had helped me when I attempted and now my application has been denied. Also i've just been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and vitamin d deficiency and am on medication but mentally/physically I feel horrible. I'm tired of so many bad things always happening to me at once, i'm trying to contact the admissions office at the university but likely things won't work out. I will be wasting another year of my life again, thankfully I still have my suicide equipment from my first attempt and now I can finally use them. I'm done with life always handing me the shorter stick, how many times am I supposed to try before getting tired of rejection every time?
