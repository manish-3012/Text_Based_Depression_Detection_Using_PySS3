No job, no work, no money, no future Can I just kill me now?I am not joking here. I am not even close to try to make a joke about.

Simply put: I'm at lost of how I could be able to emphasize the feeling right now. I got the latest rejection even within 2 hours after phone interview this afternoon, saying crap like We choose a more suite candidate than you....blah blah blah.

To be blunt: I graduated as a network/system admin guy, at excellent level, no less. I had been working for one tech-based service company and another non-tech in the last 2 years, right after I left the school. My record isn't all that awesome, compare to my friends at least, but it has its shares of good points. So what are all those HR recruiters looking for? I was only laid off last December because of financial issues, that, I could guarantee with my head. I keep on applying over and over again, yet even with many jobs totally fit with my record, what did I get? The nonsense again and again We choose more suitable person than you ....or We think your record didn't fit with the position..... yadayadayadayada.....

Conclusion: Right now I am feel worthless, unbearable worthless, 200% feel like I am a leech who suck the blood out of my family. I don't know what exactly how to describe the feeling, as I'm not too much of a talkative guy. I try not be depress, but it took its tone day by day. My family is worthless, with all their nonsense about working at own business..... My colleagues, well, not helping much, can't blame them.

I just can't take it anymore......I had never had a history of suicidal thoughts before but now I am starting to feel suicidal. Every morning waking up, I am in misery with this obsession of ending my miserably worthless self. God, if there is such an entity called God, what did I ask for? I just want to work in IT-related fields, not only because of the money, but also because I love the career I choose, and want to make the best of it. I don't mind all the hard works, as long as I could be at least feel useful as a system admin, not just sitting here, bickering. Is that such an enormous wish? Is that a hard wish? I know I have done things bad in the past, but it's not like I am a serial killer to be punished like this.

Can't take it anymore. Maybe I just take a bunch of pills this weekend &amp; be done with it.
