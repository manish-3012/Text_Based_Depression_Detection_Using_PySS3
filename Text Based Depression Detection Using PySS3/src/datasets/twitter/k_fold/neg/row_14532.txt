Constant nausea, tooth pain, fever, fatigue, anxiety and depression. Someone please help meI'm 16. I've had anxiety for 10 years. I've had depression for 4 years. I've had near constant debilitating nausea and fatigue for 3 years. 4 of my teeth are rotten and decaying away, and a week ago horrific tooth pain and high fever started. I can't eat or sleep. I haven't left my house in almost a year. I can't go to the doctors and DEFINITELY not the dentist because I feel too nauseated and tired to get up. I've been having constant thoughts of death and suicide. I've been in the hospital 5 times in the past for suicidal thinking, but this time I want to get it done.

My tooth is killing me so bad. Its radiating to my head and throat. Tylenol helps sometimes but this pain isn't going to go away on its own. I need help. Like now. I'm tired of being nauseous and weak. I'm tired of having a fever and being in pain. Somebody please help me. What can I do
