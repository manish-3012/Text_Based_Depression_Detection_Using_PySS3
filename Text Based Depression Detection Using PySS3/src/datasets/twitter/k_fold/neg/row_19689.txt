I'm not good with titles.I suck at this. I guess I don't even know where to start. I want to vent, but I'm so bad about talking about my feelings. I'm sorry if this is jumbled or doesn't make any sense. I don't even know if I'm going to post this, I just want to get it out.

I'm 17 years old and I am dying. I have a stomach condition called SMA Syndrome. They tried to operate on it, but only ended up adding scar tissue and making it worse. No surgeon has been able to help me. I have an NJ tube in, but I'm just constantly vomiting up the formula. I am constantly being hospitalized and am currently down to 90 pounds (I'm 5'1/155 cm). 

I feel like a burden to everyone- financially, mentally, and physically. My mom thinks I can't hear her cry to my dad every night, but I can. She thinks I don't understand that both of my parents have to work two jobs because of all of my hospital bills, but I do. All I do is stress them out. I feel completely worthless. 

I had to quit going to public school, so I lost literally every single one of my friends. I used to volunteer at a cat shelter 3 times a week, but now I'm too sick to do that. I used to love singing opera, but I can't find the will. My dream in life was to study vet tech, but I know there's no way I can make it through school. 

Things would be a lot better if I were gone. So much stress would be alleviated (I don't know if that's the right word). I bring nothing but stress and sadness to everyone around me. 

There's a lot more going on (it's never just one thing is it) but this is all I can type out for now. Thanks for reading I guess. I really don't know how to write conclusions.
