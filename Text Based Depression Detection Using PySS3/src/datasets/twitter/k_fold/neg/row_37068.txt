Life is too boring, I hope I dieI am 16 but my life has been boring from childhood, I was always lonely, never had friends, all I had was a family which is always fighting, had a kinda sad childhood because of abusive teachers &amp; parents. Each day is getting too boring, I don't even feel depressed now, I don't want to do suicide either, I hope I die soon without suicide.
