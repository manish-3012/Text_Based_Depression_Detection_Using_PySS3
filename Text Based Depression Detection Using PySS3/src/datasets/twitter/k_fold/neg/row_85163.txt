My boyfriend tried to kill himself days ago. Still hasnâ€™t woken up, but is supposed to. I got prescription sleeping pills. Iâ€™m gonna do it. I canâ€™t handle itI (20F) posted earlier a couple of days ago that my boyfriend (M23) tried to kill himself after leaving him. I canâ€™t handle the pain and feel sick to my stomach. I told my doctor what happened, and I said I needed to sleep and haven't. Itâ€™s true. But actually, Iâ€™m going to take a shitload and drink and end myself. I canâ€™t live with this. I feel disgusting. I feel sick to my stomach non-stop. I donâ€™t deserve to live. I canâ€™t breathe, and Iâ€™m not okay. I donâ€™t find any point in living. 

I canâ€™t believe he would do that. I canâ€™t do this
