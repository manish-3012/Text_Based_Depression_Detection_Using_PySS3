My friend may be planning to suicide in a few yearsHi, everyone, and thank you all in advance for reading my post.
Me and my buddy here have been very close friends since ages, but for some time he was showing hints on ending his life.

He had been seriously ill when young, and though the doctor at the time saved his life, he is suffering from leftovers introduced by improper treatment, resulting in: 1. His appearance hasn't changed since, looking like a ten-year-old 2.His joints are aging way faster than normal, and in a few years he would have to live by wheelchair.

That means he is not viable to do any kind of sport (including intense computer gaming), nor would it be easy to find a job (normal jobs aside, when I suggested he can be a freelance artist, due to our common interest in art, he simply refused) nor a girlfriend. Though he reads a lot, I can feel that every word he reads reinforces his desire to end his life. He is also not close with family.

Recently, he has told me that life isn't worth living anymore. He feels lonely and sees little hope. He has also started spending a lot of money on the things he likes (we used to be the stingy duo). Other than that there's not much signs anymore; he still goes to school, and meets with other friends. But what I fear most is a calm end.

The worst thing is, when I was suffering from depression, I really felt him and understood his wish to end. This feeling still lingers onto me, and I literally don't know what to do to persuade him; I can't even persuade myself! 

So guys, is he really considering suicide, or might he just be showing signs to relieve his pain? Either way, is there be anything I (or any of his friends) can do?

Thank you very much for reading this post. Hope you all have a wonderful day. Keep happy!
