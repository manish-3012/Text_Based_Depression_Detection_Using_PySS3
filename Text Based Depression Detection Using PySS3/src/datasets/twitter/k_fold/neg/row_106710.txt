I've been drinking heavily, all I need to do is take the pills now, and I can finally be free of this terrible lifeI feel so nauseous 
I know I need help, but I don't ask for it because it'd make me feel weak

My life is honestly shit, idk why im posting here

I'm never going to find someone who won't fuck me over and cheat on me, I'll never graduate high school, I'll never be able to have enough money to move and start over in a new city
I won't be able to get my dream job

My "friends" tell me they care and love me, but I've been told that too much, whenever I talk about being sad or explaining why I slept through an entire day that I was supposed to hangout with them they just get annoyed and inevitably leave, I'm losing way too many people 

It's probably a sign I should just swallow the bottle of pills and cut down my arms with my knife 

I'm not worth anyone's time 
I feel like I'm obligated to post here before I finally do it though, maybe someone can Help me see something I can't 

I doubt it though, I lost any chance at hope so fucking long ago
I feel so empty, I only smile now because I have too in public, so people don't ask me what's wrong

I'm sorry for the wall of text, and sorry for anyone who's read up to this point, I'm wasting your time and I apologize for being a waste of human life
