I think it would better to not be alive anymore [cry for help]diagnosed anxiety/ depressed 

I'm an early 20s man. I did one thing on my bucket list, I came out as gay to my friends. They were so sweet and kind to me about it. I consider my closest friends, no matter if they live far away, as part of my family. I**n this post, "family" refers to friends/ my 2 cousins.** I don't have a good relationship with my Dad. My mom is ok, I don't trust her 100% though

I think my family would miss me? I think they would. I also deeply fear that my death could trigger someone else's mental illness. I don't want to be a burden in death or life. My friends are so kind to me, but I'm having trouble these days.

I feel like the burden of my death will be less than the burden I am alive. I feel that I'm a financial burden on my parents. I've had to do 99% of the work in my friendships, even though they give heartfelt responses and were always great to me when I lived near them. I recently started talking to friends much more frequently, and I fear they see me as a nuisance. I was always discouraged/ controlled by my dad. My parents rarely encouraged me or told me "good job".

I'm so scared that I will fail hairdresser school. It's my dream day job that I never told my mom/dad about because I was scared. The rent on my apartment was raised 60$ for this lease, and I fear those raises won't end. I love where I live. I can't seem to hold a ltr with any guy. I think I accidentally caused a friend an inconvenience.

If I kill myself, I have some notes planned, and I plan on post a smiling selfie so my family can have a positive memory &amp; closure.

I blame myself for everything. I am so grateful to my family. I don't want to die, but I think it would be best if I wasn't alive anymore. I guess people would miss, but it's hard right now.
