I wish I didn't have depression, social anxiety and suicidal thoughts every other day. I do not even feel comfortable speaking to my own family. I need adviceMy mood changes very quickly, on a day to day basis. Basically, I am severely depressed and also have really bad social anxiety around my own family. I have anxiety attacks when I am around them or when I have any kind of interaction with them. I hate living this way. I'm tired of being so alone. I can't even ask my family for anything, and I can only answer questions with a couple of words at best. I am so pathetic.
