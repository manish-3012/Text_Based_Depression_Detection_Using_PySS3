I don't know manMy story is pretty pathetic. I've dug myself this social hole where I literally have no one, and no one will even approach me. I had one good friend and she got upset with me because she didn't want to hear about my problems anymore, and so I stopped bringing them up but I was struggling so much I couldn't talk to anyone and she gave up on me and hates me now. I had a girlfriend and she honestly made the world light up for me and then she broke up with me and now I've got nothing left. I've been on a downward spiral for over a year, and I just feel so alone. I have nothing going for me. I'm considered "gifted", but my motivation has run so dry that I can barely pass a class and I'm useless at basically any life skills. I'm going no where in life and it hurts because I just need someone to be there for me. I cry myself to sleep every night and no one could give less of a shit about me. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I can't figure out a way to make it quick and painless. I just want the hurting to end, I don't want to cause more.

I don't even know what I hope to achieve by posting this. I just want to shout my problems into the void so maybe someone will hear me.
