hate being around peopleI feel anxious all the time and always feel like people are thinking that I'm annoying or gross when I'm in a public setting. I've been moved out for 2 years now. My mom has no one else in town and demands I go over every week. I hate being around her because she just guilts me into being around. My sisters in town and whenever I go over she tells my mom she wishes she could've had a better brother. When I want to leave my mom guilts me into staying and I feel like if I storm out I'll make a scene and they'll tell everyone in the family and I'll become that guy. I hate family but my moms threatened suicide before to me and I feel like I cant just disappear like I want to. 

I work more then 46 hour weeks and I have 4 online classes. If I don't fill my time up I just end up hurting myself or find dangerous things to do at night. I dont struggle with addiction or anything else. I have plenty of money but I am always frugal and will struggle to buy stuff for myself and will just opt to throw it into a savings account. I have made and subsequently canceled a few appointments with psychiatrists. Theres no one in my life I want to talk to about how I feel and no one besides my mom that i think my suicide will really impact. I feel like im at the end of my rope and I dont have anything really to live for. I have felt like this since middle school and always figured once I moved out I could take control of my life. 

I dont know what I expect from this.
