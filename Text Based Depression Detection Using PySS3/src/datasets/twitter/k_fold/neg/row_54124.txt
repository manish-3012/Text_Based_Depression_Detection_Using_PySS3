Nothing works.One step forward just to take three steps back. I'm broke, drained, and demotivated. I thought my medication was working. For a week or more I was super motivated. Not happy, but not thinking about suicide. Yet a week later here I am again. Death seems so much easier than pushing forward. Im thinking about hanging myself this weekend.
