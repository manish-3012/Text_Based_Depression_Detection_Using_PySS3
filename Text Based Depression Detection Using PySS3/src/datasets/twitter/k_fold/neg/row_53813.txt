I just want someone to talk to.I just need a friend right now.  Today was rough on me, and I just need some kind of distraction.  I don't even have to talk about me, it can be all about you, or anything.  I just don't trust myself to be entirely alone right now, and this is the only means I have at this specific moment to avoid that.
