Just Stop and ThinkI'm not depressed or feel like committing suicide, but Iâ€™ve felt like that in the past. I'm sure everything here and posting doesn't help, trust me on what Iâ€™m about to say.

Every single person that feels depressed is worth staying alive. Because every single one of you actually care and that's why you get depressed because you care. The people around you that make you feel shit and give you shit are the worthless pieces of shit's who are just insecure about themselves. 

So remember no matter what or who you are, as long as you care, thatâ€™s why you should stay alive. If you're one of the people that feel like death is the only thing that you can do, JUST THINK.

I got myself out of it because I found new things (hobbies) and new goals to achieve; also you have to have a dream. If you don't have a dream of something you would love to do, no matter how far away you are from doing it or getting to it, you have to have a goal.


**TLDR: Don't give up.**

P.s I'm 100% counselling helps with this, so it should be an option you should think of doing

[EDIT] what i meant by people who don't get depressed are worthless, abit of an exaggeration but i was basing it on people that put others down (basically insecure people)
