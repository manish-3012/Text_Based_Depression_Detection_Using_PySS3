I did something really stupid. I got drunk and it interacted horribly with my meds. Anyway I canâ€™t remember any of it and now Iâ€™m being charged with two felonies. 21mI donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™ll be able to get a job if Iâ€™m convicted let alone go to law school, which Iâ€™ve been studying for, and get approval from the state bar to become a lawyer.

If I canâ€™t go to law-school let alone get a decent paying job Iâ€™ll kill my self. Iâ€™m just so scared for my parents to find me but I canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t be a cashier for the rest of my life. I could throw up. It feels like my life is over because of something I canâ€™t remember. And Iâ€™m sober now but it feels like itâ€™s really at risk.
