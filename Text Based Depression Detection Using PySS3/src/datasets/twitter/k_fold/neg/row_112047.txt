I need help....I am only fifteen but i see no other way out of this. My parents are dying, I am gay, I have no real friends, but grandparents are dying as well, I'm an atheist and I'm doing fucking terrible in school. I want it all to end. I cut myself but I can't even do that right I'm a failure. My grades are all C's so good bye college and I'm fat as fuck; 225 lbs. I see no other way out. Sorry for ranting and stuff, but I am 15, so you should not expect a life story. Sorry for bothering you.
