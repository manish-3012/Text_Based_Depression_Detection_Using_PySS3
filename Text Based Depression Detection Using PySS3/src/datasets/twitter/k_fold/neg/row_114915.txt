I tried reaching out for help and all I got was told to watch a movie. That was my last hope for help.The last week or so my self harm and suicidal thoughts have got worse to the point where its all I can think about. All I want is to stop feeling this sad, whatever I have to do to stop it. But I decided to try one more time to get help, hoping they'd let me go somewhere safe like hospital while they work on changing my meds etc. Instead when I rang the helpline they said hospital isn't appropriate for me, and just told me to watch a film to distract myself and they'd ring back in two hours. They never rang back.

Just feeling like my last hope failed me and they've made it inevitable I'll try to kill myself soon. I was really hoping for another way as I don't want to do that to my family. I don't understand why they keep just ignoring me when I reach out - before my last overdose I told them I wasn't feeling safe and was likely to attempt suicide and they didn't do anything then either. I don't know what more I can do make them understand so I'm giving up.

Sorry, just needed to vent. Thanks for reading.
