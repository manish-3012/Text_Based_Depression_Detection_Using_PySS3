Tonight is one of those nights where if I had the guts to do it, I would.When I think about how nobody truly cares about me(people claim they do but they actually don't), sometimes the feeling of loneliness becomes too much for me. All night I just hear "31 year old virgin and I deserve it because I'm a selfish a-hole" over and over to the point where if it takes ending it to end the thoughts, I honestly would if I had the nerve. I have no friends. People pm me offering to be my friend but they don't understand what being truly alone is like and just give me the same platitudes everyone else has told me over the years. Some of them don't want to want me to feel better, but to feel better about themselves so they can tell themselves "I tried to help but he didn't want to help himself so  he can only blame himself. When you spend every minute of every day of every week over every month of all of your adult life alone, eventually you reach a breaking point. I haven't worked up the nerve to hit mine but ending my miserable existence seems like a better idea every day.
