WhyWhy am I even still alive


I dropped out from school, unable to stay strong under the pressure of depression. I am unable to find a job. All I can do is leech my parents to take care of my depressive self. Everything I do feels like is going toward failure, and I'm just bothering everyone with my attitude.

I wish I could have succeeded at killing myself after 3 attempts.
I wish I could die and stop bothering my surroundings and stop ruining everyone's mood.
I'm worth no one's time or money.

Why did I have to be such a failure...
