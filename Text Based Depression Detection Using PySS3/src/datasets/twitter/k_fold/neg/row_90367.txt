Spiralling downI'm gonna start this with a bit of basic information about me - I'm 18, male, from the UK. From the outside I imagine my life looks pretty good, I have good friends, I do well in school, no family problems really, can play guitar decently well etc. etc. I pretty much always look cheerful. So why the fuck am I like this? I've wanted to kill myself for months now, I haven't been properly happy in years. I just feel so fucking empty, and I'm so fucking tired from having to pretend to all my friends that I'm a happy, well rounded person who's life is going pretty well. I've been using speed, drinking, and smoking weed a shit load recently, but it only helps so much. I don't think I'll act on it any time soon, but I fucking want to. Everything is just getting worse, I'm just about holding it together but I don't think that'll last. I can't really get proper help any time soon either, the waiting list takes over a year in my area. And that'd require me to have a fucking backbone, be responsible, and deal with things in a healthy way, and that's not me. I probably wouldn't even be making this post if it wasn't for the drugs I'm on. Christ, I'm a fuckup.
