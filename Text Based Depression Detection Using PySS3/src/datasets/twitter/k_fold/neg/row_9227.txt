My best friend's ex attempted suicide last night (again). How can I help my friend?Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit. If it's not it'd be appreciated if someone could tell me where this goes.

Anyway, last night I was with my friend and she gets a call from her ex. He's drunk, lost, needs a ride home, and has nobody else to turn to. She reluctantly leaves, then calls me later. Turns out he tried to drink himself to death. This is his third attempt in the last 6 months, and I can tell it's destroying my friend. She's been incredible through all of this and really supportive of him. But I just feel powerless, like all I can do is sit back and watch as she dies from the inside out because of this. What can I do to help her?
