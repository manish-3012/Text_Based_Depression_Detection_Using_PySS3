Why? Why am I still here?I don't understand it. 

To start off, I successfully took my own life 4 years ago in mid-February. This was at a large student party. I was not a student of this college nor did I know anyone other than the person that invited me. The student housing we were in was about an hour and a half away from my home. That night I took the local high-speed train up to the dorms where the party was. I planned on not going home. The party started out slow, eventually picking up as the night had gone on. I was making my own drinks. It took roughly an hour of sloshing back screwdrivers to have me wanting to vomit. The alcohol, the acid, and the sugar were coming up. I stumbled into the bathroom inside the small two bedroom dorm. Once in there, I vaguely remember lifting the toilet seat to puke. Next thing, I woke in a hospital bed really needing to piss. I jolted up out of fear and not knowing how the hell I got there, only to see my father sitting next to my hospital bed. He told me the details of what happened after my memory went blank. I had fallen over in the bathroom, hit my head, and proceeded to choke on my vomit until I stopped moving. The guy that invited me to the party noticed I was missing and found me dead in the bathroom. He picked me up and began trying to resuscitate me, even through my vomit covered face/torso. He yelled to one of the other party goers to call the paramedics; they arrived within 4 minutes. Thanks to the guys attempt at reviving me, it kept oxygen and blood flow going long enough for the paramedics to bring me back. I'll never be able to live this down. 

But my question is, why? Why did he have to keep me going? I just wanted to die. I knew what I was doing that night. I didn't want to return home. 

I have nightmares about this still. I wish I was dead. I don't want to redo it. It was so painful to begin with. I have to retry soon. I can't keep continuing to think my life has any value.
