Im doneJust fucking kill me. Im so sick all the time and nobody can tell me what I have. They always brush it off saying "its your anxiety" or my mom who loves to blame everything on my periods no matter where I am in my cycle. Like even is im right in between two she'll be like "oh its probably your pms starting early" to her im always in my fucking pms. Now shes talking about how my room is messy even tho she knows ive been almost unable to leave bed for the past three days but she wont do shit about the rest of the house that has been a shit hole my entire life and no one can touch anything bc then she wont be able to find her stuff and have a fucking breakdown. My doctor is trying so hard (and I really appreciate him for that) but he cant find anything. I just want to give up. Im just weak. But Im too much of a fucking coward to fucking end it! FUCK!
