I don't want to die, but I don't know how to go on.Things are shit at work. I am unable to work effectively and feel intense guilt and shame about that.  I'm on a new project and I have no idea what I'm doing.

I'm looking for a new job, but this is draining even more of my energy.  

Life feels like a long tunnel of slow decay until death.
