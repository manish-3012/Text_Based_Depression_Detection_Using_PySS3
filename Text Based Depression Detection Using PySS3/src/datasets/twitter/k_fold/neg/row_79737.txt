I need to get it off my chestIâ€™m 22. I was born in Australia to a mother who Iâ€™ve learned recently may have actually kidnapped me and isnâ€™t my real mother. I was brought to America as a baby and told almost zero info about where Iâ€™m from. Iâ€™ve never had a real relationship with my bio father, heâ€™s still in AUS. My mom brought me here as a baby and my stepdad raised me. My mother abused me and my sisters and my dad. I mean, attempted murder and told Iâ€™d never be able to leave her house even as an adult or sheâ€™d do horrible things abused. 
My life has been a fucking joke. Iâ€™ve been bullied. Iâ€™ve been assaulted. Iâ€™ve been made to feel so small my whole life. 
Iâ€™ve experienced love that was reciprocated only once and it wasnâ€™t by a parent but by a high school boyfriend. We dated for two years. I met him 8 years ago and Iâ€™ve never stopped thinking about him. Iâ€™ve tried everything, Iâ€™ve been with my new partner for 5 years and yet I secretly want nothing more than to have my ex back. Heâ€™s married now. I love and miss him every day but Iâ€™m not even in love with my partner anymore. 
School was hard. I was too depressed and anxious bc of the abuse at home to really do well in school. I tried to get help from a counselor and she did nothing. My exâ€™s mother was going to legally adopt me and help get me out of that house but unfortunately he got tired of me. I donâ€™t blame him. His family was filthy rich while mine was poor and they were going to pay for me to go to the college I really wanted to go to. That obviously fell through. 
I graduated when I was 17 and went to a tech school that I had to pay out of pocket. Full time college and three jobs. My parents helped none. At 20 I bought my car. I still wasnâ€™t allowed to go anywhere but work. My boyfriend was a secret bc I wasnâ€™t allowed to date. At 20. 
My boyfriend is just so aggravating. Itâ€™s been 5 years, Iâ€™ve lived with him for 2 (I was able to leave when my dad finally kicked my mom out and divorced her. I ran at the first opportunity and never looked back). My bf doesnâ€™t take me on dates. Heâ€™s difficult, argumentative, inconsiderate, dismissive, all that shit. Heâ€™s never abused me I donâ€™t think. But he hasnâ€™t been good to me either. Weâ€™re great friends but we wonâ€™t make it as partners. He hasnâ€™t ever taken me on a date. Heâ€™s never planned anything for me, though sometimes he pays if I plan to go somewhere. Heâ€™s messy. He doesnâ€™t pay for any of the furniture. I didnâ€™t mind paying bc I became a stripper and made decent money. But he couldâ€™ve done something. $4 flowers from Walmart. Taken me on a hike. Fucking something. But he doesnâ€™t. 
Iâ€™m not working anymore. Iâ€™ve gotten pretty bad with drug use to the point I canâ€™t go without weed and/or coke in my system. I got fired from that club and bc of covid (and a newly developed, crippling anxiety) havenâ€™t gone back yet so I have a sugar daddy to help with my bills. Iâ€™m getting by. 
Iâ€™m not happy though. I never have been. My first time considering suicide I was 8 years old. My attempts didnâ€™t work and almost no one knows i tried. Do you know how embarrassing it is to swallow a bottle of acetaminophen bc you have nothing else, just to wake up in the morning and have to go to school like nothing happened? I feel like shit every day. The love of my life is married to someone else and I canâ€™t leave my current boyfriend because we signed a lease that doesnâ€™t end for another year, I canâ€™t afford to break it. I canâ€™t sleep because of how depressed I am, Iâ€™ve been gaining weight and feeling absolutely horrible about my appearance. I have one friend. I have no guidance, no life purpose, no plans, I go days without sleeping sometimes because Iâ€™m so burdened and because my stupid boyfriend snores so fucking loud and keeps me up. All I want to do is sleep, itâ€™s the only thing that helps and I canâ€™t even have that. Iâ€™ve been doing every kind of drug and they arenâ€™t helping. I have no one to reach out to. I have like, friends that follow me and that I sorta exchange comments with but I canâ€™t talk to them. I barely know these people. I post about wanting to die, I even was making jokes about it the day I smoked crack for the first time and no one really cared. I donâ€™t expect anyone to, and I know itâ€™s my responsibility to reach out but it would be nice you know?
I donâ€™t want to hurt my sister and I donâ€™t want to leave my cats with my irresponsible boyfriend. I donâ€™t want to tell him I donâ€™t trust him with my belongings when Iâ€™m gone. The suicide hotline does not help. I have no one. 
Today my cat knocked my avocado off the counter and destroyed it and it sent me into a mental breakdown thatâ€™s still going, that Iâ€™ve been suppressing for probably months. I thought today about how lucky people are to have a reason to believe in a god. If heâ€™s out there he abandoned me just like my parents did and I want nothing to do with him. 
I just feel miserable and I feel like Iâ€™ve been failed by everyone including myself. I dropped out of college my third year because I couldnâ€™t afford to keep going. I moved to a different city and nothing has changed. I was expecting to feel better when I finally got out of that prison of a home but to my disappointment I still feel like shit. Iâ€™m just tired. 
I brought this here because I have no one else. This is my first time using reddit. I just wanted to get it out there because I canâ€™t talk to anyone else. My suicide note has been in my notes app for a couple months and I think Iâ€™m ready now. Iâ€™ve been very generous with what little money I have because I donâ€™t need it anymore. I hope my cats donâ€™t grieve for long. I donâ€™t have to worry about hurting my moms feelings, she wonâ€™t care. But Iâ€™m worried for my sister. I donâ€™t want her to hurt but I really canâ€™t keep doing this. 
I already know how I want to do it. I just know that my life has run itâ€™s course and thereâ€™s no possible way to make it better. And if there is I honestly donâ€™t think I want to. I dealt with a lot of shit I didnâ€™t deserve but Iâ€™m too tired to keep trying to heal when every bit of progress I make is met with another disaster. I canâ€™t do it. 

I donâ€™t want to be talked down. When I attempted I never felt that last minute feeling of, I regret this and life might get better. At this point Iâ€™m more scared of failing again, or the idea that there might be an afterlife and Iâ€™ll have to continue existing. I think Iâ€™ve made up my mind. I just had to say it somewhere.
