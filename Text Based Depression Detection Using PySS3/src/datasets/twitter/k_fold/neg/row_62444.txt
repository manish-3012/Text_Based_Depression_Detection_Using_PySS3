I keep creeping closer to giving up I want to die. I really want to die. I'm simply a failure. I guess my mum's right, I am crazy. I cannot deal with myself when I get things wrong, and it destroys me. I was doing a maths paper and got stuck and couldn't figure it out and I started to cry and just stab myself with my pen once I looked up the answer. It kills me. The idea of failure breaks me up inside and makes we want to just walk down and stab myself. It feels like I'm being rendered completely futile. I don't know what to do anymore. If I don't get the grades I need in my GCSEs I'm quite simply killing myself, because at that point, life won't be worth living. I'll have wasted all my parents time and money.
