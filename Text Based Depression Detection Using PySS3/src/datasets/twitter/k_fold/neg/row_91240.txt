Every since my dad passed I want to join him.Last year, in December, my dad suddenly passed away from a fatal work accident. 

My family is shattered from the loss. My mom had to sell her business, and I am just here trying my best to juggle school, work, picking up the slack from everything else my dad left for us, and caring for my mom whenever she becomes really sad. School is easy enough, work is grudgingly mundane, but the hardest part is seeing my mom be broken, deteriorate ; ie she is losing a lot of weight, and not be able to help her whatsoever. Sure I know the errands I do have a direct effect on her but she still cries every night and it drives me to insanity. I obviously can't expect her to suddenly be ok and not cry anymore for an extremely long time, but that and the simple fact that I miss the person in my life that made me who I am is crippling. I turned 21 a month after my dad died, and I had to start school because I registered shortly prior before his loss, and all of those experiences distracted me from as well as amplified the reality that I will never be in contact with this person again. 

Ive been thinking that I want to join my dad. However I saw a post here that talked about contemplating taking your own life but stopping yourself because you don't want to make life much harder for those you leave behind. And I think that is a big reason why I'm even here. The sheer thought of how my mom would be if I committed suicide is unbearable, and my brother, my friends. 

However at the same time I feel like this traps me because I feel a sense of true isolation and loneliness because before my father passed I was hardly relatable as is, and now with my Father's sudden passing I feel that absolutely no one whatsoever will relate to me at all. Everyone insists either indirectly or directly, for me to simply "get over it" or "accept it" and move on. And this pushes me further away from society and reality because this is undisputable truth that they do not understand what I am going through. And I've tried reconciling and accommodating that ideal because I feel that it is more or less the true, objective way to react to a situation like this, but it just feels impossible for me. I just feel so alone. None of my closest friends have gone through something like this. 

I've constantly been thinking of tasting an end of a pistol while I just blow my brains out and just become truly selfish with my decisions. I just feel that I should be with my dad again.
