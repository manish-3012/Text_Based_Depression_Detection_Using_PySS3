I am officially totally aloneIs there any point anymore? I've lost my last real relationship, and it was the one that mattered most to me. Because I am pulled in fifty different directions, in charge of caring for an elderly family member, and failing to do what I need to do to keep up my one last real connection. I think I'm done. Help...
