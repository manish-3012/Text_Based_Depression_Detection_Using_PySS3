Why am I not enough?My mom always wanted more kids. But she only had me before tying her tubes. Then she met my stepfather. Now she wants more kids with him. She always tells me she wants more. And, oh how nice it would be to have kids. and from my intepretations, she has never directly said this to me but, its my fault she got her tubes tied. She constantly threatens me, with hitting and grounding. Aswell as taking stuff away, like clothes and bedding. And she tells me that she can easily  get rid of me. I dont know how to handle this anymore. I have planned multiple versions of suicide, each one grosser than the last.. But Im still here. Because I only think of my dad, and me being his only child. and how horrible it would be for him. and im worried  for my cats and my friends. I want to hurt myself and her so bad, but i cant do it. I cry so much, that I get headaches from it. I just want to be enough, and not feel like an outsider. I want to feel loved, and cared for. I want to be lifted up and held in someones arms. But with her abusive and narsistisstic tendincies, I cant go through a day at school or a night without crying. Help me. What should I do?
