Its getting worse and worseWorse and worse. More and more Iâ€™m giving up. This week I maybe left my bed for 1 hour. Only to get beer to get drunk by myself. I dont see a future. The only thing holding me back is I dont want to hurt my sisters and mother. I love them so much but I canâ€™t bring myself to show any love. Nobody has ever told me they love me, so how can I love others? I canâ€™t push myself to live another year just to suffer. Maybe Iâ€™ll make this my last year. I donâ€™t know yet. I just want someone to love me and to love them back.
