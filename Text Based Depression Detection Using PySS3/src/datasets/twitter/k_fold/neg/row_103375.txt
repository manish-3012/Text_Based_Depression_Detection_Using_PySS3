I want to go away.I always thought that im not worth for anything. Because my family makes me think that way. 6 years of partner let me think that way.

Everybody let me think im not worthy.

Now, i am the strongest thinker in that way.

I dont want to live, years ago when this idea come to my mind i always thought about my familiy and loved ones and think their hurt after i killed myself but now that is not in my mind.

I dont want to die, i wish ive been never existed. I dont want to live with myself.

I hate myself.

Everyday in mirror, i see i monster, uglier, bigger, i want to go.

I want to disappear.
