2019 JanuaryAbove is the date that I plan to end my life.
I thought for about a year. And decided that it would be the best thing for me. I try to never give up and always look to improve and progress. I have a real desire to succeed and I crave it. And every day wasted feels like I lost. But every time I'm on the edge of starting or creating  something great, it suddenly disgusts me. And I never do it. My boss is also my step father and that brings me great anxiety for various reasons. So yeah without saying to much pretty typical 19 year old. 

So I am going to vlog from probably next week until then just because why the hell not ya know. I don't want any help lines I dont want anyone to tell me how special I am and how if I keep trying its ganna get better. I don't want to try any more.
