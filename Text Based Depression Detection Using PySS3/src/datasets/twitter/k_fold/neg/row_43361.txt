Feel like a burdenI don't want to die, but can't stop thinking about killing myself. For 12 years I've been the main provider for my family, being my partner of 12 years, my 7 year old daughter and my
3 year old son. Last year I started having issues with my fingers curling up, which progressed to muscles wasting in my hands, forearms, shoulders and thighs. It now seems to be effecting my calves and feet. 

We went to a neurologist at the start of the year and he diagnosed me with possible MMN with conduction block, but couldn't rule out MND/ALS. Since starting the treatment for MMN it has had no effect. Currently I can barely stand up, lower seated positions make it impossible for me to get out of; about 1kg is the limit to what my hands can handle (If I can grip at all).

I'm still mostly self sustaining and look after our son while my partner works, I've been put on extended leave at work - but have no pay, so we've lost my 2000 a fortnight wage. We are struggling, and I just feel like I'm a burden on the family now - if I keep getting worse I cannot imagine how much of a burden I'll be on them. I don't want the kids to remember me as a thing in a chair or bed that just stopped them and their mother from doing anything in life.
