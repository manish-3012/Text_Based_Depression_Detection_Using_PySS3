Stock piled pills...I have many diagnoses and am on many different medications for them. I knew I was forgetting to take my morning and afternoon medications for quite a while (I always take my night ones or else I have zero chance to sleep). So tonight I found all my old blister packs (because of my history of overdoses and going into a coma Iâ€™m only allowed my medications in a weekly blister pack not monthly). I decided to grab all my old packages from every closet and shelf and count the medications I have. I have 80 mg of clonazepam all from missing dosages in the mornings and afternoons. So clearly I know thereâ€™s a good chance my getting worse has to do with not taking all of my meds but I guess I subconsciously starting stockpiling my medications â€œjust in caseâ€. Thatâ€™s just the ones Iâ€™ve missed but I also sometimes stockpile my seroquel and donâ€™t sleep for days. Part of me wants to take them all so much right now. But a small part of me is holding back...for now...
