I want to die and end the infinite pain but I will keep on living to look after my homies.There's nothing more painful to me then having my best friends hear that i have taken my own life. I would rather endure till everything is numb and be with them rather than ending the pain right now. If it weren't for them I would have overdosed a year ago.

If it means enduring this much suffering to still be able to talk and have a drink with them then for me life is still worth living. They're the ones who color my gray world. I couldn't be more thankful to them and in return I would like to ensure that they are happy and I will look after them and support them till we grow old.
