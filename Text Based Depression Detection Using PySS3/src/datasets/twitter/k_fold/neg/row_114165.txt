Personal Finance Worsening SII finally did it, I finally unsubscribed to r/personalfinance. But not before that sub kind of knocked me down and Iâ€™m struggling to get back up. 

I subbed to personal finance a while back, because I thought it would be responsible and helpful advice, but itâ€™s really just worsened my anxiety and a thread last night made me so much worse. It was a thread about someoneâ€™s fiancÃ© having a lot of student debt and there were so many people in the thread telling OP their fiancÃ© was stupid, telling them not to get married, to leave the relationship and it just really set me off. 

Iâ€™m 27. Single. In a field where itâ€™s unlikely Iâ€™ll ever make a ton of money. Big student loans from undergrad because I was stupid at 18. (In graduate school but with very small loans, almost entirely funded and 0 other debt, no car loan, no credit card debt). I donâ€™t have the skills or intent to transfer into something more lucrative. I want to be in a relationship, I want to have kids. I already struggle with feeling â€œworthyâ€ of anything and this thread just really made that worse. I feel like I donâ€™t deserve a partner, donâ€™t deserve a family because of my past financial mistakes, which Iâ€™ll be paying off for a long time. Itâ€™s super easy for my brain to make the jump to â€œnot deserving of love, just give up.â€

And the phrases they use, itâ€™s like each one rings in my head like â€œitâ€™s all over, just give up.â€ Calling things a â€œfinancial death sentenceâ€. Begging OP not to have kids. I feel like last night it all just really sunk in and even though I did the right thing and removed myself from that situation, I canâ€™t seem to shake it. 

Note: I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m in a severe crisis or anything. Itâ€™s more that I have persistent low level SI that was made significantly worse by that thread. I have a very supportive and loving family, but both of my parents have had suicide in their immediate family (one a sibling, the other a parent) and they take it very, very seriously. Which ironically makes it more difficult to talk to them about this low level SI because Iâ€™m afraid theyâ€™re going to take it as a crisis. And Iâ€™m the oldest, and donâ€™t want to burden my younger siblings with this. (But on the flip side, I also know I canâ€™t burden them with my actual suicide, because Iâ€™ve seen what it did to my parent who lost their sibling.) But yeah while theyâ€™re very supportive and I can talk to them about almost anything, canâ€™t talk to them about this. So Iâ€™m taking it to strangers on the internet!

I also donâ€™t want it to seem like Iâ€™m blaming r/personalfinance. Yeah some of their users were saying some pretty horrible things, but itâ€™s totally on me to curate my online experience, to make sure I avoid things that make my mental health worse. That sub has provided me with some great budgeting advice in the past, Iâ€™m definitely not blaming them! 

Thanks for listening, strangers &lt;3
