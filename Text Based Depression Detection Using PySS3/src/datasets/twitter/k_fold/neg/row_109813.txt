Passively SuicidalI feel suicidal all the time. I know that sounds dramatic, but it's pretty true. Whenever I have time to think, I think about killing myself. I ranges from thinking about methods to actually seeing images of my mind of me dead of various causes. I have a plan in place, but don't currently plan on carrying it out anytime soon. It's like something that I keep in my pocket for when I need it. I have gotten pretty good at knowing when my ideations are becoming too serious and taking myself to the hospital, but I'm certain that one day I just won't have it in me to do that. I don't want to hurt my family, but also feel as though I am a burden to them just being alive. I usually feel like one big painful event would be less terrible for them than seeing suffering with my mental illnesses every day.
