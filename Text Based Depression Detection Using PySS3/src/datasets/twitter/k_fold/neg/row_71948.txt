EndlessIâ€™ve been crying for hours and havenâ€™t been able to sleep all night. I feel extremely anxious. I feel trapped in my body and trapped in my mind. These are pretty new feelings for me. 
Iâ€™m not proud of many things that Iâ€™ve done. I reflect back at my life and I have largely been selfish, self centered, and unappreciative. I think I have an addictive personality. I kick one thing and soon enough Iâ€™m struggling to quit a new addiction. 
I have what seems like at least one major fuck up a year. In hindsight itâ€™s always due to my own shortsightedness and extreme stupidity.
I think about suicide fairly often. For over a decade I have thought about suicide fairly regularly. I feel almost certain itâ€™s the way Iâ€™ll go one day.
The way people treat others makes me so sad. The way some people view fellow humans like pawns on a chess board, like a tool to be used for their own means and then discarded. The way we treat elderly, the poor, drug addicts. It makes me extremely sad, it makes me want to give up. I feel like I donâ€™t have the heart , or lack there of for this world.
