this made me depressed man :&gt;(Its 2011, your listening to â€˜party rockâ€™ out of your phone on max volume walking around school. Its also mufti day and everyones checking out everyones snapbacks and looking inside to see if its real or not, you are pulling up your light blue swag pants and taking off your kathmandu jacket when it was way too hot to wear in the first place, you also have a cold juicy from the canteen. You hate Justin Bieber but want his hair. Theres a group of kids around the toilets and someones planning on pashing someone else but the girl is too â€œfridgetâ€. Now your contemplating to play handball or not..

deep stuff tbh
