planning to launch myself into a pit of despair that will lead to suicideI've already had one attempt, institutionalized and put on meds.

ive been on these meds for a while now and am planning to stop taking them by either hiding them in my mouth or throwing them up after i take them cause my mom watches me take them. i also plan to stop social interactions and hole myself up for long enough so that hopefully with the combination of both of these ill finally be miserable enough to kill myself.

I'm not really sure why im posting here, i dont want to get better and there is little to any hope to get better but I dont really care. Maybe it has something to do with wanting to have an impact on other people or something social that has been deeply rooted in our genetics.  


I know i dont matter and that my post doesnt matter and that it will likely go unnoticed in the sea of others but i also really dont care. im 1 grain of sand on   
a beach so it really doesnt matter.
