My ex told me to kill myself, knowing Iâ€™m suicidal100% serious responses only please. Iâ€™m at a loss. I spent two years with this guy. Gave everything I had, drove him around for two years when he wouldnâ€™t keep a job or get a car, I loved him so much but he emotionally abused me and physically. We had a child three months into the relationship &amp; he passed away of sids. Thatâ€™s when the abuse started. I stuck it out because I loved him, even when he hurt me, &amp; didnâ€™t show any love.

Weâ€™ve been broken up a month &amp; a half, &amp; after having invested so much time, I thought maybe things would change &amp; we started talking again. I tell him Iâ€™m eating lunch &amp; donâ€™t reply for a few hours &amp; he goes off about me being on a â€œdateâ€ (I wasnâ€™t), it became a fight, non-suicidally I said he makes me wanna drive into a tree and he said â€œif youâ€™re gonna kill yourself then do it already. I know you wonâ€™t. So just do it.â€

Iâ€™m bipolar &amp; off my meds because Of jaw and muscle issues, which he knows, &amp; Iâ€™ve been suicidal throughout the relationship, mainly triggered by the isolation and toxicity, I was doing fine at the moment but hearing that from someone who says he loves me really hurt. He was the main person in my life. My friends donâ€™t answer my calls, my family defends my ex, my son is dead, I feel so alone in the world. When he said that, I considered jumping from the tallest building I know. I cried for hours. I canâ€™t believe I still care about someone who preys on my weaknesses.

I feel so alone...it would be nice to have peace at last....

(Tl;dr) ex or two years triggers severe suicidal thoughts &amp; when I tried to work things out with him he told me to kill myself. I feel alone
