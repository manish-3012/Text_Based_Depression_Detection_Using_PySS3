I'm going to do itI failed again

I failed again

I failed again

I cannot do this anymore I'm so useless and hopeless

I just wanted to be content

All I had to do was focus on the future

I'm weak

And stupid

And a failure 

I had opportunities and I let them slip by and I don't love myself 

I can't do this

I don't want to die but I don't think I have a choice anymore
