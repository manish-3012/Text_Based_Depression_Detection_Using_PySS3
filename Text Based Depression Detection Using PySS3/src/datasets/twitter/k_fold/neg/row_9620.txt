Cops didn't find meI was suicidal last week and asked the animal shelter about giving up my cat. The shelter then contacted the police for a welfare check. The found another girl with my same name and then closed the check. Found out after a different cop was doing another follow up just as a general hey how you doing from last week. I never had contact with anyone and didn't even know there was a check sent out for me. 
I feel weird that they missed it not being me. Im ok but now I wonder how many people have been missed from mistakes like not checking an ID or something.
