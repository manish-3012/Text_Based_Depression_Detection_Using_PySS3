I think Iâ€™m goneIâ€™m sitting here covered in blood from self harming with the gun loaded next to me because I think itâ€™s time to end it.

Iâ€™ve had a really great past few weeks and I thought I was making some actual progress. But here I am. I shouldâ€™ve learned by now that thereâ€™s no hope for me and that any progress will always send me straight back here. 

It doesnâ€™t feel like thereâ€™s anyone out there that cares about me.

It felt like it would be so easy pulling the trigger once I had the gun to my head. I could almost feel the energy leaving my body. I also felt a bit of peace.

I think Iâ€™m going to go away any day now.
