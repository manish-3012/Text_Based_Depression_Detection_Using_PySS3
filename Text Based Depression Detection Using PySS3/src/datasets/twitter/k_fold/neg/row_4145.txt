he left today. Itâ€™s taking everything I have to stay aliveI was in a toxic, one sided relationship from 2019 til now. During that time I was gaslighted, constantly walking on eggshells, and dealing with severe anxiety that Iâ€™ve had for the past decade. He told me he wanted to marry me, wanted kids, etc. Right before he told me it wasnâ€™t working we had sex which makes me feel even more used. I know most people will say this isnâ€™t a good enough reason to feel suicidal and that everyone goes through this. Iâ€™ve been crying and drinking all day. Itâ€™s 3 am and nobody is awake. Iâ€™m afraid to sleep and dream of him then wake up feeling so anxious I throw up.
