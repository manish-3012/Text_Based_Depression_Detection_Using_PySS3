Im a failureAll i can ever think of now is all the ways ive failed and all the things i cant undo. Theres no point in a worthless piece of shit like me living. Im absolutely disgusting. All I'm ever going to do is hurt people. And even if this hurts people, itll be the last action i take that hurts people, right? Im not ready to be done living. Theres still so much i had planned, but ive fucked all of that up anyway. Im just so desperate. Its pathetic.
