Family: The Only Reason I'm HereDoes anyone else feel this way? Dating, booze, sports, careers, and the hobbies we keep ourselves occupied with are just to pass the time and stay focused on the "better" things. It's almost like creating a delusion to stay happy. This is how I feel. There is no meaning in life until you give meaning.   
What if some of us just fail to find meaning? JUST to live is not good enough, but to know you still put a smile on someone's face might just be enough. To know that someone thinks about you, wonders how you are fairing, and cannot wait for you to grace their presence again is something I find in family that I cannot find in anything else. I can't count the amount of "acquaintances" I've had that have entered my life, appearing to be concrete and measurable, to be able to stand the test of time, and have just fallen away, to leave me more alone than before.  The only reason I stick it out, and keep pushing on, is because I know I mean something to someone.   
  When I get into arguments with them, or I feel like they've alienated me in some way, that is when I truly feel life is worthless.  
If anything I'm living FOR them.
  My family.
  My parents and my sister.  
If it wasn't for them, if they ceased to exist today... I would not hesitate to end my life. Not a single question would cross my mind. I seriously would have nothing left to live for. Does anyone else feel this way about life, or loved ones?
