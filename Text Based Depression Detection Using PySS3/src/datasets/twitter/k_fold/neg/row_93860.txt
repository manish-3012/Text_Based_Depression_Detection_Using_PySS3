It all makes sense now....I can't deny it anymore. I've always been picked on my whole life for being slow.. I have a learning disability. I've tried to ignore it for years but for some reason it just hit me and now everything makes sense...I'm retarded... It all makes sense now why I am the way I am... I've been rejected by society... How am i sapose to deal with being like this??? I am lesser than every person I meet. I can't even live on my own... I want to die. I'm a disappointment to my whole family. I'm deleting all social media right now
