Please stay strong !I am so broken inside and have been for weeks. A very important person in my life took their life. My brain hasn't been the same since. _x000D__x000D_Life is hard, I know all too well. Life becomes harder for those you leave behind. I wonder how my friend could make such a selfish choice when they knew continuing on would be hard for me. _x000D__x000D_My selfish wish to all who are struggling out there... Stay strong. Please. I know it's hard but if you leave, you make living harder for someone else._x000D__x000D_Please stay strong!
