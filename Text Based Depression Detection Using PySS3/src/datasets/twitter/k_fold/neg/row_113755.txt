Day 29That feeling you get when you've done something wrong. All eyes are somehow drawn to your attention. The enormous elephant that's in the room and still ignore it because you are there. That's how I felt yesterday at work. The hours dragged on but knowing that I was one call away from just breaking down mentally I made the excuse to go. Even though work felt eternal, it was a cakewalk compared to being at home. At least here I could shut off from the world and go unnoticed once again. When I awoke this morning from a my restless sleep we crossed paths in the living room. I opened my arms to her and she embraced me. I was holding her for the short time that it was. This touch I've been longing for, knowing what healing properties it has or just to make me feel that I'm all right. That's when I hear her starting to cry. I feel terrible once again, seeing as this interaction had the bizzaro effect on her. Brings me nothing but sadness.
