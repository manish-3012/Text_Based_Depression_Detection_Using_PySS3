Everyone will be better off with me gone.My boyfriend and I have fallen on hard times for a while.  After getting screwed over by my previous landlords and getting laid off from my job, this kind friend of ours and her mom allowed us to move in with them. 

We contributed where we could financially and honestly,  I finally felt like I had a family for the first time in a long time.  I have been depressed over not finding a job despite usually applying to over five places a day but I tried to keep my head up. 

Well, earlier this week,  I found out that my friend and her family have been resenting us (but primarily me) for a long time, especially since I am still jobless.  I thought we talked everything out but I can still sense the resentment and hatred. I can tell that they'll be kicking us both out (if not just me) soon. And honestly,  I don't blame them. I'm worthless and pathetic. I feel useless that no place even graces me with an interview despite my excellent sales record.  

I'm kind of making plans to kill myself this weekend.  I don't know what else to do. Maybe they'll allow him to stay if my parasitic self isn't around. Even if they don't,  everyone will be happier with me being gone. I really feel that this will be for the best. I've brought nothing of value into this world and I'll be taking nothing of value with me. 

I don't even know why I'm posting this here since I don't know what I want. I regret ruining the best friendships that I've ever had and I regret being such a loser.
