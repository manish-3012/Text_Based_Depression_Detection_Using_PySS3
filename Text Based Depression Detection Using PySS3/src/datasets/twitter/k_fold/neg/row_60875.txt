I canâ€™t take it anymoreThis is it. I canâ€™t keep doing this. I go to a fucking charter school because my parents thought it would help me learn, but I canâ€™t even do that correctly. I canâ€™t. I fucking procrastinate like nobodies fucking business and I blow it off and I KNOW I do it. I know itâ€™s WRONG but I canâ€™t stop. I have fucking ADHD and extreme social anxiety so itâ€™s very difficult for me to reach out, and believe me, Iâ€™ve tried. My parents said theyâ€™d get me a therapist and a year later, still no therapy. I have a knife, some pills, and a noose. Iâ€™m going to take my car, find a nice, secluded spot in the woods near my city, and Iâ€™m going to end it. Worst part is, I have no reason to feel this way. Iâ€™ve had a good life, I have a friend, used to have a girlfriend that cared about me, my parents try to help me, and I have a nice sister. But the pain never fucking STOPS. My life has become a monotonous repetition of events that I canâ€™t get out of. Iâ€™m sorry. I canâ€™t take it anymore.
