I'm don't want to feel anymore.I'm tired of feeling empty, alone around family, and just plain depressed 
I overthink and I can't stop this empty feeling. I deal with anxiety and even social anxiety.
I feel so shitty all the time,
I feel so alone and I feel like I'm dead already
So why not be right?
I mean I lost the best friend I've ever had a brother to me 
I lost my uncle to suicide 
And my Dad is dying to Hep C and he honestly is the only thing keeping me here 
I'm sick and tired of feeling this 
Why doesn't it stop? Why...
