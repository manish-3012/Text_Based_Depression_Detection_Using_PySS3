My girlfriend is suicidal. Help.I don't know what to do, she's been having suicidal thoughts and she says she's been having urges to take pills just to end her life. I'm not very good at this at all, we're both 22 years old and i've lived an unhappy life but i've never ever been to the point of wanting to harm myself. I can't put myself in her shoes to help her. I try to tell her the positives of life, and I try to tell her about how badly her family and friends would be affected if anything ever happened to her. And then I read the rules on this subr and it seems that's considered guilt tripping so I haven't been doing so well. She's been stressed out because she's about to get her masters, she has a full time job, and on top of that we've been having some stupid arguments every now and then. Just yesterday when I saw her, she had a piece of glass in her hand it looked like she was ready to hurt herself and she stopped because I started balling out crying trying to stop her. I can't go to her family, because she tells me if they ever find out they'll treat her like she's fragile and that if they ever find out, it'll be easier for her to take her own life. I tell her about seeing somebody, whether if she wants me to come also, but then she says she isn't comfortable sharing her thoughts with anybody else but me. What can I do to make her happy and try to help her get past this?
