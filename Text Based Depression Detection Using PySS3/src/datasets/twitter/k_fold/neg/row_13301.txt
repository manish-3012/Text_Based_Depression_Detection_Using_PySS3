She fell in love with someone elseI've been through this before. I swore I'd end my life if it happened again. It did. I am so humiliated.. I lost her. And it was my fault. I did it.. I cant even type... Im sorry. You matter to me.. i wish i could go back in time. Im going now. I hope you'll be OK but at least you'll know. Im glad we met. No regrets. I love you
