There's no way this doesn't end in me killing myself.I'm so hopeless. I've dropped out of college now. I have no future. I'm trapped in a prism of depression and anxiety that I will never be able to get out of. Therapy won't help me. This is just how I am due to whatever fucked up genes I was endowed with when I was brought into this world without being asked. I never should have made it this far. Before modern society let losers like me scrape by I would have died years ago because I'm too weak. In fact I would have died in childbirth and taken my mother without modern medicine. I'm biological jetsam whose undeserved existence is subsidized by an age of plenty. There's no reason for me to exist or pass on these shitty genetic traits to my progeny. I have zero chance of ever being a functioning human being. I have no reason to continue. Anxiety, paranoia, short attention span, inability to focus, social awkwardness, and low energy will keep me from making anything out of myself or producing even a modicum of value for society or my family. Every day I spend not dying and looking for a way out is a day spent prolonging the inevitable moment where I do those pulling me along a favor and cut the ropes. This doesn't end any other way.
