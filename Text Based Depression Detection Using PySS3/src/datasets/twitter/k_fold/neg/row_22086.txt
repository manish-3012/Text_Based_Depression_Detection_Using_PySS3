Can't live, can't dieToo scared to kill myself.

Too emotionally damaged and mentally scarred to go on.

This is far from a case of 'things will get better'. I have been this way for the better part of what I can remember, with circumstances &amp; the pain only getting worse. The effects are irreversible at this stage. It's who I am. A fucking lump of miserableness.
Inside, I don't even want to die. There's nothing I love more than the beauty and wonder of this world, yet I've unfortunately fallen victim to this continuous mind torment, and know there's no way out. What a waste.

I feel it's reached the absolute breaking point of tolerance. Those who feel similar, what are you doing to cope?/ resist ending it?
