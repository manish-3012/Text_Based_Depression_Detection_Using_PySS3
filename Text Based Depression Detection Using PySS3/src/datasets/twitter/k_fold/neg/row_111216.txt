I canâ€™t contact a suicide hotline.Iâ€™ve been very suicidal lately. I just need someone to talk to. I want to try to save myself. But it feels so hopeless. But I canâ€™t contact a suicidal hotline. My mom put restrictions on my phone. I have like every possible restriction on my phone since Iâ€™m still â€œgroundedâ€ for a while. I only got my phone because Iâ€™m living with my grandmother. But thereâ€™s a contact limit. I canâ€™t text anyone that isnâ€™t in my contacts without my mom being around. But weâ€™re in completely different states. I texted my aunt but I have no clue if sheâ€™ll ever respond. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
