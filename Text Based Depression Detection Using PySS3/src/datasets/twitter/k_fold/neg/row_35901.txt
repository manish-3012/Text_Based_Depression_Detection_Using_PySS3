Ok this is beyond a joke now!I've looked after my mother for many years, she died in November.  Now I've been diagnosed with cancer and am undergoing pre-surgery chemo.   As if that wasn't enough my dog (who I've had for 12 years) has lesions on his brain, likely cancerous. There's nothing they can do save for chemo, which I wouldn't put him through and can't afford anyway. 

Just how much does one person have to go through before they call it quits?  Am I allowed to go now?
