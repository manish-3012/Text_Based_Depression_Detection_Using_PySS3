It's just a matter of daysI'm in my last 3 classes of college this semester but I'm not even logging on to any lectures or doing any work. Life is dreadful and I don't see it getting better. It's just a matter of when the walls start caving in on me, that's when I'll be resigned to the fact that it's over for me. 

Just wanted to get it off my chest ya
