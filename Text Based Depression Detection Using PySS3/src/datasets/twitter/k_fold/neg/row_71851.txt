Maybe some people deserve to feel bad for your suicide. You donâ€™t even fucking try to help that much when you fully know Iâ€™m suicidal. Fuck this shitI donâ€™t want people suffering or having their life ruined over my suicide. But itâ€™s not fair to say itâ€™s not anyoneâ€™s fault when they donâ€™t even seem to care despite knowing someone is suicidal. I donâ€™t think my mom believes me and my best friend probably tries his best to avoid my feelings at this point.
