When failing to follow through deepens the depression.I have lived a life time of pain and the ups and downs of life. The constant pulling between the two is no longer appealing to me and I can't take being down so much all the time. I don't have a support network though I have people around me.

I made the decision to end my life, but I can't do it. Just another broken promise in my life. I'm so preoccupied with it that I am barely doing my work or taking care of myself at home.

Maybe someone can check on me later.
