I feel like a waste of space.I have no idea which direction life is pulling me into, I'm going into debt and nothing I try to do makes me truly happy. It honestly feels like every time I try to something simple I just fuck it up. I haven't attempted or contemplated suicide but Its been looming in the back of my head. I really just want a fresh start because of how much bullshit I'm getting dragged through.
