I just donâ€™t see the point anymoreLife is just too hard, I know you canâ€™t have success without struggle but society is just not fair, I try so hard everyday and it just seems like I get nowhere. Im only 24 and soon Iâ€™ll be living in my car, lost my job due to the stupid damn virus and now I canâ€™t even get a job even thought I have the qualifications and skills. Iâ€™ve been applying for months. Growing up I was always the pretty girl who was going to succeed and thrive in life, now look at me, no friends and soon no where to live, life isnâ€™t even giving me a damn chance, I have no luck no matter what I do. I just canâ€™t live like this anymore. Iâ€™ve always felt like Iâ€™ve been so unlucky my whole life. Whatâ€™s the point of living if you just work and work and work and never get a break, never get to truly live and do what you love, day in day out it is mindless routines and work and then having to deal with shitty judgemental hateful people, life after 25 is just is not worth living. 


And everywhere I look humans are being terrible to eachother, women being treated like we still live in the 1800â€™s and innocent children dying, innocent people dying, people always say the is a reason for everything, how tf is there a reason for a healthy innocent child to die. 

people still living in the streets, millions around the world starving and suffering while the rich buy their 5th mansion and eat gold incrusted chicken, itâ€™s 2020 how is this still happening. Life is not fair, I just donâ€™t see the point anymore. Humans are selfish they donâ€™t care about anything other than themselves. 

I just donâ€™t see a point the world is never going to get any better or become a fair place for everyone, not in my lifetime anyway, what is the fucking point of anything, one day you wake up at 60 worked half your life doing something you hate and never got to truly live or else youâ€™d starve or go homeless what is the fucking point of it all, what is the point. 
I hate it here.
