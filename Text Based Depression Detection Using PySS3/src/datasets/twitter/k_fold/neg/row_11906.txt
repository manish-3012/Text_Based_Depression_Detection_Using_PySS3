Thank god I don't live in AmericaAmerica is a shithole of a country.

Making people purposefully depressed just for money. 

Oh and if you are depressed you just need to pay a small price of 10000000$ so you can talk to some girl with a degree to tell you think that your solution is to be happy.

And it's not even about depression, it's about any other sickness or anything, you need to sell your kidney just for basic medical attention. And they call it "the free market", "medical staff needs to put food on their table as well" well they need to put bread on their table, not 5000000$ bread, Jesus christ how stupid people are.

Basically if you don't have enough money, your family will pay for your medications for generations, just because those greedy bastards need to "put food on their table". Pieces of shit.

In America, you have to pay to live, and live to work. You are paying to work so that you can be alive because your animal instincts are not allowing you to die. 

If you are dying and have little or money, you will die in America. 

They don't care about you if you don't have money, and if you do, they barely help you, they give you the bare minimum just so you can see another day to spend working.

American culture is fucking trash, everyone is obsessed about sex and people are depressed because of it. 

People dress and behave like shit, have no respect for each other, have no culture, no morals, they are obsessed with what other people think of them and are all slaves of capitalism and social media and they don't even know it.

I would already lose my mind if I were to live in America. 

And I live in a country I hate, Croatia. Also a shithole. But at least here you don't have to be Richie Rich to have a right to basic medical attention.

If you read this whole thing, wow thanks
