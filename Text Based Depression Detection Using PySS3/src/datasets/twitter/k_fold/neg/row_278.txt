People are so mean. Why must I be so sensitive in this world.I am so sensitive. I cry easily. I am emotionally affected by everything almost. I hate it. I have anxiety and can't talk to people. I can't handle aggression at all. I don't want to be here. The world feels so cold, cruel, and distant. I feel like a scared deer alone.
