Therapy and pills aren't workingI can't be fixed. I think I need to do something drastic because no one will help me die. I'm just so tired of everything hurting. Both physically and mentally. I am a freak, nothing on me works correctly. Seriously, name a body part and I'll tell you what is wrong with it. Please someone kill me.
