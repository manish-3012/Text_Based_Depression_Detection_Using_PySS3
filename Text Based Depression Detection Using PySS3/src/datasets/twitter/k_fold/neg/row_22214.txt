Goodbye world. I'm ready.In a few minutes, I'm going to end my life. I have no friends, no living family, and turned 40 today. When I was 16, I vowed that I would end my life if I was still single (never had a boyfriend, never had a date) by the time I turned 40. In the meantime, I was going to live my life as fully as I could by myself. I've done that and here I am, 40 as of today, and still alone. I never imagined it would actually turn out this way, but it did. Sometimes, things just don't get better, regardless of what statistics show. To work my my nerve, I chatted with someone on the suicide hotline for awhile. That convo definitely helped convince me that stalling is unfair to myself.

As I said, no friends, no family. I own my home in a very rural area. I don't work and all of my utilities are paid up six months. I have no debt. There's a good chance my body won't be discovered for weeks, if not months. I just wanted someone to know I was doing this. I don't know why. It just feels better knowing someone, even rando anons on Reddit, know.

I'm disappointed, but that's how it goes. Time to do this.
