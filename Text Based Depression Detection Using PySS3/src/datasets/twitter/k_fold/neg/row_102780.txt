I'm scared to tell my friend that I am not going back to school.Of late, there has been a lot of fear in my heart concerning going back to school. I am a couple of classes short of completing my degree in Animal Science, but have been slow to reapply to my university, to the point where I have needed to place an application for the fall of next year. However, I had been hiding this from my friend/roommate, who had been wanting me to go back since last year. I had been hiding the fact that I didn't reapply for spring to the point of lying about it because I didn't want him to judge me.

At one point the truth will come out, but I am afraid admit this to my friend, who had high hopes of my graduating by the end of this year. The thought of suicide and suicidal image invades my mind in stressful situations that may or may not be. We have been friends for a long time and I don't want to lose his companionship.
