I attempted to hang myself todayI wrapped a scarf around my neck and hung myself in my closet... that was until I woke up on the floor convulsing. I mustâ€™ve blacked out and the scarf came undone from the closet. 

I remember waking up without realizing that I was awake. I felt nauseous with a headache and in panic. I was having flashbacks to everything that was causing me to commit suicide. I remember thinking â€œoh itâ€™s just a movie Iâ€™m so glad thatâ€™s not my lifeâ€ but then as I continuied to gain consciousness I realized that it was real and that it was MY life. 

I lost it at that point and was yelling/crying â€œwhy!â€, â€œI was so close!â€, â€œnooooooo!â€ And getting really angry.
I had no remorse and was mad that I wasnâ€™t able to complete my mission

It the evening now and I still have no regrets over what I did. Believe it or not I was at piece with myself during that initial blackout and was probably the happiest Iâ€™d been in a long timeâ€

My neck is sore and I have a red ring around my neck. I have a headache and some bruising on my body as I think I might have hit something on my way down.

Iâ€™m gonna try again tmr with a belt and see if that works
