I'm done, I'm leaving.I'll try as hard as I can but I will never get anywhere in life. I already failed out of university once and I don't think I'll be making it in on my 2nd try. I have no friends at university either. I'm always alone and worthless. I hate school, I hate my life and my family can't do shit about it. Hell they've been causing me more and more distress. If I'm gone then they won't have to lie about my university failures anymore to uphold their respect. Try as they might they don't know how to deal with my mental health issues. So I'll take care of it myself. This week.
