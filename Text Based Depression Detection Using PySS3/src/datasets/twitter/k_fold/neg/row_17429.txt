please just listenI'm 15 and I desperately want to die. I don't want to kill myself as a way out, not for a solution. I believe I deserve to die because i'm a terrible person. I can't rationalize anything anymore, I can't feel love or feel at all. I can't get professional help, there are no methods of coping. I want someone to talk to. I'm so selfish for not trying to help the others on here.
