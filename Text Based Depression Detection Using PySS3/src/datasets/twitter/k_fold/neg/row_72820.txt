Lost my job, my dog died, Iâ€™m out the military, employer refusing to give me my W2â€™s and 6 days until my rents dueAll these major life events are happening back to back and I donâ€™t think I can deal with them all. Iâ€™m in a city all by myself no family, I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to survive these past two weeks Iâ€™ve just been taking muscle relaxers and Xanax to put me to sleep. I just feel like taking more and more overdosing and just getting out here.
