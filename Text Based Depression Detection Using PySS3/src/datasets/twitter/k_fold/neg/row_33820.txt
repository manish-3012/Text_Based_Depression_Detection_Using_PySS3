My boyfriend broke up with me last noghtBut that's not why I want to die. He was my last crutch of pretending everything is okay. I woke up this morning (still at his house because it was late when he did it) and got drunk. Have to leave for work in a few minutes, for a job I find very draining and demanding.

I'm scared to go back out there and date. To trust someone. To get hurt. I feel like I have nothing.

And more importantly, where do I go? My house is not a home. I live with my mother. We are constantly fighting lately over an infestation problem that she claims I do nothing for. At least if she isn't home I will get to have the house and my air mattress to myself.

Yup. That's right. I don't even have a bed to curl up in.

And now I don't have a boyfriend's house to go to. I'm scared, I get urges to jump when I fight with my Mom. My only solution now is to go to a bar and drink until she falls asleep but that won't fix the morning after.
