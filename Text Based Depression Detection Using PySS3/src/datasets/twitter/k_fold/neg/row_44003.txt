Is there a sub that is actually supportive?I mean supportive to EVERYONE, not just a select few?

And yes, I know you are all thinking that no one anywhere would show support to me. I know you all think I'm unimportant, and not special in anyway. Why would anyone support me? I'm boring. 

I guess I answered my own question. No one anywhere can stand me. And everyone here thinks they are better than me.


Do you think it is hard to kill someone when you choke them during sex?

I hope it is easy cause I want this guy to kill me tomorrow. 

I met him on grindr like a year ago. He was really rough, and I went home bruised with bite marks. And I love that because we all know I deserve to be hurt, and it's hard to hurt myself. I like when other people do it for me. That's why I post at this sub. I know I'll be ignored, and then I can feel horrible about who I am. 

Anyway, he asked me if he could choke me next time we fucked. I said yes. I didn't mean it. I just assumed I would never answer his texts. He texts every few months to see if I want to fuck. I always have an excuse not to. But something has been keeping me from completely ignoring him. Now I know what it is. Maybe he can get a little too rough when he chokes me. Maybe if I'm lucky he will accidentally kill me. 

He was so rough that I started crying last time,  and he got off on that. I think he thought I did, too. And he was right. It was painful, but I needed it. I needed to feel like I wasn't important. I needed to feel like tears don't stop cruelty.
