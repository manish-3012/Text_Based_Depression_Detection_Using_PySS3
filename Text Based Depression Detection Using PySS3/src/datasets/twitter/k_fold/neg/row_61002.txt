Identical dream 2 nights in a row.I know this isn't that strange for most people, but it has never happened to me in the 25 years I've lived. I class a recurring dream as having it twice in a 10 day period, so two in a row is odd; especially seeing as it's the most disturbing dream I've ever had.

I'm standing in my flat's kitchen. Alone. Somehow a song is playing which I am able to recognise (most music in my dreams is non-discernable gibberish). The song is called The Murder Song 5 4 3 2 1 and it's a dark song.

I take a step across the kitchen, grab a 7 inch long kitchen knife, and bury it into the right side of my neck. I then draw the knife round my neck to my windpipe.

This is where I think in my dream "fuck, I've finally actually done it. This is it." So I stand there in the kitchen for 5 minutes just waiting to die, but nothing happens.

I go to the bathroom to look into the mirror, there's no blood. Not on me, not on the knife. All there is is a 4-5 inch canyon like hole in my neck which is such a dark red inside that it's impossible to distinguish anything inside.

And then I wake up in a sweat. Does anyone think this is cause for concern? And that I should tell my psychologist about it today?
