My head is so horrifically large that I want to kill myselfI appreciate the title sounds funny, and I wouldn't blame you for chuckling initially.

I'm white as a ghost, bald and my head is so glaringly big that if I go out in the street without a hat or go to the gym that strangers laugh at me without fail. I'm 5"7 for reference, although this doesn't really bother me at all.

Imagine not being able to even exercise to feel better without being humiliated. I feel like I can't do anything as basic as going to the shop without feeling absolutely worthless by the time I'm home.

A hair piece is not an option, this is equally humiliating and it's too far gone for any implants.

This is not even something that I am making up as it literally happens without fail every time I go out and others have pointed it out too.

I have no immediate plans to kill myself but I think every day how there is genuinely no point living, I don't enjoy anything any more, I don't want to go out, I don't want to see friends.

I don't know what to do
