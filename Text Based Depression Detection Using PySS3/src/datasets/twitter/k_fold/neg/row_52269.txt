Killing myself in New Years DayI made a promise that Iâ€™ll stick until 2020, and shot got *worse*. Scabies, worse depression, shit is even worse than ever. I will finally end my suffering and even if my family and friends grieves, they will all be better off without me. Everyone has something unique about them, but for me, Iâ€™m uniquely useless.
