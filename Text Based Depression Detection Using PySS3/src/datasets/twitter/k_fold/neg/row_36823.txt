don't know how to continueHello,

It's not my first time thinking about suicide. In 2012, I already tried to end my life but couldn't pull it off. In 2013, my life took a turn for the better when I entered Gymnasium(the German version of High School). I actaully started to have a normal social life, went out with friends, and enjoying going to school. 

Now I'm in Uni and the old thoughts I buried deep down in my mind are beginning to resurface. And even so I'm studying together with lots of people for about half a year I wasn't able to make a single contact. 

Having no one to talk to is fucking mind-numbing. I can assure you. But due to my low self-esteem, I am just too afraid to speak to people. Back in High School, people approached me, so it was easy. But it seems like an impossible task now. The fear is getting so bad, that I'm even too afraid to look at my emails. Going outside is getting more and more uncomftable. It appaears that my anxiety is getting worse by the day. It sucks.

 And the worst thing is that I have no one, absolutetely fucking no one, not even my parents(which are more interested in themselves than anything else) I can rely on, someone to talk about my issues.
