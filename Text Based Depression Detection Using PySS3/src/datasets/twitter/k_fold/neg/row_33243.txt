I have a whole plan of how to kill myself, but I canâ€™t tell anyone about it.Obviously I canâ€™t post it here either because itâ€™s against sub rules, but I have a detailed plan for how I would kill myself and just wish I could tell someone about it. 

I wouldnâ€™t want a discussion to ensue about â€œoh youâ€™ll get better. Just hang in there!â€ Fuck that. Itâ€™s been years and years, treatment after treatment, multiple therapists and psychiatrists and hospital visits. I wonâ€™t actually end my life because I donâ€™t have the strength and conviction, but it would be nice to talk about my plan without the threat of being sent away to hospital jail.
