When death comes for me...When I die by my own hand I will be serene. For when I think of it, the end, I do so without fear. And I spoke to a friend the other day, for she is in a similar state of mind. How we commiserated about the tribulations of life; of my mundane existence. The door is close now, and I beckon the void.
