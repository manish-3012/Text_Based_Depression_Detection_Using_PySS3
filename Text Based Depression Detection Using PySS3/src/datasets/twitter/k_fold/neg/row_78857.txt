How can I get help?I just graduated college and I've been struggling with depression for a while now.

It took a turn for the worse the summer of 2011 when I first had a scary night where I went out and I hated my life fully and completely for the first time. I didn't know what I was going to do, but I texted someone who talked me into a more calm state.

Suicidal ideation then became a more common experience during senior year, culminating in a near-breakdown about graduation.

Since then, I've been unable to find a job, and each effort to call or walk-in to talk to a manager uses all of my energy. I'm running out of money and my depression seems to be getting worse.

I rarely go through a week without thinking about how much I want to be dead.

My mom's health insurance won't cover therapy, and I don't really know what to do. I'm isolating myself further and further and my girlfriend and I are scared that I might do something stupid out of impulse on a bad day.

Where do I go? What can I do?

I know I need to get a job, and I try, but jobs are basically the *source* of my anxiety about the future, and they're an enormous emotion-dump for me, since I hate the idea of getting a soulless job that's going to crush me for years at a time.

I'm at the end of my rope and I need help, but I have no clue how to find it.
