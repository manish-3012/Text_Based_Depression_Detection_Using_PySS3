Mom has been struggling after an attemptMy mother attempted suicide about six months ago but sheâ€™s been depressed for years and has turned to alcoholism for many of those years.  As her daughter, living in another state, I would have conversations with her on the phone, most of which were her being really drunk and I would tell her positive things about her life to be happy about and to reflect on. I, myself, struggle with depression so Iâ€™ve been telling her to get help from a professional because obviously Iâ€™m not a pro and usually what I say to her is forgotten the next day.  Itâ€™s been tough since her attempt as my dad is asking for a divorce, my brother moved away with his girlfriend and Iâ€™ve been living away for some years now. But years before her attempt, we have been asking her to get help.  Now six months later sheâ€™s still at home, constantly drinking the day away and chain smoking in the backyard with her self damaging thoughts and no matter how much I try to encourage her or ask, even plead for her getting help, itâ€™s not happening. I know addiction and depression cannot be solved overnight and has taken some individuals years to fully recover but Iâ€™m just looking for the first step for her. Or at least to direct her.  However, we canâ€™t help her if she canâ€™t help herself and I donâ€™t know what to do at this point.
