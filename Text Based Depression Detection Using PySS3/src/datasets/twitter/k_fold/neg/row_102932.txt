All I do is work and pay billsWake up each morning for work 800 miles from home. And all I want to do is stop it all. But if i dont work 365 days a year im going to lose it all. I wont be going home until probably January, missing thanksgiving and christmas and seeing my family. Yesterday at work all i was thinking about was writing a note and putting it on my camper door so my friend staying with me wouldnt walk into a horror show. This is the only way I can make a living and its draining me everyday
I dont know what to do or have the time to sit and talk with someone. Dont wanna tell my family and have them worry. I just wanna stop
