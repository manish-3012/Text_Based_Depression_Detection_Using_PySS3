I dont know where else to turn....So i recently got divorced from my wife of 3 years ( She wanted it i didn't) and i got a message today saying she was with someone else. I still love her and it pisses me off because just last year she said to me "I don't understand how people can be together that long, break up, and find someone new only a few weeks later". Well you know now don't you bitch!!!!! Sorry i digress. This has been eating away at me and i am contemplating suicide. I've tried calling numbers and have also tried a shrink but they seem to be of no use. I really dont know what else to do.
