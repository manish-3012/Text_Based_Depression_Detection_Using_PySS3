I want to die, but I don't at the same time. Can't get over this feeling.Hey everyone, for as long as I can remember I have never felt like I was enough, I was born premature with delayed learning so I was isolated in special education classes when I was younger, and even though people would tell me that I couldn't get out of the system when I wanted to I worked super hard and got out of it, getting an advanced regents diploma and got into normal classes with my peers. I was so used to depending on others that as an adult (22 now) I feel like I am still 'too stupid' to do things for myself. I've made mistakes driving that we're very stupid and am horrible at directions even if I was driven to the mall like 60 times in my life I couldn't tell you how to get there. My memory seems to suck idk why, and I still don't know things that would make you laugh, for example sucking at geography and the basic education of US history. I don't even know how to use the subway still and it's my 3rd year in the city. I feel like I'm not competent enough for this world. 

My dad used to be verbally abusive to me but now we're best friends (our dog made him a better person weirdly, sucks we put her down earlier than she needed to and I had to help with her assisted death) at the same time he still says things to me that are hurtful like- 'how do you not know that' or 'lose some weight' or 'Get better at your social life'. I pushed myself away from my friends in high school, and my best friend who I miss and many other ex friends I had don't even talk to me anymore. I also care so deeply about others, when I see homeless people in NYC where I live, or look at my parents who seem to be together like it's a chore, exc it can effect me. And my dad stares at my boobs a lot I hate it, he'd never do anything but it makes me uncomfortable. 

Right now I am in a dorm at college for graphic design and feel like I can't measure up to my classmates either, I'm a senior now. I feel like I'm losing motivation slowly and starting to have really dark thoughts about dying and self harm. I've started bruising myself again with a rubber band, I'm too chicken to actually cut. I feel so pathetic. I never imagined being an adult when I was a child, maybe I was depressed then and didn't know it, but I just feel like my fate is to die young. I was never diagnosed as this though, my parents told me last year that we had 2 distant relatives who are severely depressed and my dad said he kept it from me because he didn't want me to jump on the depressed boat like it's a choice, my parents would suck at dealing with my depression if I told them, and we never talk about deep things as a family we're just not like that my moms flat out told me she's not the type to like talking about that type of stuff and said if she had a depressed child she'd feel uncomfortable talking to them saying she wouldn't know what to say. No way I'd tell them.

I have a supporting and loving family, a few nice friends, and a high gpa at my school, I feel bad for feeling this way. My parents even pay for my education. I can't stop escaping my life through YouTube and tv shows / movies. I just keep thinking what is the point of living if we're all going to die anyway. And at college there's a group of talented girls in class who don't like me for some reason and don't even say hi to me. I've never told anyone about how I'm feeling,  I've always cared about what others think of me and am a severe people pleaser, I'm always smiling to people and it's exhausting. I just have such low confidence in myself and I'm tired of always having to prove myself to others, it never works anyway. Life just seems like a chore to me. 

Thank you so much for reading all this! I've never told this story before, but I just wanted to talk about it here.
