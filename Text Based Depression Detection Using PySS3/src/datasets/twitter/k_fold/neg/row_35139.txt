I donâ€™t even know how to handle myself anymoreIâ€™ve been crying almost nonstop all weekend. Iâ€™m 21 and Iâ€™ve been severely depressed for the 18 years of my life that I can remember, but I havenâ€™t felt suicidal like this since high school.

Iâ€™m autistic and I have some other developmental disorders and my mental health is in horrible condition. I was diagnosed with autism later in life but obviously have had it all my life and my parents basically have denied it and just call me antisocial and rude and lazy.

a few days ago I overheard my parents arguing and my stepdad told my mom that if Iâ€™m still living here when Iâ€™m 30 then he wonâ€™t be living here and that basically kickstarted my weekend long breakdown.

I have a huge problem finding employment because of my disabilities but they donâ€™t give a shit that I am mentally handicapped they just see that Iâ€™m a burden.

I was a fucking mistake. I thought my step dad understood my situation but he is turning out to be another person denying my very real disabilities. I lived with my bio dad and step mom for a while but she got pregnant and they kicked me out and now my mom and stepdad are talking about how I need to get out. Iâ€™m a burden on my whole family.

Theyâ€™re hounding me about getting a job but I lost my job to covid and have been getting rejection letters left and right ever since then. I got denied disability because I make pocket change selling thing I make online. 

Iâ€™m literally just rotting alive and none of my friends are awake to talk to.

I want to fucking die because no one wants me and I canâ€™t take care of myself. my bio parents brought me into this world to suffer and Iâ€™ve overstayed my welcome in their homes.

Iâ€™m too scared to attempt suicide but Iâ€™ve relapsed back into self harm and I havenâ€™t been able to stop crying.

I want to drive off a fucking bridge lol
