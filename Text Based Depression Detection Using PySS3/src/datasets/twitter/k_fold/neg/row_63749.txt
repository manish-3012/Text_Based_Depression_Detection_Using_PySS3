A 2016 resolutionI think at some point before the new year Iâ€™m going to kill myself. last time I was scared but now Iâ€™m not. itâ€™s not just the breakup and I donâ€™t want people to think that, I'm afraid they will. I have been tested for so many years and I think I deserve that rest now. I am so tired. If there was some higher spirit or God heâ€™d welcome me with open arms and tell me I did good, I tried and gave it my best. I just want rest and isolation. I want this to be over. I wish I had taken more meds last year when I attempted ODing. I feel sorry for everyone who knew me...
