Urgent advice on side effects of suicide attemptI tooka  bunch of codeine and a muscle relaxant, and felt pretty dizzy, intense headaches, nausea, and today I feel extremely hungover, and cannot stop sneezing, coughing, and stuffy nose at the same time. Has anyone had this after an overdose of meds? Is it normal, or is it some sort of withdrawl from a higher amount?
