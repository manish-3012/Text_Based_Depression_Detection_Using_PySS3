planningi donâ€™t really know what the point of this post is but. iâ€™ve gotten scarily deeper into planning my suicide recently. itâ€™s always been something rattling around in my brain since i was a kid. after trying quite a few times over the years one would think iâ€™d be better at it by now. but how long have i been saying that for, again?

anyways, iâ€™ve been thinking up a whole new plan that nobody could ever predict. itâ€™s not just at 3:00am anymore when iâ€™m really in my head and my eyes are sore from crying. itâ€™s in the morning when i wake up and in the afternoon when iâ€™m taking a break from classwork and while iâ€™m eating dinner in the evening. fantasizing all the time and predicting costs. iâ€™m sketching things out on lined paper obsessing over every detail. itâ€™s the only way i can escape lately. i feel insane.

i looked in the mirror earlier and caught myself fucking practicing. i can literally close my eyes and watch it happen. i know exactly where. i feel guilty for the people who have to watch. i make myself sick.

i donâ€™t want to be excited but part of me really is. but also sad. i donâ€™t know. it feels different this time. iâ€™m scary.
