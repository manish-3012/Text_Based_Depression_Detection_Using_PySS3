I attempted suicide last week and Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll do it againI donâ€™t want to die. After my attempt I realized how much my parents really care about me. Iâ€™m just so anxious and depressed that I canâ€™t take it anymore. I canâ€™t go to school anymore. Hell I can hardly leave the house at all. I feel so fucking defeated and conflicted.
