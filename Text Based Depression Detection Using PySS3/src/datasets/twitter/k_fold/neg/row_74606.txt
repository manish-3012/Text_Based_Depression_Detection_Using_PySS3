Had my first break up five days ago. Banned from the only social group I was happy with. I want to give up.I feel empty, and so pathetic. My problems are nothing compared to so many other people. But I'm in pain. I've been on antidepressant for six months now, even if I'm not supposed to take them because of my young age. I still cut my skin with my scalpel, never stopped in six years. Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m being too dramatic. I cut my neck, my thights, my arms or my legs. I can't stop doing this and now because of the recent events, I'm scared of myself. I managed to control it most of time, but now I want to take nine or ten medicaments, or cut my neck wide and deep. I don't want to die but I can't take it anymore. I feel hopeless and I hate myself so much. I still have feelings for my ex and he hates me. Woke up this morning with messages from the few friends I still have telling me to be brave and saying how sorry they were for what is going on. Someone I used to see like a brother is telling others how toxic I am, and how my apology means nothing and they just should be considered and seen like  tentatives of manipulation. I've been rejected from the people I loved the most, the only social group I was confortable in. I just want to take the pain away.
