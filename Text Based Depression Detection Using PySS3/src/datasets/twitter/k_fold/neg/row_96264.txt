Great. Awesome. I still want to die.I hit my goal weight. Below it, actually. I've officially lost 50.2 pounds since January and I'm really proud of myself. I promised my boyfriend that I'd at least make some sort of attempt to recover since I got to this point, because I'm actually underweight now with a BMI of 18.1, and I've increased my intake to 900 calories a day. 

Now he's ignoring me. Like I'm not worth paying attention to if I don't need to be persuaded to eat. It's horrible and shitty and manipulative of me to be thinking this way but now that I'm trying to get better I haven't heard a peep out of him. When I was starving myself he was constantly checking up on me. 

Even at this weight, I still feel fat. I'm 25 pounds away from my ultimate goal weight. I kind of just want to keep losing and see what happens, but I also just want to die and give up and be done. I'm tired. 

Maybe I should keep losing. Maybe I should keep going until there's no more fat to lose and my body starts eating its own muscles to survive and I die in my sleep of heart failure. The good ol' anorexic death. I know I'd love getting to that point and it would be painless, the hard part is just staying alive long enough to die of natural causes instead of shooting myself in the fucking face or jumping off the nearest bridge.
