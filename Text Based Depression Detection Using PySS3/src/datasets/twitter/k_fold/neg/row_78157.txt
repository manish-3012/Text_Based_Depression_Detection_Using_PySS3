I need help.I dont know what to even think anymore. None of my friends care what i do or feel, people are spreading more rumors about me in school, and now my girlfriend is yelling at me because i asked if i could see her sometime in the next week.

I understand that shes busy with finals and tests but surley theres one day she can work out to see me for half a fucking hour.
I just have the urge to cut so badly right now. I can see the blood and the cuts when i close my eyes. I long for it. I need it.
Im done, man. I can't keep living this hell just to make those around me happy. You can call me selfish for wanting to end it, but its just as selfish to make me suffer by staying here so they dont have to deal with me gone.
I dont know how im going to do it today, but if i dont get better soon i can tell im going to do something.
