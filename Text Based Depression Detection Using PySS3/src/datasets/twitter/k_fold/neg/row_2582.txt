Thinking about killing myself after my vacation..After that, I have nothing to look forward to. It'll be back to my dumb job that I feel like a ghost at, where I make no money and come home feeling like shit. When I'm not there, I just lounge around the house all day doing shit because I have no friends while my brother is the poster boy of my family. 

I have three potential ways of killing myself in mind. My family is the only reason I haven't to this point, but I'm sure they'd get over it after a while. It'd be nice if a tree could just fall on me one day so I wouldn't have to kill myself, I could just die.
