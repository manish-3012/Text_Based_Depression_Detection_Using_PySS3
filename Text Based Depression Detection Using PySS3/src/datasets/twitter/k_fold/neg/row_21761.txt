I know how to beat this, I don't want to.I don't know if I'll be able to hear you.

I'm pretty sure you won't hear me.

It's lazy of me to be this way.

I have so little to offer.

I want what they tell me to want, and hate that.

I want what I want and they hate that.

I've been given so much, and I'm grateful.

Everything is very Leibnitz, and I can handle it.

It's actually very easy.

I just don't want it.

The surf is strong. No, I am weak and pathetic. I am a punchline.

I should just have fun with it, but the truth creeps in when I try to ignore it.

I can't forget.

I just can't talk about this to anyone.
