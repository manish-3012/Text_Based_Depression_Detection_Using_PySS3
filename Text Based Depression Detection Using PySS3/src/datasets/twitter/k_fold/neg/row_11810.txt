HomelessTomorrow I will be homeless. I have two dogs that I love more than anything in life. I can't even supply shelter for them anymore. If I can't make something happen, I'm going to kill myself.

Everywhere I look I see people talking about their lives, the good and the bad, but they have a place to go. I don't. I don't have any family that can help in any way. I was born into poverty. My parents were drug addicts. They never showed me how to be a man. It's not their fault that I'm stuck in this situation, though. It's mine. 

I asked for a loan on /r/borrow and no one replied. This was before I knew I was about to be homeless. I posted yesterday asking for a loan for $260. A guy asked from $4000 after I posted mine and had several people offer. If that's not a sign, I don't know what is.

I'm sorry to be posting this. I feel there is already too much negativity in the world. Maybe there will be less when I am gone. It doesn't matter though, I wouldn't know.

I love you so much Chopper and Zappa. I'm going to try for you two. You are all I have. If I lose you, then I'm done.
