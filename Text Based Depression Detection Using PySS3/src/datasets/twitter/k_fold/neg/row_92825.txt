I want to end it because of himMy boyfriend of 4 years left me. He seems fine but I'm a mess. I can't function without him. He was my everything. I want to die. He is perfectly fine post breakup. I want him to know that he hurt me is the most painful way possible. The only thing stopping is if hell is real that's exactly where I'll spend eternity. The pain is growing and it makes me feel like it doesn't matter what happens after. Nothing matters if I can't be with him anymore.
