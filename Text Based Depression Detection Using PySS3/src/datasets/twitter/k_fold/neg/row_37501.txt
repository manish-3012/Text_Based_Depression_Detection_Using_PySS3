pill combinations?iâ€™m just tired all the time. itâ€™s been three years of feeling this way now and i know there are so many of you whoâ€™ve had it worse for much longer. you are all so strong. i wish i could carry on for a while longer. 


iâ€™ve been a shut in the last two months while my roommates go to school and work and live their lives. today i put all their lives at risk because of my habits and i donâ€™t want something like this to happen again. no one else should have to be hurt because of my problems. 


i had my prescriptions refilled today. baclofen, cyclobenzaprine, diclofenac. iâ€™m going to sleep.


goodbye.
