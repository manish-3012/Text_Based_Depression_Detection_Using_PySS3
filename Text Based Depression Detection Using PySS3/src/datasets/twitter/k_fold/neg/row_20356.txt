I just don't want to be a burdenI want to die and be done with life, but I'm aware my death will hurt the few people who truly love me. I don't see myself getting anywhere, I'm lazy, apathetic and have found myself pursuing a path others wanted my follow. I feel death is the only way out. 

I am aware that reaching out to those who love me would be the right thing to do, but I refuse because I know them, and I know that they would immediately give me anything I wanted, but I don't want that. I don't want to manipulate others into changing their actions just by holding my own life hostage. I'm not a good person, but even I loathe the idea of faling so low, to become a manipulator like that. 

I want to go in silence, but I feel I want to talk to them and tell them how grateful I am for everything. I love my family and few friends, and they love me they see as well, but not the me I am, and I had always been fine with that. I am blessed to have people who care about me, but I feel it's not enough. It's never enough, and I simply don't know what is. 

I want to disappear and be forgotten. Death won't accomplish that, I don't know what will. But killing myself feels close enough.
