Advice won't help. I'm probably dying.I have no friends or family. I've lost everything. I feel like I crave someone to talk to, but I know talking won't help. I feel like I'm living outside of my body. When I look around, I see nothing but a blur. I'm hungry but food doesn't taste like anything. When I touch things, I feel nothing. My heart expected this world to be more. I'm dying.
