32 YearsIn this time I have never known love, only women who "used" me for something. Either they were sad, desperate, and lonely or they wanted a green card (yep... been there). I tried all the self help stuff and really none of it worked. Bust ass in the gym 3 times a week with a personal trainer for 2 years straight? Check. Learn to be "happy alone"? Check. Develop all kinds of hobbies? Check. Be more social and outgoing? Check. People say looks don't matter, but they do. I approach women and they look at me like a swarm of bees flying towards them. I don't get it. I did have some success with the ladies while I was in the military but nothing ever lasted. After that I went to college and earned my degree. I didn't make a single friend at all.

Pretty short story right? 32 years and all I have is a worthless piece of paper, a bunch of meaningless hobbies, and a uniform from a time long passed. I finally realized that my life will always be: Go to work and come home to an empty house. I looked at the statistics, in the past 40 years the % of people being single past 18 rose from 22% to about 50%. Wow, but it makes sense right? Technology has fueled an age of shallowness and high expectations from both genders. Standards are insane, everyone want's someone who's a rich model. Dating apps were impossible for me, even putting my best pictures up the one or two people I ever got to go on a date with me accused me of cat fishing them "You lied about my looks". No, I just used lighting and angles to my advantage like most females do. At my age  every day that passes is just reducing my chances of ever meeting someone.

So I have a decision to make, spend the rest of my life being a cog in the work force machine or just let the beautiful people have the world so they no longer have to be sickened by my looks and never give me a chance. Hell, even getting my job was hard despite being well qualified for them. An attractive person is just more likely to be hired. I know what you're thinking at this point though: "Wow no wonder, you have such low self-esteem and confidence". I never showed this side though, I'm pretty good at putting on a fake "everything is awesome" look. I don't go around looking sorry for myself and I didn't let myself go or anything. The world is over populated anyway right?

Honestly, at this point my experiences with women since middle school has almost made me borderline sexist. Like, I'm pretty close to just hating women. They're all the same. Sure, they'll say they aren't and defend themselves by saying it's YOUR fault for x, y, z reasons but lets be real. It's because I'm ugly, and again this isn't a lack of confidence it's just being a realist. Accept the things that are out of your control right? So the final question is: why am I posting here? Pity? Well in all honesty it's because no one will know or care that I'm gone and I think I'll be at peace knowing at least one person out there knew. "But that's not true! SOMEONE loves you! Friends?! Family?!"

No, not for me. Those are luxuries I could never afford.

For all of you young kids out there thinking about traveling the road I'm on, I do recommend giving life a chance. 20 is too young to give up,  a lot can change. Once you've been "adulting" for a while and have developed into "full maturity" then you can make an honest judgement call whether or not life is for you. I've never been a religious person so if God really does exist..... I guess I'm screwed. Although I've lived in hell for 32 years, what's another eternity going to mean?
