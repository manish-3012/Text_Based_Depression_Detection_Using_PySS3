Tired of feeling trapped in lifeMy life has nowhere to go but down, and I really donâ€™t care to carry it out. I have nothing to live for, I have nothing to look forward to, Iâ€™m so fucking ready for the end but I donâ€™t have it in me to do it. Iâ€™m so tired of the constant stress and no reward.


Even the things I used to enjoy mean nothing to me anymore. After hours of laying in bed I think to myself Iâ€™ll cheer myself up by doing something that used to be fun for me. Not anymore. Everything is a chore, everything is exhausting, everything is pointless. Nothing has meaning to me anymore.


Everything has come crumbling down, I was barely held up by a single jenga block in the first place. I donâ€™t have the determination nor motivation to â€œfight it outâ€ and â€œwait for it to get betterâ€ (hint: itâ€™s not getting better). I wish I wasnâ€™t afraid of dying, because Iâ€™m so tired of this purgatory. Iâ€™m not alive. Iâ€™m a shell, an exhaustive burden. Iâ€™m so close to snapping and letting go, and I donâ€™t know whether I should be afraid of that or excited.
