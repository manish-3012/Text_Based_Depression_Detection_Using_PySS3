Youâ€™re not alone!!!You can simply message me I also have discord or if youâ€™re comfortable Iâ€™ll give you my phone number as well. Even before this quarantine I have always try to make time on my days off in assisting others in need. 

No judgement zone, if itâ€™s any consolation I tried killing myself 5 years ago. I was on suicide watch at the hospital and they had to pump everything out of my stomach. 

6 years passed since then and I am a psychiatrist// counselor certified specializing in these fields. Please feel free to message me. 

Iâ€™m no better than you , we are all human and if I can do it, without a doubt anyone else can. 

Suicide is not worth it.....
