I don't know what to write in the title, so I will use keywords: school life; studies; depression; adulthoodWhen I was in high school, a physics teacher told me once, in front of the whole class, that people like me, who only studied, would end up going crazy. I finished high school 10 years ago and I never forgot that, but not because I agreed. I didn't forget that because I thought it was ridiculous for him to say that. I was raised in a system that told me that the more I studied and devoted myself to studies, the more certain things would be for me. Well, after a few years in adulthood I clearly realize that I was wrong. And today I started to think that maybe my teacher was right. I'm really going crazy. I am isolating myself, I am practically without friends (I only have two), I have no desire to study or work and my affective relationship is falling apart. I feel like depression is taking over me and there are days (like today) that I don't know what else to do. It gives me a sincere and deep desire to disappear. it is not necessarily a desire to die, but a desire to disappear.

Does anyone relate to this? Does anyone else feel like a victim of this ridiculous school system that doesn't really prepare us for life?
