Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™ve allowed people in my life to speak to me anyway they want, itâ€™s worse when I care about them. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m scared to push back because Iâ€™m worried they will leave if I do. Iâ€™m completely devastated, embarrassed, worthless and stupid. The way he spoke to me this morning, I feel like complete trash. Iâ€™m already suicidal and Iâ€™m trying everyday to be okay. Listening to his anger, hatred and annoyance, he had for me..listening to the words he used..Iâ€™m crushed.. I feel like I canâ€™t breathe.. Iâ€™m not okay.. Iâ€™m not okay.
