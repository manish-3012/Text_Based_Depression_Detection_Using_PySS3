About to lose my life - can someone help?How do we effectively retain and implement all this information in this modern age? I have notebooks of things, that I feel I value, but like, I'm exhausted stressed suicidal depressed, I don't know if I should just toss out the notebooks entirely, but wouldn't I be an idiot, reading SOME books and YouTube videos / articles can be extremely eye opening and helpful to our lives, right? But then..... how do we do it, there's SO MUCH info out there. I'm so lost and confused at this point, lol.
