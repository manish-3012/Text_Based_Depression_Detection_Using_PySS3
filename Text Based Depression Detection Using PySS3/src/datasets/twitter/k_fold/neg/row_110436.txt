Can anyone help me or direct me in the correct path?Iâ€™m a 20 year old male living in the US that has recently became suicidal. 

I think about it often, but no to often because I know how it would effect all the people in my life that I care about. Iâ€™m a really good human at heart (think so anyway) and really wouldnâ€™t wanna put grief and that feeling on my family, friends, and girlfriend. Iâ€™ve had a couple people commit suicide growing up, itâ€™s not good. 

Growing up, I had my sad days, gloomy days, etc... But had never really been depressed. Until I hit age 19. A lot of people donâ€™t have s cause, but I have a cause/reason Iâ€™m so down. And thatâ€™s what fucks with me. It can be fixed, but I canâ€™t get it fixed. 

April of 2018 I started to get what I call brain fog. It makes my thinking cloudy. Canâ€™t remember shit. Stopped driving due to the brain fog because I almost caused a couple major wrecks. Canâ€™t work because of the same reason. So that slowly dragged on until new things started to appear. 

I was very dependent on my intelligence/sharp mind with my day to day life. Itâ€™s how I made friends, drove, worked, social gatherings, etc. Today makes almost 2 months sense Iâ€™ve left my house, but thatâ€™s really a short time for me. If it wasnâ€™t for the little tiny amount of hope I have left, I could have easily went a year without leaving my home. 

Now, this all started in April of 2018. On the journey from then, to now, I have a list of problems thatâ€™s no one seems to care about. 

Purple feet when sitting 

Frequent heart palpitations 

Brain fog 

Fast heart rate when standing (only on some days) 

Exercise literally makes me feel like I havenâ€™t slept in days. 

Fatigue. 

Use to, exercise made me feel alive, awake, good. Now, it makes me feel like I havenâ€™t slept in days. 

Thatâ€™s what my suicide idea came from. Iâ€™ve had my life taken away it feels like. I canâ€™t even exaggerate it. My family and friends keep saying itâ€™s anxiety, but Iâ€™ve had anxiety for 20 years. Iâ€™ve lived in my body for 20 years. So now, I donâ€™t even argue with them anymore. I just let them think that itâ€™s anxiety. 

It burdens me and makes me so angry that I could be working, driving, going out whenever Iâ€™m off work, but Iâ€™m stuck at my house binging fucking TV like I have been for almost 2 years letting life pass me by because of my health. 

Iâ€™ve had a range of test, blood test, sleep apnea test that I got privately because doctors wouldnâ€™t give me a referral (I now currently have a referral), heart echo, kidney ultrasound, head scans, colonoscopy, etc.... 

 But thereâ€™s something they are missing. My life was not like this before when I had anxiety. Anxiety made me scared and figity and hot.  Not incapable of sustaining a life. 

And when I tell my doctors about my problems, they write it down in there computer and just look at me. I went from my original doctor, to a new doctor, back to my original doctor because nobody would tell me anything. 

Iâ€™m sad. Angry. Fed up. And now, suicidal. I just want my life back and would do anything to have it back. Literally anything. 

What do I do guys? Where do I go from here? Itâ€™s hard to get appointments because I canâ€™t drive anymore so I rely on family. 

Any help is seriously appreciated.
