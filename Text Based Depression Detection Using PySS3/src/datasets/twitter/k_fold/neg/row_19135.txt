I have a shitty mental state, have since I was about 7 I got ptsd and anxiety from a car crash, now I have a beautiful collection of mental illnesses. Depression, social anxiety, generalised? anxiety, binge eating disorder. etc. I'm not proud of it,  I'm in my mid teen years so I guess expected, I've been sexually assaulted, seen a lot of people I love die, been bullied, been through some fucked up relationships, never really had any friends. I've been through the wars. I'm trying to deal with the fact I cant let go of the past I've been through counselling, therapy, psychiatrists everything talked to endless amount of people it becomes a easy repeatable task I've recited a thousand times. Everyone thinks I'm ok because I've been forced in and out of "help" for years but I'm not took a while to accept it but I'm really not I think I'm at some of my worst times I've been through, I've become suicidal and I self harm Often too I've had 3 suicide attempts in the past 2 years no one knows though I don't tell anyone that, I cant stress enough about the things my mother would do if she knew. Like last time I got bad the signs are there they choose not to see no one believes me cause they expect me to be this happy person. I want to be happy I don't know why nothing worked I was I was as normal as people falsely see me. I don't have the courage nor the words to speak up I wouldn't know how.
