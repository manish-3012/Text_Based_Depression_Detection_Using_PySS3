Everything is fine and i want to kill myselfLife should be great for me. One year ago I attempted suicide, but now I'm out of therapy and don't need pills anymore. I have good grades, a great boyfriend, and some sweet and supportive friends. Even tho I have a very strick and sometimes cruel step father, life isn't bad! Oh, I should be so happy! But no, I want to kill myself. I just want to do it and I feel like it's time for it. I have it all scheduled and I'm waiting for when I have the guts to do it.
