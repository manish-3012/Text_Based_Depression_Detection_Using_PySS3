Just wanted to say thanks..Just wanted to say thanks for all the good this community is achieving and all the help and kind loving support you give people in times of crisis. 

Although not suicidal myself, I do enjoy reading all the kind words and honest comments you all give. 

You are providing a service which some people desperately need to find the will and motivation to stay alive.

Keep on doing what you're doing! 

You've saved countless lives and I wanted to give my deepest respects.

Thank you!
