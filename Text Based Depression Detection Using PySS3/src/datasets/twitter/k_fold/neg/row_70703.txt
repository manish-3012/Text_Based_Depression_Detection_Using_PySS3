Suicide.There's a pretty big chance i'll actually do it, Life just isn't really worth the trouble at all, my entire life has just been one big painful and meaningless existence.

I would absolutely just LOVE to get hit by a fucking bus and have my body shattered onto the glass just to get this over and done with.

Why does my own brain make me feel this way?

I just want to curl into a ball and die.

It isn't worth the trouble, nothing is.

Not worth trying since i'll still feel like utter shit for the rest of my miserable existence on this putrid earth where children starve and women are raped and egotistical social parasites feed off each other and battle with all their might while blinded by greed.  


Won't tell my age because i know you parasitic scumbags will latch onto that and stuff it down my throat.
