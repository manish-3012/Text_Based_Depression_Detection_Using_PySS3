my friend committed suicideim a junior in high school. exactly a week ago my friend committed suicide. i wasn't extremely close to her, but i saw her everyday and i talked to her. i've known her for more than 3 years, she used to be my brother's girlfriend up until last summer. i just want to get my thoughts out because i dont want to talk about it with anyone. my best friend and i went to her house after getting an alarming message from her boyfriend. the ambulance was already there and we saw them take her to the hospital. the next day we heard she was in a coma and we went to go see her. seeing her broke my heart. i couldnt stop crying, i held her hand, and im not religious but i prayed for a miracle to happen. she passed away the next day. i can't sleep. i don't want to interact with anyone but my friend who was closer to her than i was. i cant stop thinking of her, every time i close my eyes i see her on that hospital bed.as a person who's diagnosed with depression and has had suicidal thoughts, it hurtsme even more to know how she felt. her parents wanted a small private funeral and its today. i still have to go to school but i just cant pay attention or do any of my schoolwork. 
can anyone give me any advice for moving on? or at least being able to do my daily tasks?
