Encourage me to kill myself.I just need that one push to finally do it. This battle has lasted for 6 years, and I'm scared that it'll go on forever. I am cruel to my friends and family. I am a burden. The world will keep turning once I am gone, perhaps it could be better to those I love, so there is no need to hesitate. I really want to do this. I have already written a note for my mom.
