If i kill myself, can my wife get my social security benefits?I'm at the end of things. I want so desperately to talk to my wife, but she won't answer any communication attempts. i love her dearly, and my depression has pushed her away. I'll be homeless soon, and worth even less than i am now. The only noble thing i can think of to do is to kill myself so she can have my SS benefits. At least i'll know she will be aided in her life after me. Does it work like this? or will she be denied because i suicided? Please guys. i just want to do right by her. i'm not done yet, but i'm not seeing any other options. thanks.
