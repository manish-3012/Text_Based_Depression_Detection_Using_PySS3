I Just Want Someone to Love MeI struggle with OCD. I've been in an ongoing depressive state for a year and every time I think I'm becoming myself again life tosses me right back. My best friend was hospitalized last week due to attempted suicide. I'm struggling from internalized homophobia and no one's here to help me through this. Everyone either has left me or doesn't give a shit. The one person I loved couldn't give two shits about my existence. I've turned to drinking recently and honestly, nothing else has made me feel better. No matter what I do, any form of therapy or "healthy" coping mechanisms, I can't get myself out of this state. I just want at least one person to talk to. Someone to care, even just a little bit. And I really need a hug
