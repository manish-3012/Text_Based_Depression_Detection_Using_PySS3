gaslit by family most of life, feels like im doomed to go through it forever nowso whats the point

why would it even matter if im gone to the people who dont care enough about me not to make me feel this way? embarrassing that ive let them trick me into thinking theyd care at all

i want to be in control of what happens to me :'p
