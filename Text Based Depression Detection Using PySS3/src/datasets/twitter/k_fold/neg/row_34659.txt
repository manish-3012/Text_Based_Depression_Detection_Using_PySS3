I feel so uselessThis is a bit out of my comfort zone, but I have no idea what to do or who to talk to. I am an 18 year old trans man, who has been living at home all my life. I dropped out of high school and have not pursued any alternative schooling due to mental health still being terrible. I have tried therapy but something always seems to go wrong and I'm starting to shy away from it. There are times I feel like I have hope but then it all gets crushed.

I haven't spoken to my mom in a year due to a falling out, and my dad can get emotionally abusive at my worst times, constantly belittling me. I want to move out so badly but I am completely dependent on my dad, financially and emotionally. I just feel so useless all the time and want it to stop. I have never had a partner in my life and that's not for lack of trying, but because I am ugly and unlovable. My sister has even started to be increasingly manipulative, none of my friends make me feel happy. I feel like I'm just stuck with no future and nothing to live for. I don't know what to do at this point. I can't get a job even if I wanted to because my name isn't legally changed, and I need help with that process. As much as I hate my dad and want to leave I feel like I'd die without him. I don't know what to do.


I know I'm 18, so there's a lot I can legally do now, but I still need some help and support as I'm not very stable, and suicidal. I feel so useless for not being able to get out of bed every day and do what I need to do. I feel like I have failed my life, so why not just end it?
