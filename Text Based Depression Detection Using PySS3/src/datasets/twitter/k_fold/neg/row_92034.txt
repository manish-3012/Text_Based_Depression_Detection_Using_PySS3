it's funny reallyhere i am, now 'planning' the end. tomorrow night seems nice and meaningful. if i just go and talk to someone right now, maybe they will make me see a professional or get me locked away. maybe, maybe, it's just what i need. maybe if i had a real treatment for what i've been feeling and thinking, this urge, will fade away. or maybe not. either way i can't get myself to say it out loud. why? cause they could fucking save me, prevent me from doing it, though I've been doubting if i want to be saved anymore. maybe it's better just to accept i don't want to live any longer, stop waiting for a miracle and kill myself already. it's obvious that i at least want to try it. what's been keeping me is that i haven't thought through how and when exactly to do it; and what happens if i fail. i have to make sure i won't fail since it may draw attention afterwards.
anyway, tomorrow sounds nice.
happy new year.
