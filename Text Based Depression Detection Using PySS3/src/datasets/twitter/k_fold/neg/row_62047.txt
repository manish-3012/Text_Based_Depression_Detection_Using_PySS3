Why. Just whyI'm probably in the same boat as everyone on here. Just depressed. Beaten down by life and the light at the end of the tunnel is becoming nothing but a spec in the distance. 

My latest train of thought can be summed up into one word. Why. Why work for a company that sees me as expendable? Why pay any debts because they are just going to keep piling up? Why grow any attachments to people because you don't want them to miss you? Ultimately, why live?

Honestly, I have no answers. I try to think positively. I try to think about myself growing old and retiring, spending the rest of my life with the woman of my dreams.... but I can't see it happening. I don't see myself growing old. The more I think about it the more I feel like I'm destined to die early, whether by my own hand or another's. 

Medication doesn't work and i'm not sleeping anymore because sleep means I will wake up and have to deal with idiocy and incompetence again. I just can't do that anymore. 

If anyone has answers outside of "push through it, it'll be worth it," or "medication," I'd love to hear it.
