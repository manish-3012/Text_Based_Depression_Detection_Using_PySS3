Occasional suicidal thoughts and guilt. Is this normal?Sometimes I think I want to die, particularly when I'm in immense pain, and I've researched methods and know how I'd probably do it, though I don't want to do it. Does that make sense? But afterwards when I've cleared my head, I feel so guilty for having had these thoughts, because even though I genuinely felt it, I feel like like if I knew I was going to die, I'd do anything to live and wish I hadn't ever wanted to end it. I feel guilty because I have an amazing family and my health (well I think I have my health?) and I try practise gratitude a lot. I think deep down I'm not suicidal because the finality of death terrifies and depresses me, but I don't know how normal (non intrusive) thoughts of suicide is? I'd imagine it's not uncommon but I don't know. I guess I just wanted a little advice.
