I just feel tiredI don't know, it sounds really cliche, but I honestly just feel done with it. I don't really feel sad, if anything I just feel empty. Sometimes, I just feel like I'm broken, and that place inside where most people have SOMETHING I just have nothing. 

The only emotions I really feel anymore are boredom and mild frustration. The only times I've actually felt happy or even normal in the last few years was when I was either drinking or on drugs. I'm only 17, and whenever I think about the fact that I have a life ahead of me, instead of excitement or anxiety, I just feel blank and exhausted. Death seems inviting a lot of the time, finally being able to just stop being, to just rest.
