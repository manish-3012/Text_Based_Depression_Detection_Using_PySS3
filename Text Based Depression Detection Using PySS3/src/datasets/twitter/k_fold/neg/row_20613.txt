Passively Suicidal.I donâ€™t really value my life. I donâ€™t believe there is anything wrong with suicide. I donâ€™t believe in an afterlife. With that said Iâ€™m not actively suicidal but sometimes I feel Iâ€™d be better off dead. I have bipolar disorder, I feel like a burden to others at times, my ex broke up with me because she couldnâ€™t handle my illness. But mostly I donâ€™t want to live with this illness. It presents many challenges mostly to relationships which is a huge problem for me since Iâ€™ve always wanted to get married and have children (not to mention I could pass this illness to my children, oh god) Iâ€™d rather not live.
