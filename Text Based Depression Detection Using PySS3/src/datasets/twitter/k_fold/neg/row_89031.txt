i wanna disappear, i dont wanna wake up and realized i am still alive. i dont wanna exist anymore. i wish i can just die. i am going to find a suitable date, situation, time, and do it.and, i know i am selfish by commitng to this but i feel i will be more free from this pain and loneliness thats causing me. theres no way for me now, except what i planned. i am going to enjoy every bits of life before i go. best of luck to be, because nothing is going to convince me to change my decision. its my only way to be free.
