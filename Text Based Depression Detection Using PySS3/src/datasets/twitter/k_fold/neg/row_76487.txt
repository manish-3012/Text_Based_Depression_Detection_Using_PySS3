This world is so strangeThe world we live in at this moment in time is so strange. It's so arbitrary that we live in this world at this exact particular time as sentient beings, and death is something that we comprehend and think of. Death and suicide are arbitrary too, people die all the time out of nowhere accidentally or naturally. Death is timeless, and I feel that suicide can be..okay because the world just isn't the best for everyone. In the end we all return to the world, and I like to imagine people's souls return to the natural world, at peace.
