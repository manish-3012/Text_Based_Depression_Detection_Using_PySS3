Goodbye, hopefully sooner than laterI am quite tired of being alive. I know that no one has the choice to be born or not. Call it petty, but I'm still salty that I didn't get to opt out. All I ever do is fail.. at everything. I've destroyed and continue to destroy all the opportunities and blessings given to me. I do not properly deal with what I absolutely must (school work &amp; finance). This is because of horrible self-discipline and poor habits developed over years. It is such a problem that I need not be alive any further to continue to waste and make more mistakes. With all due respect, spare the world and let me die already God. I am working up to ending my life myself. Hopefully I will succeed at that one thing. 

I apologise to my professors. I have displayed much unintentional disrespect by failing to do or complete their assignments. I want to thank them for any effort put forth to help me. I am so sorry for wasting their time. Again, I meant absolutely no disrespect. I simply am a failure at school, life, and everything in between. And as much as I want NOT to, I still continue to fail. I am sorry to my mother for being a failure of a son. I sincerely wish I could have been a son she would have been proud ofðŸ˜­. I want to thank my mom for loving me, my boss for sharing my love of aviation and my academic advisor for helping me inspite of my failures. 
God bless my family, friends, coworkers, boss, professors and classmates. To those individuals do me a favour, please live long in peace and prosper. I love you mom.
