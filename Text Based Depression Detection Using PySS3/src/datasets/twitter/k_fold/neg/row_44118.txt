Thought about jumping off a bridge yesterday but I didn'tWas considering going to a bridge over a highway near my school yesterday while telling my parents that I was gonna be at a club. Realized last minute that the method probably wouldn't work and so I went home on the bus. Guess I'm safe till I figure something else out.
