I don't know anymoreAll I am is a disappointment, I told my boyfriend I wouldn't hurt myself anymore  but it seems out of my control. He put his faith in me and I betrayed his trust. My heart feels like its sinking and there is no escape, I just want it to stop hurting. I don't want to live like this anymore, I can't take the pain, and I don't know how to stop it.
