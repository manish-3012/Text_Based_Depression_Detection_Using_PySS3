Nowhere else to goI've never done anything like this but honestly I dont know where else to go. When I was five I started getting sexually assaulted by a few men every weekend for two years. It was my half-sisters stepdad and his friends so he would wait until i was over to visit. Around nine I was assaulted by my moms friend. She was a drug addict so a lot of people would wander in and out of the house. After that I was taken from my mom by CPS (DHHS in my area) and was given to my father who wanted nothing to do with me. He wouldnt talk to me for the eight years I lived with him and when I was eighteen he kicked me out on the streets. After that I was homeless off and on, hopping apartments and couches friends would let me stay on only to have my issues flare up and i destroy it all. The first girl I fell in love with wanted to have sex but I was always afraid. Shed give me viagra and trazodone to get me to sleep so she could satisfy herself. Then she cheated on me with my gay best friend after being together for two years. Its been a year since then and its all i think about. Even now im dealing with the health effects of what she was doing to me. Cutting me, burning me, and convincing me she was my only option for love. Ive been thinking for a while now that shes right. I dont know why I typed this all out. This only scratches the surface of whats clawing at me and I guess i want this written somewhere in case I end up being able to convince myself to die. Ive been trying to block it out and man up like im supposed to and im trying to be as strong as everyone sees me being but I'm terrified of what I'll do to myself
