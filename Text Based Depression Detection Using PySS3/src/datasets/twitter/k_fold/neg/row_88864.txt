Well, it's looking more and more like it's time to bite the bulletI'm approaching my 40s in a few years, I shouldn't be a total waste of space by this point. Every year has gotten worse for me, financially. And with the way things are looking economy-wise, it's only gonna get worse.

I've been saving up to be able to rent a room from someone so I can stop staying at motels, but after weeks upon weeks of searching, I just creep too many people out. Being ugly fucking sucks in every single aspect of life. It's such a massive detriment. I'll talk to people for days, thinking things are gonna work out, I come with cash in hand, then I get some weird excuse as to why these rentals are no longer available. And I try to take care of myself, I dress well...all that. But after a man becomes a certain age, nobody gives a shit about you.

I'm homeless. Hopeless. And have decided to use that rent money on a .45 I saw at a pawn shop. 

I  don't want to put my mother through this, I really don't. She's literally the only person who gives a shit about a loser ass man that is her son. But even she knows I'm struggling in basically every single way. I hope she understands.

Because what choice have I got. 

Anyone else here ending it because of financial reasons? It's not my only reason, but it's the one that says I've got no other options. Being unlovable I can deal with. But starving and soon to be freezing on the streets come winter, how does anyone deal with that? Maybe I'm a coward...but that's ok with me too.
