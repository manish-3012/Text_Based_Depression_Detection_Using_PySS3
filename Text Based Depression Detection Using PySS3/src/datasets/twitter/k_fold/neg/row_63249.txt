Fallin deeper into the abyss.I am at my low point in life. There are people that I know that are much worse off than I am, but I can't seem to turn anything around. Within my first year of college, I nearly got kicked out for rough grades, lost all my friends, cheated on my boyfriend, had my parents deny me the chance of going to a therapist, and I just feel so alone right now. Everything would be easier for everyone if I just ceased to exist. I want to die, but I don't have the resources to kill myself. Can someone just tell me that it will be all right by the end? I hate myself for the actions I chose to take this year. My boyfriend's friends win. They've won when they put my information on 4chan. They've won when I already felt shitty about myself, knowing I fucked up. I don't mind dying anymore.
