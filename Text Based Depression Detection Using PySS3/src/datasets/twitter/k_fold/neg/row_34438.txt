thank you covid-19I don't have the courage to actually take my own life. I know that. I've know that for almost tens years now. But as soon as this virus came on the scene I couldn't help but feel a little bit excited about the idea of me getting it and falling fatally ill. With that said I really take little to no precaution when it comes to the virus because I have no regard for my own life. As a result I have strained many friendship relationships because people can't understand why I am not taking things seriously. As more people distance themselves from me, the less guilty I feel l about the things I do. So I hope I get it and I hope I get it soon. I realize this posts is very insensitive if you lost a loved one to this virus but I just can't help but wish that were me. As fucked as it sounds.
