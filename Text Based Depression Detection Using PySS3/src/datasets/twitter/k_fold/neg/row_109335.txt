Birthday is one of the hardest days of the year.Is it this way for anyone else? As a teen, I had an idea to kill myself when I turned 18. 18 came and I said... Well, maybe I can try one more year. This happens every year. Nothing ever gets better. I've spent 27 years of my life waiting for things to get better. When is enough enough? 

It's hard to go to anyone in my life about my problems or even just to talk. Everyone is so caught up in their own stuff, which is fine, but I don't know what else to do. I just wanted to get it off my chest and maybe someone will see it and it could in some way help them. I don't know how, but the universe works in mysterious ways, I guess. 

I don't have anything worth staying for. I'm almost 30. I don't have kids, I have a job I hate, nothing long term. On top of all of this, my best friend is getting married and I'm her maid of honor. I'm being such a shitty person and friend right now. I try to talk to her about it and nothing comes of it. Which is okay. I know she's busy with wedding stuff. I don't know. 

I'm so tired of waking up everyday.
