Is being overweight with anxiety and body issues a good enough (acceptable) reason to want to kill myself.I'm curious what you guys think?? Some context - I'm 19, m, senior in high school. Been overweight since 12 years old, now I'm 186 cm and weigh 91 kg. Most of that is fat, cant remember a time in life when i didnt had a bulging belly and manboobs. This has affected me with severe depression, confidence issues and anxiety. I'm an overachiever - achieved every goal I've set for myself but the fact that i haven't gotten fit or lean after trying for 5 years makes me feel like a complete failure and makes me ashamed to even be in public. There's a mantra i repeated for a year "fight for your happiness" but i failed to do so, now i feel like i don't deserve to be happy, hence i don't deserve life itself. I feel like I've missed out on so many things in highschool due to my low confidence and shit body that I'm terrified the same will happen in university. With each day the first day of uni gets closer and i feel the pressure and anxiety getting worse.
