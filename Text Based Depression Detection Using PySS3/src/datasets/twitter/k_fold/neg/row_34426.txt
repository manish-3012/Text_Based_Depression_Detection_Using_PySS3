Life sucks.Everything sucks. I feel so empty and sad I feel like I was born just to be a disappointment. I donâ€™t get the point in hurting for so long that you go completely numb then maybe getting a few moments of happiness then it all goes away again. How am I supposed to be happy when everything that used to make me happy doesnâ€™t, Iâ€™ve tried instruments, Iâ€™ve tried painting and drawing, Iâ€™ve tried all sorts of hobbies but nothing makes me feel happy. I sick of searching for happiness Iâ€™m just done. I envy people who are happy, sometimes when I see someone I know having a good time or something i purposely say something mean to try to bring them down. I hate Iâ€™ve become like this Iâ€™m bitter and sad and Iâ€™ve lost so many friends but itâ€™s all my fault so I have no reason to complain about it. Life is just terrible, or life is just terrible to me. Iâ€™m filling up the bath tub right now and Iâ€™m ready to just end it fucking all. Iâ€™m sorry India if you ever read this, which I doubt but just Incase, I love you and please donâ€™t do anything to yourself when Iâ€™m gone I love you so much I know you deserve to be happy I just wasnâ€™t made to be.
