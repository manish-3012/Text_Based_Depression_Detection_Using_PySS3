my girlfriendMy girlfriend had been acting strange recently.

I feel like me and her sister are the only ones
That understand her. She puts up this shells and acts like a fun, outgoing person but she only leaves the house of she has to.

She's into anime and video games much like myself and keeps a diary.

One time I found her diary, out of curiosity I went through it without get knowing (I know, im a scumbag) and there was entries of how she feels like an animal, that her days are empty, she has awful nightmares of her family being murdered and that me and her sister are the only ones that understand and that nobody else cares. but she still feels it isn't enough.

Her sister and I also suffer from anxiety and depression but we have the help there if we need it but she pretends she is fine so that people don't believe her when she asks for help and busy pass it of as attention seeking.

Anything her sister and I could do?

Edit: thanks to a very helpful redditor, i now know what to do, im going to open up to her about my own problems, but how, i can't tell her in person, id make things awkward
