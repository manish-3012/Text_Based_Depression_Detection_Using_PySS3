Iâ€™ve determined how.My marriage has fallen apart due to my own actions. Iâ€™m remorseful, Iâ€™m truely sorry for I have done but I am being punished. Iâ€™ve lost everything I lived for and I see no point enduring the separation where I am powerless. Iâ€™ve moved out as my wife wanted space, done everything asked of me, continuing the yard work etc, but I am done. Broken. 
I remember always being asked in counselling sessions about suicidal thoughts and of course I said yes I have had them, then I am asked if I have detailed how. I always said no. I now know how, and have visited the 300m rock face several times now to determine the perfect spot to jump to ensure guaranteed death. I drafted my suicide note on my phone, ensuring it was grammatically correct (not dying with a typo in my memory).
All I need now is the catalyst, something to tip me over the edge. My wife seeing someone else or serving me the divorce papers. At least I now know I have an out.
