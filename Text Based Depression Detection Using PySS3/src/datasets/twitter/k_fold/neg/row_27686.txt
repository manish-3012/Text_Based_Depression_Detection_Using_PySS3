I feel like cryingWhenever I donâ€™t get enough sleep I typically feel like crying whenever I start having my suicidal thoughts. I mean I usually have them everyday, but on days where I donâ€™t get enough rest the feeling that normal people donâ€™t think about suicide at the rate that I do just hits a little harder yâ€™know? Anyway, I didnâ€™t really know where to post this, but I had to get it off my chest so I just dropped it here. I hope anyone that sees this is having a nice day. Iâ€™m boutta go nap.
