Iâ€™m at the absolute end.Iâ€™m 29 and I have been ...just dealing with this since I was 8 or so. My entire life has truly been one horrible thing after another. I grew up in a really horrible household with a lot of emotional abuse. All my family are drug addicts. 

I have borderline personality disorder and get called â€œweird, crazy, clingy, psycho, etcâ€ all of the fucking time. I have never set out to intentionally hurt anymore. I have such a kind heart. I truly donâ€™t understand what I do to push EVERYONE away. Iâ€™m in a stare of confusion constantly. 

I just moved to WA and have truly never felt so pathetic. I thought coming here would change everything, but this horrible side of me followed. 

Iâ€™m so done being embarrassed all the time. Iâ€™m done apologizing for my behavior. I AM the â€œtoxicâ€ person to avoid and Iâ€™m so sad about this. 

Shit has not let up. Iâ€™m EXHAUSTED. Iâ€™m so so so tired of fighting this. Part of me doesnâ€™t want to die. I want to believe that it will get better but wtf when?! Iâ€™m almost 30 and Iâ€™m so god damn fucking miserable ALL THE TIME. What am I even living for anymore?!
