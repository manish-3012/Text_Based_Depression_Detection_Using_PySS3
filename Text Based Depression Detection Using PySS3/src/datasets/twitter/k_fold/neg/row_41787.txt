Please suggest me the quickest way to end my life, I can't take it anymore.I am sure other people may have struggles that are worst than mine but because of ADHD and Aspergers; my life has become a complete living hell. [A part of my college struggle] (https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/3y5c5s/needadvice_how_can_an_unhappy_and_unsuccessful/), [(another link)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/3zkfxf/needadvice_odd_question_but_i_must_ask_how_do_you/) and my horrible past. I've always lived alone, isolated with others, was bullied and physically/verbally abused. All the damage is now showing up as I am at one of the most important points of my life. I cannot bring any good news to my parents, they have worked so hard to sacrifice themselves for my education. People around me are either getting married or entering tech related jobs with starting salary of 6 digit figure, yet I am struggling to survive engineering college with a low gpa and bad grades. Everyone seems to achieve this very easily yet I try even harder than them, I still make mistakes. I have no friends or ever had any, no one cares for me, I am socially awkward, I am not sleeping enough, everyone can see that I am weak and dependent, I am distracted with internet surfing and it is SO HARD to control this.

I never though my life would be this hopeless, I've done so much to make a difference but I see no results, only rejection. All this madness of my life is bringing me down, I can't take it anymore. I've failed myself, my parents, everyone. I have lost focus and can't rebound anymore. Other people's success simply haunts me. I have a mind that thinks all the time and cannot stop. This weight is too much to bear. Please suggest me something, I don't want to wake up anymore.; the mental pain is too much.
