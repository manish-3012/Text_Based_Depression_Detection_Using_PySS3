My doctor is uselessMy doctor is so useless I donâ€™t even know how heâ€™s a doctor. He sees everything in a black and white fashion. Never thinks outside the box. If I tell him Iâ€™m suffering somewhere, heâ€™ll just think of one symptom and write me a useless drug that wonâ€™t my problem in the slightest. Iâ€™ve always to give life a chance, but my doctor truly is making my life harder by not believing me. So fucking tiring.
