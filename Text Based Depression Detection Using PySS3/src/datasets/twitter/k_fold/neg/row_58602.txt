A letter to my missing friendI'm heading out to a forest soon, the same one where we used to hang out with our old mates together.

I remember the tents and the campfire we put up in the clearing, hopefuly some new youth are looking after the paradise we made.

I won't be bringing weed, alcohol and drugs to the forest like the good times though.

I'm bringing a rope with me to hang from a tree, I imagine you've already done this and I'll find you there. We can hang out one last time.
