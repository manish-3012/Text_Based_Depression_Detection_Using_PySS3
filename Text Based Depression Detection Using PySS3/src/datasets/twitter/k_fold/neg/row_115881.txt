Tried to kill myself for the third time this yearI feel so helpless and pathetic. I have no direction in my life and don't know where I'm going.

I've tried to hang myself by tying a cord to a doorknob, but I can't go all the way through with it. I always end up shaking, crying and having a panic attack afterwards.

I've posted before hoping for some advice, but at this point I'd settle for a stranger on the internet telling me that I'm not a pathetic piece of shit.
