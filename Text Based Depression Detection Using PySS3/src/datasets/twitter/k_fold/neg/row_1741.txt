I ruin everythingThe title says it all. I'm tired of causing pain to everyone around me. My girlfriend and I were planning to get engaged next month, but thanks to my anger issues and past trauma I took any excitement she had left away and she's currently sobbing right now saying that nothing makes her happy anymore. This is my fault. I drag others down into my whirlpool of shadow so much that soon they find that they cannot get out. I'm tired of it.  I've tried therapy and SSRIs with minimal results. Other people deserve a chance at happiness, and I cannot offer it to them. My girlfriend deserves better than the abusive sack of shit I am. 

I am nothing. Just one meaningless life in the void - one that humanity would benefit from my death. I can't think of anyone that would miss me. Maybe tonight I can finally remove myself from this consciousness.
