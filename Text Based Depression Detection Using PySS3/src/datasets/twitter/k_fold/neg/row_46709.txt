Got the C+ I knew was coming, ending it tonight.I waited, I hoped, I still got the C+. On campus interviews are out, and even with better grades elsewhere my law career is probably toast when combined with the C+ in Civ Pro in the fall. I was able to explain that one away as an outlier, but this is a label of failure and an official death sentence. This is proof that I am destined to fail, and to die. 

I tried, I failed, there's no shame in death. I don't have a viable backup plan, no good masters program will take me with these C's and my political science background and prior military occupation offers no real path to success going forward. It's retail or death and I choose to die.
