Im not sure how to keep going at this pointI've spent pretty much my whole time at college just getting by without doing barely any work and i think its about to catch up with me. Now its looking really likely that ill fail at least one of my classes, and if i do i don't think there's any way for me to graduate, but despite that I still cant seem to focus on my work.
