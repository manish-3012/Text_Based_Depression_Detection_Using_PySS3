I have a plan. I have everything i need.Is it time? 
I think it is. 
But its just been me and my dog alone together for a while now. 
Nobody has checked on us in a week. 
I just dont want him here when i go. 
 I have 10 Vicodin 10 xanex, 2 oxy30s 5 hydrocodone
And a 12 gauge shockwave is those dont work.

I feel like im going to wake up from this nightmare. But i cant. 
Weed used to calm me. Now if i smoke i have a panic attack. 

Maybe ill wake up early and enjoy my last sunrise in the morning... Its been nice in the Alamo city this week.
