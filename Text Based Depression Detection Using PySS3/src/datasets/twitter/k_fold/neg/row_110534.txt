I could have died when I was an infantMy mom told me a story that when I was a baby, less than a year, that I somehow got a penny or quarter stuck in my throat.  And that I had stopped breathing, and she hit my back a few times and it popped out.

I wish everyday it hadn't.  I wish I had died then.

There was a question on the frontpage that asked "if you could call yourself from 5 years ago, what would you say?"  Instantly the thought was, "just kill yourself now.  it doesn't get better."

It really doesn't.  It just gets worse and worse. 

Everyday I wake up.  And everyday I fail.
