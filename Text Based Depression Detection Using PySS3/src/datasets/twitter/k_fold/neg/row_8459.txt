this is it.This is life. Youre born, you go to school and get a job and eventually die. Life wasnt made for people like me. Ive been fucked with anxiety and depression. I cant ask for a fucking ketchup packet at a restraunt let alone interact with people on a daily basis. I was not made to function in the society that we've built today. Theres no point in me being here. Im insignificant. I hate myself. Theres no point anymore. I dont know what to do. I cant breathe, but i dont want to.
