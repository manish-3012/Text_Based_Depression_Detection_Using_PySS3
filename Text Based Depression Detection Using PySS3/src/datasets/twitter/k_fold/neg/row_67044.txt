I Don't Know What To DoI know I'm capable of doing so much with my life. I'm young (20), talented, and I have many people that love me. I have no idea why I let myself feel so low.

I've been diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder. I feel that I'm way too young to be properly diagnosed, and I don't want to go on any medications that will not help me. I know I can do so much with my life; I just lack motivation. I have random spurts of motivation. I'll shower, organize, and work towards my goals. These spurts will last anywhere between three hours to three days.

After a while, all motivation is lost. I stop showering, I start hurting myself (punching/cutting), and I ignore the world around me.

I guess I just need someone to talk to. I have many "friends" and family that I can talk to, but I feel more comfortable with strangers on the internet (weird, eh?)

I cut myself pretty bad a few days ago, but I stopped myself before I could commit suicide (if you couldn't tell).

I just need someone to talk to. Is there anyone here that can chat with me for a while? Thank you in advance.
