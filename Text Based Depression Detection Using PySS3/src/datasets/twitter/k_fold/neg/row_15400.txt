I really can't do life anymore.I can't anymore. I've been lying to myself and my family for so long, for years and years. I'm not okay. I'm suicidal. I'm depressed. I want to die. I've planned everything out, and even have a note. I really need help.

I've been lying to myself for so long, saying if I grit my teeth I can push past it and continue my college education without therapy, without medication. But I give up today. I can't do it.

I want to drop all my classes now. I want to drop out of college. I want to stay in my room and kill myself. I can't stand waking up everyday and already feeling suicidal.

I can't live like this anymore.
