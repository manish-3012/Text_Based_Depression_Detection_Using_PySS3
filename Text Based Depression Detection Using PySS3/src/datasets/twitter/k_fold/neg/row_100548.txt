I tried overdosing two weeks agoI'm tired of pretending I'm ok. I'm also tired of pretending things will be ok. Because they won't. Therapy and meds don't work for me, and they won't. I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm probably one of those treatment resistant cases. I'm sick of hearing my psychiatrist telling me my meds are working. They're definitely not. They don't do shit. Except maybe for seroquel. It puts me to sleep. And that's what this dumbass here tried to OD with. Needless to say, it didn't work. I'm just tired that no matter what I do, suicidal thoughts are always just around the corner.
