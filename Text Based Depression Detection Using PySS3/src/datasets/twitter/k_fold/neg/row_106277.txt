I should have died by my birth. God didn't give my life.I was to die just after my birth. I am disabled. I have weak cerebral palsy. I hate myself, my body my look, my illness. I am ugly because of my sickness, so I don't have to say about my relationship situation. I don't have real friends, I am not able to drink like other, to dance like others, to go out like like others. I can't drive a car. I am isolated in four walls of my house. 

The only person who I talked to about my problems an suicidal thoughts is my mom. But even she just barked at me and told not talk like this. She thinks I just imagined all my problems. No one fucking cares about fucking me.  

I was long thinking why I don't have life like others. The answer is that God, the reality wanted me to die by my birth. I just don't have life created to me. Nature just doesn't want me to exist. It is the reason I am think more and more about suicide. Each day I wear happy masks but when I am alone my hatred explodes. I just don't want to suffer more.
