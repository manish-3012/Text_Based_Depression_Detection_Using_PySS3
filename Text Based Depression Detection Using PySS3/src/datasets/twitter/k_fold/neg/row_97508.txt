hello redditors?I guess you could say I'm in a pretty bad place right now. I've had depression since I was a young teenager. Currently, I'm back home for the summer from college and I've never felt more miserable in my life. I fell into a pretty deep depression after my ex and I broke up which is why I decided to transfer schools. For a while, everything seemed to get better; talked to a therapist, got some medication from the doctor, thought I was (for the most part) over it. Been back in town for a few days and all these memories come flooding back. Medication isn't helping anymore, and I've just been staring at nothing for the better part of the day wishing everything would just end. I've never been SUPER optimistic and I am having a horrible time figuring out the point of living. I'm horrible at socializing (I guess?) and haven't had a really good group of friends since I was a kid. My parents are great and the biggest reason I'm alive right now, but if they weren't I probably would have died a while ago. They've always been the biggest obstacle when I have thoughts like this, but I don't know if that's enough anymore. I hate who I am. I am not good at anything. I'm that guy you don't notice. Quiet, seems nice and probably has a decent life, but on the inside I feel like absolute chaos. I just would like to go out peacefully and not bother anyone so they can continue their lives as normal.
TL;DR Hate everything about myself.
