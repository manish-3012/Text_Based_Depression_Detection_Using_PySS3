Why do i feel hopeless???its been a few week since i broke up with my girlfriend cause we dont talk to each other that much anymore and it feels like it my fault and i know she told me its not my fault but why does it feel like it is and everyday i think about pretending its was okay and it wasnt going to last but we were together for 4 years since 8th grade and our relationship was strong we would talk about after high school how we would move to a country side and stuff like that but then this Quarantine happened we lost contact with each other she just lost interest with me then one day she messaged me that our relationship wont work i actually was heartbroken and ever since that i actually had thoughts about suicide but i couldnt get through with it cause i was afraid that i would hurt my grandparents so i kept to myself pretended that nothing was wrong i would cry myself to sleep when im alone in my room thinking that i didnt do anything right and i did everything wrong with my relationship and i feel hopeless everyday....
