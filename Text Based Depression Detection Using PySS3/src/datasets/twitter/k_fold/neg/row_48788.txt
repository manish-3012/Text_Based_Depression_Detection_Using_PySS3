I dont even know why I'm here anymoreLife has always been rough. My family has been kicked from home to home. My parents had a horrible divorce. I've always been the Wierd kid thats had hardly any friends.... And I've been able to deal with it all.... But I recently broke up with the girl that made me happiest, and its the straw that broke the camels back. She left me for someone else, after a 1.5 year long relationship. She made me forget what I had been through. She was perfect. I wasn't depressed when I was with her. But just out of the blue she broke up with me and left. I'm destroyed. All the happiness in my life is gone. She was my meaning to life... And now she's gone. I dont know what to do with myself anymore. Its been a month, and I still can't sleep a full night. I hardly eat. There is no joy anymore. I'm reminded of my past now,  how dark everything was and its crawling back. 

I think at this point in just venting. I know people have had it worse, they have. But maybe I'm just weak. I can't take it anymore. I'm tired, and sore and I can't just do it anymore. There's a bridge close to where I live, and everyday feels like I'm getting drawn closer and closer to jumping off of it and just releasing this pain. I'm lonely now. I'm weird and I know it. I can't socialize anymore. I feel like a weight is crushing me everywhere I go.

I just dont know what to say or to do. All I really do is sleep and stay in my room. She's changed. The only true happiness I found was in her, and I was always there for her through the thick and thin. But it wasn't enough I guess

I'm sorry, its become a rant at this point. I just want this pain to end. I don't want to be here anymore... But I'm still trying to find that last glimmer of hope. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm sorry for the errors, I'm just sort of typing on auto pilot at this point
