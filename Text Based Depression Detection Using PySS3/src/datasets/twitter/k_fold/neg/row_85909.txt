Want to be committed but I can't stand the stigmaI've been randomly crying all day. I think I may be suffering from some sort of disorder like bipolarism or dementia. I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for quite some time. I've had thoughts of suicide and I've had a constant pain in my head now for two months. I want to be committed and put under psychiatric observation but once I do that I've crossed a line. My family knows I've been down and I've always been very low energy but if I do this I'm going to scare them. Being the only guy in my immediate family I don't want to do this. Also,  while they know I'm somewhat depressed they will find out that I'm suicidal as well as anything else that might be wrong with me. What should I do?
