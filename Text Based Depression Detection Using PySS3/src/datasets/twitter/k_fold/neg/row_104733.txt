Am i crazy? :DI was hit hard by clinical depression some couple of months ago, it was extremly intense but thankfully didn't last for so long, just 3 months of utter agony. Needless to say the experiance was new to me, i knew nothing about the disorder and had no obvious reasons to be depressed.

 Now as you know, depression is a package that has all the good stuff in it, one of which is suicidal thoughts. Death to a depressed person is like jumping into that warm bed after a long day of work where it's raining outside knowing tomorow is a day off ... You got the picutre it's simply sweet!

Now here's the thing, even after recovering from it, feeling the sun on my face, the air in my lungs the blood in my vains, enjoying a good laugh ... l'm still obsessed by suicide, thinking about it every day, every moment, whith no negative mindset at all, just hypnotized by the idea, the simplicity, the possibility, the serinity of it all.

What i like to do these days is put one bullet in the chamber of my gun, holding it to my head, closing my eyes and simply feeling it, the cold barrel on my skin, the Frodo's like temptation of the ring, the complete clearence of the mind and the ultimate sensation of peace. I sometimes lose myself in it to the point where my limbs and body go numb from how well relaxed they became.

So am i crazy? Is anyone here guilty of the same act? What is this exactly? And should i go gentle into that good night or resist its temptation? Love to hear your thoughts about!
