Why the fuck does everyone just use me?I don't get it. Why me? My life is a cycle of finding someone new, then fucking it up. All my friends don't actually like me, they told me to my face. I got new friends, and they don't show interest in me whatsoever, only when its convenient. My last two relationships with girls, they just used me to get back at someone else. The worst thing is, at the end of it all, I've always been the problem. I haven't had anyone genuinely apologise to me for such a long fucking time, its been over a year now. Every conflict, argument or problem (school or social) I get in, Im always the one having to apologise. I don't think I was made for this world, 2021 will be the last.
