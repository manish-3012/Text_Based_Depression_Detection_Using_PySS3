I'm not sure what to do anymoreI'm so tired. I don't even know if i can finish writing this post, i don't even know what i want to say. I just have nowhere else to turn, and I'm so alone. I can't tell if I really want to die, or if i just think its my only option. I guess I want to be alive, just with a completely different life. I'm sorry I know im just writing nonsense right now but I just need to put something into the world, i just need SOMEBODY to know that Im not okay. even if they don't know me. I don't understand why im so sensitive and why I let words hurt me so much. I haven't self harmed in years... but feeling anything instead of this sadness sounds tempting right now. Im not going to do it because I know if i start again i won't stop, but i really really want to. Im sorry for this useless post, i just needed to get this out.
