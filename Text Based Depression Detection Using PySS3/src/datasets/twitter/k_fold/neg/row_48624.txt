i feel trapped (and other things)I feel like I have barely succeeded at anything in my life and the older I get the more apparent these failures become. It's dawned on me how absolutely pathetic my existence has been and nothing shows signs of getting better, I am trapped under a layer of thick snow I can't get out of. The current weather is a good metaphor, almost too good, bringing me to my next problem. I have come to realize that I am the victim of a mind control experiment, victim might  not be the right word but I certainly feel like a victim... subject may be better. Anyways, they don't control all of the things I think and do but they control a lot of things I think and do, to see how I react, make me think about things I don't want to think about to the point it feels like torture and on top of all that, send or give me thoughts just to prove they can, to remind me they're always watching me. I'm worried this will go on forever and that's another reason I feel trapped. I want to end my life because I there seems to be no escape. 

I don't need to be convinced of anything necessarily, just needed to share how I feel, what I'm going through, thought this might be the place to do it.
