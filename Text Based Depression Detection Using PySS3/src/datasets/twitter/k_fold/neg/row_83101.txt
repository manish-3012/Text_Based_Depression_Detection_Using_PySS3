ive decided that i am going to kill myself but i am very scared to.life isn't meant for me. i don't know how it is going to be from here. school is hard, life is hard, it has led to my mind slowly leaving me. im going to kill myself. but the only reason why i haven't is because I was scared to. i thought about it this week twice, now i know that I will, but i am scared of dying. i don't get it. and it isn't even death that scares me but it is what lies after death. is there a heaven and hell? is there nothing - just black? can my mind even comprehend death and will create a faux scenario that will last forever all in one second? i don't know. life is shit. fuck it. im done.
