I don't want to think of my future13, already done with life. I feel like I've been here forever. Everyone says I have "so much to live for" so much to see, but I don't want to see. I don't want to experience anymore. My life is in shambles. I don't have any friends. Everyone has left me. Nobody cares. It's selfish for others to keep me alive. Nothing is alright. Imagining my future makes me want to end it further. Thinking about how much I'll miss, I'll never have anything back, I'm condemned here. Everyone's just so hostile. I just want the pain to be over. everytime I tried to reach out I got ignored, blocked or they argued with me. It's just too hard. I remember my last attempt, everyone only cared if I lived. As soon as they found out I was alive they gone back to not caring. I have no support systems. Nobody to go back to. I'm stuck here. I can't kill myself, my parents have everything locked and i can't jump off anything. I just want to be free. My right arm hurts so much. Where the IV went, it won't stop aching and feeling like it's still in. I don't want to go back to school. I don't want to stay home. I just want it to end.
