dear community, do you ever feel like you're being emotionally blackmailed?I know how little you guys like the idea that suicide should be legal. I think I understand why. 

I just, I don't know what to do with myself. I hate being here. I didn't choose this for myself. I feel forced into living and I resent people who try to stop me dying. 

I resent people who tell me it will cause others pain. That seems like such a stupid thing to say. There is pain no matter what, and when people say this to me the only thing I head is, "their well being is more important than yours". 

My existence was the choice of an unwell woman. She chose to keep me because she thought I could provide her with the love she had been denied all through her life. It's a beautiful thought, isn't it? This unloved unwanted woman holding a tiny baby and for once someone loves her just for who she is.. aw..

But that baby isn't a machine for providing validation. It's a growing human who has needs that will go unaddressed. Big surprise, the abused woman that no one loves has a shit load of psychological issues that will prevent her from being a fit mother.
 
Now this fucking baby is a grown adult and dealing with the result of all that neglect. and she wants to die.. and when she tells people that she wants to die, and that it's unfair of them to chastise her for it.. she's met with hatred. 

even here, on this sub, met with hatred for suggesting that she should be allowed to do with her life what she wants, for commiserating with others when they say they want the same. People belittle her challenges and tell her that neglect is no reason to want to die

I mean whatever, it's not the worst thing that has happened. But I'm saying it right now.

THIS LIFE WAS FORCED UPON ME AND I DON'T WANT IT. I AM BEING EMOTIONALLY BLACKMAILED INTO STAYING. I hate it. I fucking hate it. But I'm not a monster and I don't want people I care about to be in pain so I guess I will stay here. I will continue to mutilate myself, body and soul. What else can I do?
