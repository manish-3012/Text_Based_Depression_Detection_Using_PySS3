Waiting for my parents to kick me out to kill myselfI donâ€™t care. Iâ€™m a pathetic useless peace of shit who has absolutely no motivation or desire. I work at a dead end shithole fast food job. Iâ€™m completely fucking useless and get to anxious and depressed to develop real skills. Hell everyday when I wake up I feel like Iâ€™m dreaming more so then living. Iâ€™m so stressed out yet from doing so much nothing all the time. I donâ€™t do anything other then miserably pace around all day. I donâ€™t watch YouTube, I donâ€™t really read bc I canâ€™t process what Iâ€™m reading as much as I want, I donâ€™t watch TV, I have no interest, hobbies. The dreams I want are unbelievably unrealistic bc I would have to be so good at life to achieve them. Im downing over here screaming and dying for help but thereâ€™s none. I want to die. Iâ€™m ready. Homelessness will come in due time and when it does Iâ€™ll pull the plug then
