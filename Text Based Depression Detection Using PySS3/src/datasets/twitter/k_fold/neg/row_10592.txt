Thinking about my lifeYou know, they always say that if you wait, or act and take care of you own fate, life is gonna change and get better.
For my case it's a lie. I know too well how i have not an happy ending, but a bad one. And few will care or understand as the times goes by. That happens if life has been easy on you, pain is temporary. If, like me, always had to deal with loneliness and betrayal, and to act as an adult before the proper age came, to forget of being a kid for the sake of others, you won't have any tools to process pain or cope with it properly, cause you only got spitted in the face for years by life.

Thanks god this likely is my last year in this pit. My resolution and peace with the decision has never been so strong. Already found the day, and few will mourn me or remember me as many more died that sad day.

I finally understand peace for what really is. Time to vanish upon thin air

Thanks for reading this, it means a lot to me ðŸ˜Œ
