I'm running out of steam, and I'm about to hit a dead end.I always knew it was gonna happen, but now I really think I've reached the end of the road on this one. I've had depression and anxiety that has become severe over the years. I havent told anyone about it and I dont plan to. If I ever did that would just completely alienate me from the people around me. So I'm safe here telling random people on reddit who will never know me because if you did yould wonder what the hell a guy like me is doing here writing this bullshit for. So much fucking pain built up inside me, all those nights where I went home and cried in my room until 7am after having my self confidence driven though the ground by someone. Alot of times from people I would probably hesitate to call my friends. Always me, I'm always the target, all my life being ridiculed and thought little of, people throwing dirt on my name. Yould say just let it go, the thoughts dont matter, but how can I do that when the depression has already spread like cancer in my mind with no cure? I'm just wasted potential with my thoughts and feelings just rotting inside me because I'm too beta to do anything about them. And here I am a first year college student and I'm about to get kicked out of my program that would lay out my life, and fucked over by a girl who I really like. I thought I could make something out of myself, that this was my chance to have something to stand for, and compensate for after all those years of failure and embarrassment. Reading week is next week. My GPA has gone to shit, beyond repair, and the girl I like is gonna fuck another guy when she gets back, and theres nothing I can do about it. What a waste of my dads hard earned money, for a piece of scum like me. Just the thought of that alone tears me apart. Ive been there and done that with her, and I can swear she likes me. No I *know* she likes me. She always has to come see me, get touchy, then act all shy and nervous because she knows her friends dont want her to be with me. Hell I recently even  caught her taking a pic of me beside me (cus the flash went off in my face then she tried to play it off) but its like she feels the need to hide her feelings from me, probably because she agrees with her friends and knows I'm not capable of having a relationship with anyone, and because thats what it would have to be to go any further. So now shes getting desperate, and so am I. What a needy worthless fuck I've become. Ive gone fucking insane obsessing over the thought that my feelings are about to be thrown in the toilet (along with my future), they mean nothing, just as they never did. I know I'm just being an over dramatic teenage-pussy about this, but enough is enough.

So this is how it all ends for me, what a shame. If only I didn't fuck up, or could handle my thoughts. I have a container with enough sleeping pills to kill me twice, and a bottle of JD to wash it down when I get back. I dont want to die, but it really doesnt matter anymore.
