Why?I don't even know why I'm posting this. Anyone who replies is just here to do what they do. You guys don't care. But, nor do I, I guess.

I'm a sociopath, I'm very smart, and I come from a (lower?) middle class family 40-50k/yr (family of four). I can do my school work, I can get good grades, but what's the fucking point? I can't keep up a conversation for two sentences before slurring a word, because when I was a little kid, my parents had me in all these places because "I had no filter", or "I couldn't control myself". Now, during a conversation, I question every word I say, "did I sound stupid?" "Did I offend them?" "Was there a better word I could have used there?". All of this contributes to my inability to hold up a conversation. I can't wait for college, not that I could even afford it. I recently accepted that I was gay, which, in itself, fucking sucks. Literally. My friend group isn't small, but I get the feeling that none of them really give a fuck about me. Who does? My parents don't. My dad is too busy with his shitty job, and my mom with being just a goddamn fuckwit.

My mom always manipulates my dad, if I got a C on my report card, she'll call him and start screaming how in flunking out of fucking school, but he'll never care enough to look at the report card, he just believes everything she says, and runs straight to yell at me.

My dads pretty cool, much better than my mom, but he's so easily manipulated, and just plain stupid.

I have oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder (same thing ?), OCD, and ADD. My mom had been smoking weed since before I was born, I recently found out,  which probably contributed to this, which I can't help but think its her fault. This all just holds be back from being able to work at my full potential. I work at 1/2 of what I could, because of that shit. 

I want to kill myself, finally. I've tried before. The only thing keeping me on this earth is my cat and dog. Like what the fuck.
