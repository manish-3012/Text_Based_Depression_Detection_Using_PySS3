Iâ€™m just 15..Iâ€™m just 15 and i donâ€™t see another way out than dying. I live with my parents in a horrible country(iâ€™m from two different nations and i live in the horrible one), where i am not accepted and where i feel enclosed in the prison of not only society but also the streets, the city and the whole island. I asked my parents to let me move to my boyfriend when iâ€™m 16(he lives in Germany)- i first asked to go to a boarding school in europe but my parents canâ€™t afford it and there are no complete scholarships. My parents donâ€™t allow it saying iâ€™m just young and dumb and dont understand what i want. School just fucks me up, although iâ€™m one of the best students in my year group i have anxiety before every test. When i tell my parents that they say iâ€™m kidding, just because they donâ€™t see me study(but i do). I told them that it has been 2.5 years since iâ€™ve felt happiness here and they said they dont believe me because i always looked happy- well fuck you, i have been hiding my sadness and my depression, i have been draining myself. I feel like all that i am is my school achievements and my grades: when i say that school drains me, they tell me that my grades are good tho. I have a blockage with grades, so i canâ€™t NOT study(because that is my place in that school society, my tiny invisible place, but i dont wanna lose that if i stay). I dont have friends here. The people â€œcloseâ€ to me are just there so i dont seem lonely... here iâ€™m not living, iâ€™m waiting. And iâ€™m honestly not up to wait until iâ€™m 18, to leave as an emotionally wrecked piece of shit. My parents wont even let me catch a flight to visit my boyfriend who is the person who gives me comfort(because they say that i should give myself time and because they just hope my relationship wonâ€™t work.) The point is: iâ€™m not surviving this if i dont leave soon. I donâ€™t want to set myself a time limit(again) but i dont see me here in a few months- in one way or another.
