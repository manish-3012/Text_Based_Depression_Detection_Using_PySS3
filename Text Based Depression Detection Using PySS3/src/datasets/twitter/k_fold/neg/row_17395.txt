Why do you care if other people kill themselvesI'm genuinely curious about why people try to convince others not to die. We all die eventually anyhow. Where is the big tragedy in a life ending a few years sooner? We don't even know what death means so what makes you all so adamant about the notion that people should "hold on" or "keep going"?
