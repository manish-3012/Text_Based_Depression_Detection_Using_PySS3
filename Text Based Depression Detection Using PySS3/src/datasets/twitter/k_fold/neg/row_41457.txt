I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t know if I canI hate being alive. Itâ€™s been so, so, SO long since Iâ€™ve enjoyed being alive. Iâ€™ve finally came to the conclusion that itâ€™s not going to cheat better. Thatâ€™s a load of horse shit, that whole â€œIt will always get betterâ€ shit. Iâ€™m tired of being told that. For years, I tried to keep telling myself that and I canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™ve taken so many medications that I canâ€™t even remember the names of half of them, Iâ€™ve seen so many therapists, psychiatrists, and been to so many groups and Iâ€™m still feeling this way. I know itâ€™s not going to get better. 

I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore. I used to love art and music and shit like that but now I just donâ€™t have to the motivation to do those kind of things anymore. I used to enjoy long, warm showers to help me relax but I canâ€™t even do those anymore. I donâ€™t even shower period. I donâ€™t eat, but when I do itâ€™s junk, I donâ€™t brush my teeth, I donâ€™t brush my hair, the fucking works. Iâ€™m a fucking slob. I never leave the house unless itâ€™s me being forced to go to school. Oh god, Iâ€™m so miserable. Iâ€™m tired of being sorry for myself. 

Literally nobody will care if I die. Like, nobody. First of all, I donâ€™t have any friends. Nada, nope, none. Second of all, my parents donâ€™t like me. Iâ€™ve been a freeloader all of my life, not contributing to the household whatsoever (their words, not mine) and also I donâ€™t ever talk to them because it usually ends up in argument. The problem is that Iâ€™m not brave enough to kill myself. I have every reason to, I just am not motivated enough (ha).  Everything sucks, yada yada ya, blah.
