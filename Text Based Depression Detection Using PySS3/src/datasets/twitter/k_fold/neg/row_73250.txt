Thank you but i think i will stop hereNever thought I'd get destroyed by a breakup, yet it happened. I guess I never truly loved anyone before her, even though I thought so. Time will heal everything, or so they say, but it's been a while... It doesn't get better, you just get used to it. And instead of wanting to die, you just feel like you're already dead... And even if I get there, old and tired, I know, deep down in my mind, my last thought will be of her, smiling and dancing, young and happy; we both were...

And so i still choose death in 2-3 months, i have an entrance exam for profession in psychology in 2 months and they will announce it in the next month 

If i fail, i think i will ending it all. 
I'm just tired i guess.
