Hey guys. Been a while.Iâ€™m of a similar mind to many of you. Iâ€™ve lost any sort of comfortable connection to those around me, and feel a strong hopelessness as I watch them succeed at climbing the slope.

I donâ€™t exactly know how to put it into words, but Iâ€™ll try. As the Earth falls apart, I do what I can to make it better. I have lots of reusable items. Cut down on water. Eat little. Take care of pets better than I do myself.

But the ugly truth is that I will be subject to the abysmal future we have set up as a species. Iâ€™m young. I donâ€™t care to divulge how so. This only leaves me a constant dreading for that which I will come to know.

I already have little money, chemical imbalances, and an intense lack of social familiarity. If I could somehow trust someone enough to create a best friend, it would probably do wonders. Oh, how I try.

But in the wake of all this loneliness, time lends itself to me. Solitary thought is sometimes soothing, though more often an abrasive wave of self-hatred and logical contemplation on why I deserve this life Iâ€™ve been burdened with.

The future I see is solitary, empty of the life for which most hold little to no reverence. But especially for me, and those like me. Because our thought process force us into a repeating cycle that causes us to create posts like this.

Hereâ€™s to the end someday. Cheers.
