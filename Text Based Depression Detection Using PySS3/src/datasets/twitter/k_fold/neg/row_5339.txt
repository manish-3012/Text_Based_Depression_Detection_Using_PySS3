Does walking only part of the way to the spot of death count as a suicide attempt?On Monday at around 2 in the morning, I walked towards a train station near where I live, with the intention of killing myself by running in front of the express trains that travel through the station at full speed. However, as I got about a third of the way there, I became exhausted and decided that finishing the trip wasn't worth it. I then turned around and walked back home.

I know the answer to this question might seem obvious to you guys, but ever since it happened I just haven't been able to figure it out. Does this count as a suicide attempt, even if I didn't get anywhere close to the thing I intended on killing myself with? Thanks.
