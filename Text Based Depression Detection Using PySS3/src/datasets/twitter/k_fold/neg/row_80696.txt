Does the pain ever end?I always want everyone around me to be happy, to be supported and healthy, I was a pillar for when they couldn't be strong enough alone. I cannot crumble and let everyone down but I'm afraid I cannot handle another moment anymore. 



I'd rather have brushed my problems aside, spent countless hours beside hospital beds, been a shoulder to cry on, given all the love I could while smiling through the physical and emotional pain. 



In over 7 years I finally just went through 2 months without night crying myself to sleep, only for it all to come back stronger. Even my hobbies ache to the bone to attempt. 



I don't know how long I can hold out, I've tried to reach out, I've written many hypothetical final notes, I've been reckless, not eating, smiling a hollow smile while looking for final closure and assurance everyone's okay. 



The pain is overwhelming, if there's any other way to take it away I would.
