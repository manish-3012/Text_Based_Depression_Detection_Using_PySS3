I can't think of a way to kill myself without traumatizing othersI watched a documentary on coast guards and I saw what jumpers did to them. I can't jump from the windows of my apartment lest I land on someone, and I'm bound to be found by unsuspecting neighbours. I can't check into a hotel and slash my wrists or hang myself for a similar reason. I can't kill myself in my bedroom/bathroom because someone is always at home.

I just want to remove myself from existence without anyone knowing. When I was much younger and prone to melodrama I wanted people to grieve over my death but now I realize it's completely the opposite when things get serious. Usually the meds helped me go to sleep but nowadays I spend at least an hour trying to come up with a way to kill myself that would also be least bothersome to people. 

This is not a post crying for help, wanting to be dissuaded from suicide, nor am I writing this to show that "I care too much" or "I'm too kind". It's a legitimate concern for me. Seeing the aftermath of suicide would horrify people even if they don't know me. I don't want them to feel the way I do right now because of how I ended things. I imagine I won't care about this anymore when I decide "this is the day" but for now I'm still exploring my options.
