Iâ€™ve been in a bad place for years...... The other day my 11-year-old nephew and I was having a conversation. He mentioned to me that I mustâ€™ve been so happy on my recent birthday. And I was honest and told him I wasnâ€™t. And I also told him that Iâ€™m not usually happy. He asked me when the last time I was happy was, and I couldnâ€™t remember at first. After a while I realized It was late April early May 2019. Over a year ago. I was happy for a few hours after I got my test back for some thing I really studied hard for.

In the past four years Iâ€™ve probably had only seven or eight days that I felt OK. Not good, but just neutral. And maybe three or four days that I was happy. Almost every day for four years Iâ€™m in a lot of pain emotionally, or physically, And I donâ€™t know if other peopleâ€™s experiences are like this with depression.

I exercise regularly. I try to eat right (At least nowadays I do). Drink lots of water. Go outdoors and hike with my dog. I stay connected with family. I talk to friends and hang out with them. I keep a lot of activities and hobbies. I do so much just to feel better all the time. Iâ€™m starting to get very hopeless about ever getting better. 

Is other peoples experience with depression and suicidal thoughts similar? Is it just me or is everything terrible? I never feel good. And I started to tell myself that this is just something I have to accept.
