Everything I try just makes it worse and I can't take anymoreThe only time I feel happy is thinking about ways to die soon. I'm completely trapped in a horrible routine of work, chores and useless medical treatments for my mental conditions. I'm so tired of everything and a few weeks ago the only friend I could rely on left because I'm just not worth the trouble ultimately. Everything I try to do backfires and I just get worse and worse. Waiting to just jump at the chance to die hopefully very soon. Can't do anything right now, just wondering if anyone is there.
