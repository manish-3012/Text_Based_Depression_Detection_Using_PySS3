I don't know how to dream anymore and I want to give upI don't know what happened but around the time I was 10 something clicked in me. Within a day I completely lost my ability to dream about a future. I stopped trying in school, I lost normal habits (showering regularly, cleaning my room, brushing my teeth) and lost all responsibility, under the impression I was never going to grow up so there's no use keeping those habits. Now I'm 21 and I completely fucked myself over. I don't have any social skills, don't have a job, fuck I barely even have teeth anymore because I haven't brushed them in so long half of them are broken or corroded. No matter how much I tell myself I want and need to get help I know I'll never be able to push myself to get the help I need. Everything became so much worse when last year I ignored a friend who desperately wanted and needed help because I felt too awkward around someone who was just as depressed as I am and they ended up killing themselves, which I've blamed myself for for 417 days straight, and now I straight up hate the one person who was there for me through it all. All I can do is distract myself from the bad thoughts by watching videos and playing video games. I even force myself to take large doses of sleeping pills to the point where I can't even feel my own face because if I'm left alone with my thoughts sober I start to convince myself that it isn't worth it anymore. I know this is all taking a huge toll on my mother because she's forced to support me through all of this but whenever I consider if I should at least get a job I worry the added pressure will just push me over the edge. I don't remember what happened to me when I suddenly changed like that but whatever it was, took away my ability to dream, took away my drive for living, and all my passions and I just wish I could go back in time and prevent it from ever happening..
