I'm 25. I feel I've lived so much and done so much that I'm ready to go.Its kind of a melancholy type of thought. But I get what my dad said when he told me that he was tired of the burden of this world. That he was ready to pass when it would happen. I kind of feel the same way but want to control my own destiny.
