I have tried really hard but a canÂ´t see what the hell am i doing here...This year start different for me. My old boss was an asshole so i was so HAPPY with the fact that i`ve found a new job, and in my field (writing). I was like never, happy with my life, independent, with a great BF who loved me... but everything start to falling apart.

My BF broke up with me some time ago, i was and i`m stll are really bad about it, i feel ussless, not whorty of anything and the ONE thing that keep everything together was my job... i just found out that i`m getting fired, not because of me, because some administrative problems...

So right now im so close to jump in front of a train... 

I feel like a loser, a total loser, all my deams were in this job, writing was my passion, now... i feel so tired of trying
