wow thanks therapistOK so basically after having no therapy for almost a month I went again n told my therapist that in the past few eeks, my sleeping schedule fucked up, I felt empty n sad and restless and immensely tired at the same time and broken n I'm using a fake bubbly personality to somehow seem ok

and he just said he doesn't see it

He said I'm not really doing that badly, I'm just wanting to be sick


and idk

that was just the final blow to kick my semi-active suicidal thoughts back to active

I just don't know what to do with all those overwhelming feelings

I should feel OK, I'm having good grades, I'm doing fine health wise but I feel like all that is useless and I should just sleep forever

idk


I tried to stand in the road today but I was with a friend n that sort of made me snap back

had to get that out
