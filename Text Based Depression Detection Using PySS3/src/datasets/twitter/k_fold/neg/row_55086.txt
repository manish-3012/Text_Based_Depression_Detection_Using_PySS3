Not only what to hurt myself but othersHahahahaha, I have friends who will support me but I have this thing where I canâ€™t talk about how I feel to them because itâ€™s always in overreacting or im delusional. And itâ€™s really starting to take a toll on me I canâ€™t take it. I feel sick and want to run away from everything. Iâ€™d like to go to a mental hospital because I know I need it. I try to explain to others why but no one believes me when I say Iâ€™d like to hurt others and myself.
