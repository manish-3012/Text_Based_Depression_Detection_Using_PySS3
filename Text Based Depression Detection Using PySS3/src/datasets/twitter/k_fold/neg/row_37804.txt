Weird spot in my lifeGreetings ladies and gentleman,

I don't know how to kick this off, since it is my first post on this sub.

At first I would like to explain the point in life where I am right now. 
So a 92 year old left a house behind for me after he passed away, since I always visited him, went shopping with him and took care of him as good as I could. I'm in my mid twenties and now own a complete house. Which is nothing to complain about. I have a job where I get paid above average which is also nothing to complain about. I'm about to move in this house, just a few things left to work on.
I have hobbies where I spend my spare time. Which is also nothing to complain about.

But here are my problems:
I'm fighting with suicidal thoughts for years. I never hurt myself. 
I have no driver license which (in my opinion) classifies me as a person of second grade. Worse than everybody else.
Many people make fun of it. It is hard to find a new job since they always want you to have a license.
I have a rare heart disease which makes it hard to handle stress since my hearts starts pounding at 240 beats per minute and above, which causes me to pass out or worse.
I also have psychological problems with highways. All my experiences on a highway almost ended in me dying or getting seriously injured. 
I never talked about it to anyone. I'm a huge introvert.
But you are always expected to have a license.
I like to stay at home or at familiar places to avoid stress (because of my heart)
I can live with that.
Sometimes, every now and then, I tried to talk to my brother, parents or girlfriend, but they always "laugh it off".

If you read to this point I'd like to thank you for reading. 
There are more points to talk about but I don't want to go further into it right now.

If anyone is up for talking, just message me.

Please don't be to harsh about spelling mistakes. English is not my native language.

Thank you.
