Suicidal, living a life that doesnt feel like my own.Alt for obvious reasons.

Im 17, still in school and doing great, but i really dont care.
I stopped thinking about my future a long time ago. People are trying to preassure me to think about what i want to study in university after school, but i cant decide as i dont really see any sense in that. No matter what i do ill never satisfy my expectations in the future, and they are far beyond realistic anyways. What is wierd that i wouldnt concider myself antisocial. I have lots of friends but i dont really care. Every time im around them i just feel sad because i see them having fun and being happy which i for some reason cant really do.

Ive been bullied from the 5th grade all the way to the 10th (im in 12th now) and even tho i dont really thought it had an impact on me because im still doing fine i think i have deep scars that im only noticing now. It has left me kind of empty.

Im not from some bad family or financial background, my family is great and im sure they would be very understanding but ive never told anyone how i feel expect for my 25 year old brother when i was drunk.

I basically feel empty inside and dont see the sense in the future. Im playing with the idea of suicide more and more every day. I dont have any romantic relationships because i feel out of place whenever im talking to someone i am interested in. Ive been told many times that im worth nothing and now, two years after, im starting to believe it.
Everyone thinks of me as the bright, funny guy but i feel like thats a facade i cant take off.

I need help but im too scared to tell anyone because it totally goes against what people think im like. Help me.
