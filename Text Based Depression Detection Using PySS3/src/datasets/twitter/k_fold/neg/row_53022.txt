Y-O-fucking-LO I'm outta here boysSeriously as a human being nobody is ever gonna give a shit about you besides yourself. It's up to me to make the decisions that minimize suffering. And if I'm sure of the decision then why wait. Everyone always says that things get better but people never change. I just want the bullshit to stop and only I can make it stop. It's fucking hopeless anyway so why wait.
