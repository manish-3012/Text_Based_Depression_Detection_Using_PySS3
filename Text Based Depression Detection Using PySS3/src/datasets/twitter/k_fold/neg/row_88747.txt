I just don't know anymore...I have battled depression ever since I was 13. 17 years later I feel like I am fighting a losing battle. I try to connect and have relationships with people and to have a sense of self worth but it just never seems to work, or at least how I want it to. Not a day goes by where I don't think about ending this seemingly pointless existence. The only time I feel free from all the bullshit is when I drink. When my mom committed suicide 9 years ago I had this horrible feeling that I too would one day end it like her. I can't talk to anyone about this I have no desire to burden the people in my life with my issues. The thing that hurts the most is everyone thinks I am a super happy fun loving guy. Why do I continue to put on this show? I just don't know.
