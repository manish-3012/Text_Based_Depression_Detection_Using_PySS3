I've been close, but never this close.I've been battling depression for the past 7 years. Last year is what really broke me. Upon graduating High School, I lost (not even exaggerating) every single friend I had. I spent all of last summer depressed, suicidal, alone. My mother telling me that once I start college, I'll get new friends. I'll get my life on track, things will get better.

Fast forward a year later and here I am - still no friends, still alone, less family than I had before, and the little family I once had not caring about me at all. I've never felt this depressed in my life.

I can't eat, everything tastes bad and makes me sick. I just spend the day sleeping. I have no hope anymore. 

The other day I was seriously contemplating it, and decided to take half a bottle of melatonin knowing it wouldn't kill me, but hoping it would make me sleep. I took it in front of my sister - who was completely unaware what it was - who just glanced at me, then continued to fight with her boyfriend. I've been completely heartbroken since, knowing the one other person besides my mom that I thought cared about me, doesn't.

I don't want to hear "it will get better, things change, you're time will come, everyone goes through rough patches" anymore. Because really? It obviously won't. Not one good thing has ever happened in my life, and not one good thing ever will. I'm pretty positive this will be the summer I end it all.
