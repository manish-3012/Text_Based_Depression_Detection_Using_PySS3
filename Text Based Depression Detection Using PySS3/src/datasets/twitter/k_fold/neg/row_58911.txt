why does it matter? this is not a cry for attention:

is there really any reason for anything, really? any reason at all? why cant we just be dead. why cant i just be dead. i will never understand why we have to go through this pain. 
can i just have someone to talk to. someone who will just sit down and chat with me, because there is literally no one i can talk to without wanting too...i dont even know. i really cant take this anymore
