I don't see why I should keep going.My girlfriend of a year and a half broke up with me on my 17th birthday. she cheated on me with my best friend. Im completely betrayed. My parents dont even notice that I cry all the time. I have my blood pressure medicine and am considering downing the whole bottle. I just want to sleep forever. I can't believe my best friend since kindergarten slept with her. I feel more violated than when i was taken advantage of at a party by some girl. I cant sleep. I cant eat. I dont want to live anymore.
