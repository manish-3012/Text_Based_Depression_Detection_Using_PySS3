I am scared my dad may commit suicide.A few days ago, my Uncle on my dads side (older brother) died. My dad can get really emotionally strong, I can't think of any other way to say it.The day he found out me and my 2 younger sisters were on the 2nd floor, and he was in the living room (the furthest part of our house from where we were) and we could still hear his tears clearly. (This is in Canada). My bedroom is on next to the main bathroom upstairs, and now when he goes in he never says a word, whereas before he would always say something. Guys please help.
