You know no one caresA few weeks ago I went home and ended up going back to my old high school program to visit my instructors and a few of the younger students that hadnâ€™t graduated yet but had formed good relationships with. FIRST thing that was said to me was â€œ go get your stuff â€œ when I walked into an instructors classroom and saw one of them for the first time in nearly a year. I had forgotten to get a T-shirt that I had ordered before I graduated and they had kept it bc it was too expensive to ship it but never told me. When I went and saw some of the students I was in the program with the first thing they said to me was â€œI wish you had some like 15 minutes ago, you couldâ€™ve gotten us Dairy Queen instead of us having to order it.â€ Like I know i wouldâ€™ve picked it up for them bc im a pushover but Iâ€™m just someone people use. Idk if Iâ€™ll ever go back, Iâ€™m not in the same state for college so it wonâ€™t even be an option. Iâ€™ll try to kms again before i go back there but after half a dozen tries of different things I donâ€™t even have hope for relief from the shitstorm I live in
