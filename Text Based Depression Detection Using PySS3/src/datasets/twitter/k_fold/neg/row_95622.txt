I thought i was better, turns out i've gotten worse through denialIve been struggling with depressive thoughts since 2016. Ive had lots of bullying and mental abuse from my friends and classmates when i was growing up. I never felt like i had a proper childhood. Back then we couldnt figure out why i was having suicidal thoughts, so my parents pressured me into getting therapy. I deep down didnt want to, or didnt feel ready i guess.

First psychologist i talked to, was one from my doctor's office. She had me write down moments where i was having depressing thoughts and told me to try and analyse it. This honestly made me feel a billion times worse, constantly reminding myself that i felt like shit day in day out. She determined my problem was more severe, and they sent me to a proper therapy clinic. 

I was underage at the time, so after setting up a diagnose for my depression, they decided to go with the "kiddy treatment" program. I felt mocked and ridiculed just for being young. I was fucking SUICIDAL, and they gave me a treatment plan that was named after a fucking Dutch pun. I was absolutely furious, and the treatment itself involved a more advanced version of writing down my feelings and getting no advice or any help in recovering from these thoughts. The worst part is that ive felt this ridiculed my whole life.

I went to a gender therapist/psychologist after realising i was trans. This was at the lowest point of my life. He diagnosed and "treated" me for several trauma's. I still dont think it was really a treatment, it involved a form of meditation and im not convinced it did anything for me. After that, he allowed me to sign up to a transgender clinic, of which i am still on the waiting list (nearly 2 years)

I did better after that, got into the first year of college, found myself at the right place and found a more stable job than the shithole that is Mc Donald's. I found new and better friends and got extremely close with some of them. I had their support in being trans, i had someone to talk to when needed. 

Everything was doing fine, just fine. So why the fuck do i feel this garbage again? Why have i gotten worse than ever before? I have nearly everything i could wish for, and i feel so goddamn selfish for being this depressed. I hurt my closest friends by throwing a depressive fit i barely had any control over. There is something extremely wrong with me and i dont know what to do anymore. I dont have the time, money, nor the energy to go back to therapy, and i feel that going there hasn't helped me at all. The suicidal thoughts are back. The anger when i cant accomplish something in a day. The fucked up feeling that everything i do is a massive waste of time and hurting ones i care about.

I feel like im at the end of the road, like i was never supposed to get this far in my life. Im shutting away from friends in the fear of hurting them. And every time i think about it, i feel more and more selfish for being this way.

Sorry if this was too long, im a first time poster and i badly needed to vent.
