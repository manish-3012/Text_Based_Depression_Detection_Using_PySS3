I tried to kill myself years ago and regret I didnâ€™t finish myselfIâ€™m so tired of hearing stored form people about how some guy tried to jump off a bridge and â€œregretted it.â€ You never hear from people who tried to kill themselves and are sad it didnâ€™t work. I actually went to a bridge too and regret not jumping.

I wish I succeeded in killing myself the first time I tried.  My life was only going to get unbelievably worse.  I was a kid and innocent and could have gone to heaven if I killed myself then and now that chance had been ripped from me forever.  I could have saved myself so much pain and suffering if I did a better job as a kid.
