My friend won't respond and I'm worried as shithi, I've posted here before about the exact same friend talking about overdosing, starving etc anf I think things got a whole lot worse for them.

They don't respond to texts and don't even leave me on read. I'm seriously worried they might ve done something stupid. the last time if heard from them was in late june. 
after that it seems like they've comepltley dissapeared.

I only have their two Instagram handles, of wwich one seems to be deleted, the other is private and doesn't accept my follow request. no other social media or numbers to contact them at. 

I'm so worried, they haven't viewed any of my stories either so I can't see if they're active or not

what do I do? do I just wait? should I keep messaging them until they see my texts? 
please help
