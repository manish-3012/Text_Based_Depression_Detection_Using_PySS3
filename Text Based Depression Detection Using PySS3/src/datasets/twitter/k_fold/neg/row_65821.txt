A weird existence25 (m) guy , constantly troubled my hormones , soich so it took me 7 yes to complete a graduation. (7th year going on) . I can't concentrate on anything and believe it or not I had 7 gf ,all got thier fill and found happy things and what all . I am lonely like hell . If I continue like this I won't be able to live like this anymore. What's wrong , I am tall (6'3) , I am good looking , a good enough dick (7 inch ) , nice understanding . Is it bad to he a good , understanding boy . I just wanted someone to cuddle to . My hormones don't let me live normally , and peer pressure won't also . Better I go away
