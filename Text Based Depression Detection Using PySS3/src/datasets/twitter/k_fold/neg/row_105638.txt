I don't think I can take it for much longerI don't know why I am posting here, probably just to make myself feel better until I actually commit to it. 


Let's start by ruining this whole post with one sentence shall we? I am a teenager in high school. Boom, everything else I say is unreasonable and I am making it all up. And for the people that keep giving me those responses I thank you, they help push me closer to the end. It isn't just "hormones" or whatever else you want to blame it on. I have been feeling like this for several months (7-8) without any improvement and only brief moments of actual happiness. 



Now to the actual post. Over the summer I would talk to this friend about this. It was great, they would listen and genuinely tried to help. After a certain point they disappeared. They were fine and nothing happened, they just stopped responding to me. I thought I had finally found a friend who wouldn't just abandon me like everyone else. But now they have found new friends and haven't bothered to talk to me. 


People often say that someone is a third wheel. Well I have determined I am not a third wheel but a fifth wheel. On a car I am the spare tire that is a temporary, shitty replacement until the other tire returns. I am just a placeholder for a friend. Any other time, completely ignored.




I am just going to jump all over with things that pop into my mind so I'm sorry about that, I am having trouble organizing my brain. Then there are always the dreaded times you are asked personal questions. What are your hobbies? Can't answer that. What sports do you play? Oh great, another time I get to say none. Extra curricular activities? Love this one, I am so much of a social wreck I can't even do that. I don't have the friends or interests to bother trying any of those. 



On the topic of friends, I don't know what it is like to have a close friend. Someone who is always there for you, someone you do things with, all those things. I haven't had any of that. 



Say I did get help for all this, what good would it do? It isn't going to make me a like able person that people are going to want to be friends with. No, I will still be ignored by everyone. So why not kill myself? Nobody cares about me now, and things won't change in the future. Then there is the issue that I don't want to die. But I don't want to be alive. I know this is common but I don't know what to do. I just want to fall into a coma for a few months and deal with everything then. Maybe people will actually notice and give a shit about me. I know it won't happen, any of it, but I can hope. 



Now that I have wrote that big long post, it is time for everyone to ignore it as they usually do.
