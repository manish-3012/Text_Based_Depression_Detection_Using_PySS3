I really cannot believe the VA let me walk out like thishttps://scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14642504_269845463411176_3657308303399193799_n.jpg?oh=1a3d78f6e6de3562f09254a1b772a386&amp;oe=589E66BD

The nice nurse looked at my arm and then me and patted my head. I know they are no longer allowed to hold me without my consent. Just fucking amazes me they didn't try to grab me when  dipped out the stairwell. 

Look I did not ask to be born or to be here. There is no incentive to stay here. Hurting myself puts me a step closer to being able to leave and exit whatever the fuck this life is. 

For you eve players... how the fuck do you call for reps in real life?
