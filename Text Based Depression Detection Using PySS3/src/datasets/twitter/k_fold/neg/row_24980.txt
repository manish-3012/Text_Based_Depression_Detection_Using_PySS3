I just started school in person and Iâ€™m already ditching my classes.I literally can not handle being in there. Just like last year. Constantly getting pulled out of class because of derealization episodes and anxiety attacks. I damn near had like 2 today. And that doesnâ€™t count the amount of times I felt like going into a mental breakdown, but had to force myself not to for the sake of everyone elseâ€™s wellbeing.

They expect me to do this for another 2 years? Iâ€™m almost so fucking done. Every day I get closer and closer to choosing to just drop out and kill myself because Iâ€™m getting impatient.

When I say I cant handle being in school, I mean it literally. I try to pay attention but itâ€™s impossible with these constant suicide thoughts going in my head 24/7.

I just want to be out of there so I can experience something new and atleast have some hope that maybe things will go well but Iâ€™ve been in school like this for years and Iâ€™m getting really tired of it.
