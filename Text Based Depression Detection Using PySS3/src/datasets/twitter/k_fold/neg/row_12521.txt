My truth is being somewhat evil I believe...I said "do you love me" and it hurt me. I was embarrassed by it, I knew it couldn't ever be true anyways, but the rhetorical device of the statement just burst forward in a panic and for lack of how to couch it in a better moment I just gave in to the selfish desire. I suppose partly out of spite and partly out of confusion, or desperation, just some strong need for a human to touch me in the feelings. I knew it was the wrong time, in fact I knew there never would be a right time, but the venom in me arrested my heart and I salivated after it. The spit on my gums tasted like aluminum after I said it, awaiting some reaction my consciousness dropped out of the moment. I didn't even really hear your response. I felt the corners of my eyes tighten, the water would come next and then the collapse. It was theatrical perhaps, hope tends to make one want to be dramatic.

I haven't seen you in five years or so, well maybe more I can't recall. I get a swell in the heart, I never really recovered from that since I didn't let myself. I wanted a story to tell, people might think a love story like this is sad and I'll relate to them somehow. Whatever hides the truth is the best sort of truth, since I can pretend in some cases I never loved you and that makes it easier to hurt you without you knowing. Then, sometimes when I need to I can pretend that I really did love you and use you. Your story with me in it is my best story although for you an aside I prefer to think you don't think about. What a functional interpretation, and yet some part of me is confused about it. I often think about how toxic my presence was, whether I am a sociopath for imposing my love. Ultimately I secretly hope it helped you get out of the bad situation you were in, but I also hope you secretly stil think about me too.

Again, I know it's not true. I know you haven't thought about me since I showed up outside your house, drunk driving all the way there. That was the moment I showed my crazy after all the unsolicited courting you wanted but didn't want. I don't regret it personally because I always wanted to feel like I was saving you, sometimes from me anyways and sometimes from yourself, and so it's better this way. Better you are away from me, that I'm not with you. I am a toxic person too, and as much as I might hope you were redirected by my monster body I wish you would come back to me just to go through it all again and that's why you can't. I guess I should seek therapy, but I don't have any money and the time I would need to realize I just need to have discipline to express true empathy turns me off to it. What I'm saying is I have had no intentions of changing that I ever had the strength to realize, I wanted it all so easy because I deserve it and I do deserve it, but nothing is that easy despite what I deserve.

So what's left? Just keep doing this, writing and writing until I just can't do it anymore, when I start to feel embarrassed at my lack of words or when I think the thing gets too off topic. When I lose track of whether this is some sort of art or just a confession, or worse it's just a diary entry no one will ever see. I want it to be seen and I can't explain that except to say it must be some vanity and some therapy, some release and some excitement at the possibility of anyone else knowing what I'm saying. I wish you would see this too, in secret, but that's the secret behind the secret of it being all too vain. In the end I'm still trying to reach you, it's wrong but amorality is the suffering less painful than existing and if I can distract myself with that how dare anyone stand in my way? Better selfish than filled with a deadly rage, better vain than destructive, better confused as to whether the pain is guilt or self-righteousness, or real.

Better anything than death, right?   
I want to die, so bad.
