Itâ€™s been a year and a half since I was raped and flashbacks still wonâ€™t stop.I was getting better, they were starting to go away, but the flashbacks have been coming back with a vengeance. I have PTSD from when I was raped and at first it was just the nightmares and anxiety but now at least once a day I am doing something and all of a sudden itâ€™s like Iâ€™m back in that night, and my rapist is doing it all over again. When I finally snap out it has been hours and I donâ€™t even know where the time went. Theyâ€™re so vivid, like it is really happening again and again and again every single fucking day and I canâ€™t stop it. Iâ€™ve relapsed. I feel myself slipping further and further down, and I canâ€™t ask my old support system for help anymore. He still says that he is there for me but he just got a new job and classes and thanks to lockdown we are across the country from each other and Iâ€™m so alone. I just want my brain to stop.
