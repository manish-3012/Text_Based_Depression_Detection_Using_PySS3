I set a new dateI gave up on the only other one I set due to obligations and feeling guilty. But I officially set a date and, honestly, I feel good. I feel like much of my stress is gone. Plus a few good things happened to me this past week. I suppose some would say it's like life convincing you to stay. It struck me as a reward for accepting the inevitability of my suicide. I didn't expect to feel this relieved, but I'm glad that looming dread is not as bad
