Done with life at 15I'm exhausted. I'm tired of life. Every single day I wake up...but for what? Just to live the same old life, do the same old routine. I go to school, I come home, I cry. I contemplate suicide more often than I have ever done before. I gave up on taking care of myself. I stopped eating proper meals about 7 months ago, I stopped caring about my appearance. I go days without showering or brushing my teeth. During holidays and weekends I usually stay in bed all day and sleep my life away. I used to hurt myself and now I just look at my scars and think that...maybe I shouldn't have stopped. I can just break down and cry at the thought of just being...here with no purpose in life.

 Being around people is so difficult for me. I have severe anxiety, so much so to the point that I hate going out in public alone. I can't even order myself food or asking for help in public. I always make one of my only friends do it. I only have four close friends. They're the only people I'm comfortable around and honestly I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them. My parents aren't people I want to talk to about all these thoughts and feelings. I just...don't want to be around them anymore (for reasons I won't disclose) and I distance myself from them.

 I'm only 15 years old. I shouldn't be feeling so worthless and useless. I have as much of my life as I can have ahead of me. Why am I feeling like this? People tell me to be grateful that I was born in a position where I have the opportunity to live a comfortable life and that I'm better off than others but...what good does that do? Is it meant to make me feel better? 

I just don't know what to do anymore. 

I just don't see any point of my being alive.

I'm just tired of everything.
