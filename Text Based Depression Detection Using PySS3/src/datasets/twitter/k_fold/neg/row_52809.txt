I made a decision last year that I was either going to leave, or kill myself come my birthday this year.And with pretty much the whole world on lockdown, I canâ€™t leave, so that leaves me with one choice. Iâ€™ve had this strange feeling since last year that this was going to be my last year alive and now itâ€™s about to become a reality. Either Iâ€™m getting Covid 19 and dying this year, or Iâ€™m putting a fucking bullet in my God damned head. I realized today that no one gives a shit. They never have and never will.
