... helpI've cried every single day in the past month. I cry in the morning when I wake up. I only go to work because if I miss one more day I'm fired, and if that happened right now it would be my last day here.

When I'm at work I put more effort into not bursting into tears than I do my actual job. I cry on my way home, and then more once I get home. 

...

I loved her. She said she loved me. I only dated her for a year but I knew her for much longer. She's the only girl I've dated in the past 5 years. I'm 27. 

She cheated on me, and one week she's in love with me, the next she's in love with a new guy. She was only using me. She tried to keep using me. When plans didn't work out with him one night she came here and fucked me.

The next day I messaged him, the new guy, and told him we're both being lied to. Apparently *I* hurt *her* too much by doing this, and now she won't even talk to me.

... I'm not killing myself because of her. I'm killing myself because of me.
