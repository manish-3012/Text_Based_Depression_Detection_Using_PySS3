Why canâ€™t people just accept that some people deserve to dieWhy is it whenever I speak about suicide no one seems to be able to accept the fact that I deserve to be dead? Some people just deserve to suffer and die, I am one of them. Why do people have to keep telling me Iâ€™m â€œnot worthlessâ€ and â€œnot a bad personâ€ when I am. Just because Iâ€™m suicidal doesnâ€™t mean all the reasons for me to be dead are exaggerated or made up because of self hatred
