suicide prevention lifeline triggers me1-800-273-8255

once upon a dream, my ex and i called it together. he told the crisis worker that i was having trouble, but that he was there to support me, to help me, to check up on me. that weâ€™d work through it together.

the crisis worker said that i was lucky to have such a good boyfriend.

i said that i knew.

he dumped me a week later.
