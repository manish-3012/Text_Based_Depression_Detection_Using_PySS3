I want to take all of my pillsI'm so broken. I have no one. My dad is dead. I have no friends. My mom and sister are abusive and I cant go to them for anything. If I admit myself to the hospital I'll stay there for a week and leave and I will go back to the way I was. Therapists are really expensive and alot dont take our insurance and the person I'm seeing doesnt even help. I cant see myself doing anything with my life. The only way out is to die. Even if I dont do it right now I'm actively trying to get myself sick so i can die sooner. I dont want to do this anymore. I have so many antidpressants and so much klonopin stocked up. This is it
