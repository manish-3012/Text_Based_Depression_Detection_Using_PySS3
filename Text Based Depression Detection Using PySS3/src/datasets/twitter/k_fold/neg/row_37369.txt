Why is it considered selfish to commit suicide?Iâ€™ve had a close family member that committing suicide is a selfish act. I honestly donâ€™t understand why I have to live because of hurting others around me. Wouldnâ€™t it be considered selfish to keeping someone that doesnâ€™t want live alive? I donâ€™t know how much more of this place I can take.
