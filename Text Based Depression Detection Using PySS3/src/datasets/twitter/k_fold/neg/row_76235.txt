Probably going to make my birthday my deathday.I'm 22 years old and I have very few friends, have never had a girlfriend, or had sex. It's literally driving me insane and I feel the need for love and companionship which I can never have for some unknown reason. I'll be turning 23 soon and I've decided that if I can't succeed in finding someone by then I'll put a bullet in my head. It's already decided and the gun is already loaded, just waiting for the day to come. Even my own family calls me lame and thinks I'm gay, I can't keep waiting and waiting and waiting forever, I need love. I guess it was never meant to be, I'm a failure. There's nothing anyone can do to convince me to stop, It's gonna happen unless something happens by my birthday. Tired of waiting and tired of living, words will not save me, only love will.
