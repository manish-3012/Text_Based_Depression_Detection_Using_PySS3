Suicidal urges when life seems too good.note: I have no one to open up to one on one, but need to talk this out. I'm not in danger and have a ton of experience with crisis intervention, I know when and where to turn for urgent help.

I'm feeling suicidal because I feel like I'm at my life's peak. I have this notion that things will only get worse from here, and the thought of "quitting while you're ahead" suddenly seems to make so much sense. I feel blissful and almost peaceful with the idea of this being my final scene.

I've had suicidal ideations in the past, but I've never acted on them. I don't think I will act now either, I just wish I had someone who understood. I'm tired of being told to go with the flow or that things will get better...in this moment, things are great. 

I just spent a long weekend with a man I fell in love with. He lives very far away, there's no label on our relationship. I'm so, so happy when I'm with him. Now that he's gone again, all that my future looks like is a mess of anxiety, body image struggles, bills...I've lost my sense of purpose. I'm happy now - I may not be happy again for a very long time - what's the point? At this point in time I feel loved, fulfilled, healthy. My best friends are newly, happily married. My siblings are doing perfectly well on their own. I see that they're happy, and that's enough for me. I don't have a personal will to live, my dreams have lost their appeal. If this is as good as it gets, why not be remembered for who I am now instead of marring a perfectly good life?

I should note that I'm currently quitting Lexapro (SSRI) after being on it to treat chronic depression for ~1 year. I have a "sponsor" of sorts to help me through this process, but I feel like if I open up to him with this, he'll panic and take my ideation as a true threat.

Anyways, I just needed to vent. If anyone else can possibly relate, nothing would be better than to know I'm not alone in feeling this way.
