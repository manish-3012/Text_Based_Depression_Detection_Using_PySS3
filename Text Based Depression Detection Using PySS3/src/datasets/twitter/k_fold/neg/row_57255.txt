My whole family hates meMy mother thinks I ruined her life. I fell into a deep depression, and she played the victim, saying that if I didn't go to school, then cps would come and I could say good bye to my brother, the only person I trust.
She took away the bag I kept my art supplies in, which were my only escape from this stupid life.
My father never does anything around the house, nor does he listen to anything I ask him or tell him.
My friends are growing more distant. One of them tries to analyze and "fix" my issues. Another one stopped talking to me after I put a trans flag on my locker. The only friend I was close to got transferred to another school. I have no means of communication with her. One of my friends said they felt betrayed by me telling my cousin I was gay before her. No one likes me. 
Another thing about my mother. She goes from saying she loves me to saying that if I left then she wouldn't really notice in less than 24 hours.
