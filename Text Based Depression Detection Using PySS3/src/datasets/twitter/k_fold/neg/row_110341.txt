I was once a star shining brightI'm usually the one who comments on posts here, offering support. Tonight, I'm the one in need of support. I grew up in an abusive home. I was raped when I was 9. I was beaten and threatened every day of my life from age 6 to 18. I was a household slave, not worth respect, love or affection in my family's eyes. I'm now 21 years old, have tried to kill myself 13 times between age 10-16 but failed every time either due to being interrupted, prevented or the method failing. I self harmed from age 9 to 17. I've been clean for almost 4 years now, only small morbid thoughts about doing it again popping up. But lately, I find myself longing for peace from all of the voices inside my head. My usual outlets no longer help. I feel lonely and unappreciated; worthless. And I guess it all just kind of hit me at once, tearing me down earlier today. I've been trying to pull myself together since, but to no avail.. So now I am turning to *anyone* out there to help me. I'm not suicidal right now. But I don't want to feel like I do, and give in.
