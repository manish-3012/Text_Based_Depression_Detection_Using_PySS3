Hey I think I'm finally readySo anyways my sister is fucking insane and after a drug fueled bender claims I sexually assaulted her. 

I guess you can assume I'm lying when I say I didn't because believe all women always just like the girl I was seeing. 

So since I'm doomed to die alone I think I'm finally ready. 

I always thought I'd need a gun but it's actually super easy to get a lethal dose of heroin. For a normal person without a history of opioid abuse, you can od for like $100. And you don't need to get a certificate or anything, WAY WAY better than killing yourself with a gun. 

Also more fun and less mess. 

Anyway here's a list of reasons why absent any one (family, friends, significant other etc) just as a man, I should kill myself. 

1. Too many men in engineering, politics, law, running, music, chess etc. Literally every interest I have, there's this huge male bias and some percentage of men that's too high. So killing myself will increase the percentage of women in that field. 

2. In recreational sports leagues there are gender requirements for women to play and there aren't very many that want to so there are always too many guys. Leagues will sometimes feature girls only times to drive up interest, but they don't do guys only teams.

3. Everyone prefers the company of women, women want to hang out with other women and men want to hang out with women, no one ever says there are too many women here.

4. You should believe all women always so I am a rapist and therefore deserve public shunning.

5. Women don't want me around. Like they don't want men around, there are women only races, yoga retreats, gyms, women only screenings of wonder women, etc. So yes women may like particular men and they can stick around. But guys don't really care because just more competition so net overall, you're not wanted.

6. There's too many dating. Women are overwhelmed with messages from guys. So like who cares if there's one less guy, women don't have trouble finding guys who want to date them apparently. 

Anyway, I no longer care about anything else except this. I'm pretty excited to finally die. I deserve better than being my exes emotional punching bag so finally, I'm gonna look out for me. 

I think writing the note is the most fun. I don't want to guilt anyone because my issue is I want other people to be happy and given the reasons I listed above it's very obvious that my very existence makes people unhappy. 

So anyway to all the survivors, I hope you're happy. 

I really do. I want nothing but happiness for everyone, my friends, family, exes, enemies whatever. We're monkeys on a rock and we should be kind to each other. 

But something about me says, fuck that guy. So I think it's better than I move on. 

Anyway, I hope all of you find happiness. Find someone to love and care about.
