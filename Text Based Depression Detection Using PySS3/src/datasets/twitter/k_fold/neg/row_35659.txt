So.Over the past few months, my life has done nothing but spiral down further and further. My girlfriend just left me tonight on top of it all, so today isn't really my day. I don't know what to do anymore, nothing helps and the only way to cope with anything is to draw(which doesn't seem to be helping so much). I'm coming here because I need moral support, my longest and best friend moved a way 3 months ago and I have no where else to turn. Just some words of kindness, anything.
