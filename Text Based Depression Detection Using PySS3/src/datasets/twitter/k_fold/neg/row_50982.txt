About to shoot myself. But of course I donâ€™t want to die, I just need to escape my abusive home situation.My mom is physically and emotionally abusive. Iâ€™m 19 years old. I have no where to go no one to go to. No friends no family. No job or college, no anything. I canâ€™t escape. The only way to escape would be death. Once my step father wakes up and leaves, Iâ€™ll go get my mothers gun and end it all
