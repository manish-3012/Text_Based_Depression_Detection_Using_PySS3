Why cant I leave on my own terms?Please dont tell me to smell some flowers or realize how amazing my future could potentially be, I already know. I didnt ask for the life I was given and maybe I want to leave. Where do I turn to accomplish this, everyone seems to have a weird agenda of keeping people who are suffering alive to make themselves feel better.
