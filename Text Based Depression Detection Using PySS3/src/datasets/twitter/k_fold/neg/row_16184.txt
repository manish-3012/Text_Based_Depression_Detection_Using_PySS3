A rantI cannot live with the shame that has been put onto me in this world. I am humiliated, by many things about me. Death seems to be a good solution. I am so shameful about my past, things I used to think, do and a humiliation that has been put on me when I was a little kid. I can't do this anymore. I need to find a preferred method without getting talked out of suicide. It just makes sense. If I could just restart life from the beginning I would not have to deal with this. I cannot bear to finish schooling, get a job, have kids, interact with people at all. If somebody knew everything about me they would think very low of me, i'm too scared to talk to a therapist about any of my problems. Carbon monoxide poising seems like an ideal option, I suppose.
