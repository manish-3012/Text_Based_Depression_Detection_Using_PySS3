I feel like I'm just postponing deathI don't really know how to explain it. I feel like I should have died long ago. I've planned to so many times, but I always come up with some sort of dumb excuse not to. Right now that excuse is a concert I'm going to with my friend in February. I don't know what I'm going to do after that, and it scares me. I know people care about me, I know it could be worse, I know I could probably have a good life but I'm so fucking tired of crying myself to sleep and constantly fighting the urge to hurt myself. I wish I could just get hit by a car in a tragic traffic accident so it would just be over.
