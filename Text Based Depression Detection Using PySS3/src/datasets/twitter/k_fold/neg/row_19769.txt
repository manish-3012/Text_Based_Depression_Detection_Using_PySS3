ouchI still hear you.

I still see you.

I still feel you.

I wish I didnâ€™t anymore. You are a stranger. Strangers with memories. I so want to talk to you but I know I shouldnâ€™t. I broke up with you after all...

Suicide is the only thing I hear in my head. It hurts badly. I want it all gone. My old life back. Not this one with the Corona virus and shit. I miss you Ainsley, if you ever see this I want you to know I love you.
