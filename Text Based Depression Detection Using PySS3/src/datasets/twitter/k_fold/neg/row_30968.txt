Goodbye allI am 65 years old. My brother just took my half of the family farm that our parents left to us, because he could afford good lawyers and I couldn't. He is now suing me for (well, what he is suing me for I do not know, because I don't have anything left). What I do have is a motorcycle, a passport, and a few dollars in cash, so I am going South. I have never done Heroin, but I know I will like it. I saved it up for the end of my life. I'm going to Mexico. I am going to find a beach with a good sunset and I'm going to OD in a hammock there. I can think of a lot of worse ways to go out.

Good luck all. It's been real.
