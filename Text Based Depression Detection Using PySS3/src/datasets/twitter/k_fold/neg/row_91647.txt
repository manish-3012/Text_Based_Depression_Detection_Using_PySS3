The ProblemFor some reason I am always the problem in everyoneâ€™s life. Iâ€™m constantly being called names by the close ones in my life. Always being blamed for any little thing even if itâ€™s not true. All I can do is take there insults but they donâ€™t understand how much that breaks me down. I never show how Iâ€™m feeling so I must suspect that, thatâ€™s why they always call me names and push me around cause i seem like a strong person holding back all my feelings from them. But everyday they donâ€™t know how much pain theyâ€™ve put me through. Everyday I have reoccurring past events that I canâ€™t get out of my mind. I canâ€™t sleep at night I always wake up in the middle of the night dreaming those bad past events. Iâ€™m really exhausted of living. They donâ€™t understand how much I go through. Not a second goes by that I donâ€™t think about all the things theyâ€™ve ever done to hurt me. I canâ€™t get rid of my past and what theyâ€™ve done to me. Itâ€™s been more than 5 years that itâ€™s always the same reoccurring thoughts and events theyâ€™ve put me through that have made me feel worthless and pathetic. And it doesnâ€™t help by them constantly calling me names and telling me shit for things Iâ€™m not responsible for. Iâ€™m really exhausted Iâ€™ve been putting up with them for years and I donâ€™t know what else to do. Iâ€™m just tired of living. Iâ€™m tired of thinking. Iâ€™m tired of just everything in my life. I hate my life and who I am. Iâ€™m the most worthless person. And people in my life have proved it to me.
