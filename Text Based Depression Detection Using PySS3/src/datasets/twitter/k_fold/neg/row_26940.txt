My friend is suicidal right now, what can i do?He has attempted suicide before and he failed, he took a lot of pills but his parents saw him and took him to the hospital, he has been talking anti depressants since then, it has been a year, he is 16, he is suicidal rn as his parents just did sth stupid idk what did they do, i'm 16 too, we're in Egypt, can anyone tell me what to do? I can't visit him now, i'm trying to comfort him by words but he needs professional help and i don't want to contact his parents as they'll make things worse, note that we live in Egypt where there is no suicide prevention line and it would only cause more problems if i called 911, i can manage to make him not do it now by talking to him, but how can i make him forget about it on the long run? Pls note that he goes to a psychiatrist already and she gives him medication. Thanks.
