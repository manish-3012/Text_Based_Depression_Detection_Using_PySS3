I have no idea what to do anymoreIâ€™ve been suicidal for a really REALLY large portion of my life (Iâ€™m 19 now and the first time I ever actively wished I would die in my sleep was when I was six). Sometimes are worse than others and the past couple weeks have possibly been some of the worst, not sure why. I have nobody in my life who GENUINELY cares for me for who I am. The only love and support I have is entirely conditional, and in order for me to receive it, I have to act a certain way, look a certain way, be a certain way... and itâ€™s really tiring. If I make the slightest mistake or get grumpy or upset or my fun smorgasbord of mental illnesses causes me to become irritable, my mother completely turns on me and starts treating me like shit. (Today sheâ€™s been refusing to speak to me or treat me like anything other than garbage, and itâ€™s really taking another toll on me.) I donâ€™t have any friends. Theyâ€™ve all left me, I donâ€™t blame them. I canâ€™t foresee myself having any sort of future at all. The only dream Iâ€™ve ever had is the dream to be a singer but realistically I know Iâ€™m not good enough to actually achieve that. I know as I get older and I continue to go nowhere with my life, my family will just come to resent me more and more. If it werenâ€™t for me being too much of a coward, Iâ€™d have probably killed myself a few weeks ago. I know thereâ€™s nothing anyone here or anywhere else can do for me, I just needed to say something and vent. Hopefully I can acquire the courage to actually do it soon.
