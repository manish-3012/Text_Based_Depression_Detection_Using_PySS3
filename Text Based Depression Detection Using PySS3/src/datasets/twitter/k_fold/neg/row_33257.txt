I really want to kill myself at workFrankly I'm too big of a pussy to do it at home, so I doubt I would ever even begin to get the ball rolling on this.  But it's always in the back of my mind.  In my fantasies, I walk in the front door, arms covered in fresh deep cuts, and blow my head off with a shotgun in front of all the customers and employees.  It would be a revenge against my work as a whole.  I actually really like most of the people I work with, which is one of the main things keeping this a fantasy.

The thing is though is that I also fantasize about showing up for the first half of my shift and then just disappearing midway, only for them to discover me hanging in a bathroom stall hours later.  This one is a lot easier to go through with than the other one so it scares me.  Once again though I don't have the guts to do it at home so how would being at work make it any different.

idk I've just felt really fucked in the head and I need to tell SOMEBODY about this
