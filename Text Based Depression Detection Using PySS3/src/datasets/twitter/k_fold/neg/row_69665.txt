I don't even know if I'm sad anymore, I just really really don't want to live.People are always saying that I'll grow out of it and move forward and be fine or whatever. But I legitimately don't want to live. Been that way since 15-ish. Sometimes it's because I'm devastated by some stupid shit, sometimes it's because I'm anxious. But as of late, I just hate living. 

I'm definitely not sad. I just don't want to deal with the eventual pain life is going to bring.

I have a suicide method planned out. Every time I find the time to actually do it, I distract myself with video games or movies or getting fucked up or whatever and before I realize it, its too late for me to pull it off and not be saved.

I guess my main question is this:

Is there a way I can morally justify killing myself?

I'm 20, live in the US, and aside from a manageable disease, I'm fine. I don't manage the disease well, because I intend on killing myself before that can effect me. 

My only fear is my attempt failing and me being damaged permanently or locked up or something. Ironically, the anxiety of that is keeping me from it in a weird way.
