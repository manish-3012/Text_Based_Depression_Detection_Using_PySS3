Tell me why itâ€™s not worth itI was taking my meds but I always run out before I can get more and now Iâ€™ve been off them for a week. Anytime itâ€™s quiet, Iâ€™m bombarded with thoughts to just kill myself. No real reason. Just kill myself. I know I want to. People would eventually stop missing me. Iâ€™m not needed. What else is there for me to do? Just end it. 

I know itâ€™s not logical but I canâ€™t seem to get passed this suicidal fog, help me out.
