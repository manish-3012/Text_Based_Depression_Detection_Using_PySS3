I think suicide is justifiedIm autistic, and autism is certainly a death sentence. I know that i  will never have a nice life. I will always be financially dependent on other. I don't want that, but i can't work either. Or atleast not a decent Job with enough money. And im really scared of the future. I don't see how suicide is wrong, when you literally have no future? How is it wrong? Why should i life, when i have no future?
