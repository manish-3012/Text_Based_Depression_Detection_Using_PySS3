Just had some sort of panic attack, now I have a strong urge to kill myselfSo a few hours ago I had a very strange experience. My mind sort of stopped working. I felt like a vegetable for a good 2 hours. Any reasoning beyond 1+1=2 was impossible. I couldn't comprehend more than one word at a time. I was skypeing at the time so I also spoke a lot of gibberish. Basically I was a braindead zombie for 2 hours. I was extremely afraid since I didn't know wether it was permanent or not. This all happened out of the blue.

When it ended, and I started regaining my basic reasoning I got a very intense panic attack. Now all I feel is anxiety. I have a strong urge to kill myself. I just feel like dying. I can't imagine anything positive about anything. I hope I don't wake up tomorrow. Theres no logical reason for it. I just want to die.

I am very scared as this has never happened to me before. I have no reason to hate my life, in fact I am very happy most of the time. This whole suicidal thing is very foreign to me. Can someone please explain what all this means! 

Tldr: brain stopped working, anxiety attack, now I REALLY want to die
