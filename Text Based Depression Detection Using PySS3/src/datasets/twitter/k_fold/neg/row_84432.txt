Recently found out I was neglected as a babyWhich is probably one of 10 reasons why Iâ€™m so fucked up. Found out I was often left alone in a dark room as a baby and rarely held. It was pretty much a chore to change my diaper and feed me so my mom would do it whenever she felt like it. Was told this by extended family but they donâ€™t seem to understand how serious that is.

But when I saw my younger brother being raised it was nothing like that. He was raised with love and care and I was a burden. I always felt that I was a burden and now I know it. I was born to be fucked up. 

Now Iâ€™m stupid, depressed and suicidal. Itâ€™s been that way since I was 7. Iâ€™m waiting to learn what day Iâ€™m asked to leave earth so Iâ€™ll update you all then.
