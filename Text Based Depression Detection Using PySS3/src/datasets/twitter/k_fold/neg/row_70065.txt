Lowest point tonight, currently guzzling on a litre of vodka.Not sure what to do, as per my previous post I've basically lost everything. And today, my colleagues thought it would be funny to insult me and I just realised the girl I thought loved me actually was just using me for money and sex.

So yeah I've had about 4 litres of monster energy drinks, a bottle of sourz and now trying to finish my way through a liter of vodka.

I guess I'll eventually find my limit before my body gives way.
