Help me find the opposite
I came here few weeks ago to find like-minded people who've made their choice.
Instead, what I read everyday (replies to any new post) is ridiculous cliche's like on some Alcoholics Anonymous meetings - "Oh we love you, oh we need you". Or some religious sect meeting.. People with their lives totally fucked up, who aint going to achieve nothing in the next year, next 3 years, next 5 years - or drugged with antideps 24/7, or on some crappy psychoanalysis counseling - they come here to become a sorry-ass well-wisher....

I talked to some of them in private - their lives are miserable as they can get - yet, they put their NiceGuy Wellwisher costume on and start patting others on the shoulder.
They're not living, they're not dying, they're trapped, and will stay trapped for another 30-60 years - but they won't let anybody to make a choice by calling him a coward. Its just disgusting...

Please, if you know of any resources that are *not* anti-sui, with sane and sober, rationally-thinking community - take a split-second to PM me.
Dont reply here because its likely to be deleted. :(
