I'm so scaredI don't think I can keep going. I'll begging for a reason to stay, but I've got nothing.

My post-partum is completely consuming me. My husband wants to know why I don't love him enough, but I'm tired off begging anyone to love me.

My dad is supposed to show up tomorrow. I haven't seen him in a couple years. He used to be my best friend. I think tomorrow is going to be my last goodbye. And then he'll have two dead daughters. He could have been here for both of us, but he choose his abusive wife twice.

I can call my big kids' dad and he'll pick them up. They don't deserve this, but they don't deserve this.

I just took the first, last, and only photo of me and my baby. I hope, one day, he'll forgive me. And someone will show him. Or not. He's probably better without me like everyone else. Maybe he's the lucky one.

I always thought it would be better if I tried heard enough, but the worst part of me is me and I can't make it better.
