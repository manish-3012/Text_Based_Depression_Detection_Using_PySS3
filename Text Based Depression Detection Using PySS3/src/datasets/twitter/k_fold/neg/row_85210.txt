Why do they always prevent you from doing it other than helping you end the sufferingSometimes life is not for everyone and I'm afraid if I till anyone they are going to stop me by force.

Im really jealous of those who were courageous and did it why can't i just be like them why tf am i still here losing it more day by day but my coward self is hanging around choking me to stay.
