My LDR girlfriend is suicidal - I don't know what to doFirst of all, it's not about her blackmailing me into staying with her by saying she'd kill herself if I left her

Now that we got this out of the way, let me explain a bit

I will refer to her as V, she is19 years old and has been through quite some troubling things in her life. I met her around a year ago online when we both lifted each other up after a break-up. She is really great looking and from the outside you could never tell what she was thinking - besides for the scars on her arm

As I got to know V better and she revealed more and more to me how she was abused in her childhood, had troubles getting friends as she moved around a lot through whole countries even with new languages involved. She also went through a long time of self harming and depression and said thag very very long already she feeld like life is pointless and how she can't enjoy everything

That was supposedly until she met me and we got along great from the start. I fell for her really quickly and secretly I hoped she would do the same, but as we both were just out of a pretty terrible relationship, my hopes weren't up too high and when she confessed to me I was really happy.

We spent some more time together as friends online before I asked her if she wanted to get serious and that probably blinded me too about what I was about to get into, we never had any real trouble before but unfortunately it didn't take long for first arguments to appear and everything sticks to her very easily.

Through the course of time we broke up too only to get together again quickly. 

The thing is that I'm the one at fault - or at least that's how it's presented to me. She is quite complex and even today I would be lying if I said I understood her completly. She always seems to have a checklist in her head for me on how I am supposed to react, when I do that and in which way. Which can be quite pressuring because she is very impulsive and emotional and if I try to explain myself it is rendered as an "excuse" or that I'm just lying.

I did lie quite a lot to safe my sorry ass at times and I also kept things secret of her because I felt like she would only get unnecessarily upset which turned out to be true. Some things were justified too though to be upset over, like talking to an internet friend (Z) whom she doesn't like and who was quite rude sometimes too to her. I didn't take it as big of a deal and talked to him sometimes despite knowing she wouldn't appreciate it.

In general it would go like this ... We argue, fight, go to bed on bad terms, not talk for a while, I apologized, she eventually forgave me, and we were back to "normal" for a few days or sometimes even hours only, until rinse and repeat. At times she even self harmed again, which she did not do for like 1 or 2 months we first were together.

Around November she made me choose between Z and her and while I was resilient because that's quite a big deal to make someone choose between a friend and herself, I chose her of course and never had any contact with him ever again.

Eventually I visited V in her home country after a 12 hour train ride. We met for the first time in person after roughly 7 months of being together and we both were super nervous but happy to be together.
We got along great and had a good time getting to know each other how we really are and I wanted it to be a fresh start after everything that happened and all the ugly things we said and did. 
But we ended up arguing there as well and at one point she found messages of me and Z from months agoand well ... They weren't what you would want your girlfriend to see, guys talk and stuff I said about her while I suspected her of liking someone else, and that was probably the worst point in my life, having her bawl her eyes out and me not able to undo what I did months ago.

I tried to explain that this was not who I am today and after some awkward days later we eventually got around but she was obviously different this time a d you could see how it affected her. The final three days of my trip to her she was sick and I did everything I could to help, I did the dishes, made her toast and made her tea everytime the tea pot was empty I was already jumping up from the bed to get more, I went shopping to get her stuff she likes, made her lie in bed only and rest, read her stories even to help her fall asleep, changed her clothes for her, went to the pharmacy and in general just tried to make up for my past mistakes, I wanted to leave a good impression of a Me to look forward to again and I hoped she recognized that.

to regain her trust I let her have my passwords once I was back home and show her that there is no one else and that I'm also not talking to Z or anyone she doesn't like. Since it took me a while to give her the passwords she assumed I had some things deleted which I can't blame her for assuming but I did not delete anything. 

And eventually she found some unpleasant comment I made to a friend about a game I made her play and which she enjoyed when J visited her and she said she was disgusted thinking of how she played it not knowing how I think. But it was a silly comment, nothing I even took serious when typing. But nevertheless it left her sad and lonely as I am slowly but surely out of ideas how to handle this anymore. 
I used every apology for what you would need in a 50 years marriage for already and when I said that to her she said that she never got a real sincere apology from me ever. That enraged me a bit because I did pour in lots of energy and love but yeah..
I looked up how to apologize truly to a girl because I have little experience in that and even thag didn't work well and soon after we had the next clash again...

After screwing up and apologizing I am often staying up with her a long time and just talk or sometimes play games and skype. 
And when it's already 5am or something - and you're obviously tired that late - she would say good night and how we should sleep and of course my first thought is to comply but multiple times the next day she would complain how I just left her alone to cry and that I'm an asshole and a jerk for only thinking of myself after all I've done to her.

It feels like a fricking mine field, you are half way through not stepping on one but shortly in front of the goal .. BOOM

Since all this happened we both changed a lot, we both got colder but I still love her a lot and she said she does too. This all affected me a lot though, my sleep is fucked up, I feel sick and my mind is cloudier than it ever was. I am used to being forgetful and have a clouded mind but this is heavier than ever.

Recently after another argument she suggested to take a break by staying alone for a while without any contact to fix herself. Cheating was my first thought maybe or just meeting someone else or just not wanting me around, but recently she told me she is suicidal again and we talked very long last night and I was telling her to be strong and that she can beat this as she did before but according to her the last time she did it took her 5 years and meeting me to beat it and now I'm responsible for it again, feels great.

She also explained to me how she doesn't want to be strong but be weak and hide behind me to protect her fromme everyone. She doesn't want to stop self harming but to protect her from judgmental eyes and she just wants to be her weak and fragile self. I would be fine for everything but the self harming part. 

But the catch is, I'm not strong either or anything and my image to be like that is long gone with her.

When I acknowleged that and told her it was alright to cry and that she would do whatever she feels like in order to feel better (aka self harming) and that she shouldn't fake or pretend she completely flipped out and was like "oh my fucking god, I just explained you word for fucking word", "just leave me alone, good bye..." And stuff like that. But that's what she wanted to hear, she said that to me that she doesn't want to be strong, so why that reaction? I am often really confused and upset about her reactions, but I guess depression is irrational

Okay, now today I think she tried something stupid, as she told a friend that she should have died how she was supposed to

I am really scared, we agreed not to talk until she talks to me first to sort everything out, I don't want to be responsible for this, I want to be happy with her. I am very stupid so I really appreciated her spelling it out what she wants, and when she says stuff like "good night, dont talk to me" of course I give in and don't talk to her and go to sleep. I just am like that, I need guidance in moments like this not confusing stuff like not saying what you want, I told her endless times to tell me up front if something is bothering her but everytime I got as a response that she "can't change" and that that's "how she is" and that I should leave if I didn't want that. 

What is the best approach to all this? I would really appreciate kind advice and hope I'm right here

tl;dr

Troubled past LDR girlfriend is suicidal again after being happy once meeting me because I'm a lying idiot who doesn't know how to handle depressed people the right way, what do?
