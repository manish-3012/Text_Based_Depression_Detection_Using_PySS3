im ready for this life to be overall i feel is pain. all i want is death. all i want is to be a hero or be saved by a hero. when someone says they love you but then calls you a lost cause and dumb ass and then say "I never thought my son would end up like you." all i want is to be recognized for my qualities not my weaknesses. i am fully aware of the terrible things i have done to rip everyone apart from me. i have cut and its only a temporary fix. why prolong a life that just suffers? psychiatrist said im high risk, he may be right after all. i want to disappear from everyones mind and not cause pain to others and myself. i welcome death with open arms and the warmest smile ill ever give.
