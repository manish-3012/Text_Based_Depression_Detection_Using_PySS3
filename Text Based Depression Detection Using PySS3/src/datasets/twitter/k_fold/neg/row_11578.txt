I'm Done... I'm just so fucking Done...I'm done, i just had the police take me home to my parents because of being in a abandoned house because I had no where to go...

I'm only 14, my only friend I have also got caught and we are not allowed to hang out again.

honestly i have nothing to life for, this will probably spread to school and make my reputation even worse then it is now. I should just do it tonight...

I'm already heavily bullied at school and I don't need this to make it worse... people think i'm mental and call me "that weird kid."

I also think I have depression but my parents say it's just hormones and you are just wanting attention...
