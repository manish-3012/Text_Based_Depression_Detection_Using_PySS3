How do you know when it's time to hospitalize yourself?I've dealt with depression since my early teens (I'm a female in my mid twenties now). The past few years I've felt like I've had it mostly under control. I see a therapist weekly and am taking medication. However this past week has been horrific. There are a few things going on in my life that I think have triggered it. But I'm feeling like there's no future for me - no happy one at least. I can't complete daily tasks that I need to complete. I don't feel like my medication is working. My therapist is on vacation for 2 weeks so I'm unable to see her. I've had a few thoughts of suicide in the last 24 hours...it's not that I'm planning it, I just can't see myself continuing to live. Suicidal thoughts is not a normal side effect of my depression. They've maybe happened only a handful of times before. When do you know if hospitalization is the right choice?
