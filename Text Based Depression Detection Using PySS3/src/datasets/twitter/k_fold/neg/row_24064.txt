Alcoholic ThoughtsI donâ€™t really want to die.

But Iâ€™m an alcoholic.

I drink to quiet my mind.

Because when Iâ€™m sober, my brain plays all the stupid things Iâ€™ve done while drunk on a loop.

Iâ€™ve thought about going to the doctor and getting medicine to get off the booze and quiet my mind.

But that wonâ€™t change the stupid things Iâ€™ve done.

So, I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself this weekend.

Iâ€™m sorry to everyone that I have hurt.
