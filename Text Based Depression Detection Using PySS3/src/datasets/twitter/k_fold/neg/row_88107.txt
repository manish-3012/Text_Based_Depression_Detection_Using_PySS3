Shit is going so fastGot bullied for 8 years straight the past 4 years it got a little bit better I tried to hide all my feelings and it worked pretty well, untill 2 months ago everything I have been through in life randomly came back in my mind. I failed my school. Depression kicked in, just cant get any positive thoughts even tho I really want them back, anxiety came back, suicidal thoughts started to build up and I started hurting myself because it was the only moment where I wasn't focused on the things happening in my brain.

After a while I decided to tell my parents what was going on with me recently. They got really emotional, sadly that same evening I decided to overdose on percs, ended up in the hospital had to stay there for multiple days. 

After that I did multiple other suicide attempts. 

I got prescribed temazepam and antidepressants. I also lost my only irl friend because he didn't want anything to do with my problems. I have been abusing the temazepam since a few days, still went on vacation but forgot my medication. I just want to die at this point. Will get back from vacation in 4 days, just don't know how to continue after that. I tried to get help but there is a waiting list of 10 weeks. I'm not dead yet because of my online friends, I don't want to hurt them in any way with my problems.

It's just mind blowing how fast shit goes, in not even 5 weeks I  went from just feeling very down to overdosing, abusing my medication to think about nothing for a few hours, multiple suicide attempts.

I don't need help from you guys I just wanted to write down my story in the hope that it will maybe relieve me in some way, thank you for reading btw.
