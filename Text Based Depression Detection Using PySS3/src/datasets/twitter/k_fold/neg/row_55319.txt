Need help for suicidal acquaintanceThrowaway account for reasons.  
I am not suicidal myself, but my acquaintance A (girl) is suicidal and I don't know what I should do.  

Context:  
- She was never depressed/suicidal until boy B (my then friend) whom she dated committed suicide for reasons unknown.  
- Posted hints pictures of contemplating suicide on Instagram. (Screenshot of Before You Leave - Clouds on music app on phone)  

I've read the sidebar about some resources of how to help, but it seems that most of it assumes that I know A well, however I never really talked to A in the first place, but I have known her for about 7 years now as a long schoolmate. I don't really want to lose A.  
Striking a conversation with her will feel out of place because I have never talked to her in the first place, we just acknowledge that we both exist as schoolmates.  

What do I do? Do I leave this situation in those who know her better? (School counsellors won't work, we just graduated. Me stealthily informing her parents sounds like it would just complicate things, her parents may not even know about her condition.) She says shes takes anti-depressant meds, and calls hotlines, but still suffers from depression. help? anything i can do?
