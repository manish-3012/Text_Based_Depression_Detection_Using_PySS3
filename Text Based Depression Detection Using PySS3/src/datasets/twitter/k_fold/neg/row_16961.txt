I feel less and less human every day.I am wondering how to write a letter to EMS to apologize for having to find me dead. I am wondering how to apologize to everyone in my life for getting close and then just leaving, how to apologize for lying about never killing myself. I am wondering if there really is a heaven or hell, and where Iâ€™d end up. Iâ€™m wondering if my friends and family would be ok, or if Iâ€™d be screwing up their lives forever. I worry about my dog, who is the least friendly dog ever, but who I love and to whose idiosyncrasies I have adapted. I wonder if there is one god damn person who can put my mind at ease when I get like this, who can really make me believe itâ€™s only temporary. I wonder if I can find the smallest amount of hope to try to get help. I wonder how I got so disconnected that even the faintest amount of closeness with another person leaves my eyes filled with tears. I wonder why I speak at all.
