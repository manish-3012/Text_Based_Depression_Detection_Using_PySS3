I'm the scapegoatYou know what I listen to when i'm really ~~suicidal~~?

Gangster rap music. Something about violence and drug dealing just....

When I was in college, well this still happens today, I would walk past a girl/lady and she would give me a disgusted look or show literally no interest at all. Most women don't. Most women show fear. As if I was the gangster who killed and/or robbed someone who looked exactly like me. The funny part is... she would show more interest or love for me **if I was the type that would rob her**. I've never seen a single or lonely gang member. Every single gang member i've seen was shown so much love. It's like people like me take the punishment of what gang members/criminals do. Maybe I'm in the wrong. Most days I wish I grew up in the ghetto instead of my cousins. Maybe I would've been shown love or maybe I could've got hit in the head by a stray bullet which probably would've been a better way to go than suicide.
