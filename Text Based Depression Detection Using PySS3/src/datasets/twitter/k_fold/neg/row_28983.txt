In search of a good reason to stay alive*Sorry for a long post. Every paragraph, except for the last two, is dedicated to a certain reason for staying alive people usually bring, and those reasons are in bold.*

The more I look around and hear the reasons for living, the more I've a feeling they are all made up.

I did a Google Search on reasons not to commit suicide (can't remember the exact keywords, sorry), and the first two pages were various reliious websites, primarily Christian, whose point could be summed up in **"You must stay alive because God loves you and wants you to live"**. I'm an agnostic, and until there is a solid proof God exists, I cannot count this reason as valid.

Another reason: **"You owe your parents for giving you the joy of living, you cannot throw away the precious gift of life"**. But we do not ask our parents to bring us to this world. I'm a girl, and even though I'm curious about how it is to raise kids, I dread the idea of forcefully bringing another human to the present world, where the current generation has it worse than the previous one, where people accomodate things to lose and then are afraid to act in favour of their interests because they may lose their toys, where the majority acts on emotions and not on the reason. Oh, and every parent screws their kid up in some way - no exceptions.

Another one: **"It gets better"**. History shows that when some things get better, there are other things that get worse. If one has something, one is always in danger of losing it. If one doesn't have something, one misses out on the benefits of having it. There's no win-win.

Another argument: **"You don't know if whatever's after death is better or worse than life"**. While it seems to be the most reasonable argument, it goes back to the idea of God and things people make up to comfort themselves. Whether it's better or worse, there's only one way to find out!

Another: **"You'll miss out on so much in life"**. No. When there's no me, there's no missing out. It's YOU, who stays alive, who will miss out on much more.

Another: **"There will be people who will miss you, you must stay alive for them."** This shaming into staying alive has worked on me, unfortunately. Luckily, only two people truly care about whether I'm around or not - mom and dad - so when they're gone, that'll mean I'm good to go too. The rest of my friends and acquaintances will probably manage to replace me. Not that I have any really close friends, and I'm not in a hurry of making them, so that emotional shaming into staying alive could be applied to me from them.

Those are the reasons I usually find for staying alive. There's more, those are just ones that came off the back of my head.

The reasons for not staying alive are much more convincing, IMHO: **There'll be no more fighting over resources and social recognition. There'll be no more annoying emotions that get in a way whenever the reasoning has to take over. No more being disgusted at being a human that produces human waste and is naturally greedy and irrational. No more waking up and learning that the world is screwed up a little more than yesterday. No more hopping between activities trying to find the one to stay on, because one MUST settle in one professional field when they're 40. No more fearing the old age. No more questioning how annoying you are to other people. And more.**

I truly want to find good reason for staying alive, but so far, I'm failing. Living now feels like an emotional prison, due to the "There will be people who will miss you, you must stay alive for them.". There are happy moments in life, but most of the time living in the world feels like a deck of a sinking ship. So why waiting for the inevitable and just speed up the process?

Please help me find a good reason to stay alive.
