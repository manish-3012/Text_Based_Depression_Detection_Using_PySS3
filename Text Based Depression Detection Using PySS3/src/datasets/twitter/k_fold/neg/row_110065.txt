Wish I could be euthanized.Had a dysfunctional childhood with abusive parents who would pit me against my half-siblings. Due to abuse, I had some emotional and behavioral problems, leading half-siblings to chalk me up as "crazy" and write me off. Now, whenever I reach out for some compassion, parents make it about them and half-siblings say I can't expect people to be nice to me if I have problems. If I were a dog, I would have been put down for my benefit and the benefit of everyone around me. Why does being a human mean I have to suffer and make others suffer by existing?
