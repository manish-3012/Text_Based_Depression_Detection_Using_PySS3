fuck itWhy is my life this way?  What horrible thing did I ever do to deserve this shit existence?  No matter what I do, nothing ever changes or works out in my favor. Ever. Iâ€™ve spent the vast majority of the day crying because I just canâ€™t stand it anymore. Fuck life. Fuck everything about it.  No one should be forced to stay here when every second is miserable and there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  â€œSuicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problemâ€.  Sure, let someone who has had depression for 20+ years like I have say that to my face  and tell me itâ€™s a temporary problem.
