I'm not threatening my boyfriend but without him I'm going to kill myselfI've been suicidal and self harming since I was 9 and had my first suicide attempt since I was 10. I kept going though. Because I had a feeling that one day I would meet someone who would make everything better.

My boyfriend is that someone. He made me happy and it was like I had never had a problem in the past before. I stopped cutting and stopped being suicidal. But during Covid where were barley talking online because he's always busy helping out his family. And I can't help but think he wont love me after this. Maybe during Covid he's going to realise he doesn't need me and leave me.

Before I was with him I was going to kill myself. From a bad breakup with the guy I thought was the one (really wasn't he was a dickhead to me). 

And if he leaves me I'll go through with what I had planned back then. This isn't a threat to him. I want him to be happy. And if leaving me will make him happy then it's okay for him to leave me. I haven't told him that i feel this way. Suicidal again. Because I don't want to guilt him into staying with me.

But. Until he either breaks up with me. Or he doesn't. Ill keep trusting him. Ill believe everything he says to me. Every reason he isnt talking to me. I'll be there for him any time he needs me. And I'll keep telling him I love him. Cuz I do. He is my everything.
