My constant battleI have been battling suicidal tendencies since I was 7 years old I'm now 31, I was recently admitted to a mental health unit and diagnosed with cyclothymia (bipolar of sorts) and PTSD as well as an undiagnosed personality disorder 
I have attempted suicide once 8 years ago and considered it again last week. Since then i want to make a difference to people who suffer with this so i created s YouTube channel (link to one of my videos is here somewhere)
