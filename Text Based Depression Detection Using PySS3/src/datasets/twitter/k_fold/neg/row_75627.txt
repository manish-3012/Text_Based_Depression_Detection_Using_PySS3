I remember my second suicide attempt quite clearlyMy mother had thrown me out at 15. At 19 I dropped out of uni and moved in with her in the November. I left in February.

Christmas eve I'd had enough. I felt my mother wanted me to die. She wanted me out. I was sleeping in her hallway on a shitty fold up bed.

I took 15-20 sedatives and 15-20 prescription painkillers. I began to go unconscious. Last thing I remember is sitting on the bed. Then everything went black. AT 7PM.

I woke up at 3am hallucinating. I didn't remember what happened. I went in and out of sleep until 9am where the hallucinations stopped and I remembered what I done.

Mum was subdued. I woke her up and made her a coffee. After a while i asked if shed tried to wake me up. She said she hit and shook me and I wouldn't wake up. She said she knew I'd overdosed.

She never did anything. She watched TV and went to bed a few hrs later.

Its been almost 2 years. Things are better. But sometimes I think about it and wonder why my mum didn't call an ambulance.

I feel messed up over it.
