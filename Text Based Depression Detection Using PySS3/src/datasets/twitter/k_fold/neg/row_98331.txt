Professional helpI tried professional help once and it seemed useless and stupid. I canceled my next session and never went to therapy again. Was my experience maybe just bad luck and do any of u feel like therapy without medication really does anything?
I don't think i'll kill myself anytime soon but maybe in a year or two after i still accomplished nothing.
