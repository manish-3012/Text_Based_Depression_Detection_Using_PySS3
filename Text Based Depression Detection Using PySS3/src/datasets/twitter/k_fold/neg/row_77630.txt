I don't know what to doI posted here yesterday. Everything is set and the only thing holding me back is the fear of the act itself. I opened up to my best friend a littlebit more and he told me he understands me better now. But on the same day I have to find out that he lied to me, again. He always says that our friendship is important to him but I don't know anymore. Why does he feel the need to lie to me then and that after we already talked about it. I'm shattered and have no idea what to do anymore. I'm so close to committing sucide and ending it all but something is holding me back. Maybe it is that I don't want to do this to my family, who I have a healthy relationship with.
