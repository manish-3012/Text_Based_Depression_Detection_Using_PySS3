About to lose my apartment with nowhere else to go. I'm not sticking around just to be homelessUnless my Landlord is willing to work with me and accepts a much lower amount, he'll have a corpse to clean up. I'm not built for sleeping on the street, I have nobody who can take me in, so I'm just done.   
  
I spent my entire 20s assuming I would kill myself at age 30. Holy shit was I accurate as fuck
