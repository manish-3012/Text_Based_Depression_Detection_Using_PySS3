Tried to kill myself last nightI woke up to police and paramedics in my house. I can't do it. My girlfriend cheated on me. I do drugs it's easier to list the ones I've not done. 

I spoke to a therapist today but it felt like everything they said was a generic answer. "it'll get better" and all tgst. I think I'll do it again but now some of my family know. It would break then if I try again and succeed. I work with a load of foreigners. Since I stared this new job I have no social life. I find myself drinking a litre of vodka a night just to help me cope. 

When I told the person I reached out to that police broke my door in I've been trested like shit I got a message saying "good I hope you've learnt your lesson you inconsiderate prick'

I know If I try again. I'll do it right and will not message someone I thought was my mate. 

TLDR; tried to kill myself and still thinking about doing it again
