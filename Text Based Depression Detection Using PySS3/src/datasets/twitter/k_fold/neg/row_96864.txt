When the end may or may not be in sightI've always struggled with depression and anxiety, mirroring my suicide attempts. Lately life has began to plummet, and plummet, and plummet. And I don't know if there's any hope for me anymore. 

At age 7, I was discovered to have an arachnoid cyst on my brain, with the chance on any kind of surgery 1 in a million. Here I am, 22, having had 7 brain surgeries so far.. Potentially an 8th. I can't take care of myself physically the way I should be, mentally I'm definitely not 22. Anyone know how embarassing it is to be diaper dependant at 22? My family coddled me for the longest time, fucking with my mentality and how I perceived the world. I didn't know how to properly act in public, school, or even at home. 

I remember being scared to death to go to gym, because I was the laughing stock of the class. I would get held down inside the locker room and pushed/hit constantly. My mom used to refer to me as her "Special little ret*rd" like I couldn't here what she was saying. Everyone I've became close with has abandoned me, in more ways than one. I know I'm not perfect, I know my life isn't as terrible as it should be, but I've lost so much motivation to even get out of bed, I'd lay in bed if there was a house fire. I'm unhappy. Everyone who made a difference left. I'll never be "normal" or "healthy" &amp; I'm tired of having to push my body to its physical limits to be able to survive daily life to life encounters and pay bills just to spend it alone.

I wish someone. My parents - friends - family - someone would pick up on the fact that I've lost motivation and the will to go on, I can't make it any more obvious. I give up on life.
