I can't do it anymoreI (18 FtM) have only been going to college for two weeks and my mental state has deteriorated rapidly. I had a Dr.'s appointment my first day of class to discuss my medication and I was in such a good mood and I felt great and we decided not to raise the dose. Ever since, it has been a rapid decline. I can't look at myself in the mirror anymore. I get nauseous when I see myself or even think about how I look. I had a panic attack when I left my building yesterday to just go and get food in the main campus building. In two months, I'd be a whole year without hurting myself, but I don't think I'll make it. I missed my last therapy session (it was a video call) and I don't want to schedule another one. At this point, I just want to hospitalize myself. If I don't do that, I might end up just killing myself. I can't stop thinking about my father, who was an abusive narcissist, or the girl who sexually assaulted me about four years ago, or how my family will never really accept me because I'm transgender (and have been so for about six years). I barely slept last night and I'm so tired.
