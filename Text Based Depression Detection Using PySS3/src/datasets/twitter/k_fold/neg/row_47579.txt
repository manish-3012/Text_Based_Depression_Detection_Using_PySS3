Suicidal :(Hi, Iâ€™ve been suicidal from a really young age (10 years old) and I keep hating myself for never going through with it, I hate myself for being a coward. I donâ€™t like my life I grew up with a bipolar mother so I could never turn to her for support and I donâ€™t want to burden her, I seen 2 phycologists but they never helped me, Iâ€™m 17 and suffer from severe anxiety and depression, I was also told I have adhd by the last mental health person I saw and I was referred to a neurologist which Iâ€™m not seeing till next year, Iâ€™m constantly living in paranoia I canâ€™t go outside my house without feeling like people are judging me or out to get me Iâ€™m always looking after the house making sure itâ€™s clean, our house was always really really messy growing up and itâ€™s scared me to the point Iâ€™m cleaning to the point I feel dizzy, I left school at a young age due to severe anxiety I donâ€™t want to do anything bc of my anxiety and I donâ€™t see a future because Iâ€™m convinced in my head that Iâ€™m not going to be here in the future, Iâ€™m just sick of breathing and being here I just feel like things would be better of without me I cry myself to sleep hoping Iâ€™ll die naturally. Iâ€™m so stressed please does anyone have any advice?  I have other problems but wish to not say them on here.
