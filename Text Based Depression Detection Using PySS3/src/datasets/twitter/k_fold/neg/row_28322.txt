I feel as if am going crazyEveryday I feel as if am in a dreamy state, I canâ€™t escape it and I feel trapped inside a box. Iâ€™ve cried so much that I canâ€™t feel anything anymore. The reason for my depression and suicidal thoughts is because of doing stupid drugs and my gf of 4 years broke up with me. I feel so damn crazy, as if am losing my mind. I laugh too loud sometimes at dumb things and am scared sometimes if this is the real reality or not. But if I were to lose my mind to the point where Iâ€™d hurt any of my family members am instantly ending my life.
