Somebody, I dont care who, please help me...7 years ago, my dad died. A year later, my mom told me for the first time "I wish you would've died instead of your father." A year later, I got jumped by 13 people cuz someone lied about me. A year later, my brother died and I feel responsible. Next year, a girl I fell in love with moved away. The year after that, my mom asked me "why are you still alive? Both your dad and brother were better than you. So why did they die instead of you?" Last year, I tried killing myself for the 3rd fucking time... This year, I can't stop feeling helpless like I'm drowning in all this crap. I just want to die but for some ungodly reason... I can't... I put a smile on and make sure everyone sees a functioning human being when they look at me... I just want the everlasting pain and bleekness of my life to cease. I know someone will probably tell me "you've been through a lot, but you'll be fine and someday, you won't worry about these feelings." To that person... It's been 7 years of misfortune... I'm only 17 but God... I just want to die so that I know I won't have feelings. I hope someday I have the guts to go through with it and just slit my wrists, eat an entire bottle of pills, and shoot myself in the head while hanging myself. It's just too much for me to fucking deal with and it feels like I can't breathe sometimes. I sit in silence and darkness so nobody sees me crying myself to sleep so I don't bother anyone. But I swear, if I can't get over all this, I'm actually gonna end it the only sure fire way I know how...
