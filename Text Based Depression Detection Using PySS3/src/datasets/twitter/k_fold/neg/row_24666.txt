I have a friend who is seriously considering suicide and is refusing to take therapy and anti-deppressantsI feel shallow typing this but please tell me what to do, I'm not experienced in situations like this. She says she's doing this because her mom is probably going to die sometime this year and she feels like her mom is the only person who cares for her. I really want to help her out here but I don't know how.
