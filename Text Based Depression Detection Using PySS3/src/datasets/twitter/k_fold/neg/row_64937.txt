Financial problems are making me suicidalBasically I got a wife who's currently 6 months pregnant and we currently live in a 1 bedroom apartment. So we need to at very least move into a 2 bedroom if not a 3 bedroom. Problem is we're having problems with medical bills. We're currently paying several right now, and we have 2 in collections currently totaling around $700 and it's effecting our credit, which is gonna make moving harder. We currently have around that amount in savings and thinking about just outright paying off both of em right then and there. Thing is we've also been waiting for our tax return so we can use part of it to cover a security deposit and have money in savings again. That's when she dropped this bombshell on me today at work. Last year me and my wife only made 8.15 an hour working 20-30 hours each and our tax return was $1500. We got a pay increase right after our last tax return so this year it's both of us working 30-40 hours a week at $10. So I'm thinking it's gonna be even bigger like $2k or $2.5k right? Nope! Only a measly fucking $750!!! Literally fucking HALF as much as last year. I was SEVERELY counting on this tax return to solve a lot of problems and now everything just seems so fucked. I just don't know what to do at this point. Like unless someone I know has got a spare grand I'm pretty fucked at this point. Advice of any kind, whether financial, personal, emotional would be greatly appreciated. Just somebody fucking help me. Cause right now I feel like blowing my brains out.
