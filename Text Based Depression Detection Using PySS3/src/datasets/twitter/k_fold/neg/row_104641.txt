Iâ€™ve hit my breaking point finallyMy life has constantly been suffering, and torture. I have always been smart, but everyone called me a nerd, I have no friends in school, I am beaten up after school most days. And thats just at school. At home no one cares about me, my siblings beat me up, and my mom told me that I was a failed abortion. And today, I just snapped. I just thought about committing suicide. Iâ€™m pretty sure no one would care about my death. I just made this account to express how I feel. I am done with life.
