I need help with something...Okay, so you may not want to help me, because it might seem like you're encouraging me or something, but that's okay. I didn't really know where I could ask this, I just don't know.

So I don't have the best relationship with my brother, and so this morning, he comes into my room and yells at me to wake up and calls me a name. I wake up and just give him the finger, because this is our relationship. But I forgot that I still had the cutting lines from a week ago on my arms. I usually don't cut very often, but last week, I broke. I don't know how to put it and after about 6 months of not doing it, I had to again. 

So then he asks "WHAT ARE YOU CUTTING YOURSELF?! SHOW ME YOUR ARMS" I yell back "No, wtf" and just continue waking up and getting ready. I don't think he really knows anything, but I just feel like this might happen again, and I can't keep wearing my sweatshirt when I do this stuff. Or maybe I have to, I don't know.

I need help. Any excuses believable excuses I could say? Is there something I could do that I could cover it up and no make it suspicious? I know I shouldn't do this, but for right now, I just need help in case I do it again. I usually cut a couple times and then don't do it for months and months. I know I probably should get help, but my family is absolutely awful and I can't do it while I'm still living with them.
