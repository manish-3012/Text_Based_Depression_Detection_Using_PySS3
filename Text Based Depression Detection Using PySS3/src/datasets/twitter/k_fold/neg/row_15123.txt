My friend tried to commit suicide the other night, how can I help him?One of my best friends tried to commit suicide the other night, thankfully he called 911 himself. He's in the hospital right now and for pandemic reasons I'm not able to visit him. What are some ways I can lift his spirits or help him from outside the hospital?
