I'm just not happyAnd I don't look forward to waking up in the morning anymore. I don't see myself being successful even in the slightest in the futureâ€”in fact I don't see myself having a future at all.

I would listen to people telling me that I should be grateful for whatever that I have right now. I would thank people for their gifts, favors, or good deeds that they have offered upon me. But to be overall grateful with my life, I just can't bring myself to be grateful for it.

I'm tired. But when I tell someone that, they would say that I have nothing to be tired from.  
I'm tired of living a bland life. I'm tired of living with these chains. I'm tired of having to *live* for somebody.  
They tell me that other people have bigger problems than I do that's why I shouldn't be like this. And I don't know how to feel about that honestly. Do I have to be grateful? Should I stop being like this? But I am more genuinely tired and done with everything.

I don't feel alive. It's like I'm not living at all which makes it feel like nothing is real anymore. I'm merely breathing and not actually living my life. If this is how it's supposed to be, I  just want to disappear.

I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.
