Want to die so much.Sorry for bad English.

I can't take it anymore. Five years of depression, and I can see no end. I'm damn screw up. Nothing ever goes right in my hands. 
Education, relationship, job - totally failed everything at least twice. Five relationship, every of 'em ends within a week or two. 
My friends don't care about me anymore. Parents think that i'm shit. With years i'm getting more and more selfish, and now I don't care about what my suicide is going to mean for my parents, friends, anyone. Sometimes I think that running away from my past is better, just leave home and find another place to live, never contact anyone from my past, but I don't have money and will to do this, I'll probably just end up drunk at unknown city.
