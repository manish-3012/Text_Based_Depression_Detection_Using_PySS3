Simply a confessionThroughout my life Iâ€™ve seen a lot. The weight of it is crushing. I cannot move past what has happened, and it seems no amount of personal success or growth will ever give me happiness. 

I am simply, broken. And the sad thing is my life is not nearly as horrible or unbearable as a lot of posts I see or people I talk to. 

Iâ€™m not asking for advice, condolences, support or even a single shred of evidence that this has ever been received. I only want to say the truth somewhere:

One day, I will most likely kill myself. It probably wonâ€™t be today, or tomorrow, or a year from now. But, when the chips are down, when I have finally lost the last remnants of hope, Iâ€™ll take the super-secret shortcut.

Good luck to you all
