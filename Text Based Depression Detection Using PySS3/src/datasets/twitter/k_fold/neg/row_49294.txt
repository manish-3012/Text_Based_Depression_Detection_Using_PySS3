Diagnosed with young-onset dementia, can feel my mind deteriorating day after day. Going to take my entire supply of amitriptyline.Might not be enough, only amounts to around 2.1g. But I cannot wait any longer, my mind feels so fucked. I feel so fucked.

All my life I've been a wastrel, playing video games, then feeling like utter shit when others outperform me. Every time I look at my mom's sorrow-filled eyes I just feel so fucking sad, but I seem to just forget it as soon as I go back to games as a means of escape.

A fitting end for a fuck-up. I know I cannot bear the pain and the horrors in the years to come. Thanks guys, for making me feel less alone.
