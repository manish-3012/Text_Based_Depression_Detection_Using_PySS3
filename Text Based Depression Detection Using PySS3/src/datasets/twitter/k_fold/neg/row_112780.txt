9 weeks pregnant and ready to dieI went to Planned Parenthood yesterday and found out that I'm 9 weeks along. I've known about my pregnancy for a while and knew all along that I'd need to have an abortion.

I'm very pro-choice, but I hate myself for the decision I'm going to have to make. The grief I'm experiencing is overwhelming and there's no way out.

My ex partner of four years doesn't want to be a father. I've offered to allow him to sign his rights away and never be bothered again, but that isn't good enough for him. He isn't ready and it's not fair for me to put him in the position to be the hated estranged father of a child he'll never know. It also isn't fair for me to have a child that will be without a parent and never fully understand why.

While I certainly don't want an abortion, I don't really want to be a parent either. I'm 21, unemployed, severely depressed and living with my grandparents. I was taking steps towards getting better and getting my life together when this happened. I was no where even close to being in love with my partner and was actually trying to leave. The entirety of our relationship was awful and only in the last two years did I make any effort at all to get out, but was constantly manipulated with with suicide threats and attempts. Because I stayed, I'm facing a life altering decision that may actually lead to my own suicide.

I wish there was a another way. I wish I could put my pregnancy on hold and continue again when I had my shit together. Better yet, I wish that this had never happened in the first place. Despite the fact that I didn't want this baby, I already feel so connected. I've been talking to it, offering some sort of comfort and apologizing for why I know I'm going to have to do.

I have an appointment for a medication abortion tomorrow and I don't know if I'll make it through the night. I'm in the worst pain of my life and there's nothing that can make it any better.
