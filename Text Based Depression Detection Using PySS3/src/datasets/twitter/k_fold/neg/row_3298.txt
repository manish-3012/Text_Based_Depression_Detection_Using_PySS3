That's it.That's it, i give up. Every detail matters but i dont fucking care to bring it up anymore, dead fucking rock bottom, no motivation, nothing. This whole thing is just hurts, hurts hurts hurts hurts so fucking much it hurts im hurt im fucking bleeding it hurts. At this point the thin thread is is being torn, the guy im talking to just "kinda" wants me, my brothers have seen me turn into a fucking monster yelling and fighting with my parents, drunk dad got dragged out by police beating on my mom, me and my mom bicker back and forth she chokes me i choke her, she cooks me a meal thinking it solves everything, i made her soul cry she wont take these flowers. Brothers work long soul sucking jobs and im mentally unstable due to bpd or bipolar but brought my loser ass back to school. Friends are just silhouettes of what we think a friend is, ouch. Im gone i dont know where my soul left, sometimes things were manageable, soul still intact like a kite but now the kite, its done, it will never come back, gone gone gone gone gone gone. I want to kill myself so bad but i dont want ugly scars and scare away the hot old men i fuck, the nasty old men get the fuck away from me creep but stay you're sexy. I guess i don't deserve nothing, nothing nithing not even sleep, im going to stay up until i die,
