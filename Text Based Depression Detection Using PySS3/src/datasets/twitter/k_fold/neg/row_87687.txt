Fuck it. Fuck everything.My therapist cancelled on me for the second week in a row. The week before I didn't see her either because of Christmas. The week before that I finally got the courage to tell her that even after months of working with her, I'm still not at a place where I want to live. I still get the wanting to die feeling, constantly, daily, in moments small and large.


I don't even know what I would talk to her about if I could see her tomorrow. I would probably tell her about seeing someone over the holidays who is supposed to be my friend, who feels less and less like a friend all the time. I would tell her how awful I feel about my relationship with this friend. I would tell her how I read the book she told me to read about Adult Children of Alcoholics. But I can't tell her that. One thing that book talked about was fear of abandonment. I know she's just sick. Everyone's sick right now. Fuck, I'm kind of sick. But I don't want her to be sick. She's human. She gets sick. But fuck it, I want to talk. And she really does cancel appointments all the time, but what am I going to do? I really don't want to find another therapist. I don't want to waste money on sessions that will lead no where. It was hard enough going through the motions with her, telling about things that are hard for her to hear. The idea of having to start all over again with someone else freaks me out. The idea of never seeing her again freaks me out. I love this girl. When I can see her, it's working. Maybe I'm growing too attached, I don't know. I thought I needed this.


I'm not going to kill myself. I'm just going to smoke some more weed now. That's the only therapy that's ever worked consistently.
