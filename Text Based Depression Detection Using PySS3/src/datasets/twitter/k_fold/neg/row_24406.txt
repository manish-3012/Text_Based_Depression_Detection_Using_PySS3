I distinctly remember the last time I was satisfied with lifeIt was back in late October of 2016, junior year of high school. I trusted my friends, didn't feel stressed about life, didn't have any anxiety, just relaxed and enjoyed life. I still hadn't talked to my crush, but it was cool, because I felt like I had good enough friends that I was cool just staying single. Fast forward to now, I've had a back injury since last November and haven't been able to participate at a meaningful level in any of my favorite activities, I just have anxiety about not getting internships, I'm either sober and anxious about my GPA or I'm loose (alc) and just thinking about how I've never dated or really been all that close with a girl, I don't trust any of my friends anymore because I had a toxic asshole go ahead and turn pretty much my entire friend group against me, and also put that fun little seed of "people are just nice to you out of pity". Pro-conning life just turns out profoundly negative
