Goodbye, I guessWhere do I begin?

My whole life has been so painful. I just want a break: and someone to tell me I'm not crazy. My parents have been verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive since I can remember. I've been sexually assaulted. Bullied. Abandoned. Lied to. I've had my heart ripped out so many times I don't even know how it still works.


I'm only 17 and I know people have problems worse than me. I know I should be strong and overcome the abuse and just move on but I can't. It kills me everyday that nobody wants me no matter how well I pretend I only care about myself now. I just broke up with my boyfriend because I know I'll just ruin his life like I did everybody else's. I can't even tell him why because he'll think I'm crazy. He hates me now, and said he doesn't care about me anymore cause I broke up with him so suddenly. He just told me he loved me a few hours ago but it's okay. I don't deserve love and I was lucky to have it for a few months. He can hate me forever, if it means I can protect him from me.

Tonight I started planning how I'm gonna go. As a little girl I promised myself I would escape to a big beautiful city after I graduated. I always pictured myself at 18, free, but never older than that. I guess I always knew it would end like this. There is no out, no freedom. Just pain. I'm gonna end it though. 

I love you mommy.
