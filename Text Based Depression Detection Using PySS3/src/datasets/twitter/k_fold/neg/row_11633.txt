I have no friends and no hobbies, I need to go. 24 y/o femaleI have no friends, I'm very depressed. All of my relationships fail. I have no one to talk to. My parents are the only reason I'm alive, they always make me feel guilty, if I were to die that it would kill them. I'm an only child. I have horrible anxiety, depression, ptsd. I've been in and out of hospitals since I was 13. I'm tired of it. No one can put up with me. I don't like anything and never developed a skill or hobby. Nothing makes me happy. I can't work with my anxiety.  I'm worthless. I cry at just the thought of a hug or an "I love you" I need human contact.  I'm pathetic.
