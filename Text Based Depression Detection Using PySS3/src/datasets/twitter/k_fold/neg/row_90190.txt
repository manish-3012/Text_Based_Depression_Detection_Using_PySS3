Broke and hopelessThis is mostly a rant to get out some of my frustrations - not really expecting much advice.

I'm 26, and have been unemployed for a year and a half.  It was my choice to quit my last job, and I never had any motivation to finding a new one.  In fact, it was my intention that I would use up the remainder of my money and kill myself.

I now have $800.  That's it.  I'll have enough to get through January, and maybe pay for February's rent if I get money for Christmas.

I know I *should* be out looking for jobs, but I don't have any hope about things.  To me, it seems like I'm essentially unemployable.  The only jobs I can probably take now are minimum wage jobs - and I'll have to stay at whatever job for a while.  

I'll still have a few big gaps in my employment history, and will have been out of my field for a few years.  In that respect, going to college was kind of a wasted effort.  My degree doesn't seem to matter much if I don't have the discipline to actually hold down a job.

When I quit a year and a half ago, I had just gotten so miserable and depressed.  Some parts of the job, I enjoyed.  I wasn't given a lot of work, though - and my boss made it very difficult for me to do anything else while at work (couldn't browse the web, have a book or crossword puzzle, etc.).  All of that has made me not want to work again, knowing I'll just end up being miserable again.  That's almost inevitable to me.  Outside of work, I don't know if there's really anything that makes it all bearable.

My depression's been getting worse the past few weeks.  Thoughts of suicide are increasing, although they've been with me in some degree since I quit my job (and a few other times in my life).  I think about how I could do it... or even if I could.  As I keep thinking about my lack of finances, I start realizing I won't have any choice.
