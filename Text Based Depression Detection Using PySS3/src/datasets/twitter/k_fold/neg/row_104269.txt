Long boring last resort ventI've reached my last resort. I feel so numb I have no where to go to to talk about what ever bullshit that im dealing with. There are people in my life who are supportive but ive been fucked over so many times, and being vulnerable is just something im unable to do. i think its because of how i was raised, who knows? 
i can still hear my dad saying "dont tell anyone or youll be taken away from me and your mom and you dont want that right?" he basically conditioned me to turn CPS away once they finally arrived 
he was very neglectful when i was young. he remembers pretty much nothing from my childhood, including how he treated me. he will never admit to it. he will just continue to accuse me of being a liar.. 
theres a list of other shit that all still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth but lately i cant stop thinking about my freshman year of highschool 
that was a bad year ..
my mom finally made me snap and i went to live with my dad and things were really good for a while! for the first time in my life it felt like i was part of a real family but things eventually went downhill 
my dad started to drink more again and he started getting mad at me, really mad 
every night he would scream at me as i sobbed and had a panic attack. he would accuse me of faking the panic attack to trick him into feeling bad for me. he said i was only doing it so he wouldnt punish me 
so hed make me stand there and listen to him scream at me
i couldn't tell him i was sorry because when i did he would tell me "if you were sorry then you wouldn't do it" but i really was sorry .. and if i didn't apologize and i just said nothing he'd scream at me for not paying attention to him/being too quiet 
i still clearly remember a night where it had taken me hours to fall asleep and when i finally did i was woken up 30 minutes later by my father who had barged into my room just to yell at me and call me a bitch for half an hour straight 
he would come downstairs to my room just to yell at me all the time
he never ever yelled at my stepsister 
i had no one to turn to that year, my freshman year of highschool. No where felt like home 
My friends hardly talked to me... or maybe i hardly talked to them . .. 
i had one very close friend that year. she had been my best friend for years. She didnt treat me very well to be honest she lead me on a bunch while she had her girlfriend and played with my emotions so much. I fell very hard for her. She cuddled me one night when she spent the night, it absolutely made my night, i felt great. i fell even more in love with her i was happy. i hadnt been happy in a while. we went on a trip after that night but had to leave the trip early and instead of just spending the extra night at my house she decided that she was going to leave early and hang out with her girlfriend that she got to see all the time. she lived far so her and i didnt see each other often so that tore me in half. she chose to go hang out with someone she sees nearly everyday ... she sent me a text that night telling me about how the night where we cuddled and had very deep personal talks meant absolutely nothing and that she loves her girlfriend and not me. its such a silly thing to feel bad for still but like ... it crushed me at the time 
her and i did end up dating that year not for very long though
the night she spent at my house where we decided to become partners was really fun. it was new years eve. we kissed at midnight 
after she left i wasnt feeling good. i felt wrong, paranoid, everyone around me felt like they werent actually themselves. something felt wrong. 
i went to the hospital and had meth in my system, someone had drugged me. i was only around one person though, it was her, my girlfriend. Im still not sure if it was actually her. maybe it was the woman who made my coffee. im not sure. all i know is that i didnt do meth. 
i had a bad bad night in the hospital. i remember throwing one cup of water at my dad but i guess i threw two. i really didnt want to see him and he kept coming into my hospital room. they pumped shit into me going there made me feel worse. 
that night they decided to throw me in the mental ward or whatever its called, that isnt where i needed to be. I was confused and out of my element enough as it was. i begged them to not take me, i strugged, and i cried. They put so many tranquilizers in me. I remember a needle being stuck into my hip. 
i got in trouble for not waking up at 7 when i was in the ward but a diffrent worker defended me and let me sleep. I had to of gotten there just a couple hours before the time i was supposed to wake up, plus i had been put on enough drugs to take down a grown man (i am a 5'2 tall girl). 
that place was hell for me. it felt so small. i felt so trapped. i met some of the nicest people ive ever met there though.. i didnt belong there i had been drugged. they shouldnt have thrown me in there. it still fucks with me. the woman who watched over the ward didnt like me much either. 
i had scratched my skin so hard it left marks and i just let them go untreated and even get a little infected because i knew if a worker saw them they would make me stay longer for hurting myself. I just kept my arms hidden in my sweater. 
when i got out i felt worse than i did when i went in. i couldnt stand being in my room at night because it felt like i was locked up and trapped again. id go for very late at night walks because i couldnt handle being inside. it would give me a panic attack. 
I keep getting nightmares about those events
one time i asked my dad why he never praises me and he said "what have you dont that deserves praise" and i could answer him. i think about that, i think about how i still dont have an answer two years later, and i want to cry. he has no idea how that moment affected me. i get nightmares about that exact moment still. i relive that moment but with other people i care about telling me i havent done anything worthy of praise. i imagine everything with my dad going to shit again, about him and my stepmom being petty and terrible to me again. i worry theyll begin to act the way they did when i moved out again. im so scared to do anything with them or tell them anything in fear that they will twist my words or actions and make me look evil. theyve done it so much over the last two years. theyve done evil things.
im not sure if theyre turning a new leaf or just waiting to strike again but ive been going there more because they give me things. i know it sounds selfish. 
im just scared it will all go back to how it used to be.
I get nightmares every single night. Of all those stupid events and of simply going back to school. i dropped out of highschool recently i feel stupid.
