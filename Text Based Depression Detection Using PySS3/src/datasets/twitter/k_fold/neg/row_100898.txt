Iâ€™m scared of losing my mother and want to help her but i know i canâ€™tMy mother lost her father and her younger sister (my grandpa and my lovely aunt both died in hospital after what seems like years of fighting), my mother hasnâ€™t been the same since she lost them,  she literally has had the hardest life and she always speaks about losing it, that sheâ€™ll have a heart attack or she will die of a broken heart and it genuinely scares me cause my father has admitted to me that she has a depressive personality and that she went to a psychologist when she was younger (she never told me about this and still hasnâ€™t). She lost my grandpa about three years ago but she never got a chance to say goodbye or go to the funeral (we live in different countries), i know how hard it was on her, she broke, she never seemed so heart broken until my aunt passed away earlier this year, she broke down, she promised me that she would never cry on her own but iâ€™ve caught her several times doing so, i understand how hard it is but, when i stood outside her door and heard â€œWhy did she leave? She was so fucking young. She deserves more life than i do!â€ That just gave me the idea that she is on the verge of crisis, she has cried in the car nearly crashing it when she thinks about her, it hurts me so much, i donâ€™t know what to do, iâ€™m just a guy and iâ€™m not a professional, she is the psychologist in my family but i donâ€™t know how to convince her to see one. i really need help man, i donâ€™t wanna lose my mom, i fucking love her, she is the only one whoâ€™s understood me, well for the most part, she deserves to be happy. i really need help. thanks in advance.
