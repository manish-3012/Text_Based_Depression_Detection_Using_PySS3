Today just feels like a good day to dieIâ€™ve wandering through the woods alone, sat down and admired nature. It was peaceful. I really wish I can die peacefully just like how I admired the wilderness. Driving around the city with no destination in mind, itâ€™s tiring. I donâ€™t want to keep doing this. Itâ€™d be great if someone natural happens to me and Iâ€™m just gone. I bought more self harm tools after going to 3 different stores, Iâ€™m glad ai found them. Today is a good day.
