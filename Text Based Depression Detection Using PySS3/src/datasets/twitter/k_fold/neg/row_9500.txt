Just witnessed my brother spewing and exhibiting typical suicidal behavior and statements. Need help.Hey everyone. I'm not sure if this is the right place for me to post this, but bear with me. If the title hasn't caught your attention, then perhaps reading this post will. Just moments ago, I witnessed my brother act in an erratic manner to the point where he was spewing unpleasant phrases such as "I'm going to kill myself, I don't know who I am anymore, I hate this place", you get the picture. I tried calming him down and all seem to go well to the point where he handed me all the sharp objects he could and told me to hide them in the place he could never find them. I did as instructed, but secretly, I knew that this could be the last time I see him alive. He told me he was going to bed, and that to not call the cops, wake up my parents, or do anything "stupid" so as to not cause a scene or else he was really going to do it, whether in custody or not. I know he has no intentions of harming me, or else he would have already done it. I couldn't bear the thought of him also getting taken away, never to be seen again from me or my family. As I write this now, he's in his room doing God knows what and I won't attempt to console him any further since he's pleaded that he's fine and that doing anything to calm him down isn't going to work. I have contemplated calling the authorities, but at this moment, my fear and anxiety have taken over and I've resorted to just letting events unfold.

To those of you wondering, at the current time of me writing this, things have calmed down. There is no need for worry, for I intend on staying awake for as long and as best as I can hoping for all the best. If it really concerns any of you who are reading this, I'll be sure to update you all on things as they go. But for now, what should I do? I have never experienced this before, and it's so traumatizing.
