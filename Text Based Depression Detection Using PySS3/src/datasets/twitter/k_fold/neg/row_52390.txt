I have nothing to loseIâ€™m starting to think about it. 

What do I really have to lose by killing myself? My parents? Yeah right, I donâ€™t care about my parents and they didnâ€™t really care about me either. In fact Iâ€™m this way because of them. Instead of understanding my problems they just think Iâ€™m crazy.

So if I die I donâ€™t care about them or my siblings, they ignored me too. 

Friends? I donâ€™t have any. None of my classmates would remember me either, so thereâ€™s no point.

So I have nothing to lose by killing myself. The only problem is I canâ€™t find a painless way to do it. Iâ€™m too young to buy a gun and Iâ€™m scared I wonâ€™t be able to hang myself properly. So that only leaves me with overdosing or jumping off a high height, both of which Iâ€™m too scared to do. 

Thereâ€™s no point in me living anymore. Iâ€™m going to kill myself when I have the chance.
