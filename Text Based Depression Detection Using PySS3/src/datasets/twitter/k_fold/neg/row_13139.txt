Iâ€™m so tired and I just want to dieI donâ€™t have much to be proud of. I was the first one in my family to go to college, but that means nothing when I had to file bankruptcy and I have to work two jobs just to break even. Iâ€™m not attractive. In fact Iâ€™m super fat with man breasts, and a belly scarred with stretch marks. I have diabetes and I have to take 8 medications daily. Iâ€™m not funny or interesting. I have a job for a well known corporation but everyone avoids me like the plague. I have no friends and no romantic prospects. Being a gay man, a perfect body is everything. I will never have that. I made a pronouncement to lose weight about a month ago. According to the scale I lost two pounds. When I posted my progress I was told it was just water weight and I should be losing a lot more. I am so demoralized and tired of it all. There is nothing in my life that brings me joy. I hate seeing people more attractive than me, particularly men, being so fulfilled when Iâ€™m so miserable. I hate my existence and all I want is to end it all. Suicide seems like the only answer to my unending hatred
