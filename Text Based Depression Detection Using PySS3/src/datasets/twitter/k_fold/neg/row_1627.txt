A second chance at life.In April 2017 I was a gambling addict who had lost over 50k on roulette, I had a successful managerial/accounts/IT position but would spend my wages in 10 mins when I was at my worst point. So I found myself on the 10th floor of a multi story car park swigging from a bottle of Stoli vodka and climbing onto the ledge with all intentions of ending..luckily for me the ledge overlooked the back entrance of my police station and a cop came running out telling me not to jump, momentarily I was distracted but nothing was going to stop me and I pushed off the ledge oh to find myself inexplicably pulled back. Unbekownest to me 3 police had snuck up whilst I was distracted and risked their lives going over to grab me as I fell. My initial reaction was that of anger and was placed in a mental health facility for the next 72 hours. My life changed that day, I never gambled again, the urge completely gone. I quit my job of 13 years and am now living the dream writing my first novel, debts all in a manageable plan, I have my own flat in London.

I hope my story serves as an inspiration that even if you think life is completely helpless thereâ€™s always hope. Whether it be an addiction or depression, reach out to people, I know I am a Reddit stranger but feel free to PM me and I will try and help as much as I can. 

When you hit rock bottom the only way is up!
