Planning my own funeral would be quite funI'm extremely suicidal and to me the idea of dying when planed sounds kinda fun, I could leave all my ideas in notes so I could have a funeral I'd like, instead of just a samy black boring one if I died unplanned, I'd like my funeral to be more colourful and vibrant. Idk just something I think about when wanting to die
