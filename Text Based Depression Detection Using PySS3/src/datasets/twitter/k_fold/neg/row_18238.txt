People trying to help me and then just disappearTwo girls from my previous school found out I'm suicidal at a party. They were spewing out the normal, useless platitudes like "It will get better" or "Get help". Atleast they were trying to help me. They said they will get back at me, never did and now I found out that have hung out alot of times with my hot friend in the weeks afterwards. Why the fuck did I get this dysfunctional brain and terrible face (No, don't sugarcoat it like amiugly did please)? I feel like some fucking subhuman that my mother should have aborted. Why do humans do this in general? Trying to help someone and then just leaving him to die. I guess they either don't know how to, can't or don't want to handle a depressed/suicidal person. Still pretty cruel...
