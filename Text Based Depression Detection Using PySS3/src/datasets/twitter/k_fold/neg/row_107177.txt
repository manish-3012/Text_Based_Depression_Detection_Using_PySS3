Was going to wait until after the holidays, but I donâ€™t know if I canIt was a rough day today. It marked two years at my job and I found out today that I got turned down for a promotion. I have never worked so hard in my life before and I still wasnâ€™t good enough. On top of that, Iâ€™m in love with my best friend, she knows it and has no interest in me except as a friend. I was going to try to hold out until after the holidays to kill myself, but I donâ€™t know if I can. Everything I ever work for and all my natural instincts always seem to be wrong. I feel like I am always losing. Maybe itâ€™s just survival of the fittest and Iâ€™m not cut out for life. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can go on like this.
