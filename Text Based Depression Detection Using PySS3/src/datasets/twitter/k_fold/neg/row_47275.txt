I am weak...I am so weak, both physically and mentally. When I was younger, I used to be beaten up by some boys in my school. I was 10 at this time. I was bullied in every way possible. I destroyed all the friendships I made because I am such a horrible person.

When I was 13, I started to make some friends. It was "ok", but I wasn't invited to anyone's birthday party or any kind of party.

Last year I moved away from SÃ£o Paulo, and here (where I am now) it was way harder for me to make any friends (even though I am 1.800 Km away from where I was). I made some, but I feel like they are aways distant.

I also only dated one girl, who I love (and she loved me back)... Now she is dead, due to a car accident two weeks ago. We were 12 when we dated, we "broke up" because she moved away to another state. I wanted her to be happy and find someone better than me (we kept in touch this whole time, we talked to each other every single day for 2 years and a half.) Two years and a half passed and she told me she was going to move to the same city I was going to in the end of this year (both our families were going to move to the city of SÃ£o Paulo in the end of the year.) We shared dreams, goals, ideals. Everything was perfect. We even promissed to get married to each other one day... And now she is gone forever.

Now I am here. I feel so hollow. Everything I do is pointless. I am going to kill myself. I am considered weak by everyone, and I am going to confim that. I am in pain and I am not strong enough to keep living.
