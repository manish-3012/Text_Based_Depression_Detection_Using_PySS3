Like a ticking time bombMy finals are in 1 month. I haven't done any reading because i have not been able to. I never cared for school that much, but the finals to me seem like its the ending line. Like if i dont pass them, i dont deserve to live anymore. I've always been the person that never wants to be behind on anything compared to anyone. I want to pass school on time, even kinda "lied" to the military doctor about my mental problems (mandatory to get drafted in Finland for men). I feel like i have to do these things absolutely when they need to be done.

Ive already went to get help 3 different times, before with no results. Ended up just telling that im fine to the psychologist because i got unmotivated to go back. When i think about my future its like i dont care about it all. I dont study, even tho i know i need it. I dont do anything productive, i just sit around on my ass because i have no motivation to do anything. I just use any kind of media to get my mind off my normal life, my face is 24/7 on some screen, because my own life is way too terrifying for me. I dont know what to fucking do. I just want to restart my whole life over, maybe in a 3rd world country, so i could fucking appreciate this life of mine.

Im just so fucking hopeless. I dont want to do anything. But i have to, because everyone else is doing it and because my parents want it. They expect so much from me but i know that i just cant deliver it.

Side note. Anything doesnt help me. The visits to the psychologist doesnt help me. My friends try to help, and i respect that from them, but that doesnt help me at all. Reading online posts about related stuff to mental issues wont help me. It seems like im just screaming into the void and not getting any response. I really want to die, but im too afraid to die. Isnt it ironic that i want to take my own life so much, but im scared of death more than anything?

TL;DR Im hopeless and dont know what to do anymore. Waiting for the day i just lose my mind and go crazy
