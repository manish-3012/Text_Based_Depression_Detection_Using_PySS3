I don't know what else to doI've run out of options and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to be a burden on my family, but I know that it will hurt my mom if I die, even though she'd get over it.

I quit my job last year because I couldn't handle a full-time job anymore. I worked hard for almost a year to build up work that I could do from home, and I did really well. Then I had some bipolar episodes over the summer (depression followed by I think a mixed state - can't check with my psych because I haven't been able to afford my insurance premiums for months). I spent about two months not working enough, knowing that it would cause problems but completely unable to bring myself to give a shit. Then I got the energy to get up off the floor again, but by then I was off my meds and I wasted it on a bunch of stuff that didn't pay.

I'm back on my medication and trying to turn things around but it's too late. I'm completely screwed. I can't afford my rent. I've already borrowed $700 from my parents, and they can't afford to give me more. I don't know when I'll be able to pay them back. I've been applying to every job I can think of down to McDonald's and Starbucks, but I am a useless person and haven't gotten a single call back.

I am so, so tired of trying and getting nowhere, and sabotaging myself, and trying to do everything right but fucking everything up. I don't want to do this anymore. I can't do this for the rest of my life. It's too hard. I'm so deep in debt I don't know how to climb out. I've done nothing but make mistakes since high school and I'm 34 now and don't know how to fix it. I just want to be done and the only thing that is stopping me is that my cats love me for some reason and death feels like it would be abandoning them. They wouldn't understand it.

I just don't know what to do. I know wanting to die is just my brain being messed up but I can't figure out why I should live.
