I tried to kill myself in the shower, but I failed.Hi,
I do not see any reason anymore to stay on this planet. I have accomplished nothing. I am a 19 year old girl, who has no education, no paid job and I am freaking living in assisted living.
I tried to cut my arms with a razor, but I only managed to get some small cuts. 
I feel like I am a parasite to sociaty, living from a welfare payment, and I can't do anything.

I am autistic, and it bugs the hell out of me. Everything is too much for me, I can't travel too much, I can't do more than 1 hour a week voluntary work, I can't even have an education, a job and a boyfriend like anyone else.

I see all my old classmates, living their dream, and I am this worthless piece of shit. I cried yesterday a lot, and today only got worse.
I feel like I am no good to anyone. 

I want so bad to hold my mom, and let it all out. But I don't do that, because she will be worried sick about me again.
I wish I was just normal, without this shit. 
I slept bad the last 2 days, and I keep forgetting to take care of my pets (two rats)
Sometimes those two are the joy in my day.

I just don't know what to do, suicide seems like a good solution. I don't want this shit anymore. 

Sorry to bug you guys with this, I just needed it to get of my chest.
