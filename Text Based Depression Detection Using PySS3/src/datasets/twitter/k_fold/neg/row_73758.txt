Don't lose hopeThis week I'm feeling particularly suicidal. More self loathing. I cannot seem to quit my bad habits. I am diagnosed bipolar depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I want to kill myself by overdosing on medications because I keep wondering when will this ever end.
I hate being so sensitive.
