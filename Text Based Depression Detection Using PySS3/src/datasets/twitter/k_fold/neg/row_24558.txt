You're right that I'm not all aloneI probably sound like a dick but I just dont like advice.  People act like I never try. 'Just try new things' ' try to find something that makes u happy' , or say ' you're not alone '. They are right. I got my demons with me constantly every second of the day. No matter who is with me I do feel alone though. I feel like a fucking ghost. Damn I hate life
