I tried to go back to schoolI tried going into school today. Safe to say it didn't go well. I didn't sleep at all last night with all these thoughts, I was already exhausted so that didn't help. I had a panic attack before I left but I still forced myself anyway. As soon as I got in there I felt like I was about to throw up. I couldn't even face anyone I just had to run away and cry. I broke down again and eventually my mum just had to come back and get me.

I feel so god damn useless. I can't even get an education because of my stupid fucking mind torturing me again and again, every fucking second of the day. At this point what do I have to live.

My mum went out on a date tonight. I was considering running away while she was out. I got as far as the train station but couldn't bring myself to go anywhere from there. God can someone just fucking shoot me in my sleep
