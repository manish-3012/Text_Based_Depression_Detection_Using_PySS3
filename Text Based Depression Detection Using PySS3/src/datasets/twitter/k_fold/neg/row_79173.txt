Middle Aged. Done with the status quo. Ideation has set in.Hi. I am not going to do it now. I have spent half the day sleeping as much of the day away as possible, and then the rest, researching methods (for the umpteenth time). I am so alone and I have nothing constructive to do with my life. Every day is more difficult than the day before, because where I am, there is no hope of any change. I spend every day trying to reach out to people on social media and whatsapp, because I mostly have no contact with people face to face. That is not a choice I made.  Every few minutes I face the misery again, and haul myself into a task or an online encounter to avoid the suffering. I can't see myself keeping up the struggle for another 40 plus years. I have the set up ready if I do reach that place. I have tried before and failed. I can't talk to anyone I know about this. I am reluctant even to post this.
