2-)Our economy goes shit
3-)Nobody do anything about murder&amp;rapes they Just say Ooh sorry for your loss
4-)There are 14million high school senior year students he's taking his college exam and 1/3 become jobless how can i not worry about this
5-)worst part is nobody do anything about following reasons they are Just sit and watches tv
