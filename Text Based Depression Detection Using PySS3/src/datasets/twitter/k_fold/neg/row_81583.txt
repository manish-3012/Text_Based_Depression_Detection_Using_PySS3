A cry for helpCan someone , anyone help me ? Please I can't stop thinking about killing myself . Nothing excites me anymore  I don't enjoy doing anything I feel no motivation again I've had here thoughts when I was 14 now they're back again and it's eating me up alive. I've been holding back my tears all day and cry myself to sleep all night . I know if I don't get help now I will eventually give in . I want to enjoy life but I just can't , I feel so pathetic and hopeless I started cutting myself too after being 4 years clean. There is no light at the end of the tunnel , not for me at least .
