i just want to be lovedtoday i asked if my boyfriend really loved me and he went quiet. 

im so done. i just really want to be loved right now. i know i shouldnt look to outside sources for happiness, but i just really need to be loved. 

i want to be proven wrong. that people really do love me. unconditionally.

if you see my last post, youll see that last night i wanted to die. i got through it though, i mainly just distracted myself with happy things like watching shows, or youtube videos. 

right now the pain is so unbearable, im sorry. ill try to make it through today, so dont worry haha.
