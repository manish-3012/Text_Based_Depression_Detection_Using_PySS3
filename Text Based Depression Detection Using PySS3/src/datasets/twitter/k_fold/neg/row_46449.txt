Game overI don't know what else to do. Its far too late, and i'm far too tired to be doing this, but I can't let myself sleep. I have to do this. I know the usual repliers, I know what people say, maybe things will be different tomorrow, but they aren't, it's just another day that everyone moves further away from me. I'm sick of lies, of games, of being screwed back and forth like i'm some sort of toy. I'm sick of people pretending to care, oh, i'll help you, talk to me, e-mail me... then nothing, maybe it's a game to them, but I can't take the rejection any more. So, what do I do, post on here, for probably the same outcome again. I'm done. So thanks to everyone that kept dragging my life out, telling me lies, saying it would be ok, saying they would be there. Thanks for treating my life like nothing more than a game. Sorry, game over.
