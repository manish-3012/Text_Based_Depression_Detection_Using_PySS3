HELPIM TIRED OF FEELING THE WAY I DO i love her i know itâ€™s stupid sheâ€™s just a girl. i love her she doesnâ€™t understand sheâ€™s the world to me literally the reason i smile. i have failed my life long dream of joining the infantry. in reality i joined the infantry to die without it being considered suicide. i failed. now iâ€™m back home and back to looking around hopeless. i just donâ€™t get it why canâ€™t i be happy. iâ€™m alone i vent to the people i think are there for me and no matter what they blow it off. itâ€™s hopeless just like the dream of becoming happy.
