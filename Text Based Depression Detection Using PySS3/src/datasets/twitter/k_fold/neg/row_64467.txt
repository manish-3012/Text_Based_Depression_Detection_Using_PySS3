I want to die aloneWhat I honestly want is to be diagnosed with terminal cancer, but not tell anyone. I want to just walk into the mountains and shoot myself somewhere secluded. No horrific body to clean up if the animals take care of it, right? Nobody will really notice. I'll just pass out of memory, as it should be.
