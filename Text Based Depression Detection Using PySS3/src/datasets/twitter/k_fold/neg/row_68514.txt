calmness before deathwhy does it feel so wrong to be so calm right now. im alone at home, minutes away from ending my life without leaving a single letter behind. if i fucking fail, i donâ€™t even know anymore, screw that. i wonâ€™t fail. i donâ€™t know what im typing anymore even, all i know is i loved life and i loved living, i love you all. wishing the best for all of you.
