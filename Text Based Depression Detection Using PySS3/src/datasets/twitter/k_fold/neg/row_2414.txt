This week is going to be hell.I have a hell-week for work and school coming up, and thereâ€™s nothing I can do to get out of it. It has triggered a depressive/suicidal episode for me, and Iâ€™m trying to distract myself with some light-hearted TV and gaming but I just canâ€™t. I wish I had a rope so I could hang myself. I also wish I had razors so I could cut myself. I want to die so badly. I canâ€™t stop crying.
