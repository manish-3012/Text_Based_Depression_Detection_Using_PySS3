I just want to end my life.I'm just so, so done with living right now. I keep hoping things will get better, but they just get worse. Nothing has changed in years. My friends are borderline abusive and I can't escape them. My family is restrictive and suffocating me. I've had depression for years and various other diagnosed mental illnesses too. I just want it to be fixed. I'm tired. I want a break. I know things can't get better, so I guess this is it.
