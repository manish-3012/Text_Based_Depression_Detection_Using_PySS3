Fucked up my university yearI pretty much wrecked my university year by getting less than the minimum required average in order to pass to the next year, in France we use what's called the "LMD system" it's not like the GPA system but that's irrelevant to my current situation.

I'm sure that the title sounds pretty stupid or like someone who's trying to get some attention but after failing my university year i really considered suicide by electrocution but i was caught while trying to hop the fence of a spot with high voltage IItransformers situated near my university. I thought about overdosing on paracetamol or something like that but it seems to do more harm than really kill i can't get my hands on a gun because it's illegal here and I don't want to force a police officer to shoot me or involve anyone in my suicide

Sometimes I feel better and try to focus on retaking my year and doing better but my dad's pessimistic as hell and every time I talk with him it makes me feel suicidal, being financially dependant I'm stuck at home and it's making me hate myself even more

Sorry for the long read, this is the only place where I can talk about this without getting judged...
