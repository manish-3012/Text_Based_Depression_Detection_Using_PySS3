Working on going in the military, struggled with weight loss.(Throwaway acc) I am a 20 year old male, enlisting in the air force. 9 months ago I was over the weight limit for my size, and so I worked really hard and exercised to drop the weight and I just barely made it in. But now I have to wait till January to actually go to basic, and I have to maintain weight to stay in

Unfortunately I let myself go, and I undid all the work I had to do, and I am trying again to re lose the weight. But now I have a deadline. If I dont make weight by mid january (today being nov 16th) I dont make it in.

I didnt do good in highschool, and I have no hope of paying for college on my own, so if I dont make it in by jan, I have nothing to really live for. 

Im working on losing weight, running everyday and stuff, but I am very afraid I wont make it. 

Im not depressed or anything like that, it just seems like a logical step in my head. If I dont make it, why waste years suffering when I could just end it.

I know its not right to think this way, but I cant help it. Im not sure on what I should do.
