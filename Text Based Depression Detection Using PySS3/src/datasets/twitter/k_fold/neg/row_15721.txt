Can't get the voices to stopI have just got out of hospital and the voices are coming back the same as usual, what is the point I'm sick of hearing it, the whole 3 months I was in hospital I wasn't diagnosed with anything, I have tried to live with this and get help but no one can stop it, I quit I can't do it anymore.

What helps you if you hear voices?
