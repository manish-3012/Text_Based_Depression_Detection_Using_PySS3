Canâ€™t stop thinking about my momThings havenâ€™t been very good between us for a while but I canâ€™t stop thinking about what she would do if she found me. Sheâ€™s largely part of why I want to end everything but also one of the few reasons why Iâ€™m afraid to. Some days I feel like she truly does hate me but I also know she would be devastated if I wasnâ€™t here anymore. I wish this was easier.
