Dying truly seems like the only optionI can't stop thinking that it's inevitable I'm going to either die before I'm 35 or be buried in crushing medical debt that wouldn't be worth saving me in the first place. Every time I get sick again I think I should just put myself down and save my loved ones the trouble. Idk what to do I'll never have enough money to go somewhere better and I'm always going to be sick. It feels so inevitable I don't see the point in beating around the bush anymore.
