I honestly donâ€™t feel anything anymore.Okay to start off, I apologize for formatting Iâ€™m on mobile. Iâ€™m on probation until Iâ€™m 31. The probation is for a sex offense, but before you jump off the deep end at me like everyone else, I turned 18 while dating a girl and her parents called the authorities. Iâ€™m honestly just giving up. Iâ€™ve always struggled with depression, and recently itâ€™s not even hurting me anymore. Iâ€™ve just become acclimated to it. I first tried killing myself when I was about 12, when my mother found me hanging from an extension cord in my closet. Iâ€™ve tried a handful of times, one of which resulted in a long hospital stay and over 25 stitches. I canâ€™t deal with being on probation, I canâ€™t deal with feeling so alone. Iâ€™m a senior in university and Iâ€™m not even supposed to use the internet off campus. I donâ€™t want to kill myself, I want so badly to have some glimmer of hope on the horizon but that light faded a long time ago. Iâ€™ve had to give up my dreams, my future. All of my friends have moved away, and they get a hold of me every so often and say when youâ€™re off probation we should do THIS. I donâ€™t have the heart to tell them I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it that long. I canâ€™t even think straight right now. Iâ€™ve cried myself to sleep for such a long time that it doesnâ€™t even feel pathetic anymore. It hurts me to wake up and see the scars I have from when I found out the girl I got in all this trouble for was cheating on me anyways. I have a girlfriend now, who doesnâ€™t seem to give a fuck about any of these feelings and makes me feel even worse than any of this has. I just want a reason to fucking live and for the life of me I canâ€™t find one. Iâ€™m going to cut this short here, and Iâ€™m sorry for the wall of text I feel like this will be, but if I donâ€™t find some god damn reason to keep fucking trying Iâ€™m gonna throw myself off my apartments roof.

Edit: 14 hours later and not a single comment. Pretty garbage that Iâ€™m hated on the one sub I figured that wouldnâ€™t be the case.
