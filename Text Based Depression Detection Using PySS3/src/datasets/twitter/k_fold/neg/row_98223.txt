A 20 year death.I've chosen the long, slow route to suicide. Nothing violent and sudden and final. I just stopped taking care of myself years ago, and am now killing myself by smoking, eating, and torturing myself mentally. It will probably take another 10 years or so, but I'm obviously making a lot of progress, considering how my body feels these days.
