I can feel myself spiralingI've had problems with depression and suicide ideation for years, ups and downs but this time feels different.

I grew up being told that my father died in a freak accident, but about 6 months ago I found out he actually committed suicide. I I've been struggling to keep my shit together, but it's just sort of getting to me. I've always had these ups and downs, but knowing it beat my dad, it's like in my head now I know it beat him, it's like it's made it more acceptable for me to do it too. The main thing that has stopped me from doing in the past was guilt, for who I'd leave behind. 

I can just feel it getting worse and worse, I'm having more and more panic attacks and I'm getting anxious about the stupidest things. Right now I can't stop shaking. 

I just don't know what I'm doing, I just don't want to feel like tbis anymore. I don't want to be me.
