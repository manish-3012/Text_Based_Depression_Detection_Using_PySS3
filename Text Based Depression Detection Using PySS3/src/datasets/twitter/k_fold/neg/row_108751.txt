.I donâ€™t want to call a hotline, they ask if your a suicidal and I am. 

Well I really want to kill myself im just too scared to do it.

I donâ€™t know if I want help or what but just donâ€™t really know what to do so Iâ€™m writing here

Iâ€™ll keep it short

Iâ€™m a father to a 13 year old daughter and Iâ€™m 29 Iâ€™ve been abused mentally physically and sexually for most of my youth and tried my best to not repeat a cycle when I made a mistake and got my high school girlfriend pregnant. I have had a lot of downs along the way mentally and still hanging on by a thread I started medication six months ago to try and remidate the issue, I talk to a therapist over the phone here and there when I have a mental breakdown. But this last week was the final straw 

I feel like my life is over I spent my whole life trying to be a father and raise my daughter and now because I been so lonely over the years it culminated with me having drunk unprotected sex which I thought was protected by birth control. But she wasent on it apparently and now she told me sheâ€™s keeping the baby.

I have been abused and torn down my whole life and I can barely do what Iâ€™m doing now without completely breaking down, and this girl who doesnâ€™t have stable employment savings or any understanding what it means to be a single parent wants to have this child. 

Just trying to keep my mind busy while back after I took a week of vacation time to try and deal with this mentally. Now Iâ€™m alone stuck at work doing watching things I shouldnâ€™t be in charge of watching but it I say anything I could lose my status or my job so Iâ€™m just trying to escapee and survive today
