Suicide Lifeline(tw. mention of abuse and rape)
I have to call the suicide Lifeline last night after my dad blamed me for losing the TV remote and I feel like an absolute failure. I have coping mechanisms in place and am at a place that I know I won't actually do it but the feelings got so strong that I didn't know what else to do. My dad is the one person who's opinion matters to me and after being abused by my mother (they're divorced) and her husband until the day I moved out, being abused by my babysitter until I was old enough to be on my own and being raped by her granddaughter that lived with her, I have serious problems with authority. Whenever he gets upset with me I instantly get so suicidal and it's been getting worse since quarantine and all of this stuff happening. Almost two years ago I was put on medication for bipolar but at this point the dosage I was at doesn't help me anymore. I tried to explain to my physiatrist in a way that he would suggest we up the dosage, but instead he put me on an antidepressant as well. It's not working and I don't think it will, this is just like it was before I started on my first medication but just worse again. Because I have such issues with authority I just couldn't figure out how to ask him directly. I figured that I might as well give it a chance and I'm talking with my therapists on Tuesday about it before our follow up appointment about the new medication. With everything going on and the fact that my insurance doesn't cover my therapist, I haven't seen her in just under a year. Everything has been building up to this and I just got so suicidal that I couldn't handle myself anymore. The woman on the phone was really nice and helpful and talked me through the rough time and I did feel better, but I feel like such a failure that I couldn't handle myself for just three more days that I had to call them.
