Mentally ill with lots of school loansHi. I want to first apologize for my poor wording of things here, I'm distressed and having an anxiety attack atm.
I'm severely depressed. I've been diagnosed with depression, PTSD, social anxiety, and panic disorder. I've recently applied for social security benefits at the suggestion of my counselor and psychiatrist. When I graduate in about a year I will have racked up about 100k (US dollars) in loans. I cannot work because of my disability and my family is very unsupportive of me. They think I'm lazy and don't understand what I have going on inside my head. My parents are also in a rough divorce where my father stole our money and bought a house with it with his new girlfriend. We've also been abused by him but it looks like he will get away with it scott-free. I feel hopeless about everything. I'm 21 years old and my disabilities are brought upon by abuse from birth until I was about 19. I've been having very dark thoughts along the lines of "if I kill myself, I won't have to deal with paying off the loans". I know those are wrong, but it scares me to have thought them. I don't know what to do. I can't work in this mental state. I'm currently going through therapy and counseling to someday be able to be "normal", but the loan companies and my school don't care. I'm terrified I won't be able to pay those loans off and it's engulfing my life. I don't feel joy or happiness in anything. I feel alone and like there is no point in living.

I'm sorry for being a bother. I just need somebody to listen. I'm sorry.
