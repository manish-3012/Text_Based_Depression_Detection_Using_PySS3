Reaching outRecently, I tried reaching out to my parents for help. I was met with "you're selfish!" And "do you even think about how you affect your parents?!" I embarrass them. I don't know what to do anymore, as they refuse to get me help. I haven't harmed myself in weeks now but I feel like it's my only escape. None of my friends know what's wrong and my parents are threatening to get physically violent. I'm so young yet I've already failed everyone. At this point, I'm ready to go.
