I might've gone off the deep endI haven't been taking my effexor for the last few days and I've been having constant crying spells, fits of anger where I scream at the top of my lungs at anything (a jay walker walked in front of my car today and I fucking lost it). my 'boyfriend' and I have been distant and I haven't been "actively" suicidal in months but with my mood swings today and no human contact I just wanna go to bed..... just want to go to bed...
I just took 650 mg of seroquel. I know it won't kill me, but I just want to go to bed. Just want to go to bed. Please someone talk to me, please. So much is going on and I can't keep up. There's no way I can talk to my mom right now. I don't wanna hurt myself tonight. please
