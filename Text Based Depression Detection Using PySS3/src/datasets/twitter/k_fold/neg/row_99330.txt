I feel like I have been "reborn" as of lateI don't have long term depression but I have very unstable mood. One night a month ago I wasn't able to take it and I made a school shooting threat on Snapchat and I said on the same threat that it's fake but they'll have no choice but to throw me in jail just in case or something. Next day 2 cops show up at school, talk to me for a while and take me home. I go to the hospital with my mom who was crying when I come home and in the hospital they wondered where to put me. Now I'm regurarly talking to my school's therapist and were working on finding things for me to care about. I described my situation in a way where Im not scared, depressed or anxious about anything but I also don't have any reason in particular to stay alive and put the effort into doing anything. 

Before the whole threat situation like 6 months ago I've been really getting into philosophy and really thinking about death. My conclusion is that we've all been there before. Your existence 200 years in the future is the same situation as your existence 200 years ago. I know that once I die I'll not have the ability to feel happiness ever again but you also can't feel regret or sadness. I'm not afraid of death anymore and it makes me feel like I'm kinda free. Fuck being what other people want me to be in the past I've been described as being very stubborn about my decisions and I'm now taking it even further. I'm going to do whatever I want and I know I have the know how on getting by. I'll get decent grades and take a job I enjoy instead of something that pays a lot and completely forget about anything but doing the things that please me. We will all be equal in death and I couldn't care less about this really short time I have to spend when it comes to responsibilities. Of course I follow the law but from now on it's "me time" 24/7
