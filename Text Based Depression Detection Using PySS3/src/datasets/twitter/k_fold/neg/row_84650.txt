Gf left me, sister died, lost my job - think about killing myself every day.Hi all. 

I came on here for a last attempt at some help. As the title says, me and my gf of a year broke up recently, right after my sister passed away. And to make matters worse, I lost my job today because I missed too many days due to my depression. I think about ending my life every single day. It seems like the right thing to do. Life has just let me down one thing after another. 

Life sucks. I don't want to be a part of it anymore.
