I don't want to existI don't want to, but I also feel obligated and joy even when I work forward, towards helping the planet. But that feeling has been deposited to, I will because it's the right thing and not so much out of love.

 I have always felt the want to disintegrate, or dissipate. But more so, I wish I hadn't been born, then all of this mess could of been avoided. 

I'm glad I'm here for my cat, I'm sorry I didn't create a better life. This life is soul sucking and pure torture. I feel like I'm constantly being mocked but the universe. No one cares. Successful, failure, boring or mindful.. what is wrong with me?

Just internal screams, but I'm trying to be in the present for my cat. How couldn't I be better?? But it's hard, I fail. I pretend. But I do love and care for him. I'm doing my best.
