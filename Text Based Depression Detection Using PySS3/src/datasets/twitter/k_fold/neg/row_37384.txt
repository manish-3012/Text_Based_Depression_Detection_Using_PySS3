I canâ€™t live like thisI canâ€™t. Everything is falling apart, and I canâ€™t keep on lying and pretending like theyâ€™ll get better. 

My Ex will never take me back. I will never get a career that I love. If I keep on living, things will only get worse and worse, and I have my entire life as proof of that. 

This is it. I donâ€™t care what is there for me after this life, as long as itâ€™s not this.
