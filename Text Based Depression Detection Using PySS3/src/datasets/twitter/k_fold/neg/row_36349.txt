why do i keep goingi've been abuse my entire life, i was raped in my first and only relationship, i have no friends because of moving, i've never been able to have long lasting psychiatric care, i'm drowning in debt, and i've been suicidal since i was 11

i don't know why i'm still here

nobody believes me when i talk about how hard it is because of what happened because my girlfriend raped me (haha how can girls rape girls haha!!) and i can't tell anyone about all the abuse

why do i need to be alive but more importantly why do i have to feel this way i hate this

i hate that i'll live like this for a long time if i don't just end it asap
