Iâ€™ll outlive my dog...Not sure if this belongs here. I think about ending my life all the time. Not going to get into that but I felt like sharing this for some reason. Iâ€™m staying alive for now because I feel too guilty to leave my dog behind. No people stop me, just my dog. Heâ€™s my best friend. Had him since a few weeks old and now he is 8 years old. He is a Pit bull mix of some sort and heâ€™s the sweetest boy. I donâ€™t think heâ€™d take it well not seeing me ever again. There are no people I see on a regular basis, but him and I, we are very close and spend a lot of time together. Might be lame but If anyone needs a friend, get a dog. 

On a dark side thought, watching him age is like watching myself die on the inside. Tread lightly.
