cant wait anymore22, community college dropout, trying to quit drugs.

i have so much i want to do, but now i dont really care, it doesn't matter anyway, because nobody cares about anyone but themselves.

cant explain to parents, friends, anyone without getting the same wait it out bullshit. cant breathe well, smoked on bad lungs for years.

its all my fault, that's fine. and i'll take responsibility for it by jumping off a bridge and making everybody suffer one last time. soon. too fucking soon. people just wont understand.
