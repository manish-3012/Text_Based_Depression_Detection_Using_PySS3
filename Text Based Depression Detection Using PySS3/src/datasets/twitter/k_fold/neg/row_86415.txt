lol i want to diei thought i had hit rock bottom last year but of course guess who managed to get even lower. iâ€™ve struggled with depression and anxiety for the a few years now. but this past year has by far been the worst, it feels like every decision iâ€™ve made has somehow turned against me, and like iâ€™m slowly just fucking over my life. i donâ€™t wanna do anything anymore, i just wanna die. last night i thought i was ready to finally do it, i had everything set up and ready but i didnâ€™t have the courage and decided to just sleep. iâ€™ve been considering admitting myself into a mental hospital but idk, maybe just ending it all will just be the better option in the end.
