Feeling trapped and backed into a cornerDunno what to say . 35 years old diagnosed with bipolar 2, cptsd, ocd and general anxiety disorder . I donâ€™t really remember a time in my life when I have truely been happy . My depression and mood swings have ruined pretty much every job and relationship I have been in . Itâ€™s alienated me from my family . I had a nervous breakdown on my way to work the day of my 34th birthday and havenâ€™t been able to work since . My older brother let me live with him for  almost a year and then he and  as well as his wife we had a big fallout last July (havenâ€™t talked since and probably never will ) and Iâ€™ve been having to live at my moms like an asshole ever since which has made me feel even worse . Been seeing a psychiatrist and the meds (lamictal ) I am on have made my symptoms worse including outbursts of anger and she doesnâ€™t want to do anything but up my benzos. Now on my moms last good graces and get the feeling Iâ€™m going to get the boot from here soon . My next step is being homeless . Really feel like I am nearing the end. Keep applying for jobs and getting no responses and when I am able to work 3-4 weeks before having another brake down and having to quit . Have dental problems and no $ to fix them so in a lot of pain constantly as well. Last night I started to kind of word out my note and plan things out . I was staring at my klonopin bottle and a bottle of oxycodone that I didnâ€™t use from a medical procedure earlier this year . I decided I didnâ€™t want my mom or any other family to â€œfind me â€œ and be traumatized. I then started to drive to the Tacoma narrows bridge . Parked there and just sobbed for like an hour . Called the suicide line and damn was the guy I talked to worthless . Props for these People giving up their time to help but shit I felt worse when I got off the phone . Ended up basically crying myself to sleep in my car before waking up to a security guard knocking on my window . I think he could tell I was upset and that plus my general location to the bridge clued him into the situation . We talked for 30 minutes , he talked me into going home and talking to my family and gave me his contact info . Finally it seemed like someone cared . Back home now . Still depressed . You win life ..Iâ€™m here for now . 

Sorry for the rant . Just wanted to put my thoughts and experiences on â€œpaperâ€ and this seemed like the appropriate venue.
