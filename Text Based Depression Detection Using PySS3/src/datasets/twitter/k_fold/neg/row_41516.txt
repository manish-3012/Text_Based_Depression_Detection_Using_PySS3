I think God is telling me to do it. I wonâ€™t, but I genuinely do believe it.Over the course of the last day, Iâ€™ve gotten 2 messages from former friends basically telling me how horrible I am. Iâ€™ve been curled up in a ball all day, having no appetite at all whatsoever. I feel like Iâ€™m gonna throw up. I feel like everyone is against me.

Iâ€™ve been dealing with major survivors guilt in the first place with COVID. I feel like these messages are just reinforcing that belief that I donâ€™t deserve to live and I shouldâ€™ve died instead of other people.
