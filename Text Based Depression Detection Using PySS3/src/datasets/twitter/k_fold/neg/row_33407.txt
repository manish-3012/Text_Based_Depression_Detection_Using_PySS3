Not my first rodeoHere I am in this dark place once again.
I never really planned on making it past 21. Everyone fantasizing about other stuff. Me, fantasizing how to leave. Yet, here I am. Almost middle aged. The feeling goes away to the back seat, but it's still there haunting me all the time. Can't manage having friends. They always get tired of my moping around and leave me. Yeah, I have a job and a home. What does it really matter? So empty, no one to talk to. No one asking how your day went. Maybe it's better that way, since I won't hurt anyone anymore.

The quarantine has nothing to do. It's always been like this. Hurting more cause I thought I could confide in a friend who has suffered in life. A kindred soul, I though. I thought I could connect or something, but alas they leave and want nothing to do with you. The neverending cycle. I'm so tired. I just need it to stop.

I'm not afraid of death. Never have been. Don't really care who misses me. Not my problem. My biggest fear is living in pain, which I do since far back as I can remember. Not physical, just mental anguish. You might ask yourself why haven't I ended it yet. Hope... Not really. I just fear messing up badly and keep on living. Worse, end up a living vegetable so they can continue their cruel joke of my life. Am I selfish? I suppose, it's my life, I'm the one suffering.

I'm ready.
Please?
