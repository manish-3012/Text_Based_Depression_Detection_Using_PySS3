The biggest reason no one ever talks about suicideIs because they donâ€™t want to burden anyone with the after thought that they could have stopped it.

I have depression and I have gone through suicidal periods and I have never told any of my friends or family anything about it. I completely hide every aspect of the illness for the the similar reason that if I did kill myself i wouldnâ€™t want my friends or family to think they could have done anything. Obviously still horrible but much better if they had no idea.

Just wondering what others think of this, I see it as the biggest issue is regards to mental health and suicide.
