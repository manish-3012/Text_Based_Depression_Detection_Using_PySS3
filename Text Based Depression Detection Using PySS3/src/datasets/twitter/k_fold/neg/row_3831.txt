Is it possible I'm living a nightmare/in hellI don't remember when exactly, but a few years ago I had a major suicide attempt with pills. Looked up the LD50 and I definitely should of been dead. 

I felt like I was on deaths door, passed out, then slowly recovered within hours. Thinking back, theres a chance I'm actually dead. And all the hurt and pain that has happened since is just my imagination running wild. The amount of horrible shit that has happened in my life, this is the only explanation that makes sense. Coronavirus sounds like some world ending bullshit I created for an apocalyptic novel. Take a step back and notice I'm currently living in an apocalypse. Lol. Yeah I'm convinced this is all a dream, and like inception I need to "wake up" through death. But like a pussy,  I'm scared of being wrong.
