Lost interest in everything I used to like to do....I'm only 15 but I feel like nothing is interesting to me anymore. Everything on YouTube and movies or shows seems boring and I can't concentrate on anything they say. This leads to being really bored and then I become depressed. No I'm not taking depression, I'm not seeking pity or anything like that. I just don't understand how to live if I can't find anything joyful or makes me happy. Maybe food or cats is the only thing left that makes me happy and my family. But I constantly feel like I'm boring and no one's gonna talk to me since O don't seem interested in anything anymore.
