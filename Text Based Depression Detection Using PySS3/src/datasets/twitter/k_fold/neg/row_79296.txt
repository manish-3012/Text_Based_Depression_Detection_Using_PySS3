I need someone to talk to until I actually can sleepIf anyone can just talk to me about something, anything, until I'm tired enough to be asleep as soon as I get in bed, it would be greatly appreciated. I worry I may kill myself if I don't immediately fall asleep.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who's been talking with me. I feel now like I'm tired enough that I won't be awake for long enough to do any harm to myself when I go to bed. Goodnight
