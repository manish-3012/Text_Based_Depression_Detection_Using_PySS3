Iâ€™m ready to fucking go.Iâ€™m going to call my doctorâ€™s office again tomorrow morning to schedule an appointment where I can set up a DNR and an advance directive. I want everyone to be surprised when they read it on my folder. Theyâ€™ll wish they supported me while I was still here.

Nobody is interested in what I do enough to actually support me. My music will last longer if I die now than if I struggle making people listen all my life. Iâ€™m more valuable to the world dead than alive.

My family will find a way to twist it around where Iâ€™m the villain. â€œShe wasnâ€™t going anywhere in life anyway.â€ â€œShe was too emotional.â€ â€œThank God sheâ€™s gone, now I can finally breathe.â€ â€œShe mustâ€™ve felt bad for how horribly she treated all of us!â€ 

I want to slit my wrists with one of the sharp ass kitchen knives in the house I can barely afford to rent a room in.

Not tonight, maybe, but GOODBYE WORLD
