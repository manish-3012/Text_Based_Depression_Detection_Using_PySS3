my thoughtsmy thoughts

i keep thinking about suicide

all i want is to stop existing 

but when i picture myself actually doing it

walking into my parentâ€™s room

pulling the glock out of the drawer

and pulling the trigger

suicide suddenly seems scary

i want nothing more than for the hurting to stop

but thinking of all the consequences that come

with dying seems unbearable too

i imagine the look on my momâ€™s face as she 

walks in on my dead body

sheâ€™s the only person who has ever truly 

supported me but at the same time if i opened 

up to her about my struggles i know she 

wouldnâ€™t understand

i just feel so alone

sorry
