I have to kill Myself soonThe odds are against me in life. It's not just about not wanting to work a job or about how I can't have a sex drive. It's everything. I don't even have a car and I've had my drivers license for 2 years this May. I always wanted to drive and race cars but I can't even do that. Living in LA doesn't help either because everyone my age has cars from their parents and my parents are poor just like me. I'll always be a poor pathetic no sex getting guy so I have to kill myself soon, I'm just wasting time being alive.
