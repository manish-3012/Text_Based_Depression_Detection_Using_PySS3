I want to die so badlyI just wish I werenâ€™t such a coward and could go through with it. Iâ€™ve lost my family, my cat (he was my absolute everything, I grieve his loss everyday ), my health and I just really donâ€™t want to go on. I feel hollow but I am so scared of hurting the few people around me by committing suicide. I just wish I were entirely alone so I could go without it having negative effects on others.
