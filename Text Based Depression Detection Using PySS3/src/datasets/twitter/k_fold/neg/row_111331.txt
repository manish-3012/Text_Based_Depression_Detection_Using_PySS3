I really just want someone I can speak honestly to.There's nobody in my life that I can trust anymore to talk to. I've got a fairly long story that I don't feel like writing down all at once, but what came from it is a group of friends that don't care about me, parents that would rather use what I say to them as ammo against the other, and a brother that has told me to kill myself. I don't know how much longer I'll be able to take any of this.
