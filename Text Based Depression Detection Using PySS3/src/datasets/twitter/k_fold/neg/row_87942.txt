I miss himMy best friend/ boyfriend killed himself last weekend and I miss him so much like when I found out he had passed away it's like someone grabbed my chest twisted it and put flames in it. It hurts so much cause I can't believe he's gone and that he killed him self. He promised me he wouldn't and I still don't even get why he did he left a note specific for me saying "I'm sorry I ended my life but just know I'll still say good morning everyday at 12am to you in your heart". I remember telling him one time that if he killed him self I would too but Ik he ended his life cause he wanted his pain to end but really it just caused more pain and if I kill myself it would cause even more pain but I also wanna be with him so bad like I legit have cried myself to sleep since he's been gone and when I'm at school I act like I'm okay and that it doesn't hurt that the fact that he killed him self I just fake a smile and laugh but I'm dying inside and I wanna die to be with him cause ik life sucks he killed him self and I miss him so much so I just wanna die to be in his arms again.
