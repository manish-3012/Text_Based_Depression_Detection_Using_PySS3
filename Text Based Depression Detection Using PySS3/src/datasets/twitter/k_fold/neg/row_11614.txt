I quit.I quit life. I don't know what to anymore or where to go.

I don't even know how to put what is going on in my life into words. I'm tired of being harassed. I'm tired of being called a whore because of my sexuality. I'm tired of being judged. I'm tired of being abused by my mother who says I'm not her daughter anymore. I've tried everything and I'm tired of trying.

I give up. Everything I've kept going for falls apart. I've gone from place to place and done thing after thing and it feels like everything I ever have contact with falls apart, from relationships to jobs to school to anything else. I keep trying at things and trying not to give up until it is practically run into the ground and gives up on me.

I can't do this anymore. I'm just too tired. I finally give up on life. I finally quit. 

Goodbye.
