I'm going to hang todayI'm posting this on mobile so please excuse any errors.
I am 24 years old, I live at home, I never attended college or made an attempt to.  I am currently undateable and without friends and I believe the lack of college is a big factor in that.
My only real friends have all moved on with their lives, they live on the opposite end of the country(I live on the East coast of the USA).
I just got a full time job that pays a fairly decent hourly wage and has fair benefits for what it is.  However, I don't particularly care about it one way or the other, it's a means to an end, not my passion.
My immediate family and my paternal grandmother are really the only ones I think will be impacted in any major way.  I think they worry about me but alas, I don't have the strength for life anymore.
I'll be going later tonight.  It is currently 5:43 EST.
I'm 24 years old and tonight I will hang.
