How am I supposed to do this? ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸I am just sick of fighting with myself and people to delay the inevitable and now I wanna accept things as they are. 
But then again I start seeking hope in people or things that everything would be fine one day. 

How can I just get this thought out of mind and accept that I will always be as miserable as I'm now? 
PS- I have tried taking sleeping pills to numb my mind but even that doesn't seem to work. So, pills are a NO for me. 

No sympathetic or motivating comments please. Just need to know how do I accept my fate. Thanks
