It being Valentimes Day makes me Feel like I'll never have a wife or girlfriend and makes want to commit suicide.I'm 21 and don't have a wife or girlfriend. I just can't find the right person. I don't drink, am religious, or have had luck with online dating. I wish I had someone to give me love and have sex with. I can't find the right person doing what I'm doing.
