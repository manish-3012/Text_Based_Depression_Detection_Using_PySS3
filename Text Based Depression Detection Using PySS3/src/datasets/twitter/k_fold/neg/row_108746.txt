at work today i thought about how i'm gonna commit suicide this weekend..i bought train tickets to another city because i wanted to visit a friend.. she's kinda cutting off connection past 2 weeks and i'm afraid she'll say we can't meet this we or i will cancel it since i'm feeling pretty unsure about this thing..

just thinking about how i'd tell others i won't go to that city made me think about what if i just still go there, but not to her place and instead just look around, stay up through the night, renting a hotel room for a night, writing letters to those 2 or 3 loved ones, sending them out and then do it.

all of that at work and it was a thought progress of like 10min
pretty scary

i really wonder what will happen this weekend


i'll keep on posting here or on /r/depression since i don't have anywhere else to go

gotta head back and work now though
