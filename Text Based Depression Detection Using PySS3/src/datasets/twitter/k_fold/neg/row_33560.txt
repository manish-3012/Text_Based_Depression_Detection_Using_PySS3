How am I supposed to tell a loved one with anxiety I need to be hospitalized?In the past year Iâ€™ve had four attempts that brought me to a hospital. I learned coping skills(DBT also) a long time ago, Iâ€™m in therapy and on meds- none of it is helping me. I have a plan, and Iâ€™m just settling things before I enact it. Itâ€™s all getting worse and worse, but Iâ€™m feeling guilty about leaving my s/o who has anxiety and depression. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m supposed to reach out to them when theyâ€™re already paranoid and anxious Iâ€™ll have another attempt and leave them (they tell me regularly theyâ€™re afraid of it). I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m supposed to help myself- I donâ€™t see any point in living anymore. I canâ€™t stop thinking about carrying out my plan and I am so, so tired. 
How am I supposed to tell them when theyâ€™re already a wreck about my past attempts?
