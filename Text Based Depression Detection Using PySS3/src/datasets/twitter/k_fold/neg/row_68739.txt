Why can't I just be normal?college student, female, generalized anxiety disorder, undiagnosed depression, undiagnosed eating disorder. sitting here, pulling my third all-nighter in 5 days...I can't really sleep anyways, so I guess I don't mind. Going home in a few days for break, praying my friends and family don't notice the cuts on my arm. I'm not ready to have that conversation with anybody. It's really fucking ironic, they think I'm fine, even my roommate, who I see almost 24/7, doesn't suspect a thing. I just want to sleep, obviously physically, but just checking out for a while doesn't seem so bad. It's weird to be depressed before seeing those I love, feeling normal for the time I'm with them, and then spiraling once I'm left on my own. I almost feel like I have too much going on school-wise to even be depressed, let alone wanting to kill myself. I'm terrified of admitting defeat...my mask will not crack. Nobody suspects a thing. I can't risk them finding out, at this point I don't think I want help. It's irrational, but then again, everything is. If it wasn't for the guilt of others keeping me here, I would be gone in a heartbeat.  The only reason I haven't done it yet seems dumb...music. I am so tied to music, I can't let go because of it. I tell myself, just listen to one more song or playlist; and then I feel okay for a while. I think maybe these are all signs that I don't really want to end it...maybe my subconscious wants to be here.
