I don't know what else to do anymore.I had suicidal thoughts for three, two and a half years. I wrote notes before, I have elaborate plans, 
but thing thing is, that feeling that I'll be better off dead comes in waves, usually appears around August, stays with me for about half a year, then leaves me alone for a while.

But I know I have nothing to live for, that I'm stupid, ugly, get tired of people too easily, and I'm disappointing my family with literally every piece of my being. If my mother's biggest goal at this age is to have grandchildren, then I'm sorry, I'm a lesbian, and I'm not sinking low enough to find some guy just to have kids for her sake.

I stopped trying years ago. Sometimes I don't try to do things, knowing that I will fail anyway and I'm just wasting my time. 

My entire life feels like I'm wasting someone else's time, if I want to be honest.

I can't live for myself or for someone else, so what's the point?
