I'm doneI feel so tired and hopeless, I don't even have the slightest reason to live, I'm just escaping the pain over and over, while everything is breaking down in my life and It lasts for two months and I'm so tired, that i feel like i can't go any futher, It's pointless and I'm tired, my past is fucked up, my present is fucked up and my future is fucked up, I've also fucked up every possible relation with anybody, no one believes me and nobody realizes, how close my death actually is, that makes me wanna suicide even more, just to prove everyone, that I wasn't joking at all... And also, just to get some relief...
