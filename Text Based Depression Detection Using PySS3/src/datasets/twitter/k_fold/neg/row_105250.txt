Still suicidalIâ€™ve posted here many times,on throwaways but now its on my main eventhough my gf knows of this account,its bc the end is in sight.

Iâ€™ve thought about ending it for years tbh,and now its worse than ever,my anxiety,paranoia,suicidal thoughts are constant.

I (14M)love my gf(F16) weâ€™re in a long distance relationship and sheâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m not ending it,but I think sheâ€™s going to die soon..
Her nan,the person who cared for her just died.It wasnt supposed to happen,she was supposed to finally be happy,moved away from her abusive mother and made a friend..but now sheâ€™ll probably have to go back to her asshole of a mum and close to where her ex,who is threatening her and raped her a year and a half ago.

Goddamnit..I thought weâ€™d finally be happy..I wanted to have a future with her,I love her like no one else alive...
Dont start with the age or distance bs,Iâ€™ve heard it all before.

Iâ€™m scared,in a way.I know suicide is â€˜a permanent solution to a temporary issueâ€™ well its not temporary,fuck off.Iâ€™m just thinking yk?What if I fail?There probably isnt an afterlife,which is sad for me,since Iâ€™d only have lived 14 years.I wish I could meet her,fuck man Iâ€™d not only die a virgin,but without my first kiss or ever cuddling anyone,or hugging anyone outside of my family,never held hands..

Iâ€™m just kinda useless,most people at my age have accomplished something..I havent.

I just want to meet her,just see her..talk,whatever man its not like anyone else likes me.
All I want is a hug man..like for once yk?to know what it feels like..

I dont wanna die I just cant live without her,I dont wanna live this life anymore if the only good thing is gone..

I already have a suicide note aha..fuckin end me..
