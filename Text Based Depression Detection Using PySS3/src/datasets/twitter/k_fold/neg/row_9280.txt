I'm tired of myself after all the failed relationships...I thought I'd be married by now, I thought I'd be doing memorable things with someone I truly loved by now.. I thought life was going to be so much different then it is now... I am so tired of being mean for no reason online... I'm so built up with hate for myself I spew it to others who don't need it... I am so tired of wanting to be in love but being afraid of being close... I always lose the person I'm interested in... fuck life. :(
