Heyo, new to Reddit, bot sure if this is the right place to postIâ€™m going to kill myself very soon. I have written letters to people and I have them printed out and ready for them to read once Iâ€™m gone. I quit my job, and Iâ€™m about to drop out of school so I can spend my last week eating things I really love and things Iâ€™ve never tried, watching movies/tv shows Iâ€™ve loved and never got around to watching, and music, and so on. Save your talk, because Iâ€™m deadset on this, nothing you can do will make me not do this. This world isnâ€™t for me, and Iâ€™m only one person, Iâ€™m not able to change shit. My question is what is the quickest way to kill myself that is 1. Affordable (Iâ€™m very poor). 2. Painless. 3. 100% success rate (I was going to do an overdose, but read up that it never works and thereâ€™s a chance Iâ€™ll live on as a vegetable so Iâ€™m not really about that living life). 4. A way that I wont be a bother (as much as I hate this world, I donâ€™t want to throw myself under a train or bus or jump off a building and causing trouble for some poor saps that would be late to work/school or have to pick up after my ugly fucked up body). Thank you!
