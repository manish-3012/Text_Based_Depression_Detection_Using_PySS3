Brother needs helpI'm not sure if this is the right place, but my 16 year old brother was sent home from boarding school yesterday because the school feels strongly that he is suicidal. He went to the hospital today for an evaluation, and while he was discharged, I am very very worried about him. 

I am 10 years older than he is and live across the country. We are very close and I'm flying back to see him tomorrow. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to help him other than take him to professionals (already in progress). I want to just be there and show him how much I love him and talk him through some of this, but also want to be cautious that I don't trigger anything. 

According to our mother, he had a few methods all planned out. Naturally I'm terrified and want to do everything I can to help.

Thoughts? Advice?
