2nd day of work and I want to end itIâ€™ve wanted to stop my suffering for a while now. Work has pushed me over the edge and I donâ€™t want to work for this shitty life anyway. Iâ€™ve been a busboy for 2 days and my mental health is rapidly going to shit. I canâ€™t quit. Iâ€™ve already quit a job after the first day before. I just wish there were better jobs for me around where I live but there arenâ€™t. This sucks. Iâ€™ll probably kill myself soon.
