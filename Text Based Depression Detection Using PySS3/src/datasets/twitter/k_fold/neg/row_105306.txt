I HAVE to kill myself.I could never explain to anybody the abuse that has been my life or what my 'family' has done to me. 

Im also in so much pain every single moment I exist that literally all I want is it to stop and I just want to be gone. I mean there's a big part of me that still longs for the kind of living that I always dreamed of but I just don't think that will ever happen, they will never stop. 

I've been basically dead already for the past 4 years anyway, there really wouldn't even be much of a difference in my being gone as to how I am now. I never really stood a chance and they were never ever going to let me have any kind of happy life. All I ever tried to do was wish the best for everyone and everything and be a good person. 

I just don't want to kill myself just to find that I am still around in some way or something of that sort... I am terrified well not really more like just tired of suffering and tired of not being able to complain or point out any of it but I have just been through too much to continue this shit, I'll never be able to prove anything that has happened to me it's all fucking bent ass crazy shit.

I just can't do it anymore.
