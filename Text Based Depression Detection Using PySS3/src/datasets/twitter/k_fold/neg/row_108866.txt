My life has just started but i want to endIâ€™ve lost everything i care about. Iâ€™m not the emotional type, i was always rather cold. I was that guy that was rude to everyone for no reason. I thought i was better than everyone else. This is because when it came to relationships I always got so emotional I couldnâ€™t bare to let anyone else see it. Iâ€™m a cold arsehole on the outside but to the one i love Iâ€™m an emotional mess.

4 years ago i met the love of my life while i was still In school and sheâ€™s made me who i am today. Iâ€™ve come so far and achieved so much and done things no one ever couldâ€™ve dreamed of me doing. 

But she ended it, on my birthday, after 4 years of love and what I thought would last forever she ended it. To see someone act like theyâ€™d do anything for you one day and then be so cold the next day is the hardest thing in the world. 

She doesnâ€™t love me and she wants nothing to do with me, Iâ€™m almost certain sheâ€™s telling me there will be a chance in future just so i calm down and donâ€™t do anything stupid.

I canâ€™t live without her. Iâ€™m 20 years old and i donâ€™t want to live anymore. I canâ€™t and i wonâ€™t. Itâ€™s not worth it. I donâ€™t want to ever go through this pain again and i donâ€™t even want to bother trying with anyone else because this was it for me. 

Itâ€™s hurts so much that I canâ€™t even function day to day, and I just want it to end. Iâ€™m trying to think of the easiest and quickest ways of doing it. The ones that donâ€™t inconvenience other people. But i canâ€™t get a gun where i live so itâ€™s so much harder. 

I just want her back. But the sad thing is i think i want to die even more.
