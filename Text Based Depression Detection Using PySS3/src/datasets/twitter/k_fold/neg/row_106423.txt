About to be entering a very dark periodI've been struggling with suicide for a long time now. I've tried and failed to kill myself before and these past couple of weeks are feeling very reminicint of the weeks leading up to my first suicide attempt. 

Haven't had hot water or heat in about 2 weeks, don't mind the cold showers that's something I can push through. Just lost $1000 a month from my side gig, that's ok I can soldier on. Just cut costs elsewhere. My phone will be dissconnected at midnight tonight. That's ok, right? No one calls or texts me anyways so what does it actually matter. Electricity and internet might be next. Fine fuck it. I don't need the internet to entertain myself I have tons of books and the sun stays out till like 9pm now so who needs lights?! Going to have to sell my car back to the bank to cover some of the financial losses from the $1000 a month. FUCKING FINE!!! I LIVE IN THE HEART OF DARKNESS ANYWAYS! I can just Uber out if I need to go further than my Buble. Even have some decent hiking within walking distance.

Moved across the country a few months back and it's been one thing after the other. At first it was gradual. Then it hit a tipping point and just shot off into madness. Broke my glasses, like they exploded, desperately need them to see. Without proper insurance that was like $500 of fuckery. My dog got wicked sick. Scary sick. She's fixed, and randomly started pissing blood everywhere. All day. Tiny little spurts of blood. That was like 3 separate vet visits of around $200-300 per visit. Oh! My car got fucking booted within my apartment complex once because I had out of state plates and they assumed I didn't actually live there. Gated community. Still trying to furnish my apartment, take care of basic bills, feed myself and my dog.

The bank has put 3 separate fradulent holds on my account since I moved here, even though I kept updating my address. Even went to the actual bank to do that in person. Ended up not having access to my money 3 separate times. One time was for almost 2 weeks. Because they sent my temp card to my old address, after updating, and so they had to put another hold on my account and send me out another card. Whole this is happening I'm acruing hundreds and hundreds of dollars in late payment fees for x,y, and z bill.

My internet here uses a glass fiber optic cable. Incredibly fast upload and download speeds, awesome internet. Well my dog one day attacked the router while I was away, and demolished that specific cord. $150 replacement for the cord or no internet. My dog swallowed all of that glass, so guess what. Another 2-300 at the vet....

There's so much more. So so much more. I've lost hope. Today is one of the least panicked I've been in a while. My phone dies tonight. Doesn't necessarily mean anything, and my internet may be good for the month so there are work around apps I can use if I need to make calls. But holy shit. Things are coming to a head. I can fucking feel it man. The walls aren't just closing in. They've inverted, closed in so much that the walls passed through themselves and created a fourth dimmensional Hyper Cube, of which I'm currently locked in.

Looking out into the world through the hazy mist of this fucking cage... Who fucking cares anymore. You win. I surrender...
