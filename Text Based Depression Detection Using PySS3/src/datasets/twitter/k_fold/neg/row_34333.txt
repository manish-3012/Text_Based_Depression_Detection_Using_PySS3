Tonightâ€™s the nightSpent an 8 hour shift at work today and noticed everyone looking at me and laughing, I forgot I pooed my pants before work and didnâ€™t realise that I never changed them, and no one thought to tell me. I only noticed when I sat down on my break and felt it get pancaked all over my bum. Also for the ENTIRE shift I Am A Giant or whatever the fuck itâ€™s called by Rag n Bone Man played on repeat, fucking hate that song. So for 8 hours I had to walk around with pooey pants and gay retard music, only upside of the day was this guy who I work with twerked and it made me laugh so much I had a big dribble of wee escape my willy so that made the shift EVEN WORSE.
