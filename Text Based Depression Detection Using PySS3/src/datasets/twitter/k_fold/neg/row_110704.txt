No more to live forToday my gf through 4,5 years ended our relationship. I have no contact with my family, and don't want it.
She is my world. We have been trying to have a baby for the last year. I have been looking for engagement rings for months.

Everything is over now.

I have planned how to do it, and have what i need to do it.
I think I'll do it.
