Thought I was getting better, arranging dates, today I just feel like ending it allYeah Iâ€™m not sure I can really shed the shame. Thought I was, but the fact o keep getting crushes on straight guys, which is obviously futile and silly and unhealthy says it all. I feel like all the guys i like are almost never gay, thereâ€™s something I seem to find more attractive about some straight guys. 

Maybe Iâ€™m fucking wrong. Have I liked gay and bisexual guys? Yes! So maybe Iâ€™m just fucked by being brought up in a homophobic society. Maybe there are hot gay guys. Iâ€™m seeing them and donâ€™t even know it. I hope so cos right now I feel like ending it, and the world is ending which doesnâ€™t help. Maybe I should just kill myself and save the trouble of getting old.
