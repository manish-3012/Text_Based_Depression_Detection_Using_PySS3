Waiting on therapy is making my life worseI was [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/defnm/badly_need_help_asking_parents_for_therapy/) [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/d3ig6/im_a_20s_recluse_with_social_anxiety_and_trouble/), and after much delay and excuses I finally asked my parents for therapy... I made the initial appointment several weeks ago, and I still have a few weeks left before it happens, and I can't take it anymore. My thoughts keep jumping around between:
1) What if I can't get better
2) What if it takes too long to get better, I can't live like this much longer... I literally can't
3) Good thoughts - what if I DO get better, move out, get a job, be with friends, get a girlfriend who moves in with me... This then depresses me even worse because I realize it'll never happen
4) Bad thoughts - I should just kill myself, it's going to be way too hard to fix my life and I'm already too old to make up for everything I missed out on.

These thoughts have taken over my life, they just make me so much more depressed to the point I can't even numb the pain by playing games or watching tv anymore...

I don't know why I'm posting here, I'm beyond help. I don't want to die but I just see nothing even with the therapy date coming closer... What the fuck is the point of therapy if I have to wait months between sessions? What's the point of even trying if it's going to take years to get to the point where I can make new friends or be well enough to move to where my friends are and function socially again.
