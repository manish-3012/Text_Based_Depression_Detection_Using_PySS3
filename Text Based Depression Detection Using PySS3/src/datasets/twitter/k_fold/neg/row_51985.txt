tiredim so tired. so tired of everything. tired of disappointing people, tired of getting my hopes up, tired of failing again and again and again. im tired of complaining, whining the way i am like some melodramatic adolescent begging for attention. im sick and tired. im sick of being so lonely despite wanting to be alone. im sick of hating myself, and im sick of starting at my ceiling until 4:00 in the morning. sick of caviling, sick of crying, sick of myself. im just so fucking tired.
