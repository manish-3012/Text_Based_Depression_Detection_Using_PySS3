I wish I could tell them everything.I promise, there's nothing you could have done. I'm so sorry for what I'm about to put you through. Even when people say they want me to stay I just can't feel it anymore. No matter how desperately I want to feel loved and accepted, none of what I receive feels real. That's not your fault. I'm a broken vase that holds no water. All I can think about is finding some way to end this pain, be it drugs, alcohol, or sleep. Please don't blame yourselves. I've always had a feeling it was going to end this way. I love you, but I cant stay. I feel like I'm holding my hand inside a furnace, and the longer I stay the more painful it becomes. I'm so sorry.
