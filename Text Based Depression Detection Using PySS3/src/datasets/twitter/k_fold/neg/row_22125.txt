Pretty much everything that could happen has happen, my dog got killed, by a drunk driver. Yes he was drunk cause the cops got to him for crashing into the ditch next to my house and my dog was laying right there. I have tried to find some friends and maybe a girlfriend but they just lie and cheat on me so whats the use. I hurting more then i ever have right now and im just tired of feeling like this, the feeling of dread and that i know that if I died yes people would be sad, but i truely think that in the long run it will help them out, I honestly have nothing to live for, I tried going to college, the classes I was taking got dropped cause not enough people was taking them, still cant get a ride to go take my drivers test and still cant get a job and to top it off im about to turn 21 and im a pethtic. I truly truly wish I was dead right now.
