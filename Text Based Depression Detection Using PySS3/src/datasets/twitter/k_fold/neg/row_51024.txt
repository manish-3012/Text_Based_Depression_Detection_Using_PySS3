Depression relapseI've been on zoloft 100mg for about 2 or 3 months now and it's suddenly stopped working. I knew this was a possibility but I didn't know it would happen so soon. I'm back to thinking about killing myself and I almost feel as if the medication was just numbing me, putting tape over broken glass. I don't want to go through this again. I can't take it. If this is going to be my life I don't want it anymore. I feel so stupid thinking it would last
