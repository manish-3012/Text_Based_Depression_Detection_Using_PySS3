The drop out chokes on student debt. EZI fucked up, I dropped out of uni, Computing Science to be specific. Ahh, I should've finished it with gritted teeth, should I have not? Oh the debt. My god. It's literally gonna eat me up for good. 

I had enough of it.

It's work, work, extra work shifts, light meals and sleep. Nothing else because somebody has to save money. I diligently try to pay off the student loan but all I wanted was to work as a baker, play video games with friends, draw on the side and have a family. Now I have to work away from all the people I love, in the middle of nowhere, without time for hobbies, just to get a bigger pay-check. And 7 upcoming years like this. Why even bother living then?I pay up my debt lets say at the age of 35 or something and then I can finally free myself and start living? what. a . jok.e

And let's not start with the pressure from the family. They be blaming me for not spending time with them, going away, not creating my own family when they LITERALLY were the ones who Forced me into the university cuz a cook aint prestigious enough. Despite the situation, I love them and would never say it to their face.

You see. the main point is, **IF** ***I die, the debt is written off.***

My family doesn't have to pay a penny, I do not have to spend the rest of my life working 14 hours per day, I don't have to get old alone and I can stop being an embarrassment to everybody. It's like such a win-win situation.

And men, the relationships with them are just so bad... I got raped a few times in my life, was sexually abused at work constantly. It left some consequences which I do not think I can deal with. I try to be normal but it so goddamn difficult. It's literally choking me. And every guy just sees me as a sexual object. Makes me question will I even create a family at this point? On the other hand, I would never dare to burden my partner with such a huge debt tbf...

But boy how I would love to have a few boys, bake them sweets, go hiking, camping and beat them at video games. I just enjoy caring for people so much it breaks my heart to just work here all alone. And I literally cannot see the finish line. This is torture. Why does suicide seem like the easy way out.

To put it bluntly. I work to pay off debt, then I'm free to die alone. lmao. what a joke.

Been reading this reddit for a while. I don't feel so alone here. What am I even trying to get from this post though... :/ Probably just wanted to tell somebody. This is truly truly unbearable. I'm not sure how long I will last like this.
