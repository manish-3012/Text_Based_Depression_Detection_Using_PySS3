Sanity.Aand I'm back. I was doing pretty well the last day or so but I fell back down again and I might be further than before. When I feel like this I feel like I'm losing my mind, I feel like I can feel my sanity literally draining out of my ears and as that happens my humanity shreds and I feel more and more aware of the sick freak that I am. I have no self control when I'm like this and will do whatever the sickness says except kill myself because that's the last thing it wants. The good part of me. The loving caring self sacrificing righteous part of me wants to die because I know it's the only true way to fix what's wrong with me but the sickness in me wants to live just so It can continue to exist and be fucked up and immoral and dangerous. Right nows about the time where I'd try and off myself.
The following years after I was raped (12-15) I'd go into the storage room beside my bedroom and bash my head against the wall or try and suffocate myself or cry and scream or try to hang myself from the extension cord hanging from the rafters. Self preservation would also save me. I wish it hadn't.
