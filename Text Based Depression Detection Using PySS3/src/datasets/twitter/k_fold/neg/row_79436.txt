How can I be sure that my organs are well enough preserved for transplant?I've been severely depressed for a few years now, and although I don't currently feel at 'risk' of killing myself, It's the one thing in my life I can be certain will come back time and time again. 

I don't want to be an utter waste, and I've barely had the time to abuse my body at all, so i figured i could make some use of myself, in ensuring that if i ever do go for it, that as much of me will be of use to others. 

I'd like to ensure that my body is found as soon as possible, and that in killing myself i do as little damage as possible, and that there can be no confusion in the matter that this is what i want, so they can be transplanted as soon as possible. 

I know this isn't what this subreddit is about, but please. I just want to help people.
I'm from the UK if this affects anything.
