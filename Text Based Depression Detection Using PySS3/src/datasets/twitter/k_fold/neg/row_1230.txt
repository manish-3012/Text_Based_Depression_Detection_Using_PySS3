Underemployed, verge of bankruptcy, and suicide would solve all my problems. Forever. So I'm barely covering my bills, and of course my student loans are to start being paid in June. So, if I don't find something better than what I have I'm screwed, well my wife and I anyway. 

So. Life has never really been all that great for me, I always manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, blind short and asthmatic my life won't be long anyway. I have a... significant... life insurance policy paid for by my father it would more than cover all of my expenses for... well a long time. I'm literally worth more dead than alive. Can't think of a reason why I shouldn't off myself come June at the earliest or January 2013.
