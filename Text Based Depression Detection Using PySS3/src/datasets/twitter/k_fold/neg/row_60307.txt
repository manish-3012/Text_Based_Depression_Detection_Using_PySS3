I feel like nothingI'm young, but I have no one.

I lost all my friends and nobody will care if anything happened to me. Nothing would matter if I left. I'm ignored anyways.

I've ruined my family's life and have become a burden.

The only time I felt needed was when guys wanted pics from me, I only went along with it because they said they cared about me.

Everyday I get more and more tired, I feel like this is all a waste of time for me to be on this earth.

Nothing matters anymore, Nobody cares for me.
