I don't know if I can go onLife has been so hard.  I thought my parents cared but they don't.  I attempted suicide July 2nd of this year.  I took the rest of my antibiotics for my strep throat hoping it was enough.  I went downstairs and I started crying.  I told my mom what I had done and she didn't even seem concerned.  All she said is "let me get my stuff".  AS she got her wallet, phone, and car keys.  I thought we were going to the hospital.  I thought was going to get the help that I need or I could finally be at peace.  We went in the car and drove.  But we never did go to the hospital.  All my mom did was just drive me around for an hour.  I'm only alive because I didn't take enough.  But the pills did effect me.  I felt so sick and I did think I was going to die.  But she just drove back home, we went inside and that was it.  I wonder why she never took me to the hospital.  I even asked her when we were in the car if we could go.  It's as if she didn't care.  Like she was okay if her daughter died.  We haven't talked about it since and I don't think I can go on.  I have no one to talk to and I've put on this mask of a happy girl who's life is amazing all my life for so long its like second nature.  I don't think I'm going to win this battle.  I know I  need to get help if I even want a chance to live.  But I don't think that's going to happen.  No one cares about me anymore.  My own mom was okay if I died so I don't know this might be it.
