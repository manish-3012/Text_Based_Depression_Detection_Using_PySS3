Undiagnosed illness leading me to consider suicide.I've been suffering for about 10yrs and it has just kept getting worse. I stopped doing everything bad for my health. I started exercising more, being on a strict diet, completely avoiding anything in my life causing me too much stress. To the point where I am now all by myself and rarely go out as I cannot keep up with everyone else. I am scared to go into stores because of my condition. I vomit a lot. I faint a lot. I always feel sick. It's not even enjoyable for me so I only leave my apt if I really need something or to attend my job. I've been to about 5 doctors in the past 10yrs because it takes a lot of energy out of me and they all tell me I shouldn't worry it's all in my head. So I get a boost of confidence and think I'm ok I just need to relax more. I start living life again as a normal person would, not even stressed out about much but suddenly during what should be a good time- I feel dizzy, I can't stand up right, I feel like I'm dying... and I fall over and just embarrass myself.    

I am now very skeptical of what doctors say and losing trust in the medical system more and more. Since I do not have any on paper conditions (they've caught my symptoms on record but said some people are different and I should just lay down when it happens) ... everyone thinks I'm just bullshitting. Only the ones closest to me know better because I've always been a fighter and hate being seen as weak.

   I've been homeless before over this. I feel like a burden on those that worry about me. I feel like shit all the time, I can barely stand up anymore without feeling like the ground is moving.   being asleep is the only good experience in my life and that's hard enough to obtain from trying to take care of myself with a job.   


I'm so exhausted in every way possible.
