Messed up my life nothing I can doDont think theres any hope for me. I'm not a bad person...wife is currently sleeping with another man every weekend. Dont know how I'll go through divorce. I'm stuck in the house with her and it kills me. Our finances are bad I'm messing up at work. Wont be able to get another good job because of what I've done.

 When I was released from the hospital after my first attempt she left me home alone amd went out with him...

I just want to die but I'm scared but I'm living in hell
