It's not fairI'm going to try to make this short.English isnâ€™t my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.

had a terrible childhood got verbally aand phsically abused by my father on a daily basis:
-got punched in the face
-whipped with his belt
-get called names 
-threaten disown me
-stripped down naked and threw me out of the house and many more abusive shit. 

he also never supported me in anything i wanted to do he always find a way to discourage me either by comparing me to other or flat out say that i suck at it.

school wasn't any different got bullied by everyone teachers classmates basically everyone mad me feel unwanted and this continues through out university years.

after graduation i was able to work for almost a year but had to quit to due severe anxiety and depression plus almost everything i made i had to give it to my family due to our financial problems.

i don't know why i'm still here, i already had enough of this life if anyone could send me a bottle of N i would be grateful because i'm broke.please PM if you can help me.

Thanks for reading and sorry again for my English.
