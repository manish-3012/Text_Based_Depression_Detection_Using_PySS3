For those who have given upIâ€™m not the smartest person in the world , I always stutter when I talk , I may have some mental issues , but you know what the most important person to me told me ? My mom told me that Iâ€™m smart enough to amount to good things in life , Iâ€™m smart enough to lead people and help them and get them out of their problems , and you know what I did ? I started helping the people around me first , then spread out and helped people around the world , to some people Iâ€™m family and a best friend, most of the time I get over my mental problems with helping people , because it awakens a side of me that is smart and intelligent and isnâ€™t retarded , you may be depressed and anxious, life mightâ€™ve hit you hard and had no mercy on your soul , people probably told you to end your life , they probably said that youâ€™ve hurt them even tho you didnâ€™t , I just want you to know that I believe in you , I know and Iâ€™m sure of that youâ€™re a powerful person it might take you a month or a few months heck even a year to change and be the best version of you , life is hard thatâ€™s what my friends and family told me , but god put us on this planet to learn how to survive and be better , life is nothing but a test and a game , the strong beats the weak , but we have to learn how to adapt and learn how to deal with it , isolating yourself thinking itâ€™s the â€œthingâ€ you need isnâ€™t really it , you should leave your room and look outside , thereâ€™s more to us than depression and weakness, just imagine life as a tv show , thereâ€™s the first episode which is you becoming a human being after birth and you being introduced to life , after the first episode you would see horrible and good things , dramatic and comedic things , but at the end every show has to end which equals death because this is how every human is you live then you die , weâ€™re created to have choices and think of what to do and what not to do , weâ€™re on this earth to go through experience, but the catch is that you make your own experience you make your own choices, life is nothing but a game ; you have to go through stages and levels and beat things and go through problems but the catch is that after every experience youâ€™ll be awarded, doesnâ€™t always have to be a big award but it still counts as an award , learn from your mistakes and teach people what you know because our goal on this planet is to survive, life is a piece of shit I get trust me I might be not that old but Iâ€™ve been through things that taught me well I turned my mistakes to Greats , I didnâ€™t stop trying no matter how hard life hit me , weâ€™re all humans no matter how good or bad we are but we chose the path that we want to go through , loneliness leads to madness, surround yourself with people that you care about and love even if they donâ€™t share the same feeling , if you donâ€™t have anyone that cares about you or you donâ€™t seem to care about anyone , leave your bubble and see people and get to know them , because the more people you meet the more wisdom you gain , think of it like youâ€™re in a apple trees field , you need to be out there and picking apples from the trees , the apple represents knowledge and wisdom and love , the more you gather the better of a person you become , with all the love and appreciation I hope you become the best version of you sooner or later
