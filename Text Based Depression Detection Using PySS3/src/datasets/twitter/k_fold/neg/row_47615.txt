I worried about my friend...Hello reddit. My friend told me about some of their suicidal attempts from the past month and I sent them a message a few hours ago. I haven't heard back which albeit isn't unusual but if I haven't heard back in a few days I think I want to do something. I'm not close with any of his relatives and they don't particularly like me but I *am* concerned. Please give me advice. I don't know what the best course of action is.
