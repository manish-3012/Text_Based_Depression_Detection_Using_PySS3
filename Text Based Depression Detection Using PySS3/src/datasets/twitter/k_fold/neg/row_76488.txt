It gets better? When?Today we saw an article about a kid posting an "it gets better" you tube video killing himself.  The overwhelming reddit reaction was homophobic and hateful.  Right now I'm listening to the person I loved more than anyone make love to someone else in the next room.  
I've held on for almost 40 years thinking it'll get better, or that I owe my family something, but in the end I'm just a paycheck.  It's hasn't gotten better.  I want it to. But the last few years I keep checking my life insurance policy and trying to think of ways to make it look like an accident.  
And I hate myself for posting this where so many 15-20 yo kids might see it when they still have a chance to be happy.
