No more, not anymoreIf you seen my other posts on here you are probably sick of my whining. I have suffered for so long and hurt myself as a way to release the strong energy ordering me to end it all ,but that's only temporary. This energy was to strong for me the other night and I attempted but I failed and I was a coward...I just want it to be quick and mostly painless, at least then the world will be rid of me and me of it, and I can see my puppy again.
