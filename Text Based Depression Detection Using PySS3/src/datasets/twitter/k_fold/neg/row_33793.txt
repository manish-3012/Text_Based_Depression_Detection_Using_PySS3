I really don't have any further interest in trying...I've posted here before. I've both stepped back from the edge or attempted to kill myself only to fail. Whether that's because of some internalised survival instinct or just my own incompetence is just conjecture, really.

What's important is that I don't want to do this anymore. I'm sick of my nightmares, sick of my complete lack of self-worth, sick of defining myself by my complete lack of achievements, sick of making life harder for my friends...and I know that they wouldn't ever admit it, but I do. I'm jealous and standoffish and downright clingy a lot of the time. I care about them, and that's why I have to go. It'll make life better for them in the long-run, and it'll stop my dad from tormenting me. He's been dead for years, but I still dream about him, still hear him. I'm sick of trying to beat PTSD and depression. I can't see the purpose. I won't trust folks. They're dangerous. Everyone's dangerous.

I don't know what to do or how to make a clean job of it. I don't want to traumatise anyone else. It'll be better in the long run, I promise.
