2 days in and I hate high schoolEdit: I hate high school again, am grade 11 (16M)


Taking a couple classes a year ahead, got fucked on my schedule so I have to go to summer school to take courses I would be taking this year. Called a nerd and a loser by almost everyone who sees my schedule. Need a reason to keep going, I almost did it last new years but friends invited me to hang out with them. Really low right now and nobody knows, help please.
