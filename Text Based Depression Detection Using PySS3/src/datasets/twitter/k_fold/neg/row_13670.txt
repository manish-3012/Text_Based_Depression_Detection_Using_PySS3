A note.I have never been truthful or hardworking . If I could go back and change everything I would. Im sorry I failed as a son and a brother to my sibling. I always thought I was gifted at academics so I took everything for granted.

It wasnt soon later I lost my path in both life and in god. I buried myself with drinks and games. Even though people at work saw me as hardworking and friendly , the dark thoughts never went away. As I kept it all inside of me from all these years , I felt tired from the burden . I wanted to be free. Every day is a struggle . 

After all the years, I finally confided in someone who is amazing and gorgeous but has her fair shair of problems too. I promised to be by her side. It felt like a dream, but i never stopped thinking if someone like me deserve some form of happiness..
