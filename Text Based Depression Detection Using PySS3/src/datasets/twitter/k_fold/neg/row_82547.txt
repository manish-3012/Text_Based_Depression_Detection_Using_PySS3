I'm really missing someoneI know I post on here a lot, my mind keeps taking me to these dark places. I'm trying my best, I really am. But I was hit with overwhelming sadness. I miss someone who used to be a friend of mine. It's a long story, but the brief part was that we both wanted different things. Am I sad.... fuck yes.... but I'm also mad. I'm so mad and sad and I pretend I'm over it. I used to write music to get through a lot of these difficult situations but it's been over a year since I've wrote a song. Every time I put he pen to the paper my mind immediately fogs up and I get tounge tied and don't know what to say. And I should, because this person has dragged me through hell.... but yet I fucking miss them...... I'm such a dumbass.
