My dog saved my life.Monday was the end of it. I was ready. I came home from the bar and sat outside with my dog and a razor blade. I was drunk but I was calm and ready. 

I called everyone I could think of before I did it. I donâ€™t know why. No one answered anyway, it was so late. I started the task and got pretty far into it. Maggie, my dog, was out sniffing around the side of the house when she suddenly came running out of the darkness and knocked the blade out of my hand. I was annoyed and went to pick it up but she jumped into my lap, pinning me against the chair with her huge body and shoved her face into my neck. At that point I lost it and held her while I sobbed. 

I cleaned up and went to bed. She hasnâ€™t left my side since.
