Just as depressed as before, and now the money is gone.It's all gone. I burned through almost $30,000 in a year.  I haven't had a paycheck in 11 months. I tried getting a job a few times.  They are all scams, directly or indirectly.  

The depression never went away.  I never got better.  The only thing keeping me alive was the money.  When things got really bad, I could go to the diner for a meal, or take a girl out on a date. The smallest things.

Now it's gone.  I checked my bank account.  I have $150 to my name.  Minus the rent that's due next week, the insurance, cell phone, medical, and other bills that are overdue.  The student loans I've probably defaulted on.  My gas tank is 1/4 full, filling it will be like $65.  My other outlet, driving, now a luxury I cannot afford.

I fought with the girl I think I love all afternoon on the phone.  She treats me like shit, but she's miserable too, so I guess I can't blame her.  I do love her sometimes though.  But it's not worth it.  I barely have the energy to sit up, type, anything.  My body has atrophied and I look like shit.

I hope I find the courage to kill myself before I get evicted.  I would at least like the dignity of dying indoors, and not in the gutter.  I won't though. I won't.
