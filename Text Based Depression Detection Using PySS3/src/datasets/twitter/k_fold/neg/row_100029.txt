The idea sometimes pops into my head when I'm alone with my thoughts and Im scared because it sounds like a nice ideaSometimes when Im alone by myself at home or when I'm driving I get the idea to kill myself and what holds me back is knowing the disappointment from my family and from God. But when this happens I will spend a good amount of time thinking about ways that I could do it. I could just drive off this bridge right now, or I could go draw a hot bath and lay down with a razor. Ill start picturing it playing out and it sounds nice.


This happens to me a few times per month and only when things are calm (Im not at work or class). I feel like the only thing I have to live for is obligations. I have an obligation to my family and to God not to kill myself but there is nothing inside me that wants to live for anything selfish. There is nothing here for me but I'm obligated to stay, and it just sucks.


I'm probably just being dramatic but I feel like if I just had friends to hang out with that actually wanted to hang out and do stuff with me or a girlfriend it wouldnt be like this. Im middle aged and my life still just consists of smoking weed and playing videogames. Im a college student but even with that I have no sense of purpose or enrichment or fulfilment. I sometimes feel like Im an actor playing a role in a show that is my life but Im actually something more than this person, and this person bores and disappoints me.


I also occasionally have very violent images flash in my mind and its always something to do with a family member and it makes me feel awful. I could go into detail but Ill just say that its like going about your daily life and then all of a sudden I imagine something like this that honestly makes me want to cry. Ive never told anyone about this. 


I was driving home from work tonight and this happened pretty hard where I started thinking about things. I thought if I put my feelings and thoughts on reddit that it might help me. I'm not looking for sympathy or a friend, or anything. I guess I just want to accomplish something and have a sense of worth, and also have a social life. Thanks reddit.
