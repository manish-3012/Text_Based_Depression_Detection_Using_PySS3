Seeking urgent help.I been having the thoughts of giving up for a month now. and it all started off because of this girl,

she tend to create pointless things that leads into an argument between us because we were together.  
day by day there's always an argument from her. but when i try to let go.. she threatens me.

she is never honest about herself even when i am, our relationship was really toxic and the toxicity all came from her, and it brought me down a lot..

I have been crying for 2 months now and don't know what can i do to be happy anymore when she's the one being suicidal too. threatening me at the same time.

I don't know her in real life, so our relationship was online and we were on a long-distance relationship, she can never stop lying about herself.  
never ever honest about how she feels. and it all affects me i don't know why?

I haven't done anything like self-harm to myself, but she did and she's lying that she did not.. should i call the authorities? i'm not in the right state of mind to think properly on what should i do.  
i do hope the world can help me before i go any lower..

even if i call the authorities what am i even suppose to say? and is it going to be anonymous?  
I only know where her uni is, even tho she just graduated recently. and her full name, and her phone number. will this help the authorities?  


and even if i did call, i'm shivering too much to even hold my phone properly or speak up. so please help me..
