I just want to leave and never come back.I'm sitting at work, trying not to cry because I don't want to be here anymore. I'm trying not to let my depression get the best of me but I'm slowly losing this battle. I feel like a failure and that I let everyone down.

I'm actually sitting at work thinking about how should I end my life. I can't concentrate anymore. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for awhile now and even been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility (it didn't help).
