Tonight is the night.I can't do this any more. I have ultimately realised that there is no point to life, I had told myself I was going to give myself time to heal but the pain is too much. When you really think about it, we are just animals who will never be able to comprehend why we are here or what is our purpose. I understand you can find meaning in just that and enjoy the journey for what it is. But when you are poor and have fucked up your life as much as I have and even just waking up is a struggle, I really see no point in carrying on when all you feel is pain and suffering. I have found a sense of peace from knowing the end is near and I know it is the right thing to do.  


I have a plan. I'm gonna head down to my favourite spot from when I was a kid - on the beach banks overlooking the sea. I'll take a few beers down, take in my last moments and work up the courage to throw myself off the cliff. Who knows, maybe it isn't the end but if it is, I'm cool with that.
