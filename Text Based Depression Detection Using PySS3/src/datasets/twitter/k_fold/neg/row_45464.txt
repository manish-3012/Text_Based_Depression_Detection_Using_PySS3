I want to kill myself because Iâ€™m a shitty personI am a toxic person, I am mentally ill and itâ€™s caused me to act poorly to my friends. I have issues with my personality and I am obsessed with avoiding judgment. I have backstabbed many (metaphorically). Itâ€™s caused other people immense pain and depression. I want to just off myself so I donâ€™t harm anyone else. I canâ€™t say Iâ€™ll never backstab anyone again. I donâ€™t know if I have a disorder. I have OCD and depression. But why is my personality so out of control? I canâ€™t get therapy Iâ€™m hopeless
