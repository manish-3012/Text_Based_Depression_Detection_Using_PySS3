I have to scream to get anyoneâ€™s attentionThey donâ€™t listen. They donâ€™t look at me. Iâ€™m not funny enough or smart enough or attractive enough so I pry my way into their peripheral vision inching closer and closer until they say. SHUT THE FUCK UP! That feeling what is it. They talked to me. Am I happy, or just an addict.
I donâ€™t know but it feels good
