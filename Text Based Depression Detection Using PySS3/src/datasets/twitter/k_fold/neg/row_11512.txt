GreyI just donâ€™t really care anymore. I used to get very depressed/manic depending on the situation, but now Iâ€™m just floating through the days. Recent bad decisions have left me unemployed and having to move back to my parents place. Racked up a bit over 20 grand in credit card debt. Yet, none of this matters to me.

Overall, Iâ€™ve got a lot of loving people in my life and in general feel comfortable with who I am. Things have been clearer in the past year than they have been in a long time. Yet my drive is gone. I have no desire to fix this situation or get back on the horse.

Basically just go throughout my day avoiding responsibilities and my problems. The only bright parts of my days are heading to the gym or riding my motorcycle. Things arenâ€™t hopeless, but I just fell...exhausted. Disinterested.

My birthday is on Monday and honestly. I just wish to spend it alone. Iâ€™ve often thought about how that might be a good look on a tombstone. Starting and ending on the same date. I really donâ€™t want to bring any pain to my friends and loved ones, but I also feel ready to move onto the next step of the journey.
