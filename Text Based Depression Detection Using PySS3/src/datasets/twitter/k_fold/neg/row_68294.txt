Not sure if this is the right sub for it but...I'm really suicidal. I'm not really depressed. My life is pretty alright, except that I'm nearing the end of college and I still don't know for sure what to do next. I'm keeping well. But one big thing bothers me. 

Death. 

I feel like I can't die. I've put myself in various near death situations but nothing came about it. In fact, I've survived a lot of incidents without anything larger than bruising. I contacted dengue two years ago, but it wasn't dangerous. Specially ever since then, I've been wanting to actually go and just forcibly end my life. Every second thought revolves around that. I'm walking the street and imagining a car crashes into me, etc. I just can't shake this feeling. Like there is something beyond this life of mine. That I'm different from everyone else. And with each passing day I feel more and more tempted to try and see.

I need help, but in what sense?
