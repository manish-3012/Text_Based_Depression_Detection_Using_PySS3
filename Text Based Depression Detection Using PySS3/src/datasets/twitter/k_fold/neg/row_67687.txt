Finding myself alone in bad placeHey! I guess I'm just gonna spill my story here, you don't have to read it, it's no big deal :) I feel like my head will explode if I don't put this out tho

My life has always kinda sucked, not that it was too bad tho. People have it immensly worse then me so I really have nothing to complain about. I always had a roof on my head, a family and all that. 

But I was always the weird kid. I never fit in, I was overly emotional and loud and the odd one out. Of course I was an easy target for bullying. But that was life everyone told me high school would be better.

Of course high school was mostly more of the same except for the fact that I found some "friends". I say this in quotes because I was never truly apart of the group. Unless I planned something I wasn't invited, I was always forgotten about and just left out. 

In my senior year I got really close to some people in my group of friends and even though it was some of the best days of my life it was also some of the most toxic. We just encouraged each other's depressed feelings and made each other feel worse. I never told any of them about my suicide attempt during that time. It was the attempt that made me rethink my life and try to turn it around.

I was happier, a bit better and finding things I liked. Of course I was lonlier then I've ever been but I was confident in myself and okay with the person I am. I started to come on here a lot to try to help people out, wanting them to feel better. It made me feel like I had a purpose, even if it may have been insignificant 

Now I'm just in a complete spiral of depression. I'm over life I'm done with it. I have no future I have no one I have nothing. I just feel like sitting down writing a long note and ending it :( 

Maybe I'm coming off melodramatic, maybe I'm just numb to everything. I don't know, I need someone to talk to in a world where I have no one. I can't keep doing this :(
