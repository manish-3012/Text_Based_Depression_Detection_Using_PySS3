I just don't really care about living.I am not overly sad, apart from in a few fleeting moments or flashes of sadness. Perhaps the anxiety bothers me more than anything else, this constant festering fear of the unknown. Looking back at past traumas and being able to so clearly see how they have manifested. I don't care about living a regular life, college, job, family. None of that really appeals to me at all, If I can't be great and have a remarkable life than I don't think I want one at all.
