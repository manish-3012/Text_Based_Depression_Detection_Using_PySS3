First Time Crying In 8 YearsThis is the first time Iâ€™ve ever expressed to anyone my intense suicidal ideations beyond the normal talks of depression with my therapist without any mention of such(Iâ€™m afraid of mental hospital and the social implications of attending them). Currently Iâ€™m gonna fail out of college(see depression and itâ€™s impact on motivation) and I think Iâ€™ve reached my limit. My mental health is close to the worst itâ€™s been in the past 3 years and I honestly have no idea how Iâ€™m gonna make it through the next few months without killing myself. With winter approaching and the additional effects of SAD looming over me I feel itâ€™s better to try and succeed now then go through the unnecessary pain that will undoubtedly follow. My decision is practically made and I really donâ€™t care about myself at this point but Iâ€™m worried about the effects itâ€™ll have on my friends and family, especially if I fail. This is why I took my time with this to prepare and to hopefully get it right. After the realization of what I was thinking about doing over the past two weeks finally hit me today when I broke down and cried for the first time since my dog died when I was 11. This time though from what I can compare of the experiences, the crying felt almost hollow and maybe more of a relief. Anyway I think tomorrow is my best bet to commit as itâ€™s right before thanksgiving and after time with family I know Iâ€™ll have no energy and drive to do anything meaningful. I feel myself really slipping already and I think Iâ€™m about mentally prepared to follow through. Goodbye I guess, Iâ€™m not quite sure why Iâ€™m writing this (donâ€™t say itâ€™s because you want to live deep down) but itâ€™s kinda funny to me now that the first and last time I reached out will be the same, as that would truly be something Iâ€™d do. Peace and gl everybody else in their struggles.
