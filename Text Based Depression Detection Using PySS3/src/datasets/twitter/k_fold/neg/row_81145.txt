I'm a cowardHey, I just really wanted to talk with someone anonymously. I've been thinking about killing myself for a while now, but I'm so afraid to let anyone know that something's wrong. I can't do anything right, and even though I keep telling myself that killing myself is the selfish thing to do, and that I'm only going to hurt the people I care about more, it just seems more and more appealing. I just want it all to go away. I fantasize about finding a way to kill myself that looks like an accident. I figure that if they don't know, they'll be sad for a while, but they'll move on with their lives--it couldn't be helped, after all. I'd do it tomorrow if I didn't know my sister would blame herself, and I've caused her so much trouble already. And really they'd be much better off without me. But it's getting really hard. I've been thinking about overdosing on acetaminophen. I've heard it's pretty common for people to do it by accident, by taking different drugs that all contain some, like cough medicine along with pain killers. I just pretend to be sick, take a little to much, and whoops, liver failure. I'm such a fucking coward I can't stand it. I know I should ask for help, but I'm sure that will only make things worse.
