I'm doneI can't even handle a part-time job with minimal responsibilities. All I can focus on are the voices in my head telling me that I'm the most worthless piece of sub-human crap to ever live and that I deserve to be tortured in the worst way possible until I die. I'm really close to doing something that will destroy me.
