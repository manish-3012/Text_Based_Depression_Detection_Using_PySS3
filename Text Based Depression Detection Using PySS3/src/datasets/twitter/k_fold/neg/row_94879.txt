I think that's itI don't know how to put it. I'm thinking about justof blood pressure pills my dad takes and just go to sleep and not wake up. I don't if that's how it'll work, but I know for a fact that if I OD on those I'll die. I can't bear the thought of having to go to yet another Christmas party and have to smile and be happy like I'm fine and it's all swell in my life.
