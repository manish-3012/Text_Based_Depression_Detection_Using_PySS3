Gonna be real. I want to be dead. Badly. Scared to talk to my therapist.Not surprising. I'm just living day by day. I don't know when it's going to be my last. I feel like I'm always on edge. I can't get it out of my head. It's something I've been dealing with for a long time. It's exhausting. I keep waking up wondering what I'm still doing here. I don't care about myself anymore. Just feel like life isn't worth living if you can't enjoy it. Tired of thinking of suicide. I hate myself a lot.
