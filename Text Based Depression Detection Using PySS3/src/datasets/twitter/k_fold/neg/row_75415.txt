It's Christmas day and I feel like slitting my wrists.The bar is higher than ever for me to be the 'perfect child' one who isn't sad or tired most of the time. The kind of girl who would without hesitation help anyone; I'm absolutely sick of it. This was just a rant to get it off my chest so sorry if you stopped to read this.
