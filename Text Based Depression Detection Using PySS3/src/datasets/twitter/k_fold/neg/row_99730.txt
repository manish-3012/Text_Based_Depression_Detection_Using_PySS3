I dont know if i can resist it anymoreI am suicidal. I hate myself more than i could hate anyone else. The one person that i gave my all for ripped my heart clean from my chest. They took my spirit, they took my happiness, and unknowingly, they took the last shred of my will to live. I don't know how much longer i can do this. I had been cutting for a long time and had stopped for a bit recently, but yesterday i cut up my entire left arm. No one cares about me enough to notice, let alone to listen to me. I am just so lost. As i sat on the bathtub using a dull knife to carve into my arm i sat and thought about where i went wrong. I used to be so driven, so happy. Now i walk through each day in complacency, hoping for it to be my last. Im not sure if i could ever follow through with ending the pain for good. The only few people that have ever seem to give a fuck about me have been people i have met on reddit. So i thank you strangers for your kind words.
