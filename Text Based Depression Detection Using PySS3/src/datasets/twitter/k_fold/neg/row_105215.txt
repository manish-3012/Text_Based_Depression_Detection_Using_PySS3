Nothingâ€™s worked for me and I donâ€™t know what to doI donâ€™t know what to do anymore and Iâ€™m tired of trying. I have been dealing with depression, severe panic attacks, BPD, agoraphobia, and a couple of other phobias that impact my life, and I havenâ€™t found any relief in what is now almost 18 years. I have no energy and I cannot function or support myself...I rely entirely on my parents and SO. Everything I have done to try and better myself has blown up in my face; the past year has been especially difficult. One shitty thing after another keeps happening, and itâ€™s all been out of my control. I started self-harming again, mostly out of anger...I canâ€™t control my emotions very well. Iâ€™ve been to multiple counselors and psychiatrists and gone through multiple types of therapy over the past 16 years, and been on ~20 different types of medication in the last 14 years. Iâ€™ve been in and out of the hospital several times. Nothing has ever helped...I know it sounds silly, but itâ€™s true. Iâ€™ve applied for disability multiple times because I canâ€™t hold down a job, and been denied every time. Iâ€™m too mentally unstable to work and I canâ€™t drive or leave my house alone...I canâ€™t even get out of bed or eat most days. I honestly donâ€™t know what else I can do. I feel like such a burden on the people who care about me, and I feel like Iâ€™ve exhausted all my options. Whatâ€™s the point
