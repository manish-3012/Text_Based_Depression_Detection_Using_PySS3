Please help!So to start this off, it is not a goal for me to commit suicide nor do I think about it. What I'm here for is my cousin. She's been getting bullied at school and just a couple weeks ago I noticed some scars on her wrists from cutting herself. We grew up together so seeing her like this is just killing me. I've talk to her about it a she refuses to tell her parent. Although she has told her councilors at school, none of them have done anything. The problem is, this dickface guy has been saying some pretty rough stuff to her such as, "you're a fat bitch who needs to kill herself", "why don't you just kill yourself?", "stupid fat emo bitch", etc. the list goes on and on about the horrible things this 14 year old scumbag can say. Recently she gave me her razor so she could keep herself from cutting herself. She texted me last night going on about how she regretted giving me her razor and that she was going to kill herself. This completely broke my heart. At such a young age, I don't think she should be going through this. She's such a beautiful loving girl who is just trying to fit in. So my question is, what can I do to help her? Any recommendations as to what she should do to help benefit her life? What should I tell her? Thank you.
