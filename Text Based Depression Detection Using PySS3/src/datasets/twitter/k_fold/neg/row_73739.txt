Trigger warningI relapsed, sort of. I scratched myself. My dad upset me so much i hit my head a lot and pulled out hair. My heads throbbing. Im a stupid retard. He said hes starting not to love me. That its my fault. Im only here because he loves me. Then he says he works and supports me because he loves me. Then why does he have to be mean.  I feel like im being gaslit. Im doubting myself so bad

Ive callen ot for help so many times these past two years. My whole family feels its routine for me to go to the ward. That i wont be able to kill myself. I always fail in doing it. But they should care that i tried. 

Hes making me feel like im just being a brat and getting upset from being scolded. I cant do this. Im looking for more ways to hurt myself. Its my fault its my fault its all my fault im lazy selfish know it all obese lazy stupid ugly everyone whos hurt me is right. 

He laughed when i hit myself he laughed he laughed months ago when i told him i made myself throw up he laughs everytime i relapse and ask for help this is a fucking game for him im a fucking joke

Im sorry for dumping this on you guys. I just need someone to say its gunna be ok.
