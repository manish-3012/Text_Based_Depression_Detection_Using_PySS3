Title, title, what difference does it make?Humans are most likely fucked. I hear it every day. Do you think most realistic speculations put us at the top? No.

I am really drunk. I know I should not be..but I am. 

I was not there for my friend. I let my phone run out of minutes...and her fucking father died. I contacted her today, to let her know what happened, and she told me her dad died like it was nothing. She said, "I'm on my way to cremate my dad, call me back later." I know by the way that she told me that...I let her down. I AM SUCH A SELFISH PIECE OF SHIT. I have been feeling down, nothing but suicide on my mind, when someone really needed me....and IW AS NOT THERE.  what other evidence do I need? I am fucked. I am so sorry Rachel. I am soo sorry. 

I can't stop crying. I don't know what to do...but the thoughts remain. They do not stop. I can't stop them.

I will probably sleep and forget all of this guilt...but the thoughts are still there. I still plan to hang myself on the 10th. I am sorry for being so...upsetting. I apologize to all of you that I have let down. I am sorry for everything. I can't do anything but cause pain to other people. If I was not there, then maybe they would have searched and found another person, a person who would have been there when they needed them the most. I am so sorry.
