A dear friend is almost constantly on the brink, and will only talk to me about it. Reddit, what do I do?!A good friend of mine has struggled his whole life with feeling inadequate. He doesn't have many friends, he has Asperger's Syndrome which makes it hard for him to interact with many people, especially the people around here. A few months ago he told me about his desire to end it. I was shocked, and talked him down from doing anything drastic at the time, but now he's starting to get worse again. I need help, he won't speak to anyone else about it, especially not his parents (he's Catholic, so suicide = hell). His biggest concern is that he doesn't fit in and doesn't have many friends, how can I show him there's more to live for? He's 17 and a junior in high school.
