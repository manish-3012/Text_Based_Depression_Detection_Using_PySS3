why am I still here?I am legit confused on why I haven't killed myself yet. I told myself if I am still unemployed human scum by the time I turn 23 I would kill myself. yet here I am 2 days before my 23rd birthday with no follow through on any of my suicide plans. I am legit confused. this is like going to a party and staying at the place after everyone has left.
