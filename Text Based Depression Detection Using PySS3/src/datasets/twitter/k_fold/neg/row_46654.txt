Hopeless.I have no idea what to do anymore. I am 18 years old and I dropped out of college after 2 weeks.  I basically fucked myself at my job saying I was moving to another state, my last day is very near and I have no idea how I will be able to make rent when I move. I have no one to talk to. My mom and sister say they care about me and love me but ever since my last girlfriend I haven't been able to trust a soul...

 My coworkers dislike me because I am very quiet and awkward. I don't see myself living past 20. I always think I need help but have no intention of getting it because I cannot trust anyone. I only feel like posting here because of a throwaway account...

 I haven't even heard of this subreddit until tonight. I have been very suicidal as of recent. I have no friends outside of some gaming friends but they only can help so much. 

I just don't see my ugly pathetic self with anyone any day. Death hasn't scared me for the past couple months. I am mostly waiting for a natural death soon because I am Lutheran and I don't want to commit suicide and go to Hell even though I know I am going there anyway.

My mom is getting really nervous about me not communicating with the rest of the world, I'm just holsterd up in my room and never leave aside from work. I keep telling her I am fine even though I know I have extreme depression.
