The thought of my hanging body sounds so peaceful.No more stress, loneliness, self hatred, crying in my bed silently. Me being a corpse is better for the world. Eternal sleep or possibly a peaceful afterlife, either way I find great. I can die knowing I wasn't worth anything anyway. It really does comfort me and make me feel happy, and it feels like it would be a good deed.
