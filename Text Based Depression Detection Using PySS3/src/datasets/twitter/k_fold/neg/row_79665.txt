Depressed, alone, with my parents, and my mum wants to slap me for being depressed.Spending New Years Day alone with my family. 2019 has been the worst year in my life. I've been through a lot of bad times, although there were positives, it's all overshadowed by negatives. My mum in particular when she sees me depressed, she threatens to hurt me to get me to change my mood.

2020 is likely going to be my final year here, the thing is, everyone will suddenly care when I die when they don't while I'm alive!
