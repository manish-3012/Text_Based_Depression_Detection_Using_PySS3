Ready to die in a holeEvery time I think I'm going to turn a corner and get my life together, I fail. And yes, I know recovering from depression, anxiety, health issues, etc... takes time and there are stumbles along the way but fuck this, man. I have literally gone through the path, fallen, picked myself up, and made it to my goal of a healthy weight rather than overweight just to fail twice as hard. I am now obese as per my BMI and I fucking hate myself. I'm working on eating healthier: nutritious foods that still keep me satiated so I don't starve and binge. Working out, as much as I can fit in. 

But it's so hard knowing that I've gone through 2 "successful" weight loss journeys only to end up gaining back more than I was at my previous starting weight. I know the problem must actually be mental since I have already shown the physical ability to lose weight. It's something I can't put my finger on. I have a psychiatrist, therapist, am on an anxiety med, but I still can't fucking figure out what's wrong with me. As a female POC, finding a therapist who is still accepting clients, has time slots/physical location that I can reach, and who won't brush aside my experiences with racism and sexism has proven incredibly difficult.

I can't even cry right now about how much I hate myself. I'm numb. Yes, I'm in college, I go to a good school with a decent engineering major, Dean's List, internships, blah blah blah. I can't see how it bloody matters anymore. Nothing matters. I don't want to trigger anyone so I won't name it, but there are a couple of relatively easy ways I could die despite being the coward I am and right now, those are looking like pretty solid options.

I wasn't mean to be born. I was born with a 1 in 3 million vein malformation that could have led to cardiac arrest, but didn't. My parents had 7 failed IVF cycles but I was somehow still born naturally. I've been suicidal for 9 years but haven't gone through with it yet.

 Some may say this is a sign that I'm meant to live despite difficulties. Others will remind me how good I have it, and trust me,I know. That's what makes it worse: knowing that I can't just be fucking grateful and live my goddamned life. 

Jesus. The world is so cruel. People living with chronic diseases who want to live but are taken too soon. People like me who want to die, and could have died/not been born easily, but still drag our feet every day. I won't even get into politics and the current climate in the US and other locations, with police brutality and the protests. And then we have the lovely COVID-19. Jesus.

Fuck. I don't really expect anyone will read this, it's too fucking long and pathetic, just like my existence. I don't expect anyone here to fix me. If you did somehow make it to the end of this post, I appreciate you. Unfortunately, I'm an only child and my parents would be devastated if I die. I've been saying for years I just gotta wait for them to pass so I can kill myself; they're in their early and late 50s, so maybe I won't have to hang on more than a couple decades.
