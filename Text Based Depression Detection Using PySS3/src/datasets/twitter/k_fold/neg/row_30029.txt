Give me a reason not to kill myself that isn't empty bullshit."It doesn't matter that nobody likes you, I like you!" no you don't, you've never met me, you have no clue who I am, neither do I know you. "Things will get better! everybody has their time!" That's bullshit, I'm 18 and my life has been the same thing since I was 12. You're not the first to tell me that. "Seek a therapist!" I have. They just tell empty lives that do nothing but perhaps postpone my feelings. 

All the kids at my school have it so good. They have friends who talk to them and invite them to hang out, they have girlfriends who love them, they travel with their parents to places and spend time together, they look fit, they get good grades... I could try to make you feel sorry for me, but I don't care. Those are the things I want, but all I have is my fat self, my bed and my parents who I guess love me but barely even talk to me and all they do is fight. 

I'm sick of all this fake inspirational bullshit. Give me a reason why I'll eventually get what I want. Give me a fucking reason not to shoot myself right now.
