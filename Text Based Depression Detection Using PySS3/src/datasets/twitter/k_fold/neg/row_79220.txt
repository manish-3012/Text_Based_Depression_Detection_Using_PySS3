How long do i hold on to hope?I do plan on killing myself i set an expiration date on my self for 25 i am 24 the time is getting close. I told myself i wouldnt if i had one thing in my life worth living for.  Finally something looked up i got a girl who made me feel like i could be a better me but fate decided to piss on me,  she broke up with because she needed time to think about what she wanted and she thinks she got into a relationship to fast after her l last break up. I can't blame her but what hurts the most about it the night before she said she loved me and wished me a good night.  Then the next morning she broke up with me.  It tore me apart inside.  I had the  good thing, i had it.  The worst part is i blame myself i have always blamed my self for everything. So now I sit here and hope she takes me back because i have nothing left to live for. So i need to know how long do i wait? How long do i suffer this pain of hope?
