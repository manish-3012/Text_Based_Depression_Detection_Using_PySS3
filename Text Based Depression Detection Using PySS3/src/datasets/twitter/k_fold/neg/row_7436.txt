Im worried about my friend but she doesenÂ´t answer my texts 

I  have a friend that lives in russia and we talked very often, almost  everytime our timezones allowed it, and one day she was gone. she didnt  answer any texts, I left her some 6 texts asking if she was ok or if she  was angry at me or something

Time  passes and I write her on instagram telling her that I was sorry if I  made her unconfortable or something. she answers and tell me that she is  sorry that she is gone but she is depressed and doesent want to talk to  nobody, IÂ´ve had my episodes of depression and I know how much that  sucks, so I told her that I was worried about her and I tried to give  her some advice, It has been 2 days of not hearing about her, last time  we talked she told me that she cuts herself

I  leave her one message every day telling her that Im here for her if she  needs anything, I saw a history about a girl that killed herself and I  started to worry like crazy, I left her a message that it is ok if she  doesent want to talk to nobody, but that she at least tell me that she  is ok

Am I An Asshole if I keep leaving her a message a day telling her that she is not alone and that She can talk to me?
