Had great help on /r/askreddit, but got told to submit here. Im, 23, male. I've got a shitty job, in which i get minimum wage, i have Â£3200 on my credit card, i have Â£10,000 student loans (i got a 2:2 degree) i have no girlfriend, i've been genuinely in love once, but it went to shit, i'm currently in love with one of my closest friends but she thinks we're just friends, even though sometimes we sleep together, have sex etc... It kills me thinking about her with other guys past and present. All i want is things to be what i want with me and her. When i drive to work, sometimes i think about driving on the wrong side of the road on the motorway. Or walking out in front of cars. I still live at home, i really have a heavy load on my mind. So i ask reddit, what should i do?
Thanks in advance.
Obvs this is a throwaway.
I feel so empty, about to give up and lost.
