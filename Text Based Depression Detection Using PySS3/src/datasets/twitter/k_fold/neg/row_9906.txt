I really need to talk to someone. Please.I just go back from my father's house where my brother was. For the first time in our lives, we (actually just my brother) said to my father we never really liked seeing him, because he was so depressed and that we never really felt his love.

He took it like a bomb and he took it bad. He asked us to leave while crying.

I can't describe how terribly bad I feel right now. I think it's one of the most terrible emotion a human can feel. It's unbelievable.

All of this while hiding to everyone the fact that I have homosexual desires. I've been hiding this a long time. For most of my life, I've been exclusively hetero, but things changed, and now I'm not quite sure what I am. I fear myself, my desires. It's extremely hard.

So, if I could talk to someone. I think reddit is a great community (even though it's millions of people), this place feels good. And if someone could listen (well read) me, I'd be really grateful.

Sorry for my english.

I have not the intention of killing myself, but I don't know where to post this...
