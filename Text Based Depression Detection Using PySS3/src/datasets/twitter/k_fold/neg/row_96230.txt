i dont see a purpose anymoreiâ€™ve tried coming up with things iâ€™m excited about the future, things i want to live through. but i really cant come up with anything and im at the point where nothing matters to me anymore and iâ€™m too fucking tired to do anything about anything. i had someone i could talk to about these thoughts but a week after I opened up to them they stopped talking to me for no apparent reason. thats probably another reason I want to kill myself. no one cares about me as much as they say they do. iâ€™ve been spiraling for a while now and no one has noticed or cared to notice. i just dont see a purpose in living anymore but im too scared of failing when i attempt to do it.
