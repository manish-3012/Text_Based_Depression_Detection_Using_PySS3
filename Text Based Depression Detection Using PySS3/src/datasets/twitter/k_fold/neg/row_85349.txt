I won't do it but I still think about it every waking moment.I've (22F) been closer to committing suicide in the past than I am right now, so I'm sure I won't actually go through with it. Still, I really want to and I can't stop thinking about it. I've struggled with this for a significant portion of my life (since I was 13) to varying degrees of severity. The main reason is pretty simple: I'm lonely. I was extremely isolated as a child, and as a result, I have a tendency to isolate myself as an adult. I know I have no one to blame but myself for my current circumstances, but believe me when I say this, I try to force myself outside of my comfort zone on a daily basis in a vain effort to form connections with others and somehow save my life, but I just don't have the social skills and it's nearly impossible to maintain any lasting friendships. In addition to my efforts to reach out to others irl, I spend time chatting online with horny guys in a pathetic attempt to gain some sense of companionship. I just broke off a four-year relationship and I feel more alone than ever. I have no plans. I'm just sick and tired of waiting around to die and I just want to get it over with already!
