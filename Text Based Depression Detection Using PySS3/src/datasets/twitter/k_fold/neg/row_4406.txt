Why can't I just kill myself NOW?I don't want to talk to anyone, I just want ... ah. I want to die. And I have the plan. But damn it. Waiting so long becomes frustrating.

I want to wait a year. Just to fulfill a stupid dream. But right now ... waiting for that year seems like forever. IÂ´m going to sleep ... maybe I'm lucky and I won't open my eyes in the morning. (:
