i have come to terms with the fact that i will commit suicide in the near future.i've lost all hope i had.

near future can mean anything from 2 days to a year and i have yet to come up with a plan but for some reason knowing that the it will soon be over makes me feel at peace, almost happy. anyone else feel this way...
