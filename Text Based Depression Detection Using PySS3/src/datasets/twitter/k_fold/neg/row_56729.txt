morning depressioni wake up in the morning and i feel as if i donâ€™t have a purpose. i feel this on days i donâ€™t have plans, and even if i did, iâ€™d probably be upset that the plan canâ€™t distract me from day to night. so then iâ€™d be upset during the plan. i hate my depression, itâ€™s more exhausting since i genuinely donâ€™t want to feel this way. i feel all too aware now. i donâ€™t want pills, just that weird TMS thing (which i hope youâ€™ve heard of). my brain is as if itâ€™s a vegateble and a prison.):
