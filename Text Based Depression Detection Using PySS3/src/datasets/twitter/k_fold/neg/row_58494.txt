My dad is encouraging me to kill myselfI've been talking about it all week, and he's sick of hearing me. He's insisting on renting a motel room for me, and I'm taking him up on it. He wanted me gone this morning, but I want one more day at home. 

He knows what's in store. I'm going to be redundant in my methods, and this won't be fucked up like everything else.
