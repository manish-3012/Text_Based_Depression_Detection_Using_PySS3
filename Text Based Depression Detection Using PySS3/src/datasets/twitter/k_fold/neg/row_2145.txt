The ultimate control move?Bipolar takes away any positive control I could possibly have.  The only control I have left is negative.  I chose to abuse substances, skip meds, stay awake 2+ days in a row, and not do the things I know should be done.  The possibility of being stable scares me so much that I would rather be bipolar.  At least that would be a choice.  That or kill myself.  There really is no bigger way to exert control than ending a life, be it yours or someone else's.  I really cant take being bipolar or being stable, or any of my other issues.  Guess I'll die?
