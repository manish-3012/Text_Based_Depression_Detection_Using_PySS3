Really glad I have bipolar!I must say it is simply amazing to have a mental illness that canâ€™t be cured, gets worse over time and is extremely treatment resistant!

Even better, when I feel better itâ€™s just a lie! Surprise! Depression! Good thing every thing youâ€™ve done to improve yourself goes out the window, just a nice â€œtestingâ€ for ya.

Oh and canâ€™t forget the meds, they say theyâ€™ll help, but really they just give you a crap ton of side effects! Really you only take them to hope you donâ€™t go into a destructive mania that hurts not only your finances, makes you lose your job and ruin your relationships, hurts those around you and just in general fucks everything up. At least you hope it doesnâ€™t happen again, maybe it will though? Keeps life exciting! 

Glad Iâ€™m completely at the mercy of this disease until Iâ€™m dead! Hope thatâ€™s not too soon!!! ðŸ¤ž
