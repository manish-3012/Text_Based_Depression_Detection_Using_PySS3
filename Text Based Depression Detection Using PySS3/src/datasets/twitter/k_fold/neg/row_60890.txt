Dreams and SuicideTo give some base background information, Iâ€™m on some antipsychoticâ€™s and some sleep med.
Now thatâ€™s out of the way letâ€™s start:

Iâ€™m thinking of suicide a lot, and a large deal of it is because of my sleep cycle and effects on my psyche.
I have really bad nightmares about some of my abuse from one of my exes. She would verbally abuse me, depending on her mood, slap or kick the shit out of me, on a few bad days choke me. 
Waking up from those dreams, Iâ€™m typically out of breath. And from that, resulting panic attacks.

Whatâ€™s worse is I have been in this spiral. Suicide is constantly on my mind. Itâ€™s a miracle I havenâ€™t relapsed back into cutting. Itâ€™s hard to live dreaming of her, hearing her. Idk what to do. I havenâ€™t yet because Iâ€™m not sure I would succeed, and I donâ€™t really want to be hospitalized, and then go back to the mental house. Itâ€™s mostly centrum, maybe 40, and some allergy meds, maybe15 I havenâ€™t counted. A lot.
Idk. I just feel so lost. 
Lifeâ€™s not worth living in this cycle.
I donâ€™t know what to do.
I donâ€™t have anything to do in this break from school.
Sorry. Thatâ€™s it.
