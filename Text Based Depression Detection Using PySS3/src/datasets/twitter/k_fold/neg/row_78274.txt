My last year.I plan on killing myself before the end of this year. Thought i was starting to feel better, but i feel worse than before. Slowly deleting my social media accounts so friends and family won't notice and that way they aren't there when I'm gone. I also hope it prevents any of my friends from finding out. I want their last memory of me to be something good not that i killed myself. Hoping they'll just forget about me as time goes on. I think i might wait a little into early next year because i don't wanna ruin Christmas and we're moving soon so just think it'll be better to wait.
