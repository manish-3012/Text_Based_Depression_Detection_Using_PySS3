Everyone and everything around me seems dead already. I don't see why I don't assimilate myself. My grandmother has cancer, and I get panic attacks every time I think about her. My grandfather almost bled to death this week when an artery burst, and would have died if he hadn't woken up. I'm a senior in college and don't see anything going anywhere. I'm up at 4 fucking am trying to write a paper and can't make myself do it, even though it's due in eight hours. I'm in a dead-end relationship. My boyfriend is too in love with his work to consider a relationship with me after college. He has lied about it to try to make me feel better and not go insane, but I know what's true. 
I bought fish so I would have someone to talk to. It helped, but now one of them has pop-eye and the other has been so stressed (even though I have tried to hard to maintain good water quality and not overfeed and keep them in a quiet environment) that her eyes have turned black. If they die, I have no one left to talk to. I'm one of those people that people are hoping off themselves I think, since I'm consistently depressed now and can't really consider a happier option.
I wouldn't mind if someone talked to me. 
EDIT: this is my first post on Reddit. I've been lurking for a while.
