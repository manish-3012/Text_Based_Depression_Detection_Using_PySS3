I almost messed up my three most important relationships and definitely relapsedCw: self harm, suicide attempt, prescription drug misuse

I've been doing so good, I'm actually kind of manic rn still, but I hit a bad place tonight... I guess I made a joke a while ago that I dont remember which resulted in a misunderstanding that made my best friend think my husband was hitting on his wife.   I was terrified that I'd ruined both friendships and my marriage and i cut myself for the first time in years (i do self harm but I'm more of a burner than a cutter so this is intense) took twice the max dose of my pills and thought about taking more but I didnt go through with it.  By then my husband got home, he made me text another friend because I was obviously in too bad a place to talk in person though he tried to comfort me, I'm just better at writing.  My other friend told the original friend that I had cut, I didnt tell her the rest.  He reached out after that and getting the whole story from his wife and realizing the misunderstanding.  We all made up but now I'm afraid of my actions and ashamed and I've got big cuts to hide now for the first time in years.
