Dad wants to leave us, mom can't help me, girlfriend left me.So a few months ago my family got into a huge fight. My dad egan packing a suitcase that he still hasn't unpacked, nor does he plan to. He says "I'll just leave it packed in case that happens again this time I'll leave for real" If you are wondering what we got into a fight abouut it's because I came home from school one day crying because the class ring people (forget the company) showed us this one video about how high school is all about the memories you make with all your friends. On my way home I barely managed to keep it together because I really don't have any friends, and I hadn't realized it until then.... I eat alone every day, nobody ever says hi to me, even when I say hi, nobody ever wants to be my partener in a group assignment... I tried talking to my mom about it and she said "Can we talk about this later?" (she says this about everything. One time they were discussing how they were gonna pay for my mom's surgery and appearently the bill was due soon and she said "can we talk about this later?") So then I screamed at her. Her son was on the brink of packing it in and ending his life and she wants to talk about it later. So then my dad yelled at me for screaming at my mom and then I screamed back at him because he isn't proud of me... He wanted me to be a star football player and I ended up being something equally as good, a 15 year old semi-pro CS: GO player. I was making money off of tournaments for playing video games and he was just pissed at me for not playing football. SO then he said "You know what? If you don't want me here then I'll leave." I screamed at him to go. If he thinks abandoning me physically is an option after he already has abandoned me emotionally then I don't want to see him ever again. We've always lived in a household that fights alot. My parents probably don't even love each other, haven't been out on a date probably in 15 years, they don't even sleep together. My mom sleeps in their room and my dad sleeps on the couch down stairs. Then once everything was calm, around 2 in the morning (non school night) I went to go get a snack. I tripped over my dog and fell down the stairs and then my dad woke up and screamed at me for waking him up. He then asked me what I was doing in the first place so I told him I was getting a snack. He then said "You don't need a snack, you're already fat." He then over the course of that argument called me lazy, he called me a pussy because I'm a vegan.... I tried talking to my mom about this and after about 5 minutes I realized that she was just saying whatever she needed to to shut me up. Then later that week I had my girlfriend over. We did all the stuff we normally did... Except this time she broke up with me. I loved her more than anything in this god damn world and she was my only fucking friend. And then she just left. I stopped her on her way out and told her I love her nad she smiled and said "Goodbye Nick". I then came bursting out of my room crying oceans of tears. The only person in this world who really loved me is now gone. I'm alone. I felt empty.... That was last week. We got 2 tickets to the Pokemon Symphonic Evolutions concert that came to our town last night. When it was announced a while back I asked if she would want to go. She was completley excited to go and I started doing odd jobs around my nieghborhood to get the money I needed to get us 2 front (ish) row tickets. For months we were excited to see the music from our favorite game reorchestrated (and we're both in marching band so we love music like this) I just went alone. The entire time I was crying. Months and moths of hard work went in to creating this really amazing night htat should've been a night I remember forever and all I could think about was how alone I am. I considered leaving at intermission but I stayed anyways. I realized I should just have fun before the next tragedy sends me over the edge and I kill myself. Over the past week that she left me I've gotten 3 hours of sleep and I've probably eaten 2 actual meals. I've lost 13 pounds and I feel like I'm just burning from the inside out. Over the course of a week my support system completley collapsed.... Not that there was much there in the first place. I feel 100% worthless. If I were to die, nobody would care. My dad doesn't want me anyway, my mom isn't happy until I stop talking and anyone I might call a friend is gone. I see no reason at all for me to stay. The world might be better off without me, 2 people in my life would sure as hell be happier. It sounds like I'd be doing the world a favor
