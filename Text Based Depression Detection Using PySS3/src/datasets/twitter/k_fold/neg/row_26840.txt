I feel uselessI come from Poland. I came to Germany with my family in 2013. I am 3 years behind with  curriculum in comparison to others. For 2 years I learned the German language and worked illegal because no one would like to hire me part time without skills and language and I wanted to learn language in a school. 
I've always wanted to be an engineer in IT or in something similar. It was always my hobby. I study electrical engineering now but it is way too hard for, all those theoretical aspects. I feel so stupid and useless. I will probably fail my exams. I don't know what I will do then. My family have great expectation from me. They would not accept that I could do a labour work. Those thoughts make even harder to learn anything. Every day is worse. 
I don't have any friends nor girlfriend. Nobody to talk about it.
What should I do?
