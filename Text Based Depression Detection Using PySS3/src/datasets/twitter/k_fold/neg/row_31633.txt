I want out.I was in the middle of writing a massive essay about my life story lmao but it just felt like I was asking for attention. 

I just want to feel normal. Life lacks purpose and thats been really fucking with me lately. I've been severely depressed since year 10 (uk) and always had anxiety issues with both just getting worse and worse. I'm 17, college dropout and cant find a job. I want to die but I don't want to kill myself, I just want it to end, or change but that change just wont happen seeing as it's all caused by some fuck up in the brain. I've went to kill myself many times but I just couldn't jump. I always got too scared lol. Which leaves me feeling like an even bigger failure. I stopped self harming about a year ago but I always look at the scares and urges come back, and recently I've been getting worse again and I'm constantly thinking about burning myself because I'm desperate for some sort of rush. I need to feel alive, I crave constant change in my life and I feel like that's going to end up biting me in the ass. Like I'm probably gonna fuck up so many jobs because I'll get bored or I'll move onto harder drugs just  because I'm bored of the ones I'm doing. 

I just feel like it's all so pointless. Even if I do die at old age I'm just going to get forgotten about in a few years at most so why not end now? I just feel like an empty husk. 

Sorry if this ramble isnt what this sub is about or doesnt make sense I just need to get some shit out there maybe here some opinions or something idek lol
