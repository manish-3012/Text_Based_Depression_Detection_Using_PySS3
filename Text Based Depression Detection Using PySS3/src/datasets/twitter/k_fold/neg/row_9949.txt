32m, Divorced, Depressed, Broke, Sick, and recently diagnosed ADHD which explains my entire life. Why should I not end it all?I'm never going to recover and find a decent job or a loving relationship again. I'm a step from homelessness. If the meds for ADHD don't work I'm killing myself before Christmas.
