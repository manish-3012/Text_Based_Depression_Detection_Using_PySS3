I was abandoned by the people I thought I could trust the day I attempted suicideI still remembered clearly that day. I was alone in my room begging if somebody could hold me back, even with a simple word "don't die", "please stay", but that did not happen. I took all the pills and woke up in the hospital 2 days later. The thing I regret the most is not attempting suicide on that day, but it's the pain of having to deal with everything after that. The explanation, the getting better thing, and it's been more than a year, still I'm taken back to that room occasionally, to remind me of all the pain that push me to do that.
I just want to die, selfishly.
