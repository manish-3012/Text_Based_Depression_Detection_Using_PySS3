Falling back into a relaspe, Not sure what to do this time. Help!Hey, Not sure how to word this, so I'll just throw it out there.

I want to kill myself, to be blunt. And i don't know where to turn to. 

This isn't my first time, For as long as i remember I've been battling depression and anixety, and frequently thought of suicide, but they were just thoughts, intrusive thoughts.
However, early 2017 they became impulses, desires. I got seriously sick, I had to move across the country, and I had little to live for. I came so close, But the company of my online friends kept me on the line, I'm grateful for that, and I felt I was getting better. Still had problems, but life felt worth living.

Until reccently, I had a massive breakdown, I became paranoid, Not to go into details but I became prone to "episodes" where I'd become irrational, I would isolate myself for days, avoiding leaving my house, Not talking to my friends online, it made things worse, the times I did talk to them they'd be pushed away with my paranoia, I became convinced that they were against me, and doing so I think I've lost all their trust, my stability becoming a neausence, I used to be so good at keeping it together, it was like a Switch was turned in my head, Anyway, during my episodes, I had a bit of an incident, and my work had to let me go, and the communties I once stayed in became cold and distant, and now here I am, Jobless and wanting to end it. I can't talk to my friends about it, Because I know they will be tired and stressed with my lack of progress. 

I don't know who to turn too, I feel so alone, I know they were just online friends, but they were all I had. I've called SP, but without relible connections, I don't know how long I can hold on.

Sorry for this post being so patchy, I left out a lot of info, I guess all that matters if that I'm having tendicies again, and none of my friends really know. I don't know what to do.
