What else can I do?For years, my mother has emotionally abused me. 
Called me worthless, useless, fat, waste of space, accident.  I've put up with it, laughed it off.
Then it became physical. 
Hits, slaps, thrown books, scratches.
I pretended they were all accidents.
I've gotten to the point where I can't do that anymore.

I had a piece of fruit earlier. An orange at maybe 2 in the afternoon.
I head down again, and she's waiting. She screeches at me that I've ruined dessert for tomorrow with my grandparents, and that I have just eaten this orange. I try to say that, no, I ate it at 2. I even asked Dad about it. He doesn't remember.
That doesn't help.
I get angry with being called a liar, a cheat, a disgusting daughter. I end up shouting back.
Then she pulls a knife out on me.
In anger I call her something along the lines of a maniac shore and that's when my own father drags me out of the room by my hair and shoves me against the stairs.
Don't call her a whore, he growls.
She pulled a knife on me, I retort.
He threatens to punch me and hopes I call the police so he can tell them how shit I am.

I could overdose so easily. Right here.
I want to I really want to. 
19 years of this and then my own father? 
What the fuck am I meant to do please help I don't know 
I just want to die
I just want to fucking die
