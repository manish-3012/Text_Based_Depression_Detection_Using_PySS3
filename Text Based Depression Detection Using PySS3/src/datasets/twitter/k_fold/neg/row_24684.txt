Why can't everyone stop talking about the near future when I'm trying to kill myself-Never used this subreddit before but feel it's most appropriately suited based on the subject so yeah. -



First of all, family doesn't know I'm suicidal. I'm an a incredibly private person.


 But since this last month I've made a plan on how to kill myself and where it's going to take place but every time I am using my mobile phone whichever family I talk to mentions the near future and this frustrates me because I don't want to hear about the future yet I can't exactly verbalise this to them since they'd ask questions and this is ultimately off-putting.

I want to type more, however, my soul has had enough and I in my head I am wanting to attempt this suicide within the following couple weeks but everytime I talk to my family they mention near future stuff and it annoys me/distracts me and prolongs this. Was going to try it yesterday but I remember I ordered something and didn't want it to be left (I know right. why order something if you are going to try end your life. its weird but that's me for you) Life is so damn empty and full of this void. The thought of trying to commit suicide soon is calming me.
