New Year BluesEvery new year, I tell myself to hold out one more year and list a ton of what-if b.s scanrios. And each year Ive cared less and less to listen myself. 

Have had suicidals thoughts since as far back as I can remember. Not sure why at the age of 8, I would cry for hours and try to suffocate myself with my blanket. 

Its not like I have asked others for help either , like friends and family. It just gets brushed off or when I try to explain how I feel it feels inauthentic and makes me almost laugh. Anyone else?

I've always had this gut feeling, an intution of sorts that I wont live past 25. I just hope its by some freak accident so I wont have my parent feeling guilty. 

Honestly the only reason Im "alive".

Oh well, got that of my chest.
