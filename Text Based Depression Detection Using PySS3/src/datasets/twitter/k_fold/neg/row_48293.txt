I will be happy I didn't do it if I make it through tonightHave such bad social anxiety that I want to kill myself. First time in a long time I've been suicidal. 


Maybe I should've given in and bought more liquor tonight, b/c then I would be too drunk to want to hurt myself. 



Everything form the past few weeks has just compounded upon me tonight I guess.
