I think it's almost time to go and I think I've decided on my methodI'm tired of my pelvic/prostate/bladder health problems, due to my health problems I've delvoped mental health issues and 4 years of shit and I've basically lost my spark, lost my personality. I lost my job because of Covid and I'm just waiting for confirmation this month that  I've definitely lost the job, new dog at home hates me and I feel like a nuisance to my parents. I'm also tired of living with my parents at the age of 29, I'm also starved sexually. I've got one more salary payment then I'm done, 5 k in the bank. But got nothing really to do with it since I can't travel to Asia my second home due to the pandemic.

I'm thinking of getting a hotel room somewhere, England or abroad I don't know, and buying a sharp knife and charcoal. I'll burn the charcoal and while it's burning ill cut myself. Might get drunk before I do it. Might bang some Hooker. I don't know. I'm also tired of trying to decide which method to choose, so just decided on the charcoal and knife, a famous Korean pop star used charcoal to kill himself. I don't have a date yet. Maybe this month if things get bad at home or next month.
