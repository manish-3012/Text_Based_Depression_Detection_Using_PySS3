What's the point of doing anything?!I'm 17, I had a crappy childhood when my dad died and my adolescence consisted of me staying in my room being a depressed piece of shit, I've never had a boyfriend and I've never been to parties even though I've had invites and guys that have asked me out, I've stopped myself from having experiences. I wake up everyday miserable and go to a shitty college full of immature crack heads.

I come home and think what's the fucking point of living this unhappy life, come home to fucking cry myself to sleep and do the same thing the next day and the next. I don't want to die but I just wish I had a better life, I hate myself, I'm a useless piece of shit that no one cares about.

I go to counselling but I don't think she understands what the fuck I'm saying, how is she supposed to know when I don't even know myself?!

My life is bullshit.
