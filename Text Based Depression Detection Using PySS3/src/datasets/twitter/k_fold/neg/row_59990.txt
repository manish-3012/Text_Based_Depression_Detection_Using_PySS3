I Want to kill MyselfI am a 20 year old adult from India. I clearly don't find any purpose of my life. I come from very poor family, since the childhood I grew up with the lack of money. I never had enough money to live a decent life, I always thought of killing myself since last 3 years. I was very good at studies till high school after completing my high school, I got admission in a college after clearing toughest exam in India. After joining college I was very happy as it was my dream college but it didn't come of that way. I started hating my college, my course, my life and everything and tried to kill myself twice. I often used to go to bed thinking about how I might kill myself. I failed at killing myself and I began to search  for money because I thought that money will bring me happiness, and tbh for a short time it did. I became happy I started earning for 5-6 months. I earned for about $5000 I forgot about depression and everything and found purpose in my life and I felt the way that I never felt before, but on a very gloomy evening, I lost around $4500 dollars. I almost lost everything and I lost my all source of income. From that day only I am again struggling to find a purpose in my life, I am not able to focus on my studies, I can not sleep properly, I can not eat. I just want to kill myself and leave this earth. I want to electrocute myself. I really don't know what to do.
