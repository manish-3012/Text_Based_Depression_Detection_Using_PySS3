I have nothing to fall back onToday my last piece of hope and stability disappeared when I got ghosted by most of my remaining online-'friends'. I am pretty much abandoned by my family and  have no other person to talk to. I am Autistic and have severe problems connecting with people, I am diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses including severe  untreated depression because i am to unstable psychologically. I have no job, no social support system and no friends or relatives i could talk to.
I have traintracks about 500 meters from my house and i think that would be the least risky way of doing it without access to firearms
