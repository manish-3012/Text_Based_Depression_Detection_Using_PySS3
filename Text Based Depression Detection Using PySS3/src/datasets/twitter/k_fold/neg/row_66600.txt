Very tiredFirst off, I just wanted to say sorry if this difficult to read or understand.. Iâ€™m just spilling my thoughtsâ€¦

I am fucking tired. 

I feel tired.. mentally and physically. I am tired of thinking, talking, and even trying. I donâ€™t know why this is happening to me. I feel soâ€¦ alone. I can be with a group of people and still feel so isolated from the crowd. Something feels heavy inside meâ€”almost a physical feeling. Is this all my fault?

Thereâ€™s just something always pulling me back. I always feel like something is going to go wrong, and it isnâ€™t worth it. I donâ€™t know if you can even call that anxiety, but something is always pulling me back whenever I try to do something. 

I am trying. I have been trying. I am tired of trying. Iâ€™m not going to get into any specifics, but it seems as if everything in my life is crumbling down and I just canâ€™t handle everything anymore. I donâ€™t think I have friends. Sure I have those people I see in school, but I donâ€™t hang out with much people outside. I donâ€™t have people who check up on me. I donâ€™t have anyone who messages me first. That sounds so entitled. But I do try to be the person for other people  I want to be able to confide to to a couple of people. Every time, someone shows an interest in me.. I just feel so insecure about myself and push them away. I donâ€™t want anyone else to deal with my insecurities.. especially cause Iâ€™m a guy. Itâ€™s like that clichÃ© quote you see around on Twitter, â€œyou canâ€™t love anyone else before you love yourself.â€ I used to think that was bullshit but now, I canâ€™t think of anything that fits me the most.

Everyone always tells me that I should stop being sad because Iâ€™m lucky to have this and that, and I am so tired of people invalidating my feelings. No one sees what goes on inside my head. No one sees the personal battles I constantly face. Itâ€™s so hard to confide in people without feeling them judging you. 

Am I okay? Not today.
