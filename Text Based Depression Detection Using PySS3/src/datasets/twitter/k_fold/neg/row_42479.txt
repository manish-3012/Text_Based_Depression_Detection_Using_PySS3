Everyone gets mad at me. Maybe you should help me instead of picking fights with the mentally ill teenagerOmg just help. Iâ€™m so done. Stop telling me to fucking do it on my own. Yeah I do act like a psycho and yeah I am gonna piss you off when we get in a fight, have you ever considered maybe itâ€™s cause nobody fucking raised me right? Iâ€™m a brat, ok, what now? I canâ€™t be constantly scared youâ€™re going to traumatize me again if I already have enough problems! Fine, okay, you wanna be the victim? And me the big meanie? At least I can say Iâ€™m mentally ill and all you have to say for yourself is your just a petty freak! Someone give me a solution. I need help. Help me. Iâ€™m scared to kill myself. I donâ€™t want it to hurt. And I want to be happy. Someone teach me how to go to one side or the other, not just stay in the middle. I either want to have hope to stay alive and be happy and awesome and content or make me feel like thereâ€™s no point in living anymore and make me %100 sure I want to kill myself. DONT GIVE ME NO IN BETWEEN.
