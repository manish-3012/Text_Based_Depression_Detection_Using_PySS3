I can't live in this world knowing there is no love and magic.I am hurting so much.  After 50 years on earth and countless relationships, I found someone with whom I connected so deeply that I cannot imagine that there is anyone else in the world that could make me feel 'right'.  He is like my reflection and at the same time he is the calm to my storm and I am the excitement he was seeking.  I was a diehard disbeliever with respect to 'love and soulmates' but this man changed my mind.  He expressed mutual feelings.  Then he dumped me.  I am lost now.  I just can't see ever being in any relationship where I can feel anything for anyone.  I will subconsciously and consciously now prevent myself from feeling anything for anyone.  I have no kids, no close friends, no real family to say I am loved by anyone. I could actually see a future with this man.  Now I see nothing.  Empty nothing in my future.  We were on the same page and suddenly we are not.  How can I stay in a world that is lacking in love and magic.  I was very wrong in thinking all my life that maybe its possible. I found it and i lost it or it was never real or I was tricked by a man or by the universe or something.  I can't do this again.  All I wanted was to feel safe in a relationship and I am obviously never going to feel safe.  I can't do it any more and I can't bear to be alone any more.
