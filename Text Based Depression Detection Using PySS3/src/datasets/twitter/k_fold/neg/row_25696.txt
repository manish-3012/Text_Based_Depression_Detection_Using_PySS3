I'm overwhelmed ðŸ¥€First of all nobody is there for me when I need help, nobody loves me or cares for me. And when I try to get some help from internet then most of the sites like QuOrA gives me answers that triggers my anxiety more by saying that you should not rely on anyone, you should love yourself even if nobody else does like wtf bitch just STFU! I wanted a relatable answer that could make me feel less alone but you just made me feel guilty for being depressed.
