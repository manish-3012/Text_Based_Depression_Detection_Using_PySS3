I havenâ€™t felt this was since I was a teen. And suddenly any way to go is the way. But nothing is easy enoughI donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s just me reaching out for attention or Iâ€™m too scared. I donâ€™t encourage it for others. In fact, the only thing I hold onto is how other people feel, and my cats, and that it might encourage others. 

I canâ€™t think of a quick and easy enough way to go. 

I think maybe things could get better but I hate myself so much, I donâ€™t know if I could grow to like myself again. Iâ€™ve turned into this lazy, fat slug, who has few interests and little to live for. I cut off my family for being toxic. And I stopped talking to my friends because I sabotage things and Iâ€™m isolating. 

So I have my husband who is also depressed who would probably leave me soon anyway, and my cats. Fuck me. I just donâ€™t know anymore.
