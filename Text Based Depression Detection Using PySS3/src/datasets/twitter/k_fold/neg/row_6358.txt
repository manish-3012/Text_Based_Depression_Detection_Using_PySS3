I give up. Life isn't worth it anymoreLost all my friends over the past 2 days. Now that I think about it, they weren't my friends in the first place. I don't see myself going anywhere in life. I don't care if my parents are going to miss me. It's selfish of them to stop me. All I need now is a method, and the house to myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do it. And honestly, that thought scares me more than anything.
