The reason I wont be here tomorrow.The world is driven by ever-changing advancements, evolution, and perception being perfected every second. The species of our own in its intelligence has been corrupted by persistent inquiry, and curiosity that shall only lead this humanity to its inevitable end. There is little drive to persevere and witness the corruption of self extinction, so be free young pelicans and relinquish yourself as I do, a time well spent, but only; spent.
