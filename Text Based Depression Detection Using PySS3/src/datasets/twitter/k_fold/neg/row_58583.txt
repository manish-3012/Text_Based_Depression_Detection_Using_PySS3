I keep thinking it's gonna get betterTitle, but it doesn't.

Maybe this is just finals stress, but it's not like these feelings are new or anything. I had a complete breakdown in front of my friends the other day, and I kept expecting one of them to like... ask if I was ok, or offer comfort or something. Nah but it was hella embarrassing for me, yay.

I just really wanted to talk to someone, but scrolling through my FB friends I realized there's really no one I can talk to. So of course I came to reddit right as I was getting ready to go to bed. Haha. It's funny, said friends talk about how they're always alone or lonely or whatever, but I guarantee you they text 5x the number of people I do on a daily basis.
