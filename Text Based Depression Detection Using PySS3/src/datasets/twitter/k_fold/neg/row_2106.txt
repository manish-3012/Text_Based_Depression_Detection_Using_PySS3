I Want To Go Back...Recently I've been extremely depressed. Ever since I left my hometown for college.

I thought getting away would help, not hurt. See, I grew up in the same house surrounded by the same neighbors and nothing ever changed. It allowed me to create good memories but retain the bad ones.

That place was toxic for me - I was forced to remember my dead sister, the times when my brother wasn't a drug addict, or when my friends were with me and we could simply enjoy childhood. Even the good memories of my friends were being tainted because I desperately wanted to go back to that time.

So I moved away. Or ran away, really. But now not only am I feeling a sickening nostalgia, a longing to go back to those times, but I also just want to go home.

I'm homesick, I'm depressed out of my mind, and on top of that, I just feel empty. God I want to go home. Not literally, but back to when I felt my home was HOME. Back then. But you can't turn back time and it hurts. I just want to see my childhood friends, I want to be able to run around and live freely, I want my brother to be happy and strong, I want my sister back.

Fuck I just want it all back. I want to go home please someone help me.
