I feel so tiredIâ€™m tired of everything. Iâ€™m tired of trying to get better when I see no future for me anyway. Like whatâ€™s the point?

I havenâ€™t taken my medication three consecutive nights and I just donâ€™t have the will and strength to do so. Iâ€™m so fucking tired that I canâ€™t even express how Iâ€™m really feeling right now.

I just want to die.
