I need to die soonI have most of my supplies, I have no hope for a better future. Life has been a slow decline, off a cliff.  I was in 3rd year uni but they cut my govt school loans so I cant finish, $100,000+ I owe for nothing at all. I was a junkie several years ago but I kicked the habit. I have numerous mental health diagnosis but I can't afford my meds, food, etc. I'm at the end of my rope. Life sucks. Thanks for listening to my ramblings.
