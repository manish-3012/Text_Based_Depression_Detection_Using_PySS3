Vent lolI donâ€™t think I can take much of this anymore. Iâ€™m fairly young and Iâ€™ve already had such an emotionally tough life, I donâ€™t think any amount of therapy can help me overcome it. I seem to switch between giving life another chance to abandoning everything and just waiting for my death quite a lot. One second Iâ€™ll be ok with coping, then all the emotions come at me all at once and make me want to die. When I do feel like I want to continue living, my body betrays me. I feel as if my entire life has been robbed from me because of my upbringing. Abusive parents, bullying, a physical illness, and a bunch of other traumatic events. All of this mixed with severe depression and anxiety that have gone untreated for years because of my parents seem to be taking a toll on my body. My head is fucking exploding, and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s nothing this time. I canâ€™t take this emotional turmoil anymore, I have been suffering my entire life. I canâ€™t deal with emotional pain nor physical pain, i might be overwhelmed by the way I physically have been feeling recently but I think I wonâ€™t have long to live. I am stuck in what seems to be endless suffering, I have not yet overcome all my traumatic life events and new ones already seem to be happening. I just wasnâ€™t given a chance to live like everyone else.
