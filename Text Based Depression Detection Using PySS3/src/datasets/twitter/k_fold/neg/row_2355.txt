One of my best friends attempted last night...She took a lot of tablets and drank floor cleaner. I called her mom and her mom made her throw up and then took her to the emergency room. I called her later that night and to hear her strained voice... The machines beeping in the background... I've attempted suicide a few times now and yet I still feel angry and sad that she tried to die. I know it's hypocritical but I would be lost without her. She's truly an amazing young woman with so much potential and she makes everyone smile. I know why she wants to die , but it is still painful to have to watch her attempt and self harm. We went to the same rehab earlier this year.
