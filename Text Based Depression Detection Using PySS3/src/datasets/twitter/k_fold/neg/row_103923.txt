What's the pointEvery time an end date passes I just want to kill myself. Graduated uni. What's the point now. Finished a two month work contract. What now. I've got a month left and then I'm supposed to go to grad school but all I can think about is all this is to make money so I can survive when that's the last thing I want to do. What other fucking point is there you work to keep yourself alive for as long as possible and then you just kick the bucket why not take out some of those inbetween steps
