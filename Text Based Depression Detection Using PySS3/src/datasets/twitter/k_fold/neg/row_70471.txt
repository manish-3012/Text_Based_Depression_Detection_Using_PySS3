I just can'tFirst of all, to the person who is following me and down voting all my posts, fuck you, get a fucking life lol. 

Now to the post: I went to try to get therapy and I'm apparently starting a long term plan now. I had a "crisis plan" meeting which is supposed to be a plan for when you're feeling suicidal and I just...can't. Nobody understands, definitely not the person handling the crisis stuff. I can't communicate my feelings to anyone, absolutely no one in the world. A lot of people are well intentioned and want to help, but I am TRAPPED within myself. Killing myself is the ONLY WAY I can escape. Nobody seems to understand this. 

When I kill myself it's going to be 100%, I'm not going to try to explain to someone why I need to fucking die. And I don't want to stop myself from self harming, that shit feels good sometimes and helps me more than any human being ever could.

I don't even know why I'm posting this I just wish someone understood. I was made to believe that therapy would give me that, but nope, they're just regular people trying to help, they don't have special abilities to fix the fact that I am not meant to live.
