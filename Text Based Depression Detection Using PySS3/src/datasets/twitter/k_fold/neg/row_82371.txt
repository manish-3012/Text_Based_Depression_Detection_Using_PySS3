first of all im illiterate i barely finished 10th grade i was taken out by my parents for dumb reasons (another reason im suicidal) ive  had dyslexia since the 1st grade so idk why it was a great idea to take me out of school. i already have learning issues so lets make it harder for me please. im an 18 year old girl who cant get along with her family has no friends to run to when i cant stay home, im losing faith in God/humanity. i am christian but why does god hate me so much to make my life so miserable ?!?!? why do i try hard and still have this life !?!? no i dont have my GED or diploma i cant take it because 1 i have practiced online and i dont know 80% of the stuff bc again i didnt go to school and bc of my learning disability it makes it 5x as hard to study (even tho i still try, im not giving up). 2 my parents wont give me money to take it. 3 my mom said she wouldnt give me the money to take it because she has no faith in me. 4. ive been waiting 2 years to to get into a home schooling or a ged program they will not enroll me. why dont i get a job and pay for it ??. my parents wont give me my documents. why dont i report them because im an adult and they legally cant hold my documents (birth certificate, ID, SSN) because i dont wanna be homeless and im an adult so they could legally kick me out.

 i wanna die bc whats the point of living !??!?! most kids at 18 have finished high school have a job arent fucking stupid like me are actually in college have friends social lives and are ready to move out while im still be treating like a kid getting my phone taken away have no money cant get a job cant get a license cant get an education because my parents wont let me. imagine wanting an education and your parent havenent put you in school in 4 years !?!?! and you couldnt do a thing about it bc you were underaged and if you told anyone like CPS they would kick you out. and how would i get a job any way if if fucking too illiterate to write a paragraph and you have social anxiety so bad you cant speak.

my mom hates me she told me that. she said im not her daughter im just a bitch she gave birth to. shes verbally, mentally, and physically abusive. a fucking drunk, she starts arguments and fights and when i pushed her off of me once my whole family acted like i was the problem. yelling at me claiming i hit her. i wish i fucking could punch her in the face !!! my dad doesn't live with me. he lives in a man camp for his job so i cant live with him.

i used to have one friend who was in the same situation as me we were planning on leaving our toxic parents and moving out together. but she moved out bc she had a boyfriend so now she lives with him  and his nice family. i dont talk to her anymore because thats how life goes but lucky her to have a loving support system i have no boyfriend im asexual because i was raped as a child and now cant form intimate relationships and they make me uncomfortable. wow i love childhood trauma making me suicidal today. i told my parents when it happened when i was young seems like they dont care now bc they still bring him up to this day because he lives down the street from our home ( he was a family) i hate them for that.

i have no one because i cut everyone off by isolating myself. most of my friends were in school so when i left i became depressed and stopped talking to people. the moved on with life to have great lives. getting into college, moving out, finding better less boring people to hang with. i see them on social media living it up while im on the verge of suicide everyday. even the people that bullied me in school are living great. parties every weekend happy lives. i wasn't shy when i was in school. i was the type of person to become the shy kids friend. if i saw someone sitting alone i would go sit with them. i was nice to everyone. I was bubbly always making jokes hyper ect. i had big group of friends. so seeing myself depressed and lonely and dull with no emotion makes me feel even more pathetic. i met with an old friend i couple weeks ago and he said i was so different now and "BORING" .i thought to me self yeah thats what depression does to you. i havent spoke to him sense bc he hasnt hit me back. guess i really was boring fuck. i try talking to my old friends. we didnt leave off on beef but they just dont reply or they treat me like im someone under them. they probably know i didnt graduate. or they have better lives than me and are busy so thats why im beneath them. i see people from school still friends and close hanging out and loyal but i go through a tuff time in my life and NO ONE COULD STAY BY MY SIDE. im not exaggerating i have literally no one but myself NO FRIENDS NO FAMILY AT 18 YEARS OLD NO ONE BY MYY SIDE SAYING "YOU CAN DO THIS" JUST ME AND IM SICK OF ME.

IM FUCKING DONE WITH LIFE I WANT THIS TO BE OVER. i have only put out good and love into the world when my friends were depressed i cried for them and talked them out of sadness and hurt. i was there for people. i never was a bully. i never hurt people. NOW IM SUFFERING I NEED SUPPORT MORE THEN I EVER HAVE IN MY LIFE AND I GET LEFT ON DELIVERED LEFT ON READ, "SORRY IM TOO BUSY, SORRY I HAVE PLANS"............................................LIFE ISNT HOW IT WORKS ON THE MOVIES. BAD PEOPLE DONT GET WHAT THEY DESERVE AND THE GOOD GUYS DONT GET THE LAST LAUGH . IF YOURE GOOD IN THIS WORLD AND YOU LOVE EVERYONE YOU SUFFER  THE MOST AND GET A SHITTY LIFE. MAYBE IF I TREATED PEOPLE LIKE SHIT MY WHOLE LIFE ID BE HAPPY. IM DONE AT THIS POINT I DONT CARE .
