What.Im new. And the only reason i joined is, well. This.

Im tired of life. Of living and hearing these things everyday.

"We dont need you, your mom hates you, your dad left you.(my dad almost sexually harrased me.) your useless. Your nothing. I dont love you anymore. I regret raising you."

From my grandmother. Then.

"Your a slut. Puta.(tagalog languange here, but roughly means slut. Letting your boyfriend fuck you. Low life. You arent going to succeed in this world. Go. Live with him. Just run away with him already so we dont have to deal with you anymore."

And after a few minutes shed be soft spoken. And then this again. Wash. Rinsw. Repeat.

And every single damn time. It breaks me. I just want to.. I dont know. Run away? Die? Do something. 
I smoke to relieve the pressure in my chest. And i cut. 

My boyfriend. Were secretly together. And i just dont know anymore. I love him and he loves me. I know it. And i dont feel regret at the thought of leaving my family for him. He is super supportive. Though, both of us is.. Sick? How do you say it. Being sick is much more easier. At least theres a cure. Somehow. What we both have doesnt seem to have a cure. I hate being awake. And i cant function and it makes my family worse. And. Im. Lost. Sigh. I dont know why im typing this. I dont know what im looking for. For. Something? Encouragement? Help? What to do?

I guess. To relieve the pressure. The ever present pressure.
