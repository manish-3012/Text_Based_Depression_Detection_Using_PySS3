Why not do it?One day you will die anyway, you can die at any time from anything. You can choose to commit suicide but you would lose the chance to change something in the future. You can choose to live until you really think it is no longer worth living. No matter how many loved ones you have around you, no matter how much help you have from everyone, no matter how much you love them, you can commit suicide.
You can commit suicide for so many reasons: love, pain, anger, pleasure ... you can do it anywhere anytime. If you have someone to say goodbye to, you can do it, but you can leave them with trauma, questions, pain, memories and tears.Many people can commit suicide because someone in their family has committed suicide ... anyone can commit suicide for their own reasons even meðŸ”ª
