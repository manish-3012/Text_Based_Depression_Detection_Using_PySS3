I wish there was a way to end it without hurting familyAs I feel completely useless, I have seriously though about committing suicide 3 times in my life.

This time it's the closest one and probably the only reason I'm still alive is my mom. I know she wouldn't survive it, but I don't fee like I belong here neither I'm making her happy or proud. 

I don't see the light anymore...
