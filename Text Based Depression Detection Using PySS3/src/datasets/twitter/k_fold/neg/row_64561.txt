I wasted my best years doing nothingMy parents chose to start me in school at age 6 instead of 5, so all my life I've been older than everyone else around me and felt different as a result and that I didn't fit in. This feeling worsened in high school were my depression really started to get the best of me and all I could think about was applying to college and getting out of there. I wanted to graduate early but my parents insisted that I would regret it if I did, so instead I spent my 18th year trapped in high school instead. When I finally went to college at age 19 I opened up, started finally doing things everyone told me to enjoy earlier in life like drinking, smoking weed and having sex. While I certainly had fun for a bit, now at 21, everyone is acting like the party is over and ready to grow up and turn into an adult having gotten the partying and rebellion out of their system as teenagers.

I can't help feeling like I wasted my teenage years and arguably half of my prime years because of all this. I wish I had taken time to try  new things and enjoy myself in high school instead of being such a depressed loner instead. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wish life had a giant "reset" button so I could go back and do things differently. 

I'm not ready to be an adult when I feel that I never really got to live like a teenager.
