I canâ€™t do this anymoreEveryone says itâ€™s going to get better. But itâ€™s not. Is it. Iâ€™m chronically mentally ill. Iâ€™m literally never going to recover thatâ€™s a fact. I will be like this for the rest of my life. And I genuinely canâ€™t live the rest of my life like this. I am In so much pain every day. I am horrible to everyone around me because I hate my life. Nothing in the world makes me excited anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m not even real. 

I have a burning desire to jump off a high bridge where I live but itâ€™s over water and Iâ€™m worried it might not kill me because Iâ€™ve been doing some research and a fair few people have survived. And I donâ€™t wanna survive. So then I thought rope would be the next best way but I need to go somewhere where Iâ€™m guaranteed a stranger will find me not my parter or family or anything because I donâ€™t wanna traumatise them. And I know what youâ€™re gonna say â€œkilling yourself will traumatise them anywayâ€ but I know it will upset them initially but they will be far better off in the long run. 

Trust me Iâ€™m actually a truly horrible person. 

Donâ€™t know the point of me writing this. Just needed to get it out. Might go get a bottle of wine and then maybe Iâ€™ll feel better.
