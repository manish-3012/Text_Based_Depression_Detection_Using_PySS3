I have 5 monthsLately I have been thinking about how I'll always have a miserable life not because life is inherently hard (which I think is true) but because of how I view myself and the world. I'm just broken and I'm trying to fix myself by doing so many thing: sleep, a good diet, exercise, self-care, you name it. I put so much effort and it doesn't seem to pay consistent effort. I don't want to keep suffering for nothing. So, I'm thinking of giving myself a cutoff point where, if I don't start to become better, I'd kill myself. I chose 1/1/2021 as the cutoff date.
