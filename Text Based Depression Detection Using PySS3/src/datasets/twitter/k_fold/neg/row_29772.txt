I woke up took a shower and cleaned all my appartmentI didn't have the motivation to do so in months, but today when I woke up I just decided that it's going to be it, I threw all the beers cans laying arround, the weed bags too...etc.

I don't have a miserable life, I'm sure most of you have it worst than me, but it's just , my choice. I didn't chose to be born and I don't want to continue.

so I'm gonna watch a movie and take some pills ( a lot) i have sertraline and bromazemap. I don't know what they'll do to me but it's worth a try.

I haven't felt so motivated and relieved in a long time.

Thanks for reading and I hope you find a better solution for yourselves.
