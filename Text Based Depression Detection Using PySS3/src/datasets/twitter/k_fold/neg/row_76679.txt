How can I get better if all I do is lie?My family decided that it was best for me to get me a therapist, which was a really good idea. Iâ€™ve been depressed (undiagnosed, but fairly positive) for a few years now. I hid it pretty well from my parents until recently, and even though I denied being depressed, I think they could tell I was lying.

My therapist is really nice, and was the same one that my mom used for her PTSD when my dad died. And it was the same one my brother used when he had some trouble too. Sheâ€™s great.

The only problem is that I lie to her. And I lie to my parents. And I lie to my friends. And my girlfriend. And myself. And even though I want so badly to stop, I canâ€™t.

How can I get better if nobody even knows the truth. I have such a strong feeling that I will die to suicide at some point in my life, even if itâ€™s not now. I just canâ€™t see myself getting any better, like I was just destined to be miserable no matter what I do. 

My step-dad recently told me to â€œgo fuck myselfâ€ which ended in me hyperventilating on the floor of his room while he watched tv, and my mom was trying to calm me down and comfort me. She blames me for not wanting to talk to him about it though. I ruin my family. I ruin my relationships. And Iâ€™m just kind of sick of drifting through life like this. Itâ€™s just unbearable. Iâ€™m beyond help at this point. Iâ€™m not going to kill myself, at least not yet. But Iâ€™m just hopeless and helpless. And thatâ€™s how I was meant to be. Forever.
