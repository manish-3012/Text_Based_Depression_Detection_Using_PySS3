Donâ€™t know how to reach outLife seems pointless. When you have nothing, nothing at all life really seems pointless. No friends, no job, no money, no car, no real family. Some might say why donâ€™t you get a job? Why donâ€™t you just go out and live your life? I really wish I could, honestly. Today I almost killed myself, just overwhelmed with being lonely, having nothing and what seems like bad luck. Iâ€™m a really good person, Iâ€™ll give someone the shirt off my back but everything gets taken from me. Last year I had a job on a oyster boat making $500 a day I got cut over some politics. Growing up I had a somewhat decent family then my mom got with an abusive husband and that just ruined my concept of â€œfamilyâ€. Two years ago I had a nice vehicle, $20k in the bank (19 at the time) and a decent job. And alcohol and bad friends ruined all that (my fault). One of the things holding me back is social anxiety. I hate meeting people to the point I canâ€™t get a job my anxiety wonâ€™t let me. It seems like Iâ€™m stuck in a hole and I just want to ask for help, I want to talk to a therapist but Iâ€™m broke. I feel broken, Iâ€™m at the point where life really doesnâ€™t seem like worth living. Somebody please give me some words of wisdom or something to make me feel better. Iâ€™m at my rock bottom
