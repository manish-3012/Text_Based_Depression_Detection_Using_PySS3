I just made a legit suicide planI've always attempted on a whim before. But this time, I've got a plan. Saturday, when I get my meds, I'm going to tell my boyfriend I love him and I'm running to the store. I'm going to park my car somewhere empty. Im going to take all my pills and wash it down with as much alcohol as I can stomach. I'll climb in the backseat of my car. If the meds don't kill me, the cold will. I really just needed to tell someone about this. I'm scared but I'm sure. I can't see any other way out and finding help has been difficult and humiliating at times. I am finally ready to say goodbye. Honestly, the only person who loves me is my boyfriend and he can do so much better. I just hope he doesn't think I don't love him.
