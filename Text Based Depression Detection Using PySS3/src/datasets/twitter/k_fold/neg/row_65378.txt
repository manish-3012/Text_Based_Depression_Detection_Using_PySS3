A Question For You To PonderI'm a heterosexual, caucasian male.
I've been alive for twenty or so years, give or take. I'm not going to accurately say how long. That may not seem like a lot of time, but it's long enough to see where the world is headed. There are a lot of people who want to see me dead because of what I am, not who I am, and it hurts, knowing that people want me dead over something I can't control. 

I bet even a few of you on this sub also hate me because of that, and will, in secret or directly within this post, attempt to spur me on. I believe that I'm going to be murdered within the next ten to twenty years, and don't see any reason not to simply end my life now before an authoritarian decides to officially announce the death of people like me.

Is there any reason to live knowing that you are hated for nothing, you will never find a relationship, and that, even if you're lucky enough to find someone, you will just be either imprisoned or executed anyway?
