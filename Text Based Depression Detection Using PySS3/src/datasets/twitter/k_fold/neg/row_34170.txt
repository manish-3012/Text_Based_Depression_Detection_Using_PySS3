Do you guys actually believe any of this positivity bullshit? It's a crock of arm-chair-psychologist bullshit and I'm giving the finger to you all as I make my fucking exit from this pathetic fucking place called earth. Exactly as it's read. You know how many times I've heard phrases like keep your head up/it gets better/stay positive? It's a crock of fucking bullshit and your all a bunch of fucking liars. It never gets better and it never fucking will. 

I'll save you all a fucking seat in hell at the liars chair. You should all be ashamed of giving people on here fucking hope that doesn't actually exist. God knows people like you have only helped to make it obvious this is the right fucking choice. 

I hope you all choke on a bag of dicks. Tonight I'll make sure to give tribute to you guys. 

Oh, and that "feeling suicidal now" link is also a crock of horse shit. I made it through the first paragraph and basically wanted to fucking off myself just reading the fucking stupid positivity bullshit spewed all over that page. You guys are in need of a reality check if you think good things eventually happen to good people, cause they fucking dont. I can't wait to be banned cause I'm apparantly a troll. No, I'm not trolling you guys, I just think you and this whole fucking subreddit is misguided. There is no benefit to positivity, it only leaves more room for dissapointment and pain. Don't you guys fuckign get that? maybe you need to loose the way I've lost. You wouldn't make it fucking one day in my shoes without tossing yourself in front of a subway train. 

FUCKING LIARS FUCKING LIARS FUCKIG LIARS FUCKIGN LIARS
