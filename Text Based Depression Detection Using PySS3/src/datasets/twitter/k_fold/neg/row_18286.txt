I donâ€™t want my family seeing me.I have made up my mind. I canâ€™t continue to fight just because of the guilt I currently feel, knowing about the people I will leave behind. 

I know suicide is selfish. I know it doesnâ€™t end the pain, it only moves it. But I could not imagine the physical strain my parents would go through if they found my dead body - i wouldnâ€™t wish that on anyone, regardless of me being dead. 

I want to jump into a river and be taken away, but I know my instincts will kick in and try and save me. Thatâ€™s not what I want. 

Help me, Please.
