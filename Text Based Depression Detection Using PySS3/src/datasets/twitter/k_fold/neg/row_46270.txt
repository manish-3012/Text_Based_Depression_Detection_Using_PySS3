I am so close.Usually i manage to get out of this mindset. I find something, a goal, a wish, that at least keep me going on until the next day. Tonight, i am empty. I have nothing left. I tried to message my friends to see if they would at least respond.. to make me feel appreciated.. but theyre not. My boyfriend read my message 6 hours ago and still hasnt answered me. I have never mattered to anyone. Why should i waste time being here when i have no point or purpose? I am just a dead weight to everyone.
