Please can I just go?I'm so tired of being here, I'm so tired of going through the motions every day, I'm tired of all the fucking random mood swings that convince me my mental illness is gone just to throw me right back in at the deep end. I'm tired of all these responsibilities that keep piling up, I'm tired of pretending to be happy, I'm tired of people criticizing things for the few things that still bring me joy in life. I'm just fucking tired, so tired that I don't even want to get out of bed in the fucking morning. I just want time to stop. I want to go. I want to go to a place where there is no time and there are no responsibilities and no expectations and no people. Please let me go...
