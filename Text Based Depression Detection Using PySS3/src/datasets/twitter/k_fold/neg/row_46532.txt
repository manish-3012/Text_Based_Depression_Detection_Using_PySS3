2019 has taken me straight to the edge. I am done.I have posted L after L this year. Lost jobs, failed attempts at starting a life for myself after graduation, car accident, injuries, surgeries, my birth father died, and my alcoholic mother ended up in the hospital. I thought with my recent contacting job things were starting to look up but I just got let go from my contract tonight and honestly I'm pretty fucking beat. Life has taken the optimistic, passion, and love in me and beaten me until there's nearly nothing left. I'm a shell of the man I used to be. I need a win. Anything at all. I'm lost.
