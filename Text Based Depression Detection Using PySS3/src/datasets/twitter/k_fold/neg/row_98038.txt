I'm gonna kill myself today.I just can't do this anymore. The pain, the stress, the pressure is just too much. I have no friends and when I do they're mean to me, like everyone is, even though I'm funny and friendly... My friend told me I'm not doing anything wrong but I just can't bear the fact that I'm so alone. I just can't do this, I'm so scared, hurt... I'm just determined to die. Today, when it's night (23:00-0:00) I'm gonna drink so much vodka, smoke grams of weed and overdose on benzos. 

I'm so sorry, I just can't do this anymore.
