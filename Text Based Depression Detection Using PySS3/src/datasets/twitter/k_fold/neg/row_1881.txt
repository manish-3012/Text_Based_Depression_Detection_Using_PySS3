I really just need to kill myself already...I spend so much time thinking about it i just want to do it but i dont know how, the best way i can think so far is going to a shooting range and 1 to the head.

i cant hand the fact im going to be a failure and alone for my whole life, im 27 years old and have never had a relationship of any kind and have no skills or job

i just need to go to the shooting range and i can finally not hate every moment of every day anymore
