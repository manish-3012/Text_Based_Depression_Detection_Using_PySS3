I'm not going to be here much longerThis is a bit of a vent, apologies. I feel like something has shifted within me. I always thought I would die by my own hands, but now it feels like it's really going to happen, and soon. I keep putting it off because I know it'll upset my loved ones, but the sooner I get it done, the sooner they can move on. I'm ready to do what I need to do, I'm absolutely disgusted with myself for causing so much hurt to people and for wasting resources that were supposed to help me.
