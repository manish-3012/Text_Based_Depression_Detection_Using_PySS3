constant suicide ideation?I'm currently a student studying Psychology (pretty ironic). The work load is ridiculous, and it makes me overwhelmed all the time. This, coupled with the fact that I have anxiety and depression, basically make me feel like shit all the time.

I end up putting my work off because I fear it, but when the deadline approaches, it's a mad scramble to get quality work done. Of course, the works I do end up being far from what I can produce.
If I gave no fucks, that would still be okay. However, my self-worth is based very much off my grades.

This, along with other stresses in life, make me constantly fantasize about committing suicide. While I (probably) would never do so, it doesn't stop me from thinking about how great it would be to be dead.
It's reached the point where I say "I'm gonna kill myself lmao" several times a day. While this phrase is used by a joke by many people, I am actually half-serious every time I say it.

It's so tiring to feel this way all the time.
