I have always considered myself a waste of resources. The epidemic just proves my point.I've always felt I'm a waste. I don't want to exist, and any resources spent on me are a waste. But I've always lived in a first world society and been upper-middle class where people act like there isn't a shortage of resources. (there definitely is, though, but that's not what I'm going to rant about).

This epidemic just shows the problem. There are a finite amount of hospital beds and equipment. I would like to say that if I'm hospitalized, just kill me. 99% of humanity deserves the medical attention more than me.

I am a waste. I had a lot of potential. Thinking about it, I don't think there's any series of events that would have even ended up with me being not useless though. I'm a flawed human being and always will be.
