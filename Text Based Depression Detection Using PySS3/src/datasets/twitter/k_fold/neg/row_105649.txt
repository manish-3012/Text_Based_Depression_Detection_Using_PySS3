I see no other wayPills? Maybe, but a temporary and possibly addictive/damaging solution. I hate waking up. I hate going to work. I hate being alive. I'm 31, and done with this infinite loop of bullshit.

I unfortunately can't commit suicide now because I can't put my family through that, but if I don't die in some other way, that will be the way out. Please save the "We need you" and "You have so much to live for" bullshit, because those Hallmark templates should not be said for everybody.

You know what? Pills. It will at least take the emotions away or push me into actually jumping off the bridge.
