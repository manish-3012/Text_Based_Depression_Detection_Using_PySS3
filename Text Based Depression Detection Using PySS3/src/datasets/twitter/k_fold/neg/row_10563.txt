idekWhen I was ab 4 i watched my mom kill herself, by hanging. It was by far the most horrific and traumatic event I have ever gone through in my life. Iâ€™ve spent countless hours crying, wondering, and missing her. Even now, 13 years later, I feel a hole in my heart. Everyday I had to relive what life was like without her. The pain i felt for so long was the same, it was constant and obvious. I couldnâ€™t sleep for years, I was soon diagnosed with PTSD, depression, chronic insomnia, and anxiety. This sounds like a sob story, and i guess it is. Iâ€™ve never really talked too in depth about how iâ€™ve felt about the situation except to the never ending therapist iâ€™ve been to. Nothing has worked to help ease my pain, iâ€™m not sure what the point of continuing with the pain is. I feel so burdened each day that I can barely even get up in the morning anymore. Even now I can barely cry or pity myself. Iâ€™ve become numb to everything around me, and that somehow seems worse than feeling pain.
