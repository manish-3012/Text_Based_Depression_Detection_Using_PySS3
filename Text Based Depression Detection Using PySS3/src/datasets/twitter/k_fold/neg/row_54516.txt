Need Advice.I am an 18 year old male with autism who was admitted into a mental health ward last month because I was having suicidal thoughts and planned on taking my life the day I was admitted to the hospital. I was released a few weeks ago and I was feeling better but recently I have become increasingly worse and have had more thoughts about suicide and want to kill myself. I don't know if I should go back to the hospital or try and get better on my own because I feel stressed out and frightened when I enter new environments. I know if I go back I will receive help but I am worried that I may have to stay in the hospital for a long time and I will be forced to do things that I don't want to do. I also know that if I don't go I may harm myself. So I need advice. What should I do? Should I go to the hospital or try and work this out myself so that I reduce some stress but still live with suicidal thoughts and feelings? Please help if you can and feel free to ask questions if it will help you assist me. TLDR Suicidal autistic who needs help on deciding to go the hospital or work through these problems myself.
