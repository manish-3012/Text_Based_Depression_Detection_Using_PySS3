Just wanted to share my thought, if you like have a look and express your own opinion about itSlowly recovered from a breakdown, and I sorta came up with this thought to help myself succeeding

I understood that life is like going to gym:
it is fuckin demanding, need to struggle everyday in the small as the big things, and it's fuckin painful at first, when you decide you wanna get somewhere: looks like nothing changes despite your efforts, which only seem to cause pain.
Nevertheless, if you keep up "training" (with this I don't mean postpone suicide, but actively trying in all ways to get back to society, get a job, rebond with family and friends) results arrive and you'll start to feel better and improve more and more, till the point that's not going to take effort at all, it would just be your real life, you wouldn't be faking anything or carrying a lie.

Be fucking brave


sorry for bad english
