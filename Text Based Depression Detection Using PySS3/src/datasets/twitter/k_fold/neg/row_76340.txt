I need some help please.I'm saw my therapist today. I'm seeing him again tomorrow morning. I don't think I'll actually do it, but the thoughts are very loud tonight. I keep dreaming of doing it. Music helps me a lot. Can you please suggest some good songs to help get me through the night. I tried to build my own playlist but shit just got dark so quick. I want something empowering, I don't want to listen to songs that remind me why I want to disappear. Something to help pull me through tonight. I feel stuck. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to do it. I don't want to do it. But I'm really fucking tired of everything. I feel trapped. Like stuck in a constant loop of thinking about it and wanting it and pulling myself back at the last minute. I'm scared in that moment it'll get too much and I'll do something stupid.

I will call my therapist if things get too bad, but I really want to do this on my own. I have no one else. I wanna listen to music and play BotW and just wait till tomorrow's appointment.

Thanks.

Also, if there is a better place to post this let me know. I'm not trying to be dramatic.
