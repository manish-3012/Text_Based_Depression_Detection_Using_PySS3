If it weren't for the people around me I would've ended it by now.Everyday I wake up to a feeling of emptiness. I have no future and don't have the will or motivation to have one, nor will I ever gain it. I'm considerng running away to cut commnication with everyone close to me so that they cann prepare themselves for the inevitable conclusion.

I just wanted to know if there was anyone else in the same boat as me. And if so how have you managed so far.
