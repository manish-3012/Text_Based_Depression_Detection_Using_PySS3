I just talked to someone I met on this sub and he just killed himselfI just came across this sub tonight and found a guy who said he was going to do it so I told him to pm me.
I was already tired and having trouble coming up with good things to say to calm him down.
We talked for awhile, he was extremely drunk. I wanted to help him but I guess It wasnâ€™t good enough. 
Heâ€™d been contemplating for five years he said. 
He had no one. 
I hope he knows that at least one person is shedding a tear for him.
