Being ugly destroys confidenceIf your ugly nobody gives you a chance, only ugly people know what itâ€™s like to go years without affection from anyone. Girls ghost you before even speaking to you, the second they see you in person you can visibly see the look of disgust on their faces. Itâ€™s a feeling you never get used to, to feel unwanted while your friends succeed simply because they were born better looking than you. People underestimate how dull and hellish life is for the unattractive, itâ€™s not Disneyland... itâ€™s just frustration mixed with severe depression.
