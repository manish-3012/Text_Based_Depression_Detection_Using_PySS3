Going to the therapist dont help ...Because everything is beyond the repair. Ä° mean i got no one in my side , nobody cares me , no energy to fix something , going to college, getting a  jop  or putting the shit together ... this loneliness and all of those setbacks i had to endure  really disturbing me . Ä° was getting better but  damn thanks to my damn father putting me where i started ... Ä° might be physically strong but mentally i feel like weak . Now i dont care about who worst than me , because this shit is worst too 
Stucking in the rot ...seeing other's  accomplish something ... Ä° cannot change this reality , it feels like i have been cursed ... Therapist only care about money , he or she is not a fucking wizard to fix something ...Ä° have really tired of being society's punching bag ... please understand for the God's sake iam not stupid , i just dont belong here ... Ä° didnt choose to be in this way ,unluckly. Ä° just want to dissapper ... erase my exsistence in here !
