Iâ€™m not okayIâ€™ve been getting worse and worse as the days go by. I was okay because I fell asleep but then I woke up.  I cannot cope. Idk what to do. If anyone can talk to me....or be there? I have no friends and no one to talk to. Can someone pls be my friend for just An hour? I just feel so alone.
