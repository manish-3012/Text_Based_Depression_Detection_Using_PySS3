I can't face the consequences of my actionsI have always had a problem with throwing tantrums and screaming at people whenever I feel upset or angry. Now, I had one and got into really serious trouble for it because I insulted someone based on his race directly and explicitly. He was innocent and I had absolutely no reason to say that.

My chances of having any type of career now are pretty much zero. Everyone will just think I'm a dirtbag human being. I can't accept what I did and I can't deal with the consequences. I will probably end up homeless. Killing myself gives me an escape. People are so angry that it doesn't make sense to try to fix my anger and abusive thinking problems because they won't care. I knew I was being cruel.
