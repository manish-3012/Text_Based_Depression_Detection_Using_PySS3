I've been here before. You have more options.I tried to kill myself. More than once. Everytime I woke up in a hospital or was found by EMT's I was **pissed**. But eventually everytime, I was so glad I was rescued. People do care about you, especially one you haven't met yet. Think about the future child or pet or spouse who would be so so happy with you.

You don't have to do something drastic. Write on the mirror with lipstick, or send a text, or leave a note, but just say "I don't want to be here" "I've been thinking about dangerous things" "help". Its not worth it. Don't do anything permanent you might regret.

I've been there. It hurts. It still hurts, but everytime I see a bird or sunset or my parents, its all so so worth it.
