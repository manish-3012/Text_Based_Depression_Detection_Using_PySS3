Academic Pressure Makes Me Suicidal (asian perspective)I'm a high schooler in the Bay Area. My friends are always talking about how many APs they're doing, or if they got a internship at some tech company over the summer, or about the new Android app they're building. I'm a freshman.

I feel like I'm drowning. My school is in a upper middle class suburb of Silicon Valley. It's majority Asian. All of my friend's parents work at some sort of tech company. One of my friend's parents work at Apple. Another at Microsoft. Another at Google. To say that the academic pressure is pretty damn intense would be an understatement. It's the type of school where kids sometimes flat out kill themselves due to the stress, the kind you hear about in the news. In my school there's this unspoken rule that you have to major in CompSci if you "want to amount to anything"

The Asian parent stereotype is true. Every single part of it. I don't want to say anything more.

Im pulling a 4.0 right now but I literally cannot afford to get a single B. I would kill myself if that happened, and it probably will.

Sometimes I'm just sitting in Spanish class and I start to think about how much easier it would be just to hang myself instead of doing Algebra II homework. I just want the stress to end. I just want to not have to get up every morning at 5:30, and trudge through the California cold (it's legit cold in the morning, shut up) to go to school literally before the sun even rises. Slowly but surely my life is going out of control.

I haven't done SAT prep in a few months now, and I need to raise my sat by about a hundred points if I want any hope of getting into a decent UC, I have a science Olympiad meeting tomorrow morning for like 4 hours and it's 2:30 am so I guess I'm not getting any sleep. I have to register the club that I run at a fundraising event, and fill out the paperwork for that. My coding projects are all behind schedule, and I'm so fucking depressed that my most recent project was a Python script called "areyoustillalive.py".and still need to learn Java to try to prepare for AP CompSci next year.

Kill me now kill me.please

I would probably be dead already if it wasn't for the fact that one of my classmates killed himself at my school back in October. He sat in front of me in class. that was a hard week.

Thanks for listening to my rant. I need to sleep now.
