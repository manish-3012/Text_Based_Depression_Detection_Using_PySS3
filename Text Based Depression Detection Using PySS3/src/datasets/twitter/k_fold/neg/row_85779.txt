I have every advantage possible - Why do I feel like shit still?I'm White. I'm Male. I'm Canadian.
I went to school. I played sports. 
I have more clothes than I need. I have a bed. I have a fan that I can run all night if I want to. 
I have a backyard. I have an in ground pool. I have a computer that has internet.
My parents love me, and always support me. They care about me more than I care about myself. They have never hurt me on purpose. They are always there for me. 
I have every advantage in life. Many would kill to be me. 

So why do I feel like shit all the time? Why do I never have the energy to even dress myself? Why can I not stop thinking about how bad I feel? How worthless I feel? I've been like this for 6 years and I can never see it changing.

I no longer feel grateful for being alive. I wish I was being melodramatic when I say that every moment feels like I am being tortured.
