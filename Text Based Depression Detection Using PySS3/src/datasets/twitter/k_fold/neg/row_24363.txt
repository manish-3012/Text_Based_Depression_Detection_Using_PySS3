My Friend is Also Depressed But Better Off Than MeSo one of my good friends went through inpatient not too long ago and is now back home and has been doing individual therapy for about two months now. I really love our friendship and she's helped me get through a lot in my life. But, something is seriously starting to bother me. She is very wealthy. I'm very poor. Now, I'm not trying to say that her depression is worthless or her recovery is rigged but ... It certainly feels that way? I know I should be happy for her recovering but she has it so much easier than me, it's not hard to see why she's doing so much better than me.

We're in the same boat, depressed and alienated, but she has so many more resources than I do. It's hard to feel for her or express my thoughts when I know how much better she has it. I feel awful for feeling this way when I know all she wants to do is help. But her help just doesn't feel genuine because of her support from her large family, her religion, her wealth, etc. These are things I don't have and when she tries to make me feel better, I end up just feeling worse.

Please help! What do I do? Do I tell her this? Should I stop talking to her?
