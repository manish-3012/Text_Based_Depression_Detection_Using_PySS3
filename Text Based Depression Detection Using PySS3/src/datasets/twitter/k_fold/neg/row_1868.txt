I [20M] need help talking to my suicidal friend [20M] 

I \[20M\] currently share an apartment with my friend \[20M\], his brother \[20M\] and his girlfriend \[19F\].

My friend was talking to his girlfriend and I about her needing to find a hobby since she has free time that she doesn't know what to do with. She mentioned that he also needs to find another hobby which I agreed with as he recently and his brother recently dropped out of university (his girlfriend and I still attend) and all he does all day is play video games. I know that video games can be a fine hobby but it takes up his day from the time he wakes up to the time he goes to sleep. When I suggested that they find a hobby that they could do together he rejected the idea. When his girlfriend said that she wasn't fond of him playing video games for around 10-16 hours a day he said that it keeps his mind off of suicide and that she would have to deal with it until he gets better.

He doesn't go to any counselling that I'm aware of and doesn't leave the house all that often except for things like running to the corner store or the grocery store.

Neither his brother nor his girlfriend are really in great mental places right now either so I'm not sure if they'll be up for having a serious talk with him.

I'm worried about him but I'm not sure what I should do, any advice would be appreciated.
