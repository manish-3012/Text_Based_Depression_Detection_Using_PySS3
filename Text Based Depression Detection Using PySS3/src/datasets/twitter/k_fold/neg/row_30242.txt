Death just feels so comforting.Death just feels so comforting.

Thinking about death, eternal nothingness - so to speak, just sounds so comforting. I look outside and observe its beauty. The trees, the sky. Its so nice, before i remember the burden of life. I just wish i was an animal, that couldnâ€™t have rational thought. Something like a bird, who could soar the skies, or a fish to swim the seas. Not having to worry about anything, no work, no sorrow, it all sounds so much better than life. This universe is so beautiful, and yet we waste our lives sitting on our asses. I dont understand - i cant understand. Which, is why id rather die.
