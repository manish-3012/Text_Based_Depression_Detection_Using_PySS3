I don't want to die. I just want to stop existing.I don't want to live anymore, but I do not want to hurt the people who love me. I don't even know why I feel like this. I just feel like I want to be gone forever. I have a family who loves me, a boyfriend who daily tells me that I mean the world to him... but still I feel like everyone would be better of without me. I've tried reaching out to doctors, counselors.. but no one seem to have any appointments for me (sick I know). I just don't know what to do. Please help me.
