I don't want to live and I feel like I'm getting closer to doing it.Day after day for the first week of my summer, my mom is up visiting my grandpa who has less than a few months to live, my idiotic dad is at work, and my brother hangs out with his friends all day since he can drive. This means most days I have to sit on the computer watching the days waste away as my summer slips through my fingers, the worst feeling ever. But that's just the tip of the iceberg; I'm a Christian, as is my family, and I'm gay
 My family would be devastated if they knew. So much crap is going on, and I feel physically sick keeping it bottled up all this time. I have no friends, I'm just not a very likeable person. I just need someone to talk to, because I just don't see the point of life. Go to school, get a job, lose all summer from working, get old, suffer and die while watching the same thing happen to everyone around you. Let's cut out the middle man. No one knows I'm gay, and let's keep it that way (rhyme). I haven't seen a therapist, and every day I just start sobbing out of loneliness, and I can't take this anymore. I'm just a wreck,  and I got like this from school. Bad teachers, work stress, and constant bullying which I won't go into detail. I just really need someone to talk to. If you want to skype chat (text chat) then I thank you in advance &lt;3
