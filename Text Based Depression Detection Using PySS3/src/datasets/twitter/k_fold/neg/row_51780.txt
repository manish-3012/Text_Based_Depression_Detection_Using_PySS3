I don't know what to doI was in depression a month ago but managed to get out of it, was pretty difficult but felt so goood. _x000D__x000D_I've been really stressed over the last few days. _x000D__x000D__x000D_I support a football club called Everton but somethings real wierd happened which has made me real sad. The season started two weeks ago and I've watched both of our matches but I did not feel anything for Everton. Did not feel happy when they scored a goal neither did feel sad when the opposition scored against us. I've been supporting everton from last year and when watching a match I used to be so fucking nervous, my heartbeat used to be so high - every minute. My ears would become hot when the opposition scored a goal against us. I don't feel any of this now and this makes me seriously sad. I don't even know what to do. _x000D__x000D_I want to die but don't have the balls to kill myself.
