What counts as an attempt?Does it count as a attempt if you start out intending to die but give up before completion? I tried to slit my wrists once, but the blade I was using was a little blunt and I couldn't find the willpower to slash hard enough. I also tried to hang myself twice, but the first time I pulled myself up once I started to pass out and the second time I tied the knot too loosely and it hurt too much for me to keep going. I'm trying to see whether it's worth seeing a doctor or if I'll just waste their time.
