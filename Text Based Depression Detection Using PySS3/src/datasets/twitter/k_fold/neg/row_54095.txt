Life is boring. I want to play a game before I die.I wish to end all my connections with friends and family, get on a train with as much money as possible and just go wild. I want to ruin my life over a span of 3-6 days, across the country. No money on any cards, only cash. The risk doesn't matter, being I plan to die when I run out of money and things to do. It won't matter how much I damage my body, my emotions, or other people. I'll be dead in less than a week after I start. I won't have to deal with the consequences, and any that I do have to deal with, I can off myself before they get too much. It's an unrealistic goal, though. I probably couldn't pull it off, so I guess I won't die for a good few months still. I just don't want to waste my time on Earth following stupid guidelines that ruin all the fun when I can live a much shorter life but live it in the most exhilarating way.
