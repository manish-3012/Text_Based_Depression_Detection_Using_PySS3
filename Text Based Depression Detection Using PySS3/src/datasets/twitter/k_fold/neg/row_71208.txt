We don't want to die we want the pain to endI don't really want to die... I don't want the pain. So my method of suicide is overdose. If my family can come to the realization that I'm depressed and I ACTUALLY AM suicidal then I would be able to get help. That's why I plan to overdose, not enough to kill me but close. Then maybe I could do something about my weight because my parents will realize that that's the main reason for me being suicidal. So what is the best medication to overdose with and what was the killing dosage? I'll go just under that and maybe survive, if I do die then... well I won't know and besides that wasn't my plan before this. If you will, just give me some answers... goodbye
