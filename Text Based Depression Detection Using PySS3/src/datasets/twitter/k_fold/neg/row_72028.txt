TrappedIâ€™m stuck and I hate it. I just wish I had a way out and the fact that I cannot figure a way to kill myself just makes my depression worse.  It has been 3 days and I have done absolutely nothing. I canâ€™t even open my text book to start my homework. Everything is so fucking difficult and I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. i just want to die. My life is a constant cycle of me circling back to this very point where I just want to die. My entire life is going to be me constantly wanting to commit. Things like using a gun or jumping off a bridge are too scary bc of how immediate it is. Plus Idk where a 17 year old can get a gun and I donâ€™t have any access to the top of high buildings and there arenâ€™t any big bridges near me. I have nothing strong enough to od on, idk which chemicals are the best to drink and how much would be enough. Plus, I canâ€™t even stand their smell so Idk how Iâ€™d be able to taste it and swallow it. And what if it doesnâ€™t work. And slitting my wrists could also not even result in my death, and how do you work up the nerve to do it. Fucking hell, can someone just kill me?
