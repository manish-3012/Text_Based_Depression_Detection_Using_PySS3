I need helpIâ€™m sure everyone of you reading this knows what itâ€™s like to have an extremely hard day when youâ€™re depressed. Most days I donâ€™t get out of bed unless I have to work. I dropped out of college this semester because I just canâ€™t bring myself to do anything. Iâ€™ve been fighting this battle since I was a teenager. My boyfriend does not understand depression at all and I do not have any friends where I live because I moved here for my boyfriend. Today all I wanted was someone to talk to. Something to take my mind of things for awhile and not think. He argued with me and told me he doesnâ€™t have time for me and isnâ€™t responsible for me laying in bed all day. I found these threads because I was googling how to make a noose out of bed sheets. Iâ€™m not sure what to do from here and want this to be over.
