I feel like a worthless pile of shitAnd I don't want to be here anymore. I used to stop myself from killing myself by thinking of my family and how much it would hurt them, now, that's not working. I was driving home from work and I just want to do it. Just drive away and pull over somewhere secluded and take a bunch of pills and walk into the woods until I collapse and die. 

People say "life is worth living". I don't think my life is. My life is just sadness and low self esteem and a blur of nothing. I work. I was going to try to go back to school for the fifth time. That's it. The one person I thought was a friend really hurt me today. And I don't want to bother anymore with my shitty self anymore. I have no one to talk to.

For years I've thought of killing myself. I can feel myself getting closer to just doing it. I want to do it. I know it'll hurt people...but now I just feel numb to that. I don't want to feel so awful anymore.
