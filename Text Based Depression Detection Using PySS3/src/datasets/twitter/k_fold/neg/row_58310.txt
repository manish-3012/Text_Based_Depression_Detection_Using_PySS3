Why?Why are we born then forced to stay alive till we die from old age? Am I the only person who wants to die, despite not having that many hardships? Sure, i am pretty isolated but Iâ€™m fine with that. I didnâ€™t have the choice to be born, yet Iâ€™m not allowed. Why? Is there something wrong with me?
