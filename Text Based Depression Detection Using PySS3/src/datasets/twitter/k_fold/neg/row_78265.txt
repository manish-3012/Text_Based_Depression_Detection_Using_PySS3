I'm supposed to be dead in 15 minuets.I made a deal, the fucker didn't honor it. I made an addendum, just to test my own sanity, the fucker honored that but then shows me the abyss before me. Why are you keeping me here? I already went to look at shotguns, I can already go buy one without issues, why am I still here? Why the fuck do you keep showing me the carrot, then the stick, over and over again? Why won't you let me be happy? I Told you time and time again all I wanted. I want someone to come home too. But you keep poisoning that well. I'm so lonely. I just want to die. Death takes all it calls its own in the end. Take me home. Out of this pain. These feeling will be gone. I changed the deal to the end of the year but ALREADY YOU MAKE THIS SHIT PAINFUL. STOP TOYING WITH ME, LEAVE ME ALONE OR LET ME DIE PLEASE YOU ASSHOLE I KNOW YOU SEE THIS....
