Rock bottom is really beginning to feel like home....I don't even know where to start. I genuinely don't care to see tomorrow. In the last year, I've been cheated on by my soon to be ex husband. After a rough night at his work with a 18yr old waitress hitting on him, my now ex best friend told me they'd been cheating for four months. I found out in late February 2020. In the beginning of February, I met someone (I'm polyam/enm) who quickly fueled emotions and feelings inside me I'd never felt before. I'd felt whole for the first time in my 27 years of living. 

Then Covid hit. I decided to stay with him. I couldn't stand to be quarantined with my husband. I spent time on and off in between places. I loved being with my new partner (NP).

Recently, I've really hit a mega depression. I'm financially, mentally, emotionally, and physically failing. I can't seem to keep my head above water. Between financial issues, having DID, severe Complex PTSD, politics, and the common SAD, I can't seem to keep my nose above water. To add on top of it, I feel completely worthless, or of no value. I feel completely unwanted by everyone in my life. Recently found out my grandma blames me for my marriage issues. Found out my other grandma is near her death bed. I can't do this anymore. 

I honestly don't care to see tomorrow. I really don't. I won't do anything and I'm physically safe, but I don't want to be here... I feel so alone... People touch me and I can't feel them. I'm scared.
