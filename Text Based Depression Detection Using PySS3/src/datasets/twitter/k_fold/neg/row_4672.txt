Just don't tell anyone. It is way too risky and not worth it. You're the only one who can help yourself and that sucks.**Basically whatever happens, there is always a chance of you killing yourself 3x more.** Yeah, there is a small chance of finding that unicorn that cares and understands and doesn't judge but really.. do you want to take those chances? It is like playing Russian Roulette with 5 bullets in the chamber. Sure, there is always one bullet that won't kill you but are you gonna take the 16.66% chance at life VS 83.34% chance at death? Would you even play Russian Roulette with a single bullet, which is the opposite &amp; way less risky? Think about it.

Most people won't really care &amp; it will only fortify your decision to go do it if you were unsure about it. They'll call you a coward and tell you it won't be right to do instead of providing reasons why you shouldn't kill yourself. Or you'll be made fun of because people don't treat suicidal thoughts as something real and serious because of all the shitty memes. Or they try to "help you" and you will be put in a mental hospital / jail cell and be even further pushed to kill yourself. Or they'll feel overwhelmed and will probably just dump you on the spot because they don't want to feel burdened. Just look at Katy Perry's meme "you just have to say you are fine but you are not really fine but you can never get into it because they'll never understand". It was the purest, honest, straight from the heart cry for help that has been rendered to nothing but a stupid suicide joke meme and when Katy Perry offs herself people will be like "oooOooHh HoW'd ThaT haPpEn wE could NEEEVER seE iT coMinG". I fucking hate that meme.

And I hate the fact that most people say "i dont know how/why they'd kill themselves, they had a nice life and all". Yeah, some suicides can be done that way where something just clicks and they do something stupid but 9/10 times people ignore the warning signs and it pisses me off. Not many people really give a shit, depressed thoughts are treated as a joke and suicidal people are never taken seriously until it happens. At least in this sub people take it seriously but honestly the whole existence of this sub is kinda sad and pathetic about this world. People shouldn't reach out to random strangers for this. Don't get me wrong, this subreddit is sort of a godsend of good side of humanity but there should be less than 100 people subscribed here instead of over 100k. The suicidal people should reach to their communities and people who know them and want to help them. I shouldn't reach out to Reddit's PhysicalInjuryWatch to fix a broken arm **and I don't.** But, alas, it is just how it is. Sucks.

I wish it was different but it isn't. As much as it sucks to say this; nobody can help you but you yourself. Not anyone in here, either. Some people can offer amazing help &amp; insight but if it isn't accepted then it isn't really worth anything. If someone wants to kill themselves, nothing will really stop them. Yeah, people will take advice but at the end of the day it is them who chose to take (or not take) that advice. **So, what should you do?** Try your best to make yourself happy, find a purpose in life, work hard towards your goals, don't feel guilty about looking out for yourself, if you have to force yourself to do something that'd be good for you because depression makes it hard then force yourself &amp; most importantly get a good environment surrounded by people you can trust.. and if you find that someone who cares, well, just cherish them and make it worth for them 10 fold. There is nothing wrong about pills, either. If your life is in order but you are suicidal then you might just have something missing and pills could help with that.

If nothing else works out and you really wanna kill yourself.. well, hey, you tried your best. Life sucks. It is hard and stupid and unforgiving for some people. If you gotta go, you gotta. I won't encourage you because I am not pro suicide but telling you not to do it when you're at your wits end and literally tried everything would be selfish and cruel. I won't judge you.. but make sure to really try your best first before anything else. If you can't, then.. whatever. I still won't judge you. I'll just be sad and think there was a chance for something better and more.
