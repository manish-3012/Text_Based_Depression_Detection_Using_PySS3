I'm done with it all. Any tips?First of all, if you're going to comment "it'll get better" or "go to a therapist" please don't bother. I understand all of that 100% but I just don't want to hear it right now. 

I want to kill myself. I want to do it tonight. The only reason I've never properly attempted before (I had an "attempt" a few months ago that I pussied out of absolute last minute and I've had other planned attempts that I've been too scared to do) is because I'm so scared of pain. I hate pain and I hate the idea of laying around in agony for hours. Please can someone just tell me how to do it relatively painlessly or at least very quickly. I live somewhere were firearms aren't available and I have access to what you'd have in a normal house I guess, so no cyanide or anything, and no rope or anywhere to hang a noose from either. 

Also sorry for posting this here I have literally no idea where else to go.
