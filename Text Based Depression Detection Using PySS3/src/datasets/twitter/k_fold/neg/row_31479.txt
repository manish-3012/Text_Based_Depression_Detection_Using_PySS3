Dead before 18.There's this date on my calendar, some day in April, where I turn eighteen. I don't intend to be alive then.

I've filled this account with posts detailing my spiraling down for months, spent days and weeks toying with the idea of suicide, wrote and erased letters and notes. I've swallowed pills and I've trusted the vice of narcotics to grant me any relief; and I stand unfazed. I've talked to people I shouldn't have, sought support for far too long and wandered mindlessly far too much.

I choose to exert my maximum, radical liberty in deciding to shut down any further act of freedom. I choose to end this life before April 25th, 2019.
