I want to kill myself more and more with each passing dayI don't see the point in trying anymore. I will never be the person I want to be. I simply do not have the motivation to make it there. I will never find a lover, and live in my dream home, because I'm ugly inside &amp; out and my lack of motivation will lead me to a job where I have to slave away and not make enough income to live in that home. I think that all but 2 of my friends (who are long distance and I rarely talk to these days) are plotting against me. I think they enjoy watching me suffer. It's okay though, because I love them and I deserve to be in all of this pain anyway. I can't make new friends and replace them so it's better to have them than to be lonely. I let my family down each day and they don't know that yet, but they'll find out soon. Maybe if I just kill myself I won't burden anyone anymore. Everyone will be free from my bs and move on to bigger and better things. A world without me would be so happy. Anyone who disagrees is in denial.
