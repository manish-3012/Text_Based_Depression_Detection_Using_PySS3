i'm too much of a cowardi put the belt around my neck and around the pole in my closet but i couldn't bring myself to tighten it. but strangely i felt very peaceful right before when i figured i should just end things right here and now. but when i had the belt around me i just got scared that it would hurt and i just imagined how horrific my dead body would look. So I couldn't do it. I should do it, but I can't. I almost sent a goodbye text to someone i haven't spoken to in 6 months. would they even care? I doubt it, and I'm being completely serious when i say that. 

I keep staring at the belt because i know it's my real only way out. I've already reached my peak and now it's over. The rest is just more of this, more pain and more failure and more delusion. I need to get out.

I wish I had the courage.
