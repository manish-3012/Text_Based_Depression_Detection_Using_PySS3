Everyone has been accommodating for me my entire life. I feel like a burden, and I think it would be best to stop living.I thought I was done feeling like this. I am disabled and my entire family has supported me since I was a child. It's gotten to a point where I thought I was not burdening them too much anymore, but then I got into an argument with my sister and she told me that everyone does so much for me all the time and the least I could do is support them as well. 

I don't know why I thought I was pulling an equal weight in this family. I wish I was dead. No matter how hard I try, it will never get better. All I do is upset the order of things and create conflict. It would be better if I was gone.

Sorry for the rant. I don't know if anyone will read this, and I really don't care. I just needed to say it to someone. Thank you for listening.
