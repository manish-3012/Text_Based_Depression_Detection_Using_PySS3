Of my 4 options, suicide is the only one that doesn't hurt to consider.I'm turning 18 soon, and the parent I live with made it pretty clear that they resent how much money I've cost them, speaking similarly about their stressful divorce. They even accused me of intentionally getting put on psychiatric holds to hurt their finances. Continued to tell me how worthless I am, how I'm going to lose my job and everyone will hate me. If I stay here after I'm 18, I'll have to give him all my money, which I need to eat, wear clothes, and hopefully attend college. The only other solution where I get to stay here is homelessness. I don't know how I'll keep my job and not be apparently homeless if that happens.

My other option is to move across the country and live with my other parent. I haven't talked to them in years, and when I was in their custody, they were even more vebally and physically abusive.

The only other way I see is if I just end it . I won't have to worry about where to stay, I won't have to take verbal abuse and get kicked out if I complain. I haven't felt this way in a long time, but I don't think I'd feel any better in any of those scenarios. I think I'd feel worse.
