Any point in trying?I've tried, I've tried to get my life back on track, but every time I try, I just go back to square one, since I dropped out of school I haven't even made any real progress, I've got no good grades, no friends, no job, nothing.

I'm absolutely pathetic and worthless, I can't do anything for myself, I just fucked up opening a tin of ham, I can't take a bus by myself, I need help just doing anything. 

I try and I try and I get nowhere, I don't see the point, I hate life and I have nothing to live for, never had a girlfriend and never will despite I'm probably to only guy in my city who *isn't* looking for cheap sex.

So what's the point, nothing to live for and I hate my life, nothing positive has ever happened in my life and I'm not going to get anywhere in life so why don't I give up? I've already lost so what the point in fighting a battle already lost.
