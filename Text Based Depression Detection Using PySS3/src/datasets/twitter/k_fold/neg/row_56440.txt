I think Iâ€™m just gonna do it.Iâ€™m a 13 year old male. My mental state has been declining for the past 10 months. Almost every day I have thought of and been fantasizing about suicide. I have friends, and a girlfriend. I live in a small house with 6 of my family members. I never get time to myself. My dad left us, my brother is dead. Iâ€™ve just been thinking about suicide every night. Why would I keep living if Iâ€™m gonna die anyways? â€œEnjoy the journey!â€ Iâ€™m not enjoying it right now. Iâ€™d rather die than continue living on this wretched planet. It doesnâ€™t matter if I somehow make it to 80 years of age. Iâ€™m gonna die and lose all my memories anways. Everyone is. Everything Iâ€™ve collected from my life will be gone. Iâ€™m not enjoying life and probably wonâ€™t in the future. I should just kill myself and end it all.
