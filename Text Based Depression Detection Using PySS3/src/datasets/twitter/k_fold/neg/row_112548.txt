I just need to talk to someone.I really feel like this is it for me, even though I know this feeling will pass and I will return to my depression, only for it to come back again. I feel like I can't die. I can't decide whether or not to kill myself, and it's infuriating. I don't know why I can't just go through with it, it's pretty awful living like this. I'd just like someone to speak to. I don't have any friends or anyone to talk to so I have nowhere else to go.
