not sure if i can survive self-quarantinei am dreading being stuck in my home. iâ€™m already so depressed and barely hanging on by a thread. my boyfriend and i live together so iâ€™m not alone, but i have been considering leaving him for a while now and being around him makes me feel immense guilt. i work from home so iâ€™m used to being there a lot, but running errands and going to the gym and hanging with friends on the weekends has helped me find reasons to keep going. being stuck in my house i think might bring me to my end. i am already so done with living and i think this will be the time for me to go.
