at an all time lowhi everyone!! im just going to try and be no filter and spill out my thoughts because ive been holding them in for a while. some context though, im 17 years old going into senior year and right now im just at a really low point. i suffer with anxiety and depression and have been on meds for them before but im not right now. im dealing with a lot of insecurity issues, and feeling lonely and just hopeless. i was going to go into details on my issues but i mean i doubt anyone cares lol so ill keep it as simple as i can. this is super embarrassing to admit lol but i havent showered in like a week and a half or maybe even 2 weeks i lost count at this point and i havent done my face routine or anything in a while i just cant bring myself to. it seems the anxiety and depression is making me so lazy and i feel like a different person. like i said ive dealt with depression for a little bit but this time it feels a lot worse, it feels almost unstoppable.  along with that i just feel kind of lonely and i just feel like ill never be able to find close friends because of just how i am or even a relationship in the future. and even then everything seems very meaningless too. ive been suicidal for a long time and this isnt a suicide note or anything, but its very tiring just not caring anymore about life. i used to be so excited about college and living in a dorm but now i just cant seem to care anymore about applying to schools. i just dont see the point anymore. my words dont do justice on how much im hurting on the inside. thanks for anyone who read &lt;3 means a lot
