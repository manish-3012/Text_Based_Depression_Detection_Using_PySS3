A thank youA week ago today I tried to kill myself.

It was rough. Mom found out, she got pissed. I posted here, and pretty much went radio silent. Well, got good news. I ended up in a mental hospital inpatient programs for 6 days. I started an antidepressant. I am headed to 2-4 weeks of partial outpatient. I just wanted to thank the people here for what you do, you change lives. Theres a scale the doctors gave me of how liveable I am. 0 is so bad you're like comatose, 100 is that your life is pretty much perfect. 6 days ago I was at a 10. Now I'm at a 50.

Keep doing what you are doing. Love you all. Peace.
