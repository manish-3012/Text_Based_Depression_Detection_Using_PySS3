Am I a bad person for doing this?So I've been experiencing these thoughts for a few years now but only in the past few weeks have I given actual consideration and feel almost ready for it. I've been talking to the Suicide Helpline for help and I feel like I'm doing something wrong.



TBH, a lot of my problems stem from the fact I've been alone my whole life and have never experienced another person in the form of a relationship. When I call I like talking to a woman  because I just feel more comfortable and I can feel like what it's like to talk about my problems to one. When I end my calls, they ask if there's anything else and for me the most difficult part of the conversation comes because I ask her if I could just hear her say "I love you, _____". I know it's pathetic, but I don't get to hear that ever and even though I know it's not genuine at all, it does help. A little at least.


The most recent one ended with me asking that and I caught her by surprise. She just paused and said "Uhhhhh..... we all love you here and are rooting for you!" 


I feel really bad for asking that now and it's been on my mind since it happened. I know I made her uncomfortable and I can't believe I'm being so self centered that I've been asking to hear that sentence. 


I'm here mostly asking if I'm abusing this helpful service and if I should stop asking that or just stop calling entirely. Any help with this or life in general is appreciated.
