Life has fallen apart in less than 5 months 

Backstory, so this has been the worst year for me. My life hasn't been the easiest overall but ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar 5 years, it has been looking up. I was given seroquel and lithium to treat it and it enable me to function in school

I began college last year in the autumn and was working part time but when March came things took a turn for the worst. School was dismissed, then my mother lost her job a month later, then just two months ago the pandemic payment run out so we knew by September, we were living off savings and going to be homeless.

I'm not really worried about being homeless as there's a hostel which isn't too bad in my country as much as how I'm going to cope without medication.

I'm wondering is there a point in even continuing. Should I just off myself?
