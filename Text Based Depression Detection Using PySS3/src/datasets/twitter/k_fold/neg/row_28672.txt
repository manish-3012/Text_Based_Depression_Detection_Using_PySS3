I don't actually want to kill myself, I just don't know any other optionHeyo, so I'll start by saying that I am a 29 year old married guy with three kids. I absolutely love my kids. I've been married for about 7 years and during that time, I've struggled off and on with an addiction to pornography. My wife and I are religious and we are raising our kids as Christians. Just to give you some context. I went through a point when my addiction was deeply secret. This lead to it becoming uncontrollable. 

Eventually, I cheated on my wife. I regret it deeply and I felt the need to "confess" to God, my wife, and my church leaders. I did and my wife eventually forgave me and her trust is beginning to show again. About 3 years ago I started getting into pornography again. This time, it was much harder to control and I became even more secretive about it. This is when I should have got help. I didn't and I've done many things that I honestly feel like I could never be forgiven for by God or my wife. I've cheated on my wife with 3 men and 2 women. 

I hate myself for it. I know I shouldn't have done it. I hate that I'm leading a double life. I know I need to confess. I don't know how to tell my wife. I've already messed up once before but this seems so much bigger. I want to be a dad and a husband but I know I am failing at both. I am torn between keeping this secret and telling my wife. I know if I do tell her, it will break her heart and she may leave me and take our kids. Because I'm so torn about what to do, I've thought about killing myself. I've already typed out my suicide letter. This way I won't have to deal with this tremendous guilt but I also won't break my wife's heart and get my kids taken away. My kids will be sad at first, but in the long run they will be better off without a dad who is a hypocritical P.O.S. Perhaps, my wife will re-marry someday and my kids could have a better dad than I ever was.
