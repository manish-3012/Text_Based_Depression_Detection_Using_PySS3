Can you hire someone to visit your animals?They'll be fine if/when I kill myself. My dogs live with my father, and my parrot's going to a sanctuary not too far from my house. I just want to make sure people will be play with them, love them. etc. 

Probably going to do it in the next couple of weeks.
