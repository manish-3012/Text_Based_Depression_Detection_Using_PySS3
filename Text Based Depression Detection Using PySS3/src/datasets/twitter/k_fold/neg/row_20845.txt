i feel so aloneI JUST FEEL SO ALONE
Like nobody is listening, they say they are but when it comes down to it, iâ€™m by myself 

im currently on the verge of getting kicked out by my sister, arguing with another sister 24/7 i found out by my cousin that the boy i was falling for was actually getting close with my other cousin, i donâ€™t have a job i donâ€™t have my license i donâ€™t have a car.. my mum isnâ€™t here anymore, my dad has his own problems and we arenâ€™t close
my best friend tries to help by drinking alcohol and partying but it only makes matters worse

i feel like giving up, thereâ€™s nothing i can do anymore.. iâ€™ve tried applying for jobs, i tried going for my license but i failed, i tried everything, i seriously feel like a waste of oxygen and i just shouldnâ€™t be here
