How long until things get better?I suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) when I was 16 years old. Prior to that I had some issues with depression and anxiety, though since I've been diagnosed with a myriad of other illnesses including schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and depressive bi-polar. Only after these past 6 months did I realize there is a direct correlation between my head injury and my mental illness. Every day is worse than the last. Every night the nightmares get worse. I'm so dug into my sadness and self pity that I don't see a way out. On top of that my mental illness is what caused the most traumatic break up of my life. She wants nothing to do with me. I'm too much for her, my parents, or even my old friends. She was the only spark of happiness I've had that I can remember. It may seem foolish. Everyone tells me it's just young love. But it's been months and she's moved on. And all I do is dream about her leaving me all over again for that other guy. All I think about is how she is laughing and experiencing happiness with someone else. I can't get my mind off of it no matter how hard I try. And now I finally have a plan that will work. I've tried overdosing in the past but have only ever ended up in the hospital. Those are my worst regrets. Not completing my suicide attempts. But this time I have a plan with minimal pain and quickness. I made a note. And I'm just waiting to act on it. I need something. Something other than these empty words of encouragement everyone gives me telling me "it gets easier." I can't see myself loving anyone again and if that's the cause for me leaving than so be it. I just want a reason to continue. I want to be happy. I don't want to hurt my family by hurting myself but I see it as my only way out. I'm scared and apathetic all at the same time. Please help.
