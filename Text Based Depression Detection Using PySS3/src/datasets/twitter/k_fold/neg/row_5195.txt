I'm gonna get fucked up on sunday and kill myself.I feel like it will be the only way that I'm actually not gonna pussy out of it. Gonna buy some good booze, get high as fuck, listen to some songs and find some good place to jump from. I'm gonna try and write some things for my gf and  probably something to my family too on saturday. They all hate me now anyway, depression made me a bad person I guess. I don't do bad stuff to anyone and I like to think that I'm actually pretty emphatic and nice person in overall. But that seems to be bullshit. It doesn't feel like they will miss me at all and I know for a fact their life will be better off without a burden like me. But I know everyone will tear up once they found out, it's so fucked, I can guarantee that people who literally tell me how ugly of a person I am, that they can't talk to me etc, will be the one that will be crying the most. Acting like they cared, especially my mum. I know it's not up to me to decide ( ironic af but whatever) but I don't want a funeral, I will write it in the note fully expecting them to not oblige me. Oh well.
