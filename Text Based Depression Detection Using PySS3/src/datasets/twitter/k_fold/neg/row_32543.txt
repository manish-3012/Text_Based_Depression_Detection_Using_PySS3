FINALLY found the perfect plan, I don't expect to last the month.I've been wanting to commit suicide for the last 10 years, the only problem has been finding a suitable plan. I've had multiple attempts but they have all failed for one reason or the other. Usually they seem perfect in my mind but in reality it never is that simple. 

I once tried to put a lawnmower in my car and asphyxiate with the fumes but the fucking thing wouldn't fit. I also have access to guns but you have to have A LOT of determination to shoot yourself in the head AND there's also the risk of surviving. Another time I went into the forest with two bottles of vodka, hoping a wolf or something would eat me but I vomited after half a bottle and gave up. Basically, billions of years of evolution have made it hard to kill yourself.

Well, today I finally found the perfect plan. It's extremely simple, I don't need to buy any extra equipment, it's almost failsafe and it's painless...

You just loop a belt, attach another belt with its buckle, pass it over a door and close it. The noose should be low enough so that you can comfortably stand but high enough so that if you kneel down it will choke you. I already tried it on and could feel myself fading away (not asphyxiating, but cutting off blood supply to the brain). It's slightly uncomfortable and I got scared at the last second, but both of these problems can be solved with alcohol.

I'm so happy knowing that I'm just a bad day away from finally committing suicide, I just wanted to share this with someone (canÂ´t really do that IRL). I'm so tired of feeling anxious and depressed all the time that this will truly be a relief.
