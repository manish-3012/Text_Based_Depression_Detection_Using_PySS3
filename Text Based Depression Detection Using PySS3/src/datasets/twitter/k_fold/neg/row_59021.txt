Iâ€™m gonna try tonightIâ€™m at my wits end. Trying to get out, but I just canâ€™t it seems. My whole family thinks Iâ€™m useless. Iâ€™m going to shoot myself tomorrow, or tonight, or now. I love my boyfriend but heâ€™ is the only thing I have. I donâ€™t deserve him. Iâ€™m sorry it has to be like this for him. For my friends. I do everything for my family. Everything and anything. Itâ€™s never enough. I want them to see what theyve done to me. I want my revenge on them and the world. Merry Christmas to them, I guess. Itâ€™ll be the gift theyâ€™ve always wanted.
