Tired...**Option 1: carry on...**

Positives: You have to potential to do something with your life that you might enjoy. e.g. owning property, paying off your debts so nobody is burdened by you.

Negatives: Carrying the burden of untreatable depression and anxiety... which will mean that you won't ever actually achieve anything in your life. The reality is many years of being a lazy, piece of shit.

**Option 2: die...**

Positives: This nightmare ends. No more anxiety, depression, constant headaches, brain fogs, auras, visions...

Negatives: No way to guarantee death - risk of survival and severe disability. 

I wish there were a guarantee. I'm so tired. I don't belong here, I should be dead... it's not like the change would even make a difference, nobody is going to miss a lazy piece of shit who contributes nothing to society. I'm so lazy I can't be even bothered to find a foolproof means of dying...
