I feel hopeless, at a dead end, and extremely lonely.I have read the posts here for a while and have really been humbled at how strong you all are. It is amazing what people go though and survive...it is no accident all of you are here. Please do not let my feelings bring up something in you that is bad for your happiness, etc. I also realize that compared to a lot of you my problems aren't "bad" but as I heard once, just because someone bleeds doesn't mean you don't bruise....I can't talk to anyone about  this really so I've decided to use my anonymity to my advantage and hope this helps.   


  
My mother is dying. I don't really want to specify of what but this has gone on for months, I've thought about killing myself so much to the point of writing a note...but I can't, because my mother still needs me.

These feelings go back to a few years ago, when a guy I loved did some things he should not have done. I wanted to have a talk with him and make it alright, and I ended up in a car alone with him being shouted at that I was a waste of his time and that he regrets ever knowing me or my family. This is a person I trusted a lot, way too much, so the degrading things he told me were things that, for the longest time, I believed. After this I wanted to be strong but I wasn't. I descended into self-harm, for months, and nearly overdosed multiple times. When my family found the scars, there was even more hell to pay and I was sent to a counselor. All she did was ask me how I felt and this didn't help me at all.

That self-harm relapsed a few times for various instances and I am still dealing with the scars, which remind me every day how weak I was. I feel like it will never release me.

Because of my mother's condition, she has become very weak and dependent on me. I hardly ever go out. So many friends have left me because when they ask how things are going, I cannot be honest without "bringing them down" with the not-so-great news. It disappoints me that these were people I trusted who are not there for me when things are not all perfect. The friends I have left are wonderful in every way but only recently was I less afraid to tell them that I'm indeed \*not\* alright and very afraid for the future. Sadly they live far away and are all fairly busy with their lives. I am happy for them but have no support. My family members outside my household want nothing to do with me or the ones I live with. I didn't even get a card at Christmas from my aunts, etc. and I don't think I've talked to my cousins even casually for about 7 or 8 years. The little ones whose lives I wanted to be part of don't even recognize me when they see me. No one was there for me when I was suicidal, so I bottled it up, only to have people rage and me and roast me constantly as to why. It is self-explanatory..

I am worried about my future; that one of the last person who cares about me is covered up with anxiety and is on their way out as far as I can see. I'm worried that I won't be able to pay for my education, worried that I am stuck here forever, and worried that this stress is causing me to isolate myself and feel even worse for being lonely. I worry that it is my fault that I ended up this way, that I should trust more people, take risks...but then I remember times I did when all that occurred was that I would get hurt by those people for doing so.   


My hair is falling out because of stress, I am lonely, I feel like I cannot be honest, and I feel like I am putting on a good face for my mother (which is all too often not good enough) when really on the inside I am a shattered mirror of what I used to be and I'm stabbing myself and other people with the pieces.
