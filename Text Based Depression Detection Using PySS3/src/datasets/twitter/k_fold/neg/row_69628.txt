no point to existencejust don't feel like i can go on anymore.   I've been depressed for years and nothing has changed.  I've put in effort to be more involved in life since i used to be homebound  but that has left me feeling more alone and dissconnected then ever.  i really don't know where to turn and i can't imagaine the pain of exisiting like this for years to come.  i really  wish i knew no one and had no family/friends so i could get this over with and not make any one else feel bad like i do.
