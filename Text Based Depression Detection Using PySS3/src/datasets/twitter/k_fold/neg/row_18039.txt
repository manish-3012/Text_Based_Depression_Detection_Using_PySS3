It's 3:40am, and I can't sleep.I've got serious suicidal urges right now and I may go through with it very soon, looking at what has happened in my life lately. Plus it'll be beneficial for everyone else. I've have this overwhelming feeling of guilt within me, even though I didn't do anything wrong. I need help, but I don't have anywhere to get it anymore.
