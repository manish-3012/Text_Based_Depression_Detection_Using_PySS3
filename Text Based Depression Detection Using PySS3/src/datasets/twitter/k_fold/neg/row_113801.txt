My Depression isnt Good Enough.I would like to preface this by saying that I wrote this in a notepad in the middle of the night while pretty intoxicated, so be warned this may not make perfect sense, but I need to actually reach out for once and voice my thoughts. So even if this dies in new, at least I finally fucking said something.

I dont even know if I have it. Ive never gotten it diagnosed because I dont think I legally can yet, and there is no way I can talk to my parents about it. I can definetly say for certain that I feel a certain degree of 'sadness' but alot of the time I dont know if I'm just making it up for attention. Im only fucking 17 right now, and for the past 4 years I've tried to get help from friends but they've only told me to 'suck it up' or that im just looking for attention. I've been told that I'm normal, and that I'm dumb for feeling the way that I feel, and I think I beleive them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wont do it . I know I wont. I want to, I want to more than anything, but I cant. Ive tried, but I havent even gotten as far as to write a fucking goodbye note. I cut myself occasionally but even that doesnt help much anymore. I feel sometimes like I need to do it to finally justify my emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the very worst part is I know its my own fault. Its my own fault for beleiving my 'friends' and for staying with them for this long, but I have no one else. Im very very introverted so meeting new people is virtually impossible. Hell, the only reason I can open up this much is because I'm sleep deprived and fairly high.

&amp;#x200B;

The fucking icing on the cake is that im quite privilaged in life. Im pretty much a spoiled brat, if I want something my parents will eventually buy it for me. And reading all these posts really show me how worse I could have it. Im insanely grateful for everything they have done for me, but it still wont make me happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive felt this way for at least 6 years, although it has intensified an extreme amount the past 2 years, from just having a general dissatisfaction with life to not having the motivation to do fucking anything, and constantly thinking about suicide.

Im abusing marijuana currently aswell. It helps, but im gaining tolerance faster than I can buy. Ive gone to 4-6 bowls a night. Its been like this for 4 months. I wont stop, I cant. I know I would be dead right now without it.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading back through this makes it seem like I'm depressed, no question. but im stuck in this infinite loop of self doubt and hatred of who I am currently. I think I know what I want for my life but im not 100% certain of anything, im scared of being wrong, of being made fun or being called stupid for the thoughts in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much more I wish I could say, but I cant put the way im feeling into words, hell half the time I dont even know how I'm feeling. Im tired of feeling this way, like I wont ever be enough for anyone or anything, and all ill amount to is a fucking hole in the ground.
