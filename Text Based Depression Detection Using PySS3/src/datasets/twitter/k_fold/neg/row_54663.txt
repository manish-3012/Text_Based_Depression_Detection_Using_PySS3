To live or not to liveMeh. Been suicidal for a long time now. Always put it off as I thought stuff would improve in the future.

But I have now realized that it is all not worth the effort. Sure, my life could improve if I put in the effort, but I am so far away. I am too tired, and I don't have the willpower or resolve to make any effort. 

The only thing that scares me about death is "what if I didn't die my life improved, kinda like in 'The Mist'". 

This is indeed a cry for help, not for someone to save me, but for someone to guide me towards a peaceful quick and dignified death. 

**Important bit here** -
**I am thinking of using a numbing spray and a very sharp knife to get to my carotid artery. Is this a good plan? PM me if you have suggestions to make this more 'painless' and quick.**

The only thing my note will probably say "please don't fucking bring me back, I will be irreversibly brain damaged and will cost my family a lotta money to keep me alive, who will have the stupid hope that I will recover some day".

I am kinda 80% sure about this. The rest 20% is "what if". I am scared. So scared. But it's gotta be done I guess, why must I suffer this more?
