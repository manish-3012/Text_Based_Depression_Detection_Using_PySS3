i just fail to see the point anymore.I've drafted this post several times in my head over the past twenty minutes or so in an attempt to figure out which way I can convey this without being longwinded and/or whiny.


I feel so very detached from the world. 

I feel like I'm missing some skill set that most other people seem to possess for handling the outside world. I can barely handle getting out of bed and tending to myself.

I'm quite intelligent, though, so I see what is happening and I can recognize it, but... Then because of that missing something, I end up paralyzed. 

I'm slowly running out of energy. And eventually, I'll implode. 

I don't mind. I recognize the fact that although I am intelligent, I have severe psychological issues that will likely limit my interaction with the world, and to be honest, I really want none of it. 


I don't remember the last time that I was happy. 


I don't want to be remember that I don't remember that...
