Iâ€™m lostI just donâ€™t know anymore, Iâ€™m from a different planet and I donâ€™t belong here. No matter how many people I surround myself with family/friends, no matter how happy I seem Iâ€™ve always felt so alone. everyone around me could say anything to try and make me feel better compliments, giving me attention and love but Iâ€™m numb. even when Iâ€™m alone trying to fight these thoughts trying to be happy with myself and grow i just canâ€™t do it.  Iâ€™m goofy and try to make the people around me laugh but deep down i feel like a piece of shit. I have no self worth and Iâ€™m drowning in my thoughts. Some days are better but I always seem to go right back to thought that no matter what I do I will never be happy.
