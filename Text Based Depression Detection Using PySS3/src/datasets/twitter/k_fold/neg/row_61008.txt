Iâ€™ve been planning to kill myself for a few months now. like setting things up to where I can. I think I should really dolike Iâ€™ve been getting rid of things so my family doesnâ€™t have to, Iâ€™ve been throwing away old diaries and stuff I wouldnâ€™t want my family to see or find, Iâ€™ve been figuring out how I want to do it, when and where. iâ€™ve been doing all this because I wanted to so many tines recently but then thought about all those things and felt I couldnâ€™t kill myself til I dealt with those things. my last and final thing I feel I should do is leave videos on a jump drive for the family I live with, and like people who used to be in my life, and then also write notes for my family. i feel itâ€™d be nice, if the ever even care. to have my writing as well as a video. once i do that, iâ€™ll clean off my laptop and phone and everything so they can easily sell them, and then iâ€™ll feel free to kill myself without any burdens
