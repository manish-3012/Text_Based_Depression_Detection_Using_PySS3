Tonight might be my last night, and im smiling.I will attempt suicide tonight. I have at best 8 hours left (if i succeed of course but i prefer not thinking about it). I wrote a suicide note to my friends, but i really dont know what to say in the letter to my family. I took a shower, brushed my teeth, put some nice clothes on, listening to some good music. I said goodbye to my dog and cat, they are so cute, i love them. I'll be taking a walk tonight, its 11pm so its dark outside, but a walk outside is something i wanted to do before dying. 

And i did all that with a smile on my face, a different smile. I've had a fake smile for the past 5 year and i really hate that smile. But now, i think its a real smile! I'm proud of it. I really feel like 8 hours is too small, but you need to do with what you have.

I eat out of necessity, i drink out of necessity, i breath out of necessity, i smile out of necessity, i sleep out of necessity, i woke up out of necessity. 

But now, i die by desire.
