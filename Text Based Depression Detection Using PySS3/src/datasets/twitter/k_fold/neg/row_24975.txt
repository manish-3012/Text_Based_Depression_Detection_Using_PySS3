Got paid to be used for a night...Wall of text probably incoming. And still, no matter what I write, no one will understand -_-

I'm 23 and have struggled with depression for years prior to this, which is partially what put me in such a vulnerable position. Needless to say that I feel a large part of this depression has come from the fact that I've never been in an intimate relationship with a girl, to the point where I slowly just started giving up. I figure I just must not be good enough.

So Wednesday night one bad decision leads to another. Drugs are involved. I end up in a hotel room with a stranger, who's offered to pay me to just hangout and do more drugs with him. I'm uncomfortable right from the start, but am an addict of sorts and also desperate for money. Anyways -- I'm sure you see where this is going and I'd rather spare you most of the details, but I just have to get some of this off my chest.

He didn't actually fuck me but I feel like he might as well have -- afterwards i started feeling really violated and raped. he got much closer and touchier than i would have preferred -- and at the times, it was easy enough to just blank out and keep binging on drugs, but then i didn't sleep for days afterwards. I still don't really have a permanent place, because during that night i missed curfew and ended up getting kicked out of the shelter that i had been staying at :/

i just really don't know how i'm going to be able to go through each day from now on, knowing that. I got $60 for my efforts. fuck me right. i wanna just go jump off a bridge; or in front of a train; or swim out to sea; or overdose on heroin; or buy a gun

I've just been smoking weed and drinking beer and trying to calm down and chill out, but the money's almost gone and time's dragging by. And the only bed i have access too is in a 'gay dorm' where there are guys all around me fucking each other
