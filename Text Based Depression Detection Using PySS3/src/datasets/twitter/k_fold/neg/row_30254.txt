Tried to buy razors [Vent]I just tried to buy razors with the intent of slitting my wrists some time this month, forgetting that you have to have be 18+ to do so. I have non at home that would be even remotely sharp enough. So now I'm sitting outside the store feeling like an idiot having failed an attempt before even attempting. If I can't even fucking do that right then how can I expect myself do to anything else right.
