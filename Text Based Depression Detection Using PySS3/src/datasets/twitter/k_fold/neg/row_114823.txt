I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreThese last 2 months Iâ€™ve had 4 friends commit suicide and one die in a car crash and i feel like I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore, nothing in my life is working, everything seems to be falling apart, and I canâ€™t stop it. I just donâ€™t know the reason i should keep living
