an interesting titlesorry for the shit title. i dont know what to title this. also not 100% sure this is the right place to post this but whatever. anyways, guess i'll just say what i wanted to say.

i cant see myself having any future at all. i cant see anything. anytime i try to imagine something realistic for myself it just turns out as me being fucking dead or its just blank. i know people in my life don't want me to die. but truth is i want to. i havent wanted to live for years. i cant imagine myself ever doing or being anything worthwhile. i know im nothing but a fucking piece of shit. im untalented. im ugly. im disgusting. im not worth anything. i just dont know what to do. being alive is hell. all i do is suffer. but i cant bring myself to end things bc ive already hurt everyone in my life enough. plus tbh im scared of killing myself being painful or death being terrible. i dont know what to do anymore and i guess ive come here to seek guidance or comfort or something. all i know is that life has been hell for over a decade and i cant see it getting any better.
