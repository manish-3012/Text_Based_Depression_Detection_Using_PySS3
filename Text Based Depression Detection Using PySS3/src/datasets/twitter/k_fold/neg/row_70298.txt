... my last attempt was on tuesdayI tried to end my life on Tuesday. I don't even know if you can call it a suicide attempt since I woke up in my bed hating life even more. Everything has just gotten so. As and as much as I was to open up to a few friends about it I know they won't care. I guess I'm so sick of listening to the thoughts and I kind of want to try again tonight..
