Someone please help me live through tonight.It's father's day, and my cousin's birthday tomorrow - I don't want to ruin my dad's and cousin's day. But I'm so close. I know how I want to do it. I know what my note's going to say. I even know what I'm going to wear. The thoughts are overwhelming at this point and I feel physically sick, I'm shaking. I want to cry but the tears won't come out. I don't want to be even more of a burden by fucking up everyone's day with my bullshit but I can't keep going on like this. Sorry if I'm whining or being weak and stupid. I just don't want to be alive.
