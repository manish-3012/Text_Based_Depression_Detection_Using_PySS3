Anybody here familiar with severe existential nihilism?I'm starting to really think that nothing matters. I feel like I'm losing everything I ever enjoyed in life but I still exist because of my huge fear of death and the unknown. So I just exist as this odd entity within this weird feeling that nothing I do has true value or consequence. Not just to me but to anybody. I start getting more and more apathetic to things I thought I'd care about so long as I live. But everything is emotionally falling out of my brain like some weird form of Dementia or something. Like I'm forgetting to care but I can't form those feelings again.

Does anybody have any familiarity with this feeling. Honestly I'm not even looking for solution. Just some form of understanding.
