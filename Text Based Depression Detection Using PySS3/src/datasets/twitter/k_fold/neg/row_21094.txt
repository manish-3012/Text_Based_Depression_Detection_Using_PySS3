I was going to do it today.I don't even know what stopped me. I keep distracting myself but it's only going to work for so long. I've worked so hard to get better, only for it to mean fuck all in the end. I don't know that I won't keep planning, or that I won't do it. 

I want to stop hurting. I want to live, I don't want to survive. The more I survive, the less of me there is. 

I'm not even sure what I'm doing here.
