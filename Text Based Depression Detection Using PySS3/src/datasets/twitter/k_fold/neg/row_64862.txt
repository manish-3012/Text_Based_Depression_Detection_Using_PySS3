The thoughts are coming back againI cant get them out of my head. I dont know what to do. I have an incredible girlfriend who is loving and just amazing. I m starting college in only a week. But I just wanna fucking do it. I just wanna end it all. I keep fantasizing about it. Usually it just comes in waves, but it hasn't been this bad in a long time. 

I wanna die so badly. But I also dont wanna die. It's so confusing. I wish I could just stop existing. But I know I cant. I just wish something would kill me. But I dont wanna leave my family and girlfriend in despair. What do I do? It keeps eating away at me. I dont wanna tell anyone so I dont worry them
