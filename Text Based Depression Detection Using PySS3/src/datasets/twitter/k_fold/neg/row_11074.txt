Too Scared of Hurting PeopleI contemplate dying everyday, but I can't bring myself to do it because I have a family and a good friend group who would really be hurt. I know many people who are struggling would love to have people there for them, but even though I do it doesn't help with the pain. If anything, after someone sees my self-harm scars or see me have a break down, I just feel ashamed and embarrassed and vulnerable and it makes me feel worse. Every day is the same pain and darkness and I wish I could just get release, but I can't because I don't want to fuck up life for my siblings or friends or mom. I don't know what to do.
