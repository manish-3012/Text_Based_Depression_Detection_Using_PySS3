Fuck this shitYou won't understand, or maybe you will, but I don't enjoy anything any more, haven't for years, I only gave people the perceived notion that I had fixed myself up but I'm really just dead on the inside. I thought living up to peoples expectations of me would make me happy. It only makes me want to die now. Exams in a week, and studying going shit. Why fucking bother?!

There's a window that opens all the way in the kitchen and I'm on the top floor of my building. Maybe people will try be a hero and comfort me,  but there're just wasting their time, the only person that can save me at this point is me. I've lived my whole life as a bitch and I'm taking the way out like a bitch. Bye.
