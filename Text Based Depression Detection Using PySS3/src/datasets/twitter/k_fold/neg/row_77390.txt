Just how I feelI just wanted to tell someone that I'm not doing too well. I can't talk about this with loved ones because they have enough on their plates. 

I recently lost someone I really love. She was my world. 

I've been sponging off loved ones for so long. I can't bring myself to face the world and get a job because I get really nervous and flustered talking to people face to face, and then I can't stop ruminating over every little thing said for weeks and sometimes for months and even years afterwards. Every time some of these interactions come to mind I just want to blow my brains out then and there.

I just want to be alone all the time, and I am alone almost all of the time.

I really want to pull my weight but I'm always so exhausted and paranoid. I get paranoid over every little thing. 

I battle to sleep properly, and when I do sleep, I have nightmares. I battle to focus and especially during verbal exchanges with people.

I really hate sponging off family. It makes me feel so worthless. So useless. So pathetic.

I've been through some pretty traumatic things in my past - and also not too long ago - that have really crushed me. I can't snap out of it. I just cannot get over it. I feel so ashamed and scared all of the time. 

I can't stop thinking about suicide. I have everything ready, but I haven't had the heart to go through with it. One of these nights, after a drink, I'm scared I might just do it.

I know that it will affect some people. God I am so sorry. But I don't see any other way through this. Circumstances just do not allow for any other options, and I will not keep letting my family feed and shelter me and spend their hard earned money on me. 

I am so stupid there are no words to describe just how stupid I am.

I'm really sorry fam. I'm really really so sorry. There were so many things I would loved to have done to help you and others who could use my help, but I'm starting to believe this world could do without me.
