I hope no one starts taking it seriously when I'm deadFuck everybody that didn't do anything despite me begging for help by mutilating my body because I was dying inside. Fuck you. Fuck everybody who knew I was hurting and didn't do anything. Fuck everybody who left me alone. Fuck my abusive parents who robbed me of a childhood and a chance at a normal life - they should have been the ones to suffer like this, NOT ME. Fuck my ex-boyfriend who made fun of my mental health and only used me for nudes. Fuck all of those people who called themselves friends, but always managed to be too fucking busy. Fuck sitting here every day all by myself, just waiting. Waiting for just ONE PERSON, and trying to not give up. Fuck this life. I don't even know why I stayed this long. The joke's on me because I stayed this fucking long. Fuck this life, and fuck everybody in it. There is no point to this shit, there never was.  


It's not NORMAL to suffer this way, EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY. I'm done telling people and having a little bit of hope that they'll care, just to be let down every fucking time - again and again. No one means what they say, and no one will stay. I guess I'm just too fucking useless.  


I've tried. I can't be all alone anymore, I can't do it by myself. Sorry I wasn't good enough. God, please give me the strength to end it this time, please
