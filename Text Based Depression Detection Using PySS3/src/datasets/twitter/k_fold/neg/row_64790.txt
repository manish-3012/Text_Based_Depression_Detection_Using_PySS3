It feels weird...I'm 20 years old, and I've been sad for a long time. I tried to kill myself when I was 13 years old, always had suicidal thoughts but I learned how to live with it for years, but I've been feeling really sad lately, since last year and this last months being the most difficult. I found myself contemplating suicide today with more confidence than I ever had. I just want to know if anyone else has felt like me, I been wanting to die since I was a kid.
