I'm worried about a friend of mineI feel like she might hurt or even kill herself. She allways seemed extremely depressed. I don't know where she lives currently and I can't text her anymore so the only contact I have with her is through instagram. Suddenly left an extremely emotional comment under something I have posted 16 days ago so I checked her profile and her bio is what worried me the most because it seems she is planning to commit suicide. I don't know what to do and I will never manage to live in peace if something happens to her
