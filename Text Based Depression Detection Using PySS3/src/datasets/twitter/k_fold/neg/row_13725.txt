Might do it soon.I'll begin a new job next week. It's an industrial labor job. I'll be working 12+ hour days.. I've been depressed for so long and increasingly suicidal. I just want to take the first paycheck I get and overdose on something. I'm 21, and dont know If I'm gonna make it.

I'm trying to think if life will be better, once I get out of my shitty home life.. but I don't think it will. I might be too damaged already.
