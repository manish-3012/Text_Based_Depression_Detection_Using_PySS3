I think my brother is going to or has committed suicide? PLEASE ANSWER!So my brother who's 21 years old has always had drug issues due to feeling alone or just not loved as he was growing up which is NOT TRUE, his drug habits and not listening to rules ended up getting him to leave the house at age 16.. He claims he was kicked out but after a yelling fight called our sister and lived with her, ended up getting kicked out due to drugs, moved in with our father and got kicked out due to drugs and not doing anything.   

So tonight my older sister got a text saying "I love you sister, please let the kids know I love them etc" is all I know that was texted to her atm.. Then we noticed he just deleted his facebook, which he would NEVER DO. I messaged a friend of his and  he said "I was with him last night and he seemed fine, but all of sudden today he is struggling"... Not much info there. Now he's not answering any phone calls and is MIA.   

I'm very scared for his life and I've always felt like he was depressed, he locks his emotions up and is always in denial or delusional.. Always trying to be someone he isn't and it's very sad... 

What do I do?
