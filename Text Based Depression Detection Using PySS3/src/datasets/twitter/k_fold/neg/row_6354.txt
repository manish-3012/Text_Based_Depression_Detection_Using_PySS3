9 months ago, I wrecked my car while trying to kill myselfI wake up every day wishing it would've worked.. I wish I wouldn't have been able to see the pain it brought on people, because I can't imagine what it would be like if I killed myself now. I'm so sick of being me, I don't want to be alive anymore but I can't do that to my mom and dad. I get my license back in 5 days and all I can think about is doing it right this time.. if there is a god, I fucking hate him for letting me live. This was the 4th time I've tried to kill myself and I was so sure it would work but it didn't and now I'm stuck here with the consequences. I'm so tired.. I'm ready for it to be over.. please just let it be over..
