tick tickI've known since birth something was off with me. I still don't know what exactly it is, but I know at this point it cannot be fixed. I do not want to continue hurting people and I do not want to wait to get fixed due to the fear of the more people I will hurt during the process. I knew it was going to happen soon, but did not realize how soon. I love you guys. I love my family. I love my friends and everyone I once knew throughout my life. I'm sorry I'm not a good person. I wish everyone would understand. goodbye. I wish nothing, but peace among us.
