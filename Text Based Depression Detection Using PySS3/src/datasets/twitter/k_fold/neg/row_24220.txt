Been mindfucked my whole lifeIâ€™m done with this world, i was constantly trying to be nice and help others, when most of them can only think about themselves and makes others feel bad,
constantly trying to understand why, only fucked my mind

now iâ€™m constantly trying to find reasons to stay alive, trying to balance the good from the bad, i try to only focus on the beautiful and nice things but the bullshit is overwhelming 
why would i keep trying to want to live, making big efforts 24/7 when 
i spend weeks trying to force myself into wanting to live, when sometimes, a single interaction destroys everything 

from my grandfather who is not able to listen, he talks 24/7 but when you want to talk he doesnâ€™t give a shit
he asks you questions like 3 times in a row, insisting on the Â«Â say what?Â Â» but still wonâ€™t listen to what you have to say, it may sound stupid and easily avoidable but i live with him and on the long term, it destroys your mind and self esteem 

to the people who spend their days outside observing the weakest person to steal from, or just to fuck with you and make you feel less than them

why yâ€™all saying being alive is a chance when all you do is avoiding being stolen from, being killed, hurt, robbed, raped, fucked with, just to appreciate the little things in life which arenâ€™t shit compared to this

only reason iâ€™m typing this is to get my thoughts straight, but i donâ€™t mind an answer

what iâ€™m trying to say is that iâ€™ve been trying to balance good and bad for way too long, i now know that the good isnâ€™t worth shit and even if it was, the bad will always be there to fuck everything up

i have no reasons to stay here anymore, iâ€™m tired of being constantly anxious, the smallest of interaction with a stranger and iâ€™m starting swearing, shaking, blushing cause i donâ€™t know if youâ€™re here to be nice or to mindfuck me 

the reasons to stay alive have been overshadowed by some humanâ€™s stupidity and selfishness 

i donâ€™t know when, but when time is right, iâ€™ll drive 2h to the closest/highest bridge, enjoy the last and only thing i liked about this world which is driving 

then iâ€™ll jump, hopefully dying instantly and rather painlessly

finally leaving this complete madness that is going on
