I'm going to commit suicide when I get home in a few hours.There just is no hope left for me in this world. I promised to give it a year and nothing is better. So today will be the day. The only person that will miss wil be my dad but I know he will be ok.
Update: I just got home and I'm preparing to do it now. I'm sorry I appreciate all your advice but I just can't live anymore.
