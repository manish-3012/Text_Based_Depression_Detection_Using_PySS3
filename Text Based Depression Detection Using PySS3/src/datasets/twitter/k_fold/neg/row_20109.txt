I wish nobody knew meI can make friends effortlessly, but I can never keep them. I don't know what's wrong with my personality, because I have no grasp of who I am. Everything I show people is an act, I go through interactions on autopilot. I never let anyone get close to me. It's because I feel I don't even deserve any relationships. If I let people get close, they'll hurt me or leave me so I have to keep them at a distance. Even so, I don't want to be alone. It hurts so much, but I'm too disgusting for this world. I want everyone to forget me. I want to die.
