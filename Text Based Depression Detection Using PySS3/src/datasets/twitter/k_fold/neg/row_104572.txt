One To Beam UpSometimes I really do believe that death is the next great adventure. That these bodies are but mortal shells that can be discarded in favour of a greater ascension.

I don't believe in Heaven and Hell but I do believe in the vastness of space and what could possibly lie beyond the known corners of the universe.

What if these bodies are nothing but time bombs, what if our souls are destined for a greater purpose?

People get mad at me for "wanting to die" and "wasting my youth" but they don't seem to realise that not everyone was cut out for this world, and I never chose to be here. I never wanted to be here and I want out. I've wanted out from the very start. I've never experienced true happiness and I just don't think I'm capable of it. Which is fine, better to be self-aware and have both eyes open to what's really going on.

And if it really is just the next step, then I just want to get out of here. I want to return to the stars. I don't want to be so far from them anymore.

I've got nothing and nobody to stay for. I've got no reason to remain in a world that has never shown me anything but melancholy and suffering.There's just no point in it. It's illogical, and time-consuming. I thought about joining the military solely with the intent of dying an unknown soldier, nothing more and nothing less.

But I don't want to die within the confines of gravity. To return to the stars, to become stardust again I have to die close to them. 

So to whoever is listening...one to beam up. 

I'm ready.
