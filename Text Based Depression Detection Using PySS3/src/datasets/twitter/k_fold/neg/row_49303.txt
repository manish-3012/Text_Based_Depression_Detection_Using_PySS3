The idea of death has always calmed meWhen our family almost got hit by a car I thought â€œthank godâ€. But my dad swerved in time. and when I woke halfway up due to the plane descending (a very loud noise and the feeling of free falling) I was still halfway asleep so I thought the plane was crashing for a second. And I remember feeling so at peace. I was nervous but overall I was so relieved. And then I realized that we were just landing. And then my stomach ache returned. I just want one day of being ok. I donâ€™t ask for happiness even though I want it. I just want one day.
