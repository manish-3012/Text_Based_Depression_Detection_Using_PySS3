Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of reckless things in hopes I might die because Iâ€™m too chicken shit to just do it myself.I honestly donâ€™t even know where to start with this but I can say that Iâ€™m not actively trying to commit suicide. When I was younger Iâ€™d have many occurring thoughts of â€œI could just not turn and drive my car off of this highway into a treeâ€ and things of those sorts, but I was usually pretty controlled. 
My mom died a little over a month ago now and since before I can remember I had plans to kill myself when she died. She was my adopted mom and fairly old and even got Parkinsonâ€™s Disease so I knew she wouldnâ€™t last much longer. When she did I had already returned back to my family and reconnected with them, so I knew I couldnâ€™t do anything. And now Iâ€™m just stuck in this place of constantly wanting something to just take me out. 
I drive excessively dangerous speeds to and from work (Iâ€™m talking over 125mph), picked a couple of fights with people I knew could rip me apart, taken just one more pill than recommended so that Iâ€™m knocked out for 12 hours, and my biggest (and most recent) one: 
I got fucking surgery and didnâ€™t follow any of the 10 day diet pre-op guidelines in hopes I would not wake up. 
But here I still am. 
Iâ€™m supposed to turn over a new leaf with this surgery and lose a ton of weight (Iâ€™ve been a fat bitch since before I was adopted), and in my good moments that sounds absolutely amazing. Thereâ€™s a lot of active things Iâ€™ve thought Iâ€™ve wanted to do. 
But thereâ€™s also the huge part of me that just wants to eat something huge so itâ€™ll rip up my new stomach and kill me. 
Anyway if this doesnâ€™t get deleted and you read this far thanks I guess. I know I have to go back to therapy and thereâ€™s not really much anyone can say to this. But it felt really good to finally get this off of my chest. Iâ€™ve been feeling really guilty about how excited my family members are about my surgery with them not even realizing that I would be even more excited for one of them to put a bullet to my head.
