The parts of me.I have lots of parts of me that make me mentally ill; parts of me that mentally well people just can't understand. 
There's a part of me that says I am worthless and trash and will never amount to anything. A daily routine of self hatred: wake up, hate, sleep, repeat.
Another part of me that says no matter what, I can't speak out against others. My survival instinct. I am inferior, only a servant to those who are successful and talented and beautiful. They know better. Listen and obey, or face the consequences I know so well.
A part of me that says I escalated to this point for attention. So I tell no one. Never give them the ability to call me a liar. I know what I feel.
But the next part says I don't. My feelings are irrelevant and made up and bullshit and I need to get a grip.
There's a part of me that's the actress. The fake smiles. The "I'm fine"s. The feigning ignorance, happiness, content.
Then the part of me that keeps me alive. Empathy. Because no matter what I do, I have so much love in my soul. An infinite cacophony of love and happiness and understanding for *others* that resounds in my heart.  I give all the love that was intended for **me**, to anyone who needs/ wants it.
The last part is the silence. Periods of blanks stares and mental battles and hunched shoulders.     The silence, for me, is dangerous. It means I'm thinking too much and not enough. It means the my will has broken and my energy has vanished and I'm close to the edge and *I need it to end*.
I've had a lot of silence these past few weeks.

TL;DR
I try hard to explain what I'm going through to my friends and family and they just don't understand how complex it is. This was just a little ramble of how I feel.
