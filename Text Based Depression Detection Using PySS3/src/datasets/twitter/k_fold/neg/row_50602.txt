Deciding when you don't deserve to liveLet me introduce myself; I am a 19 year old female who struggles daily. Growing up, I had an abusive father. My parents split when I was 15. My father kicked me out at 17. My boyfriend's family took me in. After being kicked out, I tried reuniting with my family. My siblings shamed me for feeling bad about myself because I "had it easier" than they did. My mother tries to be in my life but currently puts all of her dates in front of our trying relationship. I currently have 1 friend who somehow manages to stay with me through everything. I've pushed all other friends away with my inconsistency. In a 10 minute span, I could go from being happy and okay, to zoning out completely, to snapping abruptly on them, to being okay. Most people cant handle that constant change of attitude from someone and I dont blame them. My boyfriend's family, they clearly are tired of me being around. My boyfriend is trying to help but he doesnt understand so he's not the best at helping and I can tell he's getting tired. So what's the point? Where's the rope to cling to, to pull yourself from the drainage? At what point do you consider yourself a waste of fresh air? When do you know that enough is enough and there's no more air for you to breath?
