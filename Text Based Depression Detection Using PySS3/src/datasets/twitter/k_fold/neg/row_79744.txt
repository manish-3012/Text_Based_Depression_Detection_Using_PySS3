My parents think I'm the "chosen one" in my family and got my 3 sisters married to my first cousins while there was nothing I could do but watch as a kid.Hello friends. I'm a Pakistani immigrant who came to the US when I was 6 and I was the youngest within 5 siblings. My father is a hotel worker and my mother is a house wife who didn't go to school. As I was getting older my drunk abusive father decided it would be good if my first sister who was doing well in high school to get into an arranged marriage with a first cousin from back home. They then later got my 2 other sisters into arranged marriage with more first cousins. 2 of my sisters have kids which makes me an uncle. 

My brother was then pushed into an arranged marriage with a 16 year old girl while he was 24 and loved another woman (he got out of it and got a second marriage). I just sit and wonder sometimes about why we couldn't all become educated and worked towards getting a house all together. I am not the chosen one. I want to end my life as a big fuck you to my father and leave a note telling how much he's ruined my family (I would blame my mother but she's just a product of the system). 

I am now a 20 year old who flunked out of college. Not a day goes by where I don't think about ending it all, I don't wanna be built on the backbones of my sisters. I talked to my brother once and he tells me it's our culture and I hate him for it because it's just a dumb outdated tradition that's used to keep money within the family and have visas to the US. I don't know when it will all end. I'm not gonna drag this on any longer, thank for reading this.
