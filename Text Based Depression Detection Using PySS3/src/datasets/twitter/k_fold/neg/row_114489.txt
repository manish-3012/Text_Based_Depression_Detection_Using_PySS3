Need help with a friend (repost from r/depression)My boyfriend has had depression for about 2 years or longer now. He has ideation about ending it all, often, and has for a very long time. He seems to just be sinking, and getting closer to hurting himself.

I am not in his presence in real life. I cannot detoxify his home, I am not physically there, I can't possibly be online all the time, he's alone somtimes, like when I'm at school, I cannot buy him anything like medication (we're both 16), and I cannot directly help to get him therapy or any professional help.

What do I do? I am so desperate to help him get better. I feel like he could end it all any day now, I need to get him help, this isn't okay. I am deeply afraid. I'm so concerned, I care about him so much, and I really really need some suggestions. There must be something I can do. Even just suggestions on how to talk with him would be nice. In the past, for a long time, I was preachy, assertive, and did all the wrong things. I need anything you guys can give me, Anything.

Edit: Details about the depression. He has a major inferiority complex. if he's not THE best, he'll often break down. Help with that? He's also got divorced parents, largely, I believe, which spurred the depression, and his dad is depressed and alone, and that makes things just 100x times worse. How do I help with this?

Double Edit: If he can tell his parents about his moods, he may be able to get help and a therapist/meds. But he won't. How do I convince him to tell his mom or dad so he gets a therapist?
