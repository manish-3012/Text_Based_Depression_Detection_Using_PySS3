What will my doctor do if I tell her about my almost overdose?I've been taking Zoloft for my depression and Restoril for my chronic insomnia. A couple nights ago I had an episode where I got super drunk, took 3 sleeping pills, and passed out. I was alone but on the phone with my friend. It was completely accidental, but ever since then, I've been wondering, "What if?" and kind of fantasizing about it...  
Does anyone know what my doctor will say/do if I tell her this? I want to get better, and overall, I do want to live (just without all of the constant pain in my head pls), I just don't want to get sent to a psych ward or something...
