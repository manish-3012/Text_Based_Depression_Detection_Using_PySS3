I got help for myselfToday I have a psychologist appointment with one of the best psychologists in the state. I felt suicidal for two years and didn't tell anyone because I thought that if i did, things would only get worse. And they did for a while. Everyone I knew questioned who they were, asking themselves "What kind of friend am I that I didn't notice one of my best friends is suicidal." It took me weeks to convince them it wasn't their fault. But now we're here, and I'm getting help for myself. And I don't regret it one bit.
