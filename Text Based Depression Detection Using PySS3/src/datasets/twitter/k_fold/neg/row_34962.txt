Suicidal Mood SwingsEarlier this week I was sitting in class and felt like I was legitimately at the lowest of low points: I remember being on the verge of tears as I imagined the route Iâ€™d drive so that I could kill myself off of one of the bridges in my city and how iâ€™d call my family to tell them that I was sorry and all of that selfish shit etc etc.  

A few hours later though, for essentially no reason, my mood skyrocketed and I felt above my default depressed mood. 

Today, again, I find myself feeling empty and contemplating suicide again just as I did a few days ago. This has been happening for a couple months now: one moment Iâ€™ll be ready to dive into oncoming traffic and the next Iâ€™ll feel on top of the world and I donâ€™t understand why. Anyone else feel the same? I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s wrong with me. I donâ€™t feel like I really even deserve to be on this subreddit sometimes since I have such intense moments of happiness â€” hell â€” near euphoria.
