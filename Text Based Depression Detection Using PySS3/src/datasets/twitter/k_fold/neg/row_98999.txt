QuestionDoes Suicidewatch ever get a poster's IP from Reddit and call local authorities?

Because I'm damn sick of being taken away by the police because I mentioned to someone that I'm feeling suicidal.

I've naively thought I could be honest with so many health providers and had them fuck me over, so I can't trust anybody anymore.
