ugh helpi donâ€™t know what to do anymore. iâ€™m so stuck in this life and the thing is, i have nearly everything i could ever want. i have a loving mum who understands me, a few friends who really love me and understand me. iâ€™ve had a rough family history kind of but my mums boyfriend is really supportive of me which is good. but this thing is i suffer from gender dysphoria and thatâ€™s really really difficult and iâ€™m really depressed and i just want to die all the time. and i know people would miss me. i know that, but i have to go. itâ€™s just so painful all the time. iâ€™m getting counselling but god idk itâ€™s just all too hard.  it tortures me every night and it wonâ€™t stop iâ€™m so done with everything.
