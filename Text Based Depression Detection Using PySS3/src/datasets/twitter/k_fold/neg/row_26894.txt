Is it possible that suicide is an evolutionary advantage to a species?When members of a social species have a specific task they need to do to keep the group alive, I imagine they feel a deep inclusiveness. Whereas those of us who have no purpose are merely drains of resources and generally feel very alone. Perhaps loneliness, the desire to die, and committing suicide when not useful helps keep the useful members of a population alive and healthy. Then they can reproduce others who will be motivated to keep the group alive.

I dunno. I just want out and am trying to figure out why. Self-imposed isolation is the worst, but I just don't have the energy to keep up with others. Perhaps we aren't all fit for existence.
