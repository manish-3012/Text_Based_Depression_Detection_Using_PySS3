I wish someone saw me.It's Wednesday noon and I should be studying but I can't stop crying. It's hard to focus when you're too anxious to sit still. I want to take the day off but I've taken way too many days off recently and I need to get this done before tomorrow. I know I will only feel worse if I fall behind or take a break but I'm so tired. 

I'm so tired of waking up every morning and holding myself together all day just so I can do all the things I need to do. I'm tired of coming home and still feeling anxious and suicidal. I'm tired of smiling at people and talking about the new Game of Thrones episode, how nice the weather is or someone's recent trip to Paris was when in my head I'm constantly contemplating suicide. I'm tired of putting in an effort to become better when everything still hurts just as much. I'm tired of trying to be a good student, a good employee, a good friend. I'm tired of being me.
