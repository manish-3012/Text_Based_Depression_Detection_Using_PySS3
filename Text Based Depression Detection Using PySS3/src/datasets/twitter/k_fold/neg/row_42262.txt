I'm not suicidal at all but I found a letter of a stranger who claims to be.Hey reddit,

today I've moved into a student dorm room and while arranging my things and checking everything out, I found a suicide/goodbye letter from someone who claims to be a 18 year heartbroken guy preparing to end his life over a girl.

I don't know him or pretty much anyone else here. The date on the letter says 21st of October 2017 so it's almost a year old.

What should I do with it?
