i don't feel wanted anymoremy parents love me, but i don't think they like me. every time i interact with a member of my family, it's like they can't wait for it to end so they can get back to whatever they were doing before i showed up. i'm often told i don't care about anyone or anything but myself. i wonder if i'm actually in a bad situation or if it's all in my head and i'm really as nasty and manipulative and horrible as they say i am. i've never been able to talk about how i feel because it's always turned back around on me and now i can't imagine any scenario where i'm not the monster. i can't keep waiting for the day that it suddenly gets better because it feels like it's never going to come. i'm just so tired.
