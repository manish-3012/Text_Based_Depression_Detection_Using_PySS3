Waiting for the right timeIs anyone else just waiting for their mother to pass away before they want to kill themselves? Shes the only reason I've never tried more than once and I honestly dont see myself carrying on after shes gone. I've spent nights crying just thinking about that day and my reaction and k genuinely believe one of my first responses would be to try again.
