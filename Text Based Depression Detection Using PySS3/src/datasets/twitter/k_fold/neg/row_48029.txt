Afraid to die, but sure as Hell don't want to live....Long story short, my life is a carbon copy of "The Sorrows of Young Werther", and I can't take it anymore. It's driving me insane. Basically, the only person I remotely cared about made it pretty clear that I was wasting my time. Well, the realization that one's going to turn 20 with nothing to show for oneself is not pleasant at all. I know what I should do-go get drunk for a while, suck it up, move on. But I'm not pretending like I'm being rational. I KNOW-somehow, I know, that I'll probably get over this, and that it would drive me nuts for the rest of my life. So I've opted to shorten it. We all end up in the same place anyways, so what's the point? I know I'm wrong, but I just don't give a shit anymore. As I am now, I give myself a life expectancy of a week, and that's stretching it.
