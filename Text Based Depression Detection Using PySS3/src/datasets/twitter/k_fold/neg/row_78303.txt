Feeling like a prisoner in my own lifeI basically just feel like i'm prisoner, I can't imagine a futur for myself, my days are the same and i'm feeling forced to do what im doing.

After being bullied a lot durng school, I stopped it and stood at home for multiple years, playing online video games and making friends on it, it helped me escaping real life and the thoughts of killing myself.
Years later, 21, i havent done anything with my life, lot of shit happened making it even worse, i didnt really go outside through these years, i have no friends around my city, all are eirher from different countries or at the opposite side of it.

  
I recently got a small job on internet that gives me 700$/month, it helps me making my mind busy so i dont think a lot, but i dont di anything beside this, listening to music (linkin park hello), i even almost dont play video games anymore when i used to do it  lot every day for years.


I feel like my futur is pointless, i dont feel the courage to do anything like going outside, the main reason being that i have nobody to hang out with, i cant find any positive point in my life, i dont feel like i can enjoy anything, even when il trying to, i fail. I feel like i cant get a normal life again, feel like i'm ugly and mainly worthless.


I never achieved anything good in my life and never made anyone proud, each day feel like being in jail, i just feel forced to keep on breathing, i recently was in a long distance relationship, during these 2 months my depressive thoughts were gone, i felt happy, the reason i got my actual job is bcs i wanted money to visit the girl, but it didnt happen because she ended it before, which gave me the depression back with an even bigger pain.


If i dont keep myself busy i just overthink, think avout death and try to tbink about a way to kms without pain.


Id like to be happy but i feel like whatever i do isnt enough, and when i manage to feel happy, something quickly happens to break it all 

I just feel like i dont have any strenght left to get up, go outside on a regular basis or finding anything that makes me happy, im just totaly dead inside and fake to be happy
