Been having suicidal thoughts for a few weeks, and been self-mutilating. Afraid to tell any psychologist/psychiatrist because I don't want to go to a mental hospital or jailHi there,

I've been having severe panic attacks and intrusive thoughts regarding suicide for almost a month now, and have been been self-mutilating as well.  I am in the process of seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, however I do not feel comfortable admitting the true extent of my issues out of fear that they will simply commit me to a mental hospital or call the cops and have me arrested, neither of which will help me.  I'd lose my job, I'd lose my apartment, I'd then totally lose my sanity and maybe even actually kill myself then, something I don't want to happen.  I don't know how to proceed, because I am clearly losing my mind but if I actually seek help, I just will get hurt.  What do I do?
