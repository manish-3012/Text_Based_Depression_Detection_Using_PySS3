Everyday I'm lonlier and closer.Everyday I care a little less.  Everyday I feel more detached from reality.  Before the only thing that kept me from doing it was that my parents are still alive.  But they understand less and less about me and we've drifted so far I don't even care anymore.  My friends sure as hell don't care.  Why should I?  No one cares and really at this point neither do I.  What's the point when all I know is hate?
