Gonna delete this in the morning. I just needed a place to share my thoughts ... to someone who is there....
Since the day my best friend stopped talking to me I havenâ€™t felt comfort or true happiness. Loneliness is my new normal. Every day hurts. I thought things get better with time; but I was wrong. 

I put everything I had to give into our friendship and I wasnâ€™t good enough. The thoughts .... they have me second guessing why Iâ€™m even here. Itâ€™s just too painful. Deep down... I love her more than anything else in the world and sheâ€™s gone. She brought joy and purpose into my life again even by just having random conversations. Our emotional connection was unlike no other. But it got too tough for her. I felt I was wanted. I was needed. I was loved...

Everything I do I get reminded of her. I cannot watch YouTube to distract myself because all I can think about is sharing videos with her. I am stuck in my own mind and Iâ€™m not sure how much more I can take of this torture. 

I am trying my best to honor her wishes of us not talking anymore; and itâ€™s the hardest thing Iâ€™ve ever gone through. I put my trust in her and it became too much. Even if I were able to say â€œhiâ€ and saw that she read it.... I likely wouldnâ€™t be in this state of mind- not this deep at least. 

I miss her so much. Life is torturous right now, and I relied on her for her support and ability to calm me down. When my life was falling apart already... she left. The support structure we had built for each other during rough times- became one I relied too heavily upon. I can see that now; but it doesnâ€™t stop all the pain I feel on a constant basis.
