Story of my lifeTakin all these pills
To forget how it feels
Going to bed not wanting to wake up
I wear a smile, thatâ€™s my version of makeup 
I was on a low
Just looking for a high
I donâ€™t want to die
But if I do I wouldnâ€™t mind
Itâ€™s not what I want
what I want ye Its you
I got a hundred â€˜friendsâ€™
Yet Iâ€™m always alone
Nobody to talk to
Nobody to phone
No girl I can love 
And call her my home
Ye I am so broken 
That I cannot be fixed 
So many problems 
I could give you a list
Iâ€™m sad
Iâ€™m alone
Iâ€™m anxious
Iâ€™m scared 
But I donâ€™t want to die
I just want to sleep 
for the rest of my life
I listen to music just to escape
Suicide is on the horizon
I feel like itâ€™s fait
They say that they understand 
but I donâ€™t think that they do
Put a blade to my wrist
Just to see if I go through
