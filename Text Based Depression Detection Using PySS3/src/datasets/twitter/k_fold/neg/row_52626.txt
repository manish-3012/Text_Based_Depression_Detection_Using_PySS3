Constant anxiety, panic attacks and depression are finally make me finding suicide viableFirst of all my english is not very good

30 yo male. Tonight I have an argument with my boyfriend (24 yo), the second strongest on our almost 1 year relationship. He is the only one till now strong enough to support me. I have a strong anxiety and panic attack back in june, and since them the anxiety attacks and the depression are become strong an stronger every day.
After the argument, and have everything solved, he gave me one more opportunity to prove him I can do this. But when he was gone I start to uncontrollaby crying and remenber everything bad that happend to me in the past, even revive something that gave me PTSD 3 years ago

I am calmed now, but that is because at the end of crying fearing I become completely alone in the future because I hurt everyone around me say the same thing once and again and again and again till they get boring of me I come to the conclusion that kill myself it will be a viable way to solve things, then the tears stop

I was in therapy since I have memory, unhappy since always, not even one doctor have been able to help me. I am at therapy right now, but it get worse and worse between sessions, because the place I work gave me great stress and anxiety and I cant renounce or even find a new one ATM.

I want to stop anxiety, I want to know how to identify my particular triggers to this, I cant have one more argument of this kind, is destroying my soul, my life, and everyone I love and care

Thanks for hear me, and thanks for any advice
