I'm really scared I might attemptI'm so sad right now and I can't bear it. I'm trying so hard to be normal, but I cant stop crying. My husband has asked me if I'm "going to be in a good mood at any point today" and looked at me with disdain.  I have bipolar disorder so this will be my life forever.  Idk if i can do this.
