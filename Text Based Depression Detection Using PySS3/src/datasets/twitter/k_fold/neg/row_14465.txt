I donâ€™t think anymoreMy brain is tired. At work and I work with patients with idd. One of the clients wanted to get a snack but I didnâ€™t wanna let him and have someone tell he he canâ€™t have a snack so I asked  someone. Idk sometimes I feel dumb for not just having confidence in my thoughts. The situation I described is kind of irrelevant but I just needed to vent. I donâ€™t feel like an adult. The anxiety is eating me.
