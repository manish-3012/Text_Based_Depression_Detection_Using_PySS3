I need something but I don't know how to get it.So this is not my first post here, and I've been to the hospital and I've been in the mental ward for a month before, so I supposedly know what I should be doing in these situations, but I've never, ever, figured out why I should go on.  I hate my life so much, it's just painful, and guilt and hate.   I don't really want to exist.  I'm currently living so that other people won't be sad.  I'm on meds and they are actually helping i'm not depressed, I just don't want to live.  My life is shit. I'm 29 i'm fucking obese, I have never even had a girl look at me with anything close to romantic feelings.  I have 1 person I talk to but I'm pretty sure it's because he's my roomate not an actual friend.  Everyday I think about killing myself and everyday i struggle to figure out why i'm alive.   I don't even know how to begin to fix myself nor do I have the willpower to do it.  I don't know how people have willpower for anything.   My last attempt was using a fuck ton of pills and I can remember laying on my bed and remembering how peaceful and nice it is to finally let everything go, and to know that it's over now and i'll stop existing soon and being nervous but actually fucking happy about it.  I don't know what  to do.
