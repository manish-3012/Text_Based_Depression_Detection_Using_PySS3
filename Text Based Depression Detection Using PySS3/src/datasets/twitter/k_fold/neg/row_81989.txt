I'm tired of planning my own funeralI use this account as a throwaway to vent and express the thoughts and feelings I have. For a while I didn't need to use it.

But lately, life hasn't done anything but depress and disappoint me. 

On several occasions,  I've found myself planning my own funeral,  and it just makes me cry, to be quite honest.

I told myself I would save up enough money and buy a high quality camera; next I would take pictures of myself for a funeral slideshow.

The slideshow would be me trying my hardest to look happy, as if I lived a somewhat decent life. I would put on the best smile, a silly face, change up clothes and settings between shots, and look like I was actually happy in those last few moments.

I would then make a farewell video explaining why I did what I did and how I was just tired of life and the disappointments, and that it was starting to be too much.

If the video wasn't good, I would leave a well typed speech and sign it in my own hand writing to verify with my signature that these are my own words; I would make a note that anyone who wanted to could read it at the funeral; I wouldn't pick one person, I would let them choose who got to take up that task.

I would make a slideshow of pictures set to songs I like, then once I'm done I would burn it to a CD or flashdrive perhaps. I would then test it and inspect it for flaws.

After those last few day...I would find some helpfully painless way to end it. I would try and have as much of my affairs straightened out as possible first, though.

I've put so much thought into this that it really depresses me, which doesn't really help. But I keep the plans in my head anyways, just in case.

I really just want a change for the better before I decide to follow through with this. Even as I type this,  I'm starting to cry on the inside,  knowing it'll be present on the outside soon enough.
