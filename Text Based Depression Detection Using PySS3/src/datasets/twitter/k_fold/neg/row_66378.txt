suicidal feelingsI've been suicidal for years now. when i was 11 years old i almost killed myself. the only reason I've stayed these past few years was because i was too pussy to do it and make my parents sad, but honestly, now, i see no point living anymore. I'm a freshman in high school and im already exhausted. Ive been wanting to self harm for the first time for about a month now, i just don't wanna bleed too much. no one knows how i feel anymore. i hide my feelings because i know the only response ill get is either being ignored or being told to go to therapy and that im too loved to die. i have such a love for drugs also. cocaine and xanax being my favorite. i don't have enough money to support ether addiction though. the main thing I've been just needing so much recently is for my mother to tell me she's proud of me. actually saying the words, "I am proud of you". I mean, hearing those words from anybody who actually felt it would help. im so tired. i just wanna give up on everything then see how long i can live with myself.

so ig the reason why im posting this is to sorta vent because idk where else to. i can't risk anyone that i know in real life knowing how i feel. if this gets any attention what's so ever, and you wanna comment something, just talk to me. im lonely and sad. 

also if u wanna get to know me a bit, here you are.

im a girl from oregon. im white. i have blonde hair and brown eyes. im 5'1 and 166lbs. fat right, ik. i have like 5 friends. i love listening to music. my favorite artists are lil peep and suicideboys. don't say im basic cause i listened to both before they were popular. i really love driving for some odd reason. im pretty boring. i don't do much. i really just need someone, physically. like to kiss and hug. that sounds dumb. im just lonely and bored
