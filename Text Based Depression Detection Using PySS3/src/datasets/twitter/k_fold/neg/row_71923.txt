If my mom dies, Iâ€™ll probably kill myselfMy mom has copd and lung problems. She had a heart attack once and didnâ€™t even know it. She has high blood pressure and breathing problems. Yet she smokes. That doesnâ€™t help. I donâ€™t wanna make her feel bad or judge her. Smoking is an addiction. She is the best person I know. Iâ€™ve never really had any friends. Iâ€™m lonely. I love my family. I love my siblings so much and Iâ€™m really close to them. But itâ€™s not the same. My dad is strange. He acts crazy and switches personality all the time. He was an alcoholic and has physically fought my mom multiple times. (Even when she was pregnant). Heâ€™s been to jail for it and doesnâ€™t physically hurt as much anymore. He still has a few times though. He says horrible things to her and I hate him for it. I feel like he hates me more that my other siblings. Me and my brother. I donâ€™t know why but he always chooses us to cuss and loves the others more. He made fun of my brother for painting his nails. He calls him horrible names and used to say that he wasnâ€™t his son. (He is). My brother is only 12 and has the biggest heart. He deserves better than that. Heâ€™s said that I wasnâ€™t his too and sometimes I wish I wasnâ€™t. He says Iâ€™m lazy and stupid. I cut my hair before and he made fun of me and told me I look like a dy*ke. (Nothing wrong with being lesbian but he was being a homophobic ass). My mom always makes me feel better and it sounds lame but sheâ€™s truly my best friend. I love her more than myself and I couldnâ€™t live without her. Sheâ€™s my everything. I canâ€™t imagine the day something happens to her. Iâ€™ve even thought about killing myself before anything happens to her just so I donâ€™t have to see her like that. But I donâ€™t want to hurt her. That would tear her apart and sheâ€™s lost so much. She deserves better than that. I donâ€™t want to do that to my brother and sisters or even to my dogs. They donâ€™t deserve that. But I truly canâ€™t imagine ever living a good life without her in it.
