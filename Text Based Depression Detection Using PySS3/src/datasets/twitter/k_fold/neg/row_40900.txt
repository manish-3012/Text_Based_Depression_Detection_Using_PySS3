constant unreality / unrealization is pushing me over the edge.no matter what i do or who i meet the world just feels so dull and bland. i know have 'emotions' for sure but i just can't manage to make any of them stay for longer than a minute. my moods and emotions control my entire life and leave me with no identity anyway, so im just constantly along for the ride and trying to numb as much of the screaming polar opposites in my head as i can. nothing feels permanent or solid and i don't really know what's real anymore. i just can't imagine how pleasant it would be to sleep for years, if not permanently.
