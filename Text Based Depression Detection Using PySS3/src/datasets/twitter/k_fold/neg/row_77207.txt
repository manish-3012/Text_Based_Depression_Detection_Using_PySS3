What 'affairs' does one need to get in order first?I have a bunch of things: car, furniture, pc, music gear etc. Are you supposed to leave it to someone in a note or what? What do they do with it if you do nothing? What about bank savings? Are you supposed to send it to someone before you do it? What happens to it if you dont? What about superannuation (401k) ? Does that go to your next of kin or does the government keep it? What about all your clothes and stuff do they just chuck it away? Will these be a pain in the arse for my family to deal with or do police/government people do it? What other things do I need to think about?
