Chaotically numb

A bond to be broken, one carried with love. 
Creating chaos, with strings and a tug. 
Infused and misused, what a violent little thug. 
Burying your own face in dirty puddles of mud. 
Suffocated screams, when youâ€™re surrounded by bugs. 
They say you wonâ€™t hear, if you stay quiet too long. 
So you cover your ears, you donâ€™t hear a sound. 
There you go building bridges, knowing theyâ€™ll fall to the ground. 
A mind so fragile, such a tiring flood. 
Your wounds wonâ€™t heal, if theyâ€™re still covered in blood.
