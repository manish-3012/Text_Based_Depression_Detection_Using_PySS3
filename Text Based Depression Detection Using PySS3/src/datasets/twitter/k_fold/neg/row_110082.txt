I have suicidal thoughts everyday and I self harm.Basically, the only reason I'm alive is because I don't want to be a even bigger burden to my family. I don't want one of my siblings to have to find my body and I don't want them to waste money while it's already tight on a funeral. Yet I'm a burden just by being alive and I'm starting to get desensitized. 

The only time I don't feel suicidal is when I cut myself. The pain is the only thing that distracts me from my suicidal thoughts. Everything I once enjoyed feels meaningless. 

I already have a plan on how I'm going to do it. I've researched so many times I'm well aware of what will happen during and after the process. I know it's not healthy and I know I'm horrible. 

My parents won't take me seriously when I say how I'm feeling and I know if I don't get help now it'll be too late. I've been planning to commit suicide on my 18th birthday for too long and now it's only 12 days away. The part that makes me sick is that I'm beyond ready for that day to come. I want to die so badly but I don't want to hurt my siblings. I wish I never existed.
