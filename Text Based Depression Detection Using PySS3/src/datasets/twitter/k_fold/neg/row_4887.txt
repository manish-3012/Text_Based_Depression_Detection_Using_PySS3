I got really close to killing myself last night for the second time. I just need someone to talk to right now. I feel really alone.I've been suffering from depression since I was in middle school (I'm 21 now). Yesterday I was feeling like shit. Like usual. I got in another tiff with my boyfriend about how I can never open up to him about how I'm feeling. I cry in his bed for like an hour. After I leave instead of going home I drive up a mountain that overlooks my city. I cried alone in my car for four hours. 
I always contemplate suicide. Yesterday I decided I would finally do it. I started  driving to the Golden Gate Bridge (I live about an hour away from it). On the way to San Francisco I realized that my method was ridiculous because I'm horribly afraid of heights. Also I can't kill myself right now because I take care of these dogs and the family that owns them is going out of the country for a few months in a few weeks. If I died they wouldn't have anyone to walk their pugs.(yeah I'm 21 years old and I have a job as a dog walker because I'm too scared to get a real job. I'm such a loser) I love those dogs. And they unconditionally love me. It's kind of a lame reason, I know. 
Anyway, I don't really have any friends. I never really made new friends at college. I don't talk with my old friends from high school. I can't talk with my boyfriend about my depression because it's too difficult. He always blames himself or gets frustrated and I just can't deal with him. Every time we talk about my depression he honestly just makes me feel worse. I never even told him about the last time I tried to commit suicide. I had a rope in my car and I was planning on going to the park... 
I feel so, so alone. I really could use someone to talk to right now.
