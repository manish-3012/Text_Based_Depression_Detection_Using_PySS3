I (M19) feel I'm a few months away from doing itMy depression started when I was a sophomore (at least that's when I realized I had it) and everything has been going downhill so damn fast. I used to be repulsed by the idea of killing myself and then one day I started liking the idea of being dead. Still during that time I couldn't leave the people who I loved and the people who loved me. And in the present day theres always an image of me dead by my own hand in one form or another. And now I'm hoping I get the courage to actually do it and I know I'm close, but theres still that part of me that wishes it wasn't this way. 

Anyway, sorry for the long post. Truth be told I'm trying to released that "bottled up" stuff in hopes that it helps. Hope everyone has a swell day
