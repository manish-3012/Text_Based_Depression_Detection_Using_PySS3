In short, I can't do this anymore. There's no escape. I understand my death will cause pain and trauma. That part is unfortunate. However, I am fairly sure continuing to live without merit or will is likely to have equally devasting consequences. 

Hear me out. I have failed at everything I've ever attempted. I was okay at passing exams but that's about it. No life skills. No social skills. I made two friends in high school but that's literally it. My job history is a joke. I can secure okay jobs but I can't ever hold them for over a year. Objectively speaking, I'm bad at most things and this tends to cause problems with employment. 

I'm a 26 year old lesbian. I'm hyper androgynous and everyone is confused by me. It can cause problems. I live in the Midwest and come from a largely conservative family. My romantic life has been my most successful area, but that's not saying much. Sex is fun. But no one will stay with me once they realize I'm a complete fuck up with zero social skills. On top of that I lost the person I wanted to be with. And her kids. She left me for her baby daddy who beats her. I have no desire to date again. 

I can't afford to buy basic necessities. I've been living off of rice and peanut butter for weeks. I have a degree in Psych and 30,000 in student loans. I just started a job in Child Welfare. If I fail, I risk ruining the lives of children who have already endured trauma unlike anything my privileged ass has ever known. If I quit I'm homeless and/or a family burden. 

I bought a gun a few weeks ago. Waited three days. Then bought ammo. I planned to do it that night. But instead I passed out drunk on my bathroom floor with a loaded gun in my hand. Every evening I hold a gun to my head. It's a ritual, I think it will help with desensitization. 

I feel bad for my mom. She has MS and she is very emotional. She never got over our dog dying over ten years ago, she still cries about it.
