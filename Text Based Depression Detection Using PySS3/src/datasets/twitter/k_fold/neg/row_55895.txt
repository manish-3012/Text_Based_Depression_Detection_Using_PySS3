How to find meaning?I know it's late and not many people are on at this time of day, but what is the meaning of it all? I don't know what to do anymore and I feel lonely and depressed sometimes.  I'm about to graduate high school and I feel like I didn't really have fun. I know what I'm doing afterwards for college, but I feel like I won't have any friends. Do people typically make new friends in college? I feel like I wasted a lot of opportunities due to me being socially inept and fearful of it. I feel like I will end up alone after this school year with no one. If I fail in college I feel like my life is completely over. I'm not feeling too bad today, but I want to hear some input from people here. I don't want to take resources away from people who are in urgent need right now. Do you have a reason for living?
