I'm a burden.I've managed to survive at my current age of 24 but I feel like I've finally reached one of the lowest points of my life. I've been raped, suffered trauma and abuse most of my life. Diagnosed with ptsd because of it but lost all my close friends because my mere existence just causes people to feel miserable. My family is angry and disappointed at me, I've lost a promising job and I'm broke. I tried my best to get out of my own mess, tried to stay positive but I keep failing and disappointing everyone around me..I'm disgusted with myself with my mistakes and my past, no one can forgive me but it's fine I can't forgive myself either...I really wish there was some other way to turn my life around and start new but I'm a loser. I really want to take my life.
