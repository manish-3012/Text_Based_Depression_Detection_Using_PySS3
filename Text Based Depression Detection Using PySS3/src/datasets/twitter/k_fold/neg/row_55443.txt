I think it's time I should get some helpI'm not really sure where to begin. I never discussed this with anyone before so forgive me if my story jumps from a lot of places.

I've always been depressed for as long as I can remember but in recent moments, it's been getting worse. There's been multiple attempts throughout my life when I was 13, 15, 19, 20, 21 and now (25M) but these recent attempts are almost a daily occurrence now. Although my feet are dangling over the bridge or have a noose around my neck, I don't commit to it. I kinda hang there for 30 minutes with a blank mind. It's when I'm at work or at home when I really start thinking about ending my life and sometimes thinking about it will become unbearable.

While at work, my mind will start roaming and these suicidal thoughts will get intense. After the sort, most clock-out while a few co-workers and I stay around doing extra work looking for missed scans but sometimes these thoughts are so heavy by end of the sort I'll hide somewhere crying it out until my next shift starts. I'm afraid of telling about this because it'll create an awkward work environment or possibly get fired for my own safety and I'm afraid my ex- girlfriend/coworker will use this against me. 

I'm not sure who to talk to about this and I'm not sure how to bring this up(which is why I'm here). But I think it's time I talk it out with someone, even if it's someone who I don't know.
