I feel like I very well might be dead by the end of next week and I'm very very scared. :(I've always had a fear of death and there have been many times that is the only thing that has kept me alive.

This time I'm very scared may be different. 

I could sit here and list all the things that are wrong with my life, but I feel like that's just a competition in sadness. I know I don't have the worst life on earth- I just have the worst life for me.

I'm 30, on the brink of being very very lonely- the one person who was there for me seems to want to head for the exit and as such leaves me with no one. I took a risk... after all the horrible horribleness of my life before him I didn't know I could try one more time... and I did... and now I'm paying for it.

There's an incident I can pinpoint where I should have died about 5 years ago, and everyday I think the fates that be made a mistake. If energy cannot be created or destroyed... then I feel like all I am doing is preventing someone or something else from living that could do better with this energy than me. 

I'd say I have nothing to look forward to- I do. It's just every time the darkness follows. For once in my life I was entirely completely loved and happy... and now I find myself in a lower pit then I even began.

I'm thinking the week after next might be a good time to go for it, because it's the 2nd anniversary of my mother's death and if there is something after this, maybe I have her to go to.

I wish life didn't hate me so much. There's so much beautiful in it that I just wish I could be part of.
