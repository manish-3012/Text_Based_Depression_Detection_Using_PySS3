17f; I can't take itI've had anxiety for years. I found happiness with my boyfriend, but now almost every conversation we have descends into him expressing self hatred and telling me I should leave him. I canâ€™t cheer him up and it's really taking a toll on me. I get so scared I'm dizzy. I'm terrified to text him. (This sort of thing doesn't usually happen when we talk in person.) He wants to break up before college, and then I'll be truly alone. He's the only friend I have. I have no hope that college will go well for me. I have no future. But I don't have the means or the guts for suicide. I want to die in my sleep.

**Edit:** Thank you for the encouraging messages.
