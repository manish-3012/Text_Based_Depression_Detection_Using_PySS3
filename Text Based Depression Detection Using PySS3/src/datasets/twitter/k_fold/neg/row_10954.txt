Why do I want the pain to come back?I don't understand. Every time I feel depressed, I dread the moment, wishing everything would be better. But right now, I feel normal but want to feel miserable. Please help me. I don't want to cut myself, but also do (It's very confusing, look at my previous posts on r/advice about my cutting problem). I'm posting here because I'm hoping to be heard.
