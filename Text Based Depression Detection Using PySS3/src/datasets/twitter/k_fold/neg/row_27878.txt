Fucking multiple sclerosisProbably doesn't seem like a big deal to you, but it's taken everything from me... In one year. Basketball, working out, playing guitar, hanging out with my friends; all those things I loved doing: gone. Not sure what I did to deserve this. Not sure why everyone I know gets to have control of their hands, legs, or feet.  It just pains me to see people I know personally living in such a reasonable state.. 

"Be thankful, there's people who are far worse off than you", they say.  "It's just MS, you'll be alright." "It gets easier, you just need to reach out." No it fucking doesn't. It gets harder. It gets so much fucking harder. 

The only reason I'm sitting here (struggling) typing this is because I've never kissed a girl or had sex. What a fucking life, right? I had a good 19~ years, but now it's just shit. Utter shit. 

It's almost like I wasn't meant to be on this earth. I have a pretty debilitating disability, absolutely suck at anything that would be useful to be successful in life, and can barely get to my (useless) college classes. 

Point is, we are all going to die, my friend(s) who used to care about me barely acknowledge my existence, and each day my illness gets worse. I'll PM someone my address for a gun, because all I'd be able to do is drive off a fucking cliff.
