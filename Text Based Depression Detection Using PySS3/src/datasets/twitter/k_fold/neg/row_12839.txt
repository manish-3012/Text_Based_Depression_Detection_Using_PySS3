This isnâ€™t worth itIâ€™m supposed to graduate from High School this year, but I havenâ€™t done any of my work this quarter. I just canâ€™t get the motivation or desire to do this. Whatâ€™s the point of working my ass off in school just so that I can slave away at a job for my entire life to continue living? How is it worth it when life just shits on me?

Nothing notably bad has even happened recently! How can I still be so miserable? Living just gives me more stress and depression. Iâ€™m not even sure that I identify with my biological sex, so I canâ€™t even be happy with my body either. 

The only thing that consistently makes me happy are my cats, but I canâ€™t bring them with me to college, and itâ€™ll be a long while before I will be able to afford an apartment which allows pets. All in all, life just sucks major ass, which leads to my conclusion that it isnâ€™t worth it.
