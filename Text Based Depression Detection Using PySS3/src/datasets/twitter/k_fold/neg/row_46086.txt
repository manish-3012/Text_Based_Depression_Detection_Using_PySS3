If I kill myself even though I'm not suicidal does the fact that I committed suicide mean I was suicidal?What do you guys think? Like if hypothetically someone isn't depressed and doesn't have a history of suicidal thoughts, and then one day they just go and take their own life for the hell of it. Does the fact that suicide happened make the person suicidal?

Half conversation starter, half desperate plea for help. Hahahahaha*sob* 

I don't know where I'm going with this, I'm not trying to be profound or anything, I just really need someone talk to and I want the conversation topic to be death and also I want to die please someone help me through this I can't do this alone holy shit I'm so alone
