FUCK!!!okay so Iâ€™m 17 year old guy and Iâ€™ve never been the type of person to do anything like this because It makes me feel like Im only doing everything for attention. so Iâ€™ve started cutting again... Iâ€™ve been getting high every night since February last year when I started smoking weed, I had a cocaine addiction for a while and Iâ€™m still not funny over it. I do a lot of k, pills, 2cb, weed and I smoke a lot. Iâ€™ve never really enjoyed my life and I donâ€™t remember a single day I wasnâ€™t sad I think Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was about 11 but when I was 12 someone told one of my sisters and because itâ€™s my age people put it as an attention thing... so I just pretended to be fine and started joking about it to hide it. Iâ€™ve stopped going to college and stopped doing my work, Iâ€™m supposed to be going to uni next year but Iâ€™m failing everything now and Iâ€™ve stared calling in sick to work. The thing is though I know I need help but I donâ€™t want it and I donâ€™t think I do. This is now my normal. Iâ€™ve accepted that this is how Iâ€™m going to live. I know that cutting is just fucking stupid and my life is a joke. Iâ€™ve always struggled with problems with my sexuality and Iâ€™ve been through some other shit that people think is fucked up, My dad left my mum when she was pregnant with me and I hated seeing him when I was younger because since I can remember he called me a puff, faggot and other things like that but now I havenâ€™t spoke to him in about 8 years which Iâ€™m glad about I guess, when I was 15/16 a male pe teaching assistant I had kinda abused me I guess but I never saw it as a problem... Iâ€™ve never had anyone I consider a true friend and I donâ€™t have anyone that I think likes me as much as I like them. Thereâ€™s other stuff too but I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™ve said this much. Iâ€™m currently fucked on pills. Anyway I know there are people who have probably had worse lives than me but idk just fuck everything. and fuck life!!! I want to kill myself and Iâ€™ve tried but I always stop myself not because I want to live itâ€™s just I feel so selfish doing it and i donâ€™t want to put my mum and nan (thatâ€™s who I live with as well as my two sisters) through that just because Iâ€™m a fuck up. so anyway thatâ€™s my life rn.
