Hi need to say some stuff that I bc and tel anyone and looking for help23 was diagnosed with depression anxiety and anger issues when I was 15  think. I was on meds until I was 18 and maybe I felt like reveling I'm not sure but I want to go back on them now and have no idea how to even start that process. I recently started self harming again and I own a gun and have been having a lot of suicidal thoughts the last 3 months or so. Anyways my mother at the time got this going but now I'm all on my own 100% no family to speak of and new insurance threw work. How do I find a therapist and someone who can get me anti depressants and such. I believe 2 of the medications I was on at the time are now banned. I'd be fine with a new type just looking for help on how to get this started. I want to be alive again and be happy
