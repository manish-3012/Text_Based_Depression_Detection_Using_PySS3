My own head is against me.I have had two major exes, one would cheat on me repeatedly because i had no libido, and was young and stupid. The other couldn't handle my depression caused by the first, and emotionally cheated on me after 4 years, and then of course, we ended things.

Now these days i have attending alot of therapy and psychiatric sessions, it's been helping immensely and i feel alot better than i did.

But now there's this new girl i really like, we've been talking for over a while now and she even told me she loves me. But i was too scared to reciprocate that feeling back to her then. Cut to today, and i'm afraid i no longer emotionally satisfy her like my exes.  I'm absolutely terrified. I haven't been able to eat or sleep much the past few days at all.

Pretty much all aspects of my life have been and are pretty awful, but i am still doing my best. But now i am terrified that this girl i have fallen for ends up like my ex. I *know* she won't, i *know* she's not my ex, but i am still tremendously afraid. My mind keeps lingering on the "What if's".

And honestly all the thinking has had me quite depressed, to say the least. Everything in my life is far from ideal right now.
