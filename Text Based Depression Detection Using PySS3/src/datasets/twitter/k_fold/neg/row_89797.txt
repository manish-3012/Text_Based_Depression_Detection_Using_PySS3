My life...Iâ€™m 20 years old and Iâ€™ve been low for a long time! Itâ€™s about the member down there! Iâ€™ve measured my penis bone pressed and got it to 9cm flaccid and 13,5 erected! I feel like that is to small! I think of it every day! Doing exercises like never before, searching how to make it bigger, but it doesnâ€™t follow! My biggest dream in life was to get a wife and kids! But I think thatâ€™s no point dreaming... No girl wants that small of a penis it is really small and I feel its hard to find smaller on the Internet. Everyone is bigger! And since nothing works to make it bigger and you have no one to talk to about it (I donâ€™t have a dad) maybe itâ€™s time for me... time to end this miserable life... just wish I was normal.. wish things were different... why did i have to get this shit life? People that are complete shit gets everything.. canâ€™t even get a normal dick.. Iâ€™m not here for attention Iâ€™ve been her for a long time but nothing is changing I though maybe the exercise would help.... guess this is my goodbye  ðŸ‘‹
