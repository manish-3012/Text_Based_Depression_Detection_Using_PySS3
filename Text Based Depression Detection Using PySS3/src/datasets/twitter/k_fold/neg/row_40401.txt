Fuck NYESo, since the morning, I've been dreading the thought of the NYE's party my family is throwing. I was gonna go until my mom started getting on my nerves, with her verbal abuse and disrespect. Now I'm sitting on my rooftop steps waiting for her to leave so I can have some alone time. EVERY time I'm sad my wrists, mostly my left start to ache as if I want to cut myself, but I haven't done it in years. All I want right now is to end it all, 2018 I saved two people's lives and for what, just to have them hate me? None of my family understands me, my parents think I'm rebelling and are delusional as fuck, no one ever asks me to hang out and when I go out of my way to ask, everyone's always busy (I get that people have their own lives) but this happens on the daily for me.
