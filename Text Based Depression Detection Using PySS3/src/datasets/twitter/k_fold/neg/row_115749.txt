i just need someone to helpIâ€™m in high school. So last weekend, I was hanging out with one of my best guy friends. We had always had feelings for each other, but never got the timing right (heâ€™d date someone, I was taking to someone, wrong times etc.) Anyways, weâ€™re both single. So we decided to hang out. One thing led to another, and we ended up hooking up in the back of his car. It was both of our first times.
  Now, he seems distant every time we text and Iâ€™m scared heâ€™s ignoring me. I think heâ€™s telling people about what happened. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll be labeled the â€œschool slutâ€. I just went through a really rough depressive episode and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m strong enough to deal with this. I feel so close to ending it all.
