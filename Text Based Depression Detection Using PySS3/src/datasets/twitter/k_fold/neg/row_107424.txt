no one has the answers i needi wish someone had answers other than â€œit gets betterâ€ â€œyouâ€™re not aloneâ€ â€œitâ€™s okayâ€ â€œi careâ€.

i know itâ€™s a lot to ask, but i just want to know how to make the pain stop. how to make things less terrifying, and less pressure on me constantly. i want to know how to sleep at night without the constant anxiety and horror of my trauma haunting me, knowing itâ€™s going to keep happening. 

no one can tell me though. life is just unfiltered pain that we get handed and weâ€™re expected to just mold ourselves around this black hole that will constantly exist within us. walk around like it isnâ€™t ripping us to shreds inside constantly. maybe someone does care, maybe it does get better. but why do i have to feel so much fucking pain to appreciate happiness? why do i always expect things to fall apart once i feel okay? why is my existence ruled by how much i was hurt by those who were supposed to love me?

i donâ€™t think it gets better. i think the world around me can shift and change in so many ways but iâ€™m stuck inside the mind i was given and the experiences iâ€™ve had. i canâ€™t escape this maze, this continuous cycle. i can keep reaching my hand out to see if anyone will grab it and take me to a different dimension where nothing hurts and it all makes sense, but itâ€™s not real. it doesnâ€™t get better. you become more numb, you become more used to pain, ty expect more pain to be inflicted on you, and when it is you find comfort in it because itâ€™s all you know. thatâ€™s all i see for my future. thatâ€™s what i think every night before i sleep. i canâ€™t stop.
