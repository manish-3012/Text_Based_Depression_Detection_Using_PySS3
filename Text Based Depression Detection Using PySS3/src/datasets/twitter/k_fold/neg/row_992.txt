I need to talk to someoneIt's been a long time. I need help. It's so silly. Getting so bent over a woman. For the longest time I didn't think I could feel anything and that was how I would survive. That is how I could beat depression. Then I fell in love. I had good and bad days but they were always better because of her. Now I think she is gone, and here I sit alone again with only my hate to keep me company.
