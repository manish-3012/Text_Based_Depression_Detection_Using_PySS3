Is dry firing considered an attempt, or just practice?24F. Whenever shit gets unbearable, I often curl up in bed and cry as I debate on loading my shotgun or not.

Sometimes I make a quick pro-con list, and the cons of loading it outweigh the pros.

Cons: I'll destroy the property value of my parents' apartment; parents will see a gruesome sight; boyfriend and friends might be sad for a bit

Pros: My suffering will be over.

So I just end up just putting the barrel in my mouth, aim for the brain stem and pull the trigger. I used to jump at the sound of the click, not anymore.

I plan on buying a pistol to keep on my person soon. It'll make my mission much easier since I won't have to try and smuggle a large gun out of the house. 

I fucking hate existing.
