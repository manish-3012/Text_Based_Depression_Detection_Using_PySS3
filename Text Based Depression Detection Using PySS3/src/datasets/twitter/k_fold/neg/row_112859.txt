I hope you read thisLoving ourselves takes time 
It doesn't happen overnight because 
It has taken us a lifetime to come up with reasons we shouldn't 
Embrace that the healing journey can somtimes be long and there's really no place o get to. 
If you're beating yourself up or judging yourself for not being enough
 Let this be the moment where you let that go and come home to the love that resides within you.
Be gentle with yourself in this process this is you learning to truly be with all of yourself â¤
