I need to kill myselfI can't go on like this anymore. I'm way too busy to do anything about my mental health. And my mental health issues are ruining my life. And my ruined life is making me busy. The only way out is suicide. It's 2 in the morning I pulled an all nighter last night and Im busy until 11pm tomorrow (today?). There's no end to the hell of my life in sight. Its not going to get better, it never has and it never will. I just need to stop over thinking and make it happen.
