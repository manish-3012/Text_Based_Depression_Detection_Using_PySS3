CowardiceMy grades are declining, no one actually cares about (and if they say they do itâ€™s either a â€œtoxicâ€ type of caring or they donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m actually like; coincidentally, no one knows what Iâ€™m actually like), and Iâ€™m fairly certain that the person that I was closest with has finally realized that Iâ€™m nothing more than an incompetent parasite who canâ€™t be helped. Granted, itâ€™s not that I didnâ€™t deserve any of this; Iâ€™ve somehow succeeded in hurting and/or manipulating everyone around me just for my own benefit. Most of the people who have genuinely cared for me were legitimately good human-beings, and I still objectified and cut them off in the end; I tell myself that I didnâ€™t want to hurt them more, and that all parties would benefit by doing this, but in truth itâ€™s likely just that my subconscious deemed them as having outlived their usefulness. Every time I imagine someone else helping me, it always results in them completely enabling me (I think; I genuinely canâ€™t tell the difference between general comfort and enabling at this point. Not to say that those who need and want comfort are lazy parasites, I just actually canâ€™t draw a line when concerning myself); often I get angry at my subconscious for this and other things (including those previously mentioned), though itâ€™s likely just an excuse for lacking the willpower to fix myself. I honestly donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m doing this; the entire post probably just comes off as disorganized (Iâ€™m definitely not proof-reading this). Probably just some bid for sympathy. So, yeah, in conclusion, if it werenâ€™t for me being a coward, you likely wouldnâ€™t be reading this; though, if my grade report is as bad as Iâ€™m expecting it to be, I donâ€™t anticipate the cowardice to be a problem.
