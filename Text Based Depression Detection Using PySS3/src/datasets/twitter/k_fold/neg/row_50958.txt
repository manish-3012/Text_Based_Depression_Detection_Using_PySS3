I confessed to my girlfriend and I need your help again.I'm the one who cheated on my suicidal girlfriend. I tried as much as I could to comply with all what you guys said. Thank you so much for your help. I edited my previous post but I'm not so good with formatting and I'm not sure if any of you read it. I need your help again. Please check the edit here if you're free:

She's not doing better and I am not helping her. She said she never thought I would do it and that I threw her feelings in the garbage like it meant nothing. 
Honestly this makes total sense to me and I understand it now. She told me she can't trust me ever again like before, so it won't work out. I told her I understood and I would live with it. 
What do I do now? I don't want to lose her and I don't want to force her and wear her out by being with me. I've been thinking if I could accept my punishment and retreat everything would be easier for her. But what if it didn't turn out as I thought?

Edit: she doesn't want to be with me and she's ok with being friends. She's too much in pain to talk to me this time. How can I be a good friend now?
