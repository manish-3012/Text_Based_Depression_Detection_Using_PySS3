This is my final goodbyeI don't know what much to say besides I'm disappearing because I'm killing myself I feel betrayed like my only friends didn't  care about me  and I have nothing left there alot I'm gonna miss I dont really wanna go into details on why it's this bad but I do what you all to know you can get to the end and keep pushing on you deserve to live and I love you I could've kept going but I'm too weak everything in due time I promise ðŸ’ðŸ’–ðŸ’•â¤ðŸ’œðŸ’šðŸ’›ðŸ’“
