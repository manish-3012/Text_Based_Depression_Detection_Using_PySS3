hopelessi'm so fucking numb. my life is going to shit, but i can't feel anything. i'm destroying my family, i'm selfish. i understand what i'm doing, and at the same time i don't. i don't process the grief, or the guilt and i wonder if the trauma turned me into a sociopath for good. my cousin's husband, a man dying of brain cancer who i was once close to, is in hospice and doctors are recommending no further treatment. all i feel is irritation; i hate funerals and mopey people. i can't even feel distressed about my lack of emotion. the best thing for me would be to go to residential care, but that would decimate my family's funds. maybe if i was born a man and actually given them i'd have the balls to kill myself
