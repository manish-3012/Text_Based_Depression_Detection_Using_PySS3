Fatherâ€™s last will and testament just gifted me my bus ticket.My dad is dying. Sometime any minute now. Heâ€™s in the care and comfort stage, heavily medicated in ICU. 

He always had a lot of firearms. I was hoping for a pistol. He willed me a single shotgun. 

I donâ€™t really want to go that way. So gruesome and brutal. 

Iâ€™d rather pistol, hang, maybe exit bag. He had a lot of pills and drugs but mostly psychedelics and alprazolam(?) i think thats zanax so i googled and it wonâ€™t kill me. He also has thousands of 800mg ibuprofen but, i suppose thats just like normal headache pills. I dont want to vomit myself to death.

I found a .38 revolver it his drawer but its supposed to go to another family member. Id feel bad about using it. 

I just know my gf or mother will have to ID my body, I dont want them to see a gory skull blown apart by a shotgun. I love them and they will take this very badly.
