I'm pathetic and disgusting.I'm 27 years old, and until yesterday, I never had sex, or even so much as kissed a girl. Yesterday, I was so desperate for human contact and sick of being a virgin, that I saw a sex worker. I was awkward and pathetic and I'm ashamed of myself for even doing it. I deserve to die.
