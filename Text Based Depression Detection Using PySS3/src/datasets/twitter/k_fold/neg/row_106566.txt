I want to kill myself over the jokes my teenage self thought were funny.I have a lot of problems, and I only have one solution. I want to kill myself. I think back to what I thought was funny as a teenager. Why did I think using the N-Word was funny? Why would I say it as a shock word to get laughs? Now I have to live with it, but I can't live with it. I am not a racist, never was. I used all kinds of awful words. But I said the N-Word. I want to stab myself. How do I forgive myself for this?
