It feels insulting when someone just gives a lot of suicide hotline phone numbers in response to the topic of suicide.I don't know if I'm the only one who feels this way, it just feels like a lack of real care and almost like just retweeting one of those "retweet if you care about blank" thinks - it takes 0 effort and it is clear that everyone knows about the hotline by now. I would have called by now if I wanted to do so. But then again, why should I expect others, especially if they don't know me very well, to show genuine care and help me through this? I think the worst thing in the world is awkwardness, an awkward smile or laugh, uncomfortable silence. It is worse then being stabbed or hurt in any other way it feels like. I'd rather be ignored than make everything awkward, just let me fade into the background then and just don't let me take up your time if it's just going to make you feel awkward.
