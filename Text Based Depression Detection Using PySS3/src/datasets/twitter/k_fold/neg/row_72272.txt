Drowning in sorrows, feAr of living, fear of death.How to continue when everything has been taken, even pride? I (41m) want to kms but canâ€™t pull the trigger- I have 3 ways to go, that Iâ€™ve planned, yet I am still here. Itâ€™s a cruel sick joke. Iâ€™m ugly, selfish, worthless, and have no future. People think I can pull thru it but I know I canâ€™t. This life is worse each day. I have no life except doctor visits, which are killing me. Thank you for reading, if you are. Iâ€™m lost and need support.
