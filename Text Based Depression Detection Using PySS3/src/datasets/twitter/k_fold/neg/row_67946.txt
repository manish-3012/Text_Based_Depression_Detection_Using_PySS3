Don't know how to go onMy roommate/friend tells me to hang in there? Why? What's the point. I feel like utter shit. I have no faith in myself and starting to distrust everyone around me. My dad is around, but I just want to be left alone.
I don't think I deserve help or happiness. I feel like garbage. 
I have thought of suicide multiple time times. I am really scared of hospitals. I don't want it go wrong and suffer even more. I am on medications, (sertraline, clonazepam) but it just makes me numb to everything. I don't remember what happiness felt like.
One day I decided to go ahead and swallow the entire stripfull of clonazepam. I would fall asleep and that would be it. Had my roommate not been there coincidentally at the apartment, I might have gone through with it. It scares me that I came so close.
Each day just passes by. I am at risk of losing my job any day now. I can no longer sit and work on something for more than half an hour.
I have lost interest in almost all music. It hurts me so much that the very same place I used look for comfort and relaxation does absolutely nothing for me. My piano which I used to play since childhood gathers dust in the corner, untouched for more a few years now.
I don't know why I have to keep living like this? Is this  ever going to change? I feel like a bother to everyone and have stopped contacting what few friends I had.
I feel like I have been typing into the void now for a while. Sorry. I don't know what to do.
