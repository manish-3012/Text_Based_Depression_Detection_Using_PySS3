Is it okay if i die?I know people will be hurt but i can't fight anymore, I'm drunk right now. I'll hopefully hang myself within the next couple days I've accomplished nothing but making people happy and that's alright to me. We all die, end up in the same place more or less, I'm getting panicky thinking about it but theres no other escape from my broken mind. I just want my life back. I'm sorry mom
