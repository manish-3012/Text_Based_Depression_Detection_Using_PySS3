depressing text wallmy parents care about me but Iâ€™ll never be as good, smart, or useful as my sisters or brothers. in my junior year of high school one of my best friends told me she was just â€œbored with meâ€ and told me to stay away from any of â€œherâ€ friends (that I introduced her to) which led me to distancing myself from all of them, including one of my friends with later died by suicide. i saw him the night before and i knew something was wrong but i didnâ€™t say anything, so thereâ€™s that. i failed out of college this year, my (now ex) girlfriend cheated on me, and the only people interested in being friends with me ended up dragging me deeper into my already budding addiction problems. i cut off those friends, realized that I shouldnâ€™t have cut off one of them, who has always been supportive of me and never pressured me to drink or do drugs, unlike the others. idk. im just such a fucking failure. ive been thinking about hanging myself which is really bad because ever since my friend died, thatâ€™s been the farthest thing from okay in my mind. i just donâ€™t know what to do anymore, i feel like Iâ€™m nothing and Iâ€™ve always been nothing. i relapsed with my self harm in a bad way, nothing too major but it is a second degree burn, which worries the rational part of my brain because I know that if I relapse again itâ€™ll most likely be really bad, as almost all my past self harm has either required stitches or has been burns/frostbite second degree or worst. i just donâ€™t know what to do.
