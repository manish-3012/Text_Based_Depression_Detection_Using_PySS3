I wish I could get a gunI really want to get a gun for suicide but idk how to get one. I've had mental issues my whole life, they only got worse as I got older. They are crippling and I might even say they are agonizing. I'm 18 so I think I'm allowed to buy a rifle where I live. But I have a feeling I wouldn't be allowed to after a background check. Less than a year ago I called the police when I was about to hang myself, bc I decided I wanted to get help. I had attempted hanging a few times before. I went to a mental hospital, therapy (still in it), all that shit, and that was awhile ago but things are only worse than they were. Nothing helped. 

So whether it's being in the hospital, or having called the police, I feel like something's gonna show up in my background check that won't let me get a gun. And even if I could, I'd be way too anxious and they'd probably be able to tell something was off about me, I'm a terrible liar after all... I would ask for advice on how to get a gun, but I don't think I'm allowed to ask that here. Idk where I even could ask that.

people say "it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem" but sometimes a permanent solution is exactly what someone wants
