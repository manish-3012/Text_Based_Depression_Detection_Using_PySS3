Iâ€™ve really really fucked up this weekI have a lot to live for and I know I do and I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s changing my meds but I really really just wanna end it tonight. This week a person who I was good friends with for 2 years ended our friendship after she acted like I didnâ€™t exist for a month. She didnâ€™t give me a chance to explain myself after a conversation I had with another person that made her think I was just a shitty person, but I was just trying my best to make the world a better place. Then, a friend I recently got close with told me in a really hurtful way (Iâ€™m really not trying to play the victim but he was very insensitive about it) that because of a joking text I sent him about his dad that he and his dad think Iâ€™m creepy and his brother that I had a huge crush on but doesnâ€™t like me back also thinks Iâ€™m gross and I just donâ€™t think that this is the right lifetime for me. I believe in reincarnation and I do a lot of good work, or so I think, as an educator, but apart from that my family thinks Iâ€™m a failure and I canâ€™t maintain friendships or meaningful relationships. I know Iâ€™m young (22) and that â€œit gets betterâ€ but this really really hurts right now. And I donâ€™t really see how i can be strong enough to make it through.
