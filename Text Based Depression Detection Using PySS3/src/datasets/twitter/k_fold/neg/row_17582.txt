I have lost any will to continueDepression has been hurting me for years and itâ€™s rendered me useless. I want to be a great musician, but I have no drive anymore. I wake up at 1 in the afternoon, go to sleep at 4:00 am, and I rarely leave my room. I keep telling myself that Iâ€™ll start working, but I fear that Iâ€™m just going to fail, and I go back to doing nothing. I didnâ€™t realize how little I was working until I came to my teacher with nothing written. I couldnâ€™t explain how I couldnâ€™t work because I felt useless. Whatâ€™s worse is Iâ€™ll never be happy. Iâ€™m a defective subhuman who is cursed to having to hide who they truly are. I need to die, because Iâ€™m having no effect on the world as is, but Iâ€™m still in pain.
