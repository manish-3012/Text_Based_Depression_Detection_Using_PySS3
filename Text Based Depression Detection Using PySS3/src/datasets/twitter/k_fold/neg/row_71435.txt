I don't know if I want to try anymoreI'm in my late 20's. I'm finishing my degree, and I have a future ahead of me(so they say)... But idk if want to continue anymore. I feel defeated, I feel like no one understands me and just have nowhere left to go to seek help. I've become an annoying and needy boyfriend and my boyfriend doesn't like that. When I get like that, he won't answer his phone or text back because he says he doesn't know how to deal with it. If I say anything to my family they'll over react. I don't want to tell my best friends since they worry enough about me. I just don't know how to jeep going. Every morning I wake up I wish I never woke up. I can't even sleep a full night anymore. I just don't know what to do
