Iâ€™m tired of trying so hard to survive and keep afloat. I just want to lay my head down and not get upI daydream of a long endless sleep. Maybe not dying specifically, but just never waking up. No dreams, just peaceful, all engulfing nothingness. 

The world is too hard for me it feels like. Everything hurts, my body, my mind, everything. I can never make the right choices. I am doomed to fail, or doomed to self sabotage completely. How do you live when living hurts so much? 

I am not even a beautiful disaster. Just a whiny, pitiful, clingy girl who irritates everyone around her and destroys every good thing she gets. I would not like me if I met me. I would despise myself if I met me, more than I despise myself now. 

I want to feel better. I want to feel like the people I know who get up in the morning and accomplish things, who have goals, who take care of themselves. Nothing I do can make me into that person though, I am destined to be who I am. Destined to just slowly fade away until no one remembers me, and maybe that would be better. At least then, others wonâ€™t have to suffer through knowing me.
