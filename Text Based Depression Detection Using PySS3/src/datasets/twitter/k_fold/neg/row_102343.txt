After my suicide attempt I feel like I don't exist. It's like I have died. I should have. It's so frustrating.It's not my body. I'm in somewhere else. I'm not here.

I hate the stereotype, the lost of others confidence. The look in their faces.

I work in a drugstore in a small town. Every fucking person in this fucking place knows me.

Seriously, I don't exist. Being under suicide watch is like 1984.

I don't exist. I'm only waiting for the next chance to get rid of this body.

I alredy consider myself dead. I can't live with the burden of the pain i caused to my loved ones.

I don't know how somenone can like me. I only bring pain to people lives.

My hope is when I die everything will vanish. That this life is only an illusion.
