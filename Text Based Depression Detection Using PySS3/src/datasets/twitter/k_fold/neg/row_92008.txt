The only person who was ever kind to me, is me.It wasn't always that way. I had a huge problem with self loathing for a looooong time, up until about 3 or 4 years ago. As is typical with people suffering suicidal ideation.

 In the past 3 or 4 years however I've grown to really like myself, I became very involved in politics and found my footing on the compass.

 I found solidarity with the oppressed all around the world and cherished it. It even gave me a lot of hope for a brighter future.

However, with each passing day on this shit hole planet, my skin peels. I fucking hate everyone around me. All they do is make noise and fucking hurt me. 

The kindness I've shown myself in the past few years is simply leagues better than the way I'm treated by others. I just want to be alone with myself for the rest of eternity in the ground somewhere.

I want everyone else to fuck off forever, just leave me fucking be. I like myself and I'm the only person I want in my life. 

The thought that everything could be over as soon as I will it to be so is so fucking attractive. The idea that all of existence as it is perceived by myself can me upended in one motion from my ring finger.

Its intoxicating, I could have everything I want out of existence. To rest alone for all eternity with the one being who ever dared see me as human, myself.

Fuck off, like you even care. Farm virtue points off of someone else. The only reason I'm posting here is because it's the closest thing to an actual suicide forum on reddit.
