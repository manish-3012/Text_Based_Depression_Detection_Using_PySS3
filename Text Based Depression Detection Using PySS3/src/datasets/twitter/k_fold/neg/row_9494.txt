My Desire for Perfection leads me to Suicidal IdeationI generally feel ashamed for being mean, cruel, etc. It's good to have some guilt. How can I not let it lead me to suicidal behavior? I have compulsions as well. It's hard for me to quit things. I want to focus less on myself. Some days I feel like I'll never change or my family doesn't need or I create too many problems so I fantasize about hanging myself. I am looking for an easy way to do it. I don't like pain. I would never slit my wrists. I wish I could be perfect.
