everyone i know would be better off if i never existedim the biggest fucking burden and inconvenience to everyone in my life. i dont know if i necessarily want to kill myself because that just makes me a whole different kind of burden. but so many fucking people would be so much better off if they never had to deal with my fucked up self.
