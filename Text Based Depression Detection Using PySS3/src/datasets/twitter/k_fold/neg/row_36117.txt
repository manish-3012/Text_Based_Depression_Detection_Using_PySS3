My birthday is in about three weeks.I had planned on killing myself then, but I don't know if I can make it that far. Tonight is going to be the test of that. I'm just so tired of hurting everyone I love. I really hurt my family tonight, especially my father, and I feel horrible for it. Especially since I lied to everyone about it.

Either I kill myself tonight or in three weeks. No other option. I've been planning this for so long. Sort of a milestone birthday too. Twenty. Finally out of my teen years. I don't want to go past twenty. In twenty years, I've hurt my family so much. They're genuinely incredible and they deserve better than a rotten being such as me. One last instance of hurt is certainly better than the lifetime of pain I'd cause if I continued to live. I love them so much. I just hope that they forgive me. I wish that I could've been better to them. They deserved that. Once I'm dead, they can move on and finally learn go be happy. They'll have so many new and amazing opportunities to take with me gone.
