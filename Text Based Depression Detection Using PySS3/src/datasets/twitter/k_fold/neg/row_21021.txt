Need Help to understand that is it worth to live for meI turned 20 yesterday. Only 5 people wished birthday to me which is not of great concern but as I hit 20 I realized until now I haven't done something in my life. My heart is broken and got rejected 10 times I'm nearly bank-corrupt. I don't have any family to turn who lives near me, my nearest family member live 2000 miles away who cannot help me. I'm practically alone paying everything out of my own pocket. currently, I cannot focus my mind on my school-work because I'm too weak to handle job rejection and love rejection and my friend who has everything I don't have said to me that I was lucky because you're living on your own and having fun. Like dude I'm crying in my bed I'm not sure how I'm gonna pay my next rent, I haven't eaten in 2 days. He has everything, he has a family with him to support, a girlfriend who care for him and stable financial situation. I'm finding something worth to stay alive and hustle every day. Need help!! to understand how am I lucky when I have nothing but depression and anxiety with me. My love life is practically dead no one likes me I try my best to stay nice I don't show how weak I'm to anyone, I care for everyone but in return, i get nothing just you're not worth enough.
