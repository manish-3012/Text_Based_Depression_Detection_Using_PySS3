Do You Ever Feel Like Youâ€™ll Ultimately End Up Killing Yourself?Now, I donâ€™t feel like killing myself, nor have I ever acted on it. 
I remember seeing a documentary on TV about a woman who survived a suicide attempt when I was in 4th grade. Before that, I never heard of the word â€œsuicideâ€ or was never even aware that someone had the option/capability to actually take their own life. Since then, Iâ€™ve always been fixated (I guess obsessed) on the alternative to kill myself when I feel the time is â€œrightâ€. 
Since I could remember, the way I thought prior to seeing that woman on TV, was never stable, even thinking back to my first memories as a little girl. 
Growing up, my teachers always thought I was distracted, or daydreaming. It was found later in my teens that I actually had BiPolar. 
Iâ€™m not going to get too much into the in-betweens of my life, but Iâ€™m in my mid 20s, and this thought has always been consistent in my brain.
 I wish I had some sort of traumatic excuse as to why I constantly think this way, but I donâ€™t. 
I want to say that I think this way when Iâ€™m just â€œdepressedâ€, but I donâ€™t. This thought is always on the back of my brain. 
Knowing that I have the leverage to take my own hen I please, is sickly comforting to me. When I actually am depressed, knowing that that option is always available brings me solitude sometimes; to know that the thoughts I am thinking, or the emotions I am feeling, can be shut off whenever. 
Iâ€™m an only child, so itâ€™s currently not an option to just up &amp; leave. I know in my situation, itâ€™d be extremely selfish.  
But when I think ahead of when my mother passes, I donâ€™t see the future. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be able to see a life, considering sheâ€™s the only one who keeps me grounded to this earth now. 
Iâ€™ve never talked to anyone about my obsession with the idea of taking my own life, and Iâ€™ve always vowed to myself that Iâ€™d never actually â€œtryâ€ unless I knew the results would be unequivocally definite (hanging from bridge, jumping off a building, a cocktail of drugs).
The only reason I call this thought an obsessed is because it has crossed my mind everyday for over 10 years, and itâ€™s the only way I have ever seen myself leaving this world.
And thatâ€™s the thing; itâ€™s not that I think this world is horrible. I actually think thereâ€™s just as much good, as there is bad. Life is tragic, but it can also be full of joy. The world is beautiful, humanity is beautiful. 
But the internal suffering I feel everyday, even when Iâ€™m â€œhappyâ€, is always present, has always been present. I know one day, I will not be able to bare it any longer. I think of it as just â€œthatâ€™s when itâ€™ll be my time to goâ€ yâ€™know? 
Iâ€™ve studied, and searched for every reason or excuse as to why my brain works the way it does, and Iâ€™ve always had this unrealistic hope that one day Iâ€™d be able to pinpoint what was going on, and fix it, cure it, rather than the answer always resorting back my way of thinking being caused from a â€œmental illnessâ€. 
I feel like being â€œillâ€ is such a broad spectrum. What if Iâ€™m not ill, and this is just the way I am? Maybe I find peace in the idea suicide because it gives me a sense of dignity. Maybe some people just arenâ€™t meant to be here until their bodies shut down, and have the same mentality as just being like â€œwelp, gettin sick of this. Time to goâ€. Iâ€™m not trying to make this light now, but that is truly how casual I think of suicide. 
For some reason, I know with confidence that I will not live my life out to its entirety.
