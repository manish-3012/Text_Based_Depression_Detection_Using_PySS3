Experiencing unbearable regret over choosing a relationship over my life. The disappointment is crushing me.I canâ€™t believe I wasted my senior year of college on my ex. I had planned to end my college career with good grades and lots of progress made with my recovery work. Instead, I got into a dysfunctional on-and-off relationship with a guy and took him back numerous times, despite many peopleâ€™s warnings. Now, Iâ€™m suffering the consequences. I have multiple Incompletes for my coursework, am unsure if Iâ€™m going to pass a minor I worked hard for, and may or may not graduate. The ceremony is in a couple days but I donâ€™t want to go if that isnâ€™t indicative of me actually graduating. Iâ€™m burnt out and am considering drowning myself in a lake. 

I went through so much shit with my ex. Had to take Plan B twice, almost relapsed several times, withdrew from my communities and went MIA, and experienced suicidal ideation during the latter part of the relationship. Iâ€™m so stupid for taking him back all those times. I donâ€™t want to lose that much control over a guy anymore. I donâ€™t want to be reminded of how crazy I was for neglecting everything except him. I feel like a failure for struggling with everything. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™m trying hard not to relapse and drink. Cutting seems to be the only thing that can help me deal with life, but I canâ€™t stop doing it. If I stop, Iâ€™m afraid I might go with my plan.
