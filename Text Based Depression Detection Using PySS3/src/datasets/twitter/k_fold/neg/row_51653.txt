I keep sabotaging a relationship cause I'm not really worth her.So I entered into an online relationship for the past two months. We talk everyday. She makes me feel complete. Yet I keep sabotaging the relationship at every turn. She keeps forgiving me and rejecting my attempts to push her away. I'm literally in love and now I don't want her to end up with me cause I'm not someone she should love. Don't wanna ghost her but I'm honestly thinking of suicide right now after the last time I screwed everything up.
