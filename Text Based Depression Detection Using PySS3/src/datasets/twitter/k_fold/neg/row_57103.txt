DONT CALL THE NATIONAL SUICIDE HOTLINEThey told me "hang up and call back when you can stop crying"
Luckily I had locked myself in a restroom (there was nowhere else to go) and was on the floor bawling my eyes out so people broke the door open and dragged me out they were angry because I had been in the bathroom so long God FORBID you hold your pee for 20 minutes while some girl is looking desperately for a way to kill herself
