I don't know why.Hello. Two weeks ago i attempted suicide (because i couldn't handle that awful sadness, the headaches, and the permanent nausea), by ingesting 30 (+-) antidepressants mostly being xanax and sertraline, + more than half a bottle of vodka. 8 hours later, i woke up and told my parents what i have done. (I still don't remember things clear at this point). They called the ambulance, and i was hospitalized in a psichiatric hospital for a week. Then,  i started to feel better there and to think that i received another chance. I was told that those pills, which were my daily treatment, made me feel worse than before. Now i'm taking  just a pill of Lorazepam/day. 

My question is, why am i still alive after all of the above and why my body wasn't even a little bit affected (all my tests done in the hospital came verry good). Thank you in advance and sorry for my english, it isn't my first language.
