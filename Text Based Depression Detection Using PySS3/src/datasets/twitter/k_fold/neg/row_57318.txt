Wemt to the doctors and got sent to a mental hospital.I got sent to a mental hospital. Got a psychiatrist and a psychologist. Met some great people in the hospital. Got meds that really helped me. It was one of the scariest things at first but turned out saving my life. If you think you are a danger to yourself I recommend going to the ER and telling them.
