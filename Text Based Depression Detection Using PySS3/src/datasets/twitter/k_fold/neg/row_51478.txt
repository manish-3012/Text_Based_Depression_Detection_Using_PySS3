I feel relaxed now I have made a decisionIâ€™m going to end  life soon . When I go back to uni , and my family donâ€™t have to find my body and after Christmas . Iâ€™m having one last holiday with the people I love . Even if Iâ€™m burden Iâ€™m going to try to be the best version of myself . But I feel so free knowing that Iâ€™m finally going to go through with it . I have the day planned so nothing goes wrong and I know I wonâ€™t make it out . I have a few people to make amends with . And somethings to come clean about . I just donâ€™t want to live anymore as simple as it is . I can go on about how my life is but Iâ€™m done doing that . No one will suspect it at all . Iâ€™m tempted to go through with it now . But I donâ€™t think I can do that to my family during this period of time . So il wait until Iâ€™m alone in my dorm again . Iâ€™m ready to leave this life now. A few more weeks and everything will be over .
