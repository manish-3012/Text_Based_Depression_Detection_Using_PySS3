Just want outLife has been a series of shit childhood and debt. Debt has become so bad I'm selling up my house and moving country with wife and kid.

I just keep wishing for a heart attack. Either that or I might just disappear after we have settled and I know she's OK for money and a job and family stability.

I plan to go somewhere in the world far away and just end my life there.

I feel it doesn't matter how many times or how hard I try to avoid debt and a bullshit financial life its always going to be there. I'm going to either live my whole life struggling to make ends meet or I'm going to die now still struggling. Doesn't make a fucking difference what I do.

I keep making mistakes. I can't repair my mental health and neither can any professional or medications I'm taking. Every night when I'm alone and the kid and wife is asleep I just have urges to slice away with the sharpest kitchen knife we have.

I didn't ask for this fucking life and I despise my parents for ever meeting and deciding to have me despite being told by my father that I wasn't planned... I was a mistake.

That's exactly how I've felt all my life. Just a total fucking mistake and I shouldn't be here. I've tried hard and I've lived a fucking hard 35 years. I don't look forward to my future.
