how do i talk to a suicidal friend without being selfish?i have suicidal thoughts, so itâ€™s difficult to find something to say when i know things like â€œlife will get betterâ€ or â€œi will miss youâ€ dont register sometimes.

i cant guarantee positivity or hope in the future unless he chooses to pursue it, and i dont know how to convince him that it is. i know its selfish of me, but i really dont want him to commit suicide and i know i have no control over him. i would be absolutely devastated if he did, but he doesnâ€™t remember that sometimes.

i just need something realistic and not selfish to tell him
