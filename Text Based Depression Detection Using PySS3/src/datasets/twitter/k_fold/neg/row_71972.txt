Suicidal with thanatophobia (fear of dying)The only thing stopping me from ending it all is how terrified I am for what comes after. I'm terrified of the idea of not existing at all anymore, but that's exactly what I want. I'm in so much mental pain every day and I just want it to end. I've attempted it before and ended up in hospital feeling very very weird. I never want to feel like that again, and I'm far too scared to ever try anything. But I wish I would've succeeded back then. All I ever think about is death - how much I want it, and how much I'm scared of it. I'm a living, walking, breathing contradiction.
