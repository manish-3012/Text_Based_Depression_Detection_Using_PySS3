Is it my fault for telling my friendâ€™s boyfriend she overdosed?My friend is severely depressed for about 2 years now and she kept making threats how she was gonna kill herself, even attempting it a couple of times and ending up in hospital.  Last night she told me how she was going to overdose and i kept trying to talk her out of it for about 3 hours, she kept telling me that she is sorry and that she canâ€™t do this anymore and how it just feels like the right time to do it.  She then disappeared for around 2h and when she comes back she tells me she has 12 pills and already took 4, I call an ambulance to her house and her parents to go in her room, by the time the ambulance was there and her parents in the room she took 9 pills.  Her mom messages me thanking me for telling her and that she is on her way to the hospital.   I then message her boyfriend telling him what happened, as if I was him i would want to know.   After about 2h she messages me telling me not to tell anyone, to which i agree. So i delete the message, but he has already seen it.   She messages me today saying that she hates me and that i promised not to tell anyone, which i havenâ€™t, i messaged him before i made the promise, and tells me that she shouldâ€™ve told him when she wanted to, not me.   I donâ€™t think I did the wrong thing by telling her boyfriend, I might simply be narcissistic, but i donâ€™t think itâ€™s my fault, anyway am i the asshole?
