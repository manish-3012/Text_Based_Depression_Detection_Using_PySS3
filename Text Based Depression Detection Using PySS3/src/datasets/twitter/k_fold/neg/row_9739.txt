Go on or just turn myself off from some basic but essential human activities?Hey redditors, Iâ€™m starting to think that life isnâ€™t for me (before I go on, I'm not trying to commit suicide, but gain advice and didn't what subreddit to choose so I went with this one, if anyone has suggestions to a subreddit pertaining to my situation then please refer me to them), I live in NJ where rent is high, jobs are scarce and hard to get, I live with a family that believes they are not racist when they are indeed racist and sexual victimize women and victimize victims in general, Iâ€™m poor like canâ€™t make it on my own if I move out because as I said rents too damn high in the city, even if I was to get a roommate. Hostility against me in the household is high from my narcissistic police officer brother (btw he described a fight between two people as nigger gang vs the white gang, and sexual victimized a women the same night he was called to a scene, thatâ€™s the type of people that are protecting our rights and trying to keep peace within our communities Iâ€™m convinced), my crazy brother who swears heâ€™s doing something with his life by sitting down on a ball all day playing guilty gears fighting game on his ps4, or using the home computer and going out at night to ride his bike, heâ€™s 28 btw with a useless degree in a major that I canâ€™t even remember, heâ€™s not socialble, doesnâ€™t have a job and believes heâ€™s normal when he obviously needs help (hell I need professional help myself from living here all my life), and my shitty parents in which my dad is a terrible person like literally when he was driving me and my sister somewhere we were waiting at a traffic light near a well known good high school in the area and as we were waiting for the light to change a black guy minding his business crosses the road to get to the other side of the sidewalk and my dad shouts â€œget out of here filthy niger the projects isnâ€™t that wayâ€. Like I said some shitty people I had to grow up with and mind you my dads an Uber driver and he feels uncomfortable when black people enter his vehicle as he always voices his concerns at home loudly to my police officer brother in which he agrees with him. My mother, she just sucks, sides with my crazy brother on everything (not the police officer one) and thinks heâ€™s the golden child, the only person I like in my household is my younger sister, sheâ€™s literally the only one besides me to have learned that the behavior of these people are wrong and idk about freedom to believe what you want if itâ€™s going to condemn and dehumanize other people, itâ€™s wrong and disgusting. Iâ€™m a 21 year old male, almost done with college, hopefully in 2019, but I donâ€™t get opportunities for good employment, internships are highly competitive and other people who have experience gather already in my grade because they had family members hook them up are getting these internships easily. Makes me feel terrible, canâ€™t even be given a chance to move out of my household and make a life of my own already, I have somewhat come to terms with my bad genetics as well (short torso, long legs, long arms suck, and are mechanically bad in the weight room, only advantage we get pretty much is the deadlift, otherwise extremely hard to pack on mass and doesnâ€™t look very aesthetic, that and Iâ€™m poorly endowed like 4 inches long and 3 inch girth so itâ€™s scary to try to get with a girl when practically everyone these days are hooking up and talking about their experiences with guys being big or average but still giving them a great time, plus a lot of people donâ€™t want relationships in which I donâ€™t blame them, times are changing and long term monogamy seems like itâ€™s getting highly outdated now). Holy cow I have typed a lot already and havenâ€™t even gotten everything down but this is a good gist of it, hard for me to make friends as well since I lack experience in partying although I do have friends, they all go to different colleges in different states and come back to NJ during vacations and such so not much to do until then, and people who are potential interests to become friends never have time to hang because jobs and priorities. Like seriously, how the FUCK is someone supposed to make it out here when they have been given bad opportunities growing up and their body doesnâ€™t make it any better? I know I was born with bad genetics and born into a bad family which sucks, and everywhere now Iâ€™m supposed to accept the new anti hate movement when I know that although I do accept them, I won't be accepted back, I would be made into a mockery with girls probably saying poor guy hope things get better for him and ending it there. And donâ€™t use old success stories, this is 2018, the old ways to get rich donâ€™t and be happy go lucky fuck everyone attitude doesnâ€™t apply anymore, everything requires a good degree of experience backed by a legitimately good employer to confirm this while having a fulfilling social life to be happy. Whatâ€™s the point of living when not everyone can become part of the white collar job force when college and some professors, not all, say that itâ€™s possible? Someone gotta do the dirty work amirite? Someone gotta suffer for others to succeed, ugh I feel oppressed like I canâ€™t really change much and I have a limited amount of potential I can reach until I reach a pleateau that wonâ€™t allow me to proceed further because of life. I definitely do feel better venting all of this out though, if anyone was going to suggest taking therapy Iâ€™m too scared to do so as I couldnâ€™t tell someone my problems with objective inadequacy ,any other advice will be welcomed! Thanks in advance!
