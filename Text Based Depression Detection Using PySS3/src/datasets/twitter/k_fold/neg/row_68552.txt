Iâ€™ve told my parents that Iâ€™ve had feelings of suicide. Theyâ€™ve told me things like â€œyou need to take magnesiumâ€ and â€œeveryone is suicidalâ€. Not once have they asked me why Iâ€™m feeling this way, or done anything in the way of consoling or anything remotely sympathetic.I donâ€™t know what to do at this point. Today on my way to getting a coffee, for a split second, I wanted to turn my car into the oncoming lane, into a truck. The feelings keep getting worse, and every time I speak to them about it, it ends up being more about them than about me.
