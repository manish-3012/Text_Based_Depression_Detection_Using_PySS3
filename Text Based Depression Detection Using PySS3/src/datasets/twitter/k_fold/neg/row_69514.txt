Just buy a new carI'm like a car where every little thing is either broken or going to need replaced soon. If I strategically focus on repairing only the parts absolutely necessary and hold out until each can't wait any longer I can extend the lifespan of the vehicle, but not by much. It's going to cost more to repair everything than to simply total it and buy a new car. 

I'm just trying to hold out for another few months with this mindset. If I ignore the issues and focus only on spending what I need to keep it immediately running, I can probably last that long. I don't need to worry about replacing every little thing. I can ignore the screeching sounds and the obvious problems because I know it's not meant to last anyway.
