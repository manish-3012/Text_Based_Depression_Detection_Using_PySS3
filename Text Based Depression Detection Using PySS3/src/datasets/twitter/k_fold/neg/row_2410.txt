I think I have a clear picture of how I want to go1. Alone in a far away place. 
Maybe Iâ€™ll go buy a small lot for this purpose...

2. Cut off all ties.
I donâ€™t mind not talking to my family ever again. Friends-wise, I already disappear from time to time. They wonâ€™t notice.

3. Donate vital organs to someone who needs it.
Maybe before going, I can donate a kidney. Maybe I can donate an eye, too, as I can live with one for my final moments.

4. Give whatever money I have left to charity.

5. Last days with an old senior dog with terminal illness to die with (he can die first and Iâ€™ll soon follow). Weâ€™ll enjoy our last days together and Iâ€™ll take care of him. Weâ€™d go on walks if he still can and maybe watch the sunset. Weâ€™d both be peaceful.

Everything hurts everyday and I donâ€™t think I want to keep existing. I donâ€™t mind dropping dead anytime now but if I must stick around, I want to go this way. A clean and useful death, with no one who knows me need to know.
