I'm really hopeless today. I just need for somebody to care. Feeling suicidal.A few days ago, I got broken up with by somebody that I actually started falling in love with. I feel as though he revoked any happiness that I've had the chance to feel in a very long time. I have not met any of my career goals, despite taking the MCAT twice, and applying to medical school for the first time this past year. I'm starting to contemplate suicide again, which I haven't done in months since being rejected from every school I applied to. 

This is literally my last resort at the moment. Iâ€™m applying to a handful of PA schools. I was listening to my mom talk on the phone with my aunt earlier about my cousin, who has graduated in Sweden and is engaged, and my sister who is in her fourth week of D.O. school. I started crying after I got home from the gym, because as happy as I am for them, I just feel absolutely left behind. Iâ€™ve worked for 3 years since undergrad with the hope of getting into med school, and I got *nothing*. It feels as though I have to always watch everyone else achieve what theyâ€™ve been working so hard towards, while I scrape by, bleed over everything, *try so fucking hard that I lose sleep over it*, and I get *nothing*.
