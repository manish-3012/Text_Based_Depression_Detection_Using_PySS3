Running out of patienceI got tested positive COVID.
Had COVID back in March and here it is again.

Nothing is working in my favor.
I started taking medication and therapy for depression past 6 months. 
Now I know i have been suffering PTSD, depression, and anxiety over 20 fucking years.  More than 2/3 of my life.

Only reason that i didnt suicide was to die on 30th birthday but running out of patience.
I quit weed and put all my effort to get better but this is what I get.
Life is hopeless.
Just endless suffering.

May be this is my way out... 
Wish me luck!
