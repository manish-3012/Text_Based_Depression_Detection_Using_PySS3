What should I do with lifeDear ppl of Reddit

Recently Iâ€™ve been thinking of ways to kill myself. 
What do you people do to keep moving forward in life? Me personally I think about everything... past, present, and future.
Itâ€™s like my life is already over and I just want to die. People will say â€œwhat a tragedyâ€ or whatever but really...
I donâ€™t know what the hell im doing anymore with life and Iâ€™ve already lost everything. I have a family but they donâ€™t feel like family. Iâ€™ve been through many friendships that died out of nobody is interested in my value to voice.
I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Recently Iâ€™ve just been living... yesterday I had a shitty day yesterday cause I cried for a whole day yesterday thinking of ways to die or how I could get that.
I know everyone has their own way of repressing whatever the hell they have in their head but I just want to die. I wish I could restart.
I donâ€™t believe anybody would notice or give a damn if I was gone anyways so I was just thinking about ways I should kill myself.
Maybe suffocation, starvation (I know itâ€™s slow Iâ€™m not stupid), pills, something sharp, just sitting outside forever and dying in that spot, disappearing somewhere.
Probably gonna make some last posts on social media before I go though too and message some people.
