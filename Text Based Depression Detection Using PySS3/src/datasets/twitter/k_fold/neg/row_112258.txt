Every future I see for myself ends in suicide.Iâ€™m currently a high school student. Sophomore. Good grades. People keep asking me what I plan on doing when I graduate. I always shrug it off, â€œIâ€™m not totally sureâ€, â€œIâ€™m trying to figure it outâ€. But in all honesty- I canâ€™t come up with a plan. I canâ€™t even see myself living another 2 years to graduation. I donâ€™t feel close to anybody. Iâ€™m secondary to even my closest friend. Sometimes  I feel like the only way I can matter to anyone is by being dead. I desperately try to tell people how I feel, but nobody seems to get it. Nobody ever contacts me. Iâ€™m lucky to get a single text from my best friend in a week. I tried for a while to get across how I felt but I just indulge in my suicidal feelings now. Iâ€™m only really living for my older brother and sister now. I hope I can bring myself to do it sometime this year.
