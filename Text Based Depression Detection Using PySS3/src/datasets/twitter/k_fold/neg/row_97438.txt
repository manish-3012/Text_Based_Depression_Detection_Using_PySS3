This site is cancer but I donâ€™t know where else to rant.I stopped taking my meds a while ago, I stopped by accident but then I noticed and just never started taking them again. Getting better means dealing with my shit and you know what? Itâ€™s easier to just be a bad person and justify it with my mental health. Thereâ€™s also the fact that every time I start getting better my brain thinks itâ€™s a TOTALLY OKAY topic to talk about with people. Itâ€™s not. You canâ€™t tell people you hardly know you want to kill yourself just because youâ€™re drunk and meds give you weirdly forward confidence. 

One part of me KNOWS I need to take them and get better but the other half of me knows itâ€™s so much easier to just fucking die. 

Oh and while Iâ€™m ranting letâ€™s just vent this off, every fucking time my mums friend come around she sees my pill boxes on the side and goes oh! Only x mg, thatâ€™s pretty low, Iâ€™m on x mg, itâ€™s one of the strongest ones. Like thanks Carolyn?? I didnâ€™t realise it was a competition mate but Iâ€™ll keep it in mind next time Iâ€™m thinking about jumping in front of a train x
