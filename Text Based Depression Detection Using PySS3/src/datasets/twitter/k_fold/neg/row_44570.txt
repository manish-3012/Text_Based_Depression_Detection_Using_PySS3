I am just tired of tryingAll my life all I wanted was peace. Nothing ever came easily. I had health injuries, and had to delay school because I needed to take care of my terminally ill grandma. Now renting rooms was my only source of income. A heavy rain destroyed roof recently, and only thank to miracle I managed to get loan to fix it. I was accepted to university and I thought finally I can start a new life.

Then a man came to fix chimney, and he said my roof is done wrong and as soon as autumn winds came, it will be torn up. I borrowed heavily to preserve my source of income, only to learn i need to put more or I will lose it anyway.

But I am tired of trying. I am tired of thinking, fighting my all life just to survive. I dont think I will bother anymore. I think I will just kill myself. I can't find single reason to keep fighting, and nobody wants to help me. 

I made prayers to God for last weeks so this all works out. I thanked him a lot when work was finshed and was really relieved that finally, I will live peacefully. But when I learned that I just went to my room and kept cursing at everything. I don't know what to do.
