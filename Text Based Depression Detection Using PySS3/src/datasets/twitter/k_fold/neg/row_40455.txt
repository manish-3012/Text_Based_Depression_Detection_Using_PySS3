Want somebody to talk to.I am gay and from a conservative country. I'm in my late 20s. I want to talk to people who aren't from countries where homosexuality is illegal. My sexuality makes me an extremely depressed person who doesn't desire to be in this world, every moment of my life. I'm not looking for anything other than an anonymous gay person (where it is not illegal to be gay) to talk about gay stuff, general stuff and feel normal. I would like to be anonymous, and at max voice chat. It's tortuous to come home after work and have nobody to talk to, the least I can expect. I'm tired. I need help. I'm not asking for much. A voice that I can look forward to. A gay story parallel to mine to read. I cannot take the lonely road anymore.
