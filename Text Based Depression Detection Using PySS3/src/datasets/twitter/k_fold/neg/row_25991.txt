I want to die but don't know how toI've (15F) been suicidal for around 3-4y now, and every time I think it's going to get better, life proves me wrong and it just gets worse.
Can't really get help because everyone around me says I'm too young to suffer with depression.
I'm sick of fight, please don't try to convince me otherwise.

I just need some help on how to do it... I need a way that won't hurt too much or take too long, and I have no idea how to write my suicide letter and who to include in the letter.

Please help me be free, please help me finally reach my peace... Please
