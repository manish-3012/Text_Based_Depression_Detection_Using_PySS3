Lets try thisobviously throw away acc. 

So I've been suicidal as long as i can remember but have never acted apon it because well it's never been the right time. but that time is approaching good people. I thought I'd give you a chance to convince me but first let me see if i can shed some light on what i've tried.Therapy, drugs, 'loved' ones, nothing, everything. the point I'm trying to make is that I'm tired. no i havent reached the end of my rope. yes there's still so much life to live. but i've had my fill. i'm tired. i dont want to anymore. 

even at the high points in my life i've had the thoughts but always supressed them due to well.. the fact that when life is going well it tends to keep you busy. you don't have much time with your thoughts. but then i lost my job. and now i'm cleaning. and sure i can get a job back in my field. and get back on my feet. this is only temporary. but i've had a lot of time to thing and self reflect. I'm not a good person. the world will not be better with me in it. Either way it doesn't matter what the world will be like after I am gone because I dont care. That's another point I'm trying to make. I don't care about much. I try oh i try. there's some things i have to care about. like paying the bills and putting food on my plate. I digress. There's time though so don't worry. I've got a few things left to do before my time is up. I want to try DMT. I've gone on the deep web and got some of that so thats neato. then if that doesn't give me some type of spiritual awakening. i'll probably give my dog up for adoption and hang my self off the balcony after i spend all my money on junk food and shit and just pig out for a while. 

anyhoo. sorry for all the spelling mistakes and stuff. i gotta go do a shift. good luck!
