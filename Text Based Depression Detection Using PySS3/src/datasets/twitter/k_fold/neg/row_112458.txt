I date and fall in love with women who I eventually learn can't or won't love me back.I know the problem is more theirs for being that way than it is mine for simply finding them attractive. 

It's happened enough times though that I'm starting to feel like it is my fault. I'm not perfect, but I don't deserve this. I can't help that I'm slow to fall in and out of love, but I wish I could find somebody who feels the same way for me that I feel for them.
