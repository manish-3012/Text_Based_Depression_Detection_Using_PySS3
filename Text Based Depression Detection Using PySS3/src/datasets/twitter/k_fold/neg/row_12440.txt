Played sim-like games because...I'd like to have a family on my someday. But I think my suicide will stop that from happening obviously. 

I've download this Virtual Family game on my phone, had some kids, have a third generation of my people now. 

I can die happy. This is the closest I can get to being married and having my own family, you know?

I don't know when or how, but I have this feeling gnawing at me telling me that I'll never live longer than this. That one day, I'll take my own death to my own hands. Hopefully, I'll be brave enough to do so. One day.
