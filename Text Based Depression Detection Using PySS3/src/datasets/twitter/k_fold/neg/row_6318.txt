A failed attemptJust trying to vent and clear my head.

A couple weeks ago I tried to kill myself and would have been successful if not for external factors. I had pulled my car into the garage and left it running, I turned the radio up and layed back in my driver's seat.. it felt euphoric, I wasn't scared or anything. It almost felt like dejavu I can remember everything so vividly before I started to lose consciousness.



Around the time I started to get light headed and fading out.. a friend showed up at my house unexpectedly, she was in a panic quickly opened up the garage door.. came into my car to turn it off. Never said a word to me.. she was probably in shock, within 5 or so minutes I stopped crying and when I got out of my car and tried to light a cigarette that's when the horrible headache started. It's the most painful headache I've ever had in my life.



 I ended up being diagnosed as bi-polar and have been taking meds for it.. I don't feel normal, maybe it's because crazy was my normal for so many years, but I feel disappointed.. like I already made the decision to kill myself and it was taken away from me. Now I'm just depressed but don't have the motivation to try again
