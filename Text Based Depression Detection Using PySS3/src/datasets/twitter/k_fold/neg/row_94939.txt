Years of tryingI've been incredibly suicidal since 2015. Five years later, I still feel suicidal. I openly talk on social media about needing help and support, but no one really seems to care. Today i just feel way too much pain and i cant wait to end it all. It's gonna be in two hours. I feel scared. But i feel ready. I have had enough â™¥ï¸
