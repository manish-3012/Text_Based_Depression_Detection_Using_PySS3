Anyone else have this feeling?So a little back story. I'm 23M, divorced, father of 3, and an Army Vet (never deployed, so nothing too special). I'm not currently suicidal, but I have attempted suicide 7 times in the span of 15 days when my ex wife first took the kids and left. Really the only thing that saved me was my ex wife contacting a battle buddy living close to me who was able to get to me in the nick of time. 

Anyway, lately I've been thinking of my future, and entertaining the thought of death, or how I might die, and, every time I'm absolutely certain I will die from suicide at some point later down the road. It's like the bouts of depression get harder to resist, darker each time, the feeling of self loathing and self hate gets stronger, and the compulsion to just end it all gets progressively stronger, and, eventually, I believe it will become too much to resist. Like I said, I'm not actively planning suicide, I was just wondering if anyone else feels the same? Thanks for taking your time to read this. Hope everyone has a great day :)
