I donâ€™t know what to dotrigger warning: mentions of suicide 

I overdosed towards the end of last month and I woke up in a hospital with no recollection of how I got there.
My parents told me after 2 weeks of being back home everything that happened. And it was traumatic.
All I can hear is sirens in my head. Thatâ€™s all I hear. I keep replaying the moment I woke up in a hospital room alone.
my heart wonâ€™t stop sinking.  I wish I wouldnâ€™t have been found.
The psych hospital I stayed at was traumatizing too. They put me on the wrong unit and my life was immediately threatened by this other patient.
There was screaming,
slamming doors.
I had a panic attack and they quickly moved me to the right unit. 
I thought I was safe. I had been on that unit before. A couple days passed and I got a new roommate. She immediately asked me if I liked girls. Which I found odd, but I figured maybe it was friendly. She told me she did, so I responded and said I did too. I thought that Iâ€™d have someone there to share something in common with. The conversations moved deeper and deeper into discomfort. She asked me if I liked anyone there, I told her no- thatâ€™s not what I was there for. She asked me if I had ever been on a date, my sexual history, my preferences. She pushed and pushed and I told her I wasnâ€™t comfortable talking about it. She didnâ€™t stop though. Days passed and she followed me around everywhere. She was attached at my hip. The questions continued and she moved closer and closer in proximity to me. Eventually I just decided to space myself from her, so I found a quiet corner everytime she was around and pulled out my journal to look like I was occupied. She followed me, and when I finally told her I wanted to be alone she circled around me in laps. She literally walked around the entire room and circled around me. 

One day she asked to borrow a shirt. I said that was okay and went to get a shirt for her. she walked in and closed the door. I held the shirt out to her, thinking sheâ€™d go change in the bathroom or Iâ€™d leave. Instead she undressed completely in front of me.
I felt frozen. she kept moving closer to me.. until I pushed behind her and left the room.

It feels so stupid- because she never touched me. But she moved closer and closer to doing something. I saw the signs, because Iâ€™ve been through this before- just not the same gender. 
I feel so dumb. But if a man had done this wouldnâ€™t there be hell to pay? I knew if I didnâ€™t do something she would touch me. She would go for it, despite the boundaries I placed and the severe discomfort I portrayed. I told a nurse. She switched me out of our room. 
I thought maybe that would be the end to most of it, considering she couldnâ€™t do too much in sight. But she just pushed further and further and got closer and closer. Sheâ€™d sit beside me at the table and slip her hand onto my leg. It got to the point I isolated myself from everyone. I stayed in my room or my corner. I was on edge for days. a week. there wasnâ€™t one moment I didnâ€™t have my eye on her. finally I told my parents. They called my doctor and I was discharged early.

I still feel on edge. I still hear the sirens. I still feel my heartbeat the moment I woke up in that hospital room. Now I feel stuck. I failed to escape. again. And now I know thereâ€™s no sense in trying, but I desperately donâ€™t know how I can cope with things anymore.

I donâ€™t know how to live.
