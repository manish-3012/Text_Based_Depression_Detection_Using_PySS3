Up at 5AM, just wanting to end it.Fucking Christ my life is a mess. I act happy, but Jesus Christ I'm to the point where hanging myself is a viable option. It all started when my brother killed himself. Literally that splintered my whole life.

The only person who was really there for me was my girlfriend. We had a good relationship up until we broke up and fucked a dude a couple days later. Our breakup was messy as fuck and it hurts because she was there for me so much. Can't even bring myself to talk to her, haven't for months, just so disgusted and sad.

My mom took the whole thing harder. I should explain that my mother and I walked into a room where my brother had just shot himself minutes earlier. Her PTSD has hospitalized her twice, and she was just told that she wasn't mentally stable enough to work where she worked.

And me? I've been the "strong" one for the family. But now I'm destroyed. I dropped out of college this semester to be with my mom, but also because my mental issues nearly killed me up there. I miss my old life, this fucking shit has been non stop for 2 years. And I'm sick of it. I'm fucking sick of it. I WANT TO BE HAPPY. But it's non stop, I've gotten nothing but shit since then.
