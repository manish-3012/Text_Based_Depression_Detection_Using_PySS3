Last night I tried to sit in my garage with the car on. I failed.Had my therapy appt yesterday. My psychologist made me a safety plan because she was concerned for my well-being. I told her I would commit myself to the hospital or call my parents if I felt the intention of doing it. That was a lie. 

A few hours later I began to panic and became frantic. But in that same moment, without question, I took my car keys and went into my garage. Turned on the car and sat there for five minutes in the dark. Breathing in deep. And I fucking failed. I turned the car off and started crying. I canâ€™t even said this was an attempt because it felt so half-assed that I felt even worse about myself for this fake stupid attempt. Such a fucking idiot. 

I came back inside and started to cut myself after months of going without. It felt so good. To have a moment of peace and a sense of euphoria. After that, I smoke my weed and sat on the couch while I felt my wounds ache and sting. It felt good. 

Here am I, awake again this morning, Christmas Eve, wondering how Iâ€™m going to get out of bed and do my daily tasks again. Wondering how long this is going to take for me to finally muster up the courage to finish the fucking job.
