I'm tired of being in agony every second of every day and having friends tell me to just be more positiveI have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Occipital Neuralgia. I've been diagnosed with depression and gen. Anxiety for almost a decade. I'm turning 26 on Valentine's Day and have been in constant, and I do mean constant, pain since May of 2013. I used to be outgoing and was voted Funniest Female all four years of my high school career. That person died when the pain took over. 

Recently my pain management accused me of testing positive for methamphetamine back in September but only told me this past month so I couldn't have the sample retested and prove it was a false positive. it's a constant battle trying to receive the pain medication I need to make my life worthwhile and not be viewed as merely a drug seeker or a young person who just wants attention and isn't really in that much pain.

I've had so many procedures I won't go into naming them all but the one that was supposed to be my saving Grace was a brain surgery in Jan of 2016 and as I'm sure you can guess it was less than effective. I've had brain surgery and almost 90 needles put into my head (countless needles elsewhere for IVs) and yet still doctors look at me and treat me like it can't possibly be this bad. 

the opioid epidemic in this country is so infuriating to me not just for the obvious reasons but because if I were to go through with this I would use my pain medication to try and finally have a pain-free moment as my last. however it would just be insult to injury because I'm guessing I would just be another statistic they would use to twist how bad opiates are when they're only bad because people abuse them. When really I just want them to be out of pain.  

I'm not here to argue the pros and cons of opiate medication. I know addiction is a horrible disease and I would never begrudge anyone their struggles because of something as serious as that. It is just so unbelievably frustrating the reason I feel like ending my life is because I can't control this never-ending pain due to some people  deciding that a few have ruined the system for everyone and because people just want to cash in rather than actually help people. And I don't know if I want to live in this world anymore if that's how it has to be.

I'm sorry for rambling. Mostly I just feel so alone because not many people have the condition that I have on top of everything else. I think if it was just the depression and anxiety I could handle it or even the arthritis depression and anxiety I could handle it but this never-ending electric needle stabbing pain in my skull is driving me up a wall and I don't know if I can take another five years of this.

Sorry if this isn't making as much sense I'm crying and using text to speech on my phone because it's hard for me to see through the tears.

I'm sorry if this is too long. Honestly this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have an amazing support system in my life and I know I'm luckier than most I'm just so tired and it's that kind of tired where no amount of rest, therapy, or anything is ever going to quench it and I don't want to survive if I'm just going to feel like this the rest of my life...

Basically, if they take away my pain medication, I'm 90% sure I'm going to find a way to kill myself. And I honestly hope to God no one else ever has to feel like this because it's so isolating. 


I'm sorry if I've bored you.
