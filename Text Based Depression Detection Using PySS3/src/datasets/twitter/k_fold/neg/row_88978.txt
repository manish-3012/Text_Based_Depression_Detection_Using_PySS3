Please... I feel so alone.I don't want to hurt anyone else. I can't do it; but everything just hurts. It feels like it's my only option now. 
I've done everything I could and taken all the advice I was given; I took a huge risk and "ran away from my problems"(quote, Mother). I moved to try and get out of the rut I was in. And for a week... The first solid week in 5 years- I didn't feel depressed. 
And then it came back. My depression hit me. Not like a ton of bricks.. More like large bags of sand being slowly stacked over my stomach, and my chest, making it hard to breathe. Making my whole body hurt and keeping me from laughing or talking or being able to eat or sleep. 
I just simply can't take it. I want to fade away. I'm all alone here, and worse, I'm not. I have only one person who cares at all and I'm so wildly pathetic that I can't be happy even just for them. I'm worthless, I won't ever amount to anything simply because my depression and my anxiety will continue to crush me under their weight forever. 
To me, it feels like if I just get it over with now, it'll be for the better. There's no point in carrying on when I know what's going to happen in the end regardless, right? I'm lonely and in this fresh new place, at least no one will miss me.
