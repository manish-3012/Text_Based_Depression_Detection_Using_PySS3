Feeling hopeless.My man and I are struggling financially, my health is getting bad, my emotions and working on my mental health and BPD are causing tons of reopened wounds that's I dunno how clean out besides bitching and bad coping mechanisms. I'm trying to get better, but it's overwhelming. My cat is having aggression issues, I'm worried I'm pregnant in the midst of it but it's too early too take a test. I feel useless. I want it to get better but it keeps getting worse in other ways and I can't blanace living life properly. I don't *WANT* to feel this way, or feel like death is the option and to boot if I *am* pregnant I couldn't do that to a life inside me... But I feel like I've just failed everyone... I'm just worried. I want to give my boyfriend a break from my bullshit. It's been five years, and he's so patient but seeing him struggle is hurting me, and I need to get better. This part of me wants to be a cam girl u til I get into a job support program in my city (it's in the works, just waiting for support to open up, and I would tell him, not doing so is wrong) to pay some bills but I'm not sure that's a good idea. He even said he's not sure about my face/naked body being on the internet and I agree yenno?

I'm ranting I'm sorry. I just want to help him, and make his life easier while being with me and in scared I can't.
