I don't think I can take this anymore.I wanted to study philosophy in college and graduate before I kill myself (I know I will eventually), but I don't think I'll be able to hold on much longer. The pain is too much, the burden is too much.

I don't have anything left besides that objective. I'm a toxic, negative person. I can't have any healthy friendships or relationships in general. I can't get better; I've been to therapy a bunch of times already, it was a horrible experience.

I just want to rest. I've wanted this for 10 years. So much time... carrying a burden like this is exhausting.
