My brother killed himselfMy brother took his own life today. The effect is chilling. My family really needed him here. 

My parents have been talking about wanting to die because of it, etc. It's been one of the 2 hardest things I've ever been through in my entire life and I'm struggling. 
I mostly wanted to post about his death by suicide so I'm
not sure if this is the right post, I'm not suicidal because of this and plan to live life to the fullest.

I just miss him though and can't deal with the sadness
