Iâ€™m tired - transgender or something
I came out to my wife last year.  I donâ€™t want to transition.  Iâ€™m 6 foot and broad shouldered.  Iâ€™d make a monsterous woman.
My wife has been reasonable about it but admits that it hurts her.  I donâ€™t want to exist in this shitty world anymore.  Iâ€™ve been trying to look at the positive but Iâ€™m really tired...  so tired...
