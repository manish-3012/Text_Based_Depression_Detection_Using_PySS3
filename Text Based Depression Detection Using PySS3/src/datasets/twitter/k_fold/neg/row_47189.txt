Does anyone use suicide as a backup plan?I always just think no matter how bad things get i can just be at peace if it ever gets really bad. I know there is no benefit to killing myself but sometimes it just sounds better than living a life of hell just for a small small chance of happiness which i dont even know if i will ever get.
