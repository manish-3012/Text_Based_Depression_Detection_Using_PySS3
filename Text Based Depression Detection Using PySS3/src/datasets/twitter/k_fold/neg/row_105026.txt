There just isn't a lot to do in life by yourselfThe subject says it all.

I don't get it, I moved to this city because I figured the culture would be one I could get involved in; at least superficially, I should be having the time of my life.

I don't enjoy life at all, I never really did but I don't understand. There just isn't a lot here. People won't interact with me, and I'm sure if I knew what was going on in their heads, I wouldn't care, but I don't, so I do. I can't get along with anyone, I'm so jealous and envious. Isolated beyond belief, but it seems like nothing matters, like the body you were born into determines everything unless you can somehow do everything online. I hate my body, it's always been a burden and an issue, never done any favors, even when I did favors for it. I get it though, that's normal. It's normal for life to suck, and to suffer, and to be unhappy. It just doesn't seem to be normal to be this isolated, to not have any options or actions to take, to just be stuck. 

I'm stuck, and I  have been for years. I get it, I was stupid enough to be born into this body and still have human wants and needs, that was my fault. I should have known better. I should have known before I was born that some people are just too ugly inside and out, too different, to be part of any or the whole group. Doesn't matter, even the outcasts outcast some, that's me. I want to die, but I'm afraid. I am so tense, so lonely, so frustrated, tired, afraid, and bored. There isn't a lot you can do by yourself, this world was built for two. There isn't a way out, it's just separating from people more and more each day, realizing that life passed by and it didn't matter, nothing matters, this is a cruel and cold world and somehow people still connect. I wish I was human, it's too late for me, but reach out to someone, save someone before they become like me, before it's too late and they're just a shell sitting in front of a computer, no longer even relating to those blobs floating about, fucking and having fun. How can you relate when you don't share the same reality? How can you relate when you both live in different worlds, where your actions and world have opposite results? Where the nuance of the world is somehow caught on a reality TV subscriber, but lost on you, because you're an idiot, because you haven't a clue.
