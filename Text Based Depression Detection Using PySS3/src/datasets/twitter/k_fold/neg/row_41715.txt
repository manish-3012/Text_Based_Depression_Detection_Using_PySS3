i genuinely want to commit suicide and the only thing stopping me is my dogmy dog is the only living thing i value in life. if it wasn't for her i would've put a bullet through my head already. i have not a single person in my life close to me other than her. i refuse to kill myself just because of how much i know it would hurt her, i can't allow someone who wouldn't take care of her to keep her.
