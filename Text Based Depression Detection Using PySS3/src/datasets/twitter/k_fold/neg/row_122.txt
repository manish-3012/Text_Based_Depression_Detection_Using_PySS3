I'm ending it on new year's day.I've posted on here before and the only response was a troll comment so idk why I'm posting again. I guess I just need to organize my thoughts somehow. I've been looking for a better job for well over a year now and I can't even get anyone to look at my resume. Ive been applying to several jobs a day, I actually have my default tabs set to job boards that I search and apply on in my spare time. Since I started I have has 4 interviews but they offered me less that I am making now even with my hours and responsibilities being cut.

I want to work so bad it is literally killing me inside that no-one will even look at my resume, or won't offer me a living wage.

I just found our that my rent is going up. One of my bills has also doubled because of a late fee since I couldn't afford to pay it on time. I am just so done. I hate myself and I hate my life but kost of all I hate living. For the first time since I moved out on my own I wasn't able to pay rent this month and my roommate had to make up the difference. It's looking like that will happen again next month and on top of that I have no idea how I can afford to pay my bills now. My savings is gone, cost of living is rising, and I am just a burden on those around me.

I'm tired of being a burden on others and I'm tired of working a dead end job that I despise knowing that no matter how hard I try I will never get out of it. I'm going to end it. My dad has inherited some guns over the years, he doesn't like using them, so he just keeps them locked up. I know how to get in to the safe. I am going to find a day I can go over there while they are at work and steal one. I don't want to live to see 2020. I don't want to live anymore. I'm just tired of being in pain all the time. I'm tired of constantly feeling like I am drowning.
