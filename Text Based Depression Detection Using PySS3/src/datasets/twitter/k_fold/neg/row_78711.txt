I donâ€™t know anymoreI canâ€™t seem to be happy I lost all my friends me and this girl had a connection and were going to go on a date I canceled it and said I didnâ€™t want to anymore Iâ€™m a fuck up my teachers tell me Iâ€™ve given up on school my parents yell at me for my shitty grades and all I  can do is sink my time into pointless video games that make me a worse people I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m here if all I ever do is disappoint the people I love and yet I canâ€™t get anyone to love me back
