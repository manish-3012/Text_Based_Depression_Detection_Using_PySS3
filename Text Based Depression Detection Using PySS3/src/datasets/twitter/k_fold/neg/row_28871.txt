Really need someone to chat with, I can't do thisHi, I'm a 24 year old Reddit user who's fairly new, and I'm extremely EXTREMELY depressed and contemplating. June 25 I'll be out on my a** because my roommate is moving so I'll basically have nowhere to live, I don't know what to do or where to go. I don't think anyone cares honestly
