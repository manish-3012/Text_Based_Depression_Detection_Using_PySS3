Nobody wants me hereNobody wants me around. Everybody always says they miss me, they hate to see me go- but when I'm there, they don't want me. They might want my presence or what I can do for them but nobody wants ME. Nobody wants me around because of who I am, and it may be that I can change or maybe I can't, but that's who I am and everybody wants me gone cuz of it.
