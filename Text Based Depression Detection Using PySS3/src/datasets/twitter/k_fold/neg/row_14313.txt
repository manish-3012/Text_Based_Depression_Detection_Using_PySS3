I hate life (but I'm scared to die)First off, I'm coming from a web search for others like me and, honestly? I'm so jealous of some people. Not because of how they were feeling or the thoughts they were having but the support they received. I went to a few support websites: 1 was a glorified "I have more mental illnesses/have had a more fucked up life than you" competition, Another people made fun of me and another was completely empty. I'm running out of options. I'm so tired. But I'm also sick of nobody having an answer/wanting to talk to me about it. I'm always just referred to call a helpline then ignored. I DON'T WANNA CALL A HELPLINE!!! I've tried it all: meds, therapy, psychoanalysis, tried to "go out and force myself to be around people", tried to "join clubs and take up hobbies". I tried it all and I've been met with nothing but rejection, hate or complete ignorance. I feel insignificant and worthless. All I want is 1 friend. 1 person to go get a coffee or a beer with. 1 person who I can call/will call me to talk/complain about our days and such... I have no one. I've spent my life being as helpful as I can but here I am, wanting to die but too chickenshit to do it. I could easily grab one of the multitude of carving knives behind me and open a vein/cut my throat. But I'm terrified of the pain. I could easily go into the medicine cabinet and take all the pills in there. But I can't because I'm terrified of death and I couldn't put the grief on my family. So I'm stuck here. In a state of complete isolation and sadness. I wanna cry. I do cry. All the time. I wanna beat the shit outta myself and hopefully give myself brain damage so I don't/can't remember any of this. I'm angry at the world, I'm sad. But most of all I'm an attention seeking pity party. I want someone to care about me when everyone has their own problems. How selfish can I be? Maybe I shouldn't even post this. Not like anyone will care either way. Fuck...
