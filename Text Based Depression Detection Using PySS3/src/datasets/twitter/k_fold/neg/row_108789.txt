Ready As I'll Ever BeI'm going to try and kill myself later tonight. Its not a situation of impulse as this will be my 3rd attempt in 4 years. I've already tried to get help and it didn't work. What I need and am missing is the human connection. Most people get that from their family or from a SO if they don't really have a family. I've had neither in my life and have just pretty much been left to be by myself. Of course I've physically been around people my whole life, but I've always felt completely alone and miserable. Its always been like that, but I can't and won't take this anymore. No matter how much work I do personally, that will never affect the people (or lack thereof) around me. I hate this place and the emptiness inside of me is completely fucking unbearable.
