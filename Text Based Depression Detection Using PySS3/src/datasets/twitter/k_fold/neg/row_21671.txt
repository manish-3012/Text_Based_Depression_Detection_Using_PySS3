Iâ€™m so pissed.I was home alome all weekend and I shouldâ€™ve killed myself while I had the chance. I have the means (I have money, I can go and buy a rope, or jump off a bridge, or onto train tracks) but all I did was sit around and cry and watch YouTube. I feel like Iâ€™m going insane. I just want this to end.
