ExhaustedI just truly don't think it will get better. Good things happen or I realize something and the afterglow lasts a week. Then I go back to this sinking feeling, this depressed place. I really feel like I lost whatever essence was in me that had creativity and hope and connection. I'm honestly just sick of my coping mechanisms, my apathy, the way I check out. It's so hard to picture myself ever being happy and my changes never last long. I feel too old and I feel too depressed. I'm so convinced that everyone I meet hates me or will abandon me. It's hard to enjoy anything. Nothing ever stays consistent or when things are good I leave the good thing. I wish I knew what was on the other side. Because I'm exhausted.
