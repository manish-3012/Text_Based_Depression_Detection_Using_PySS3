My second planned suicideI'm hopeless.

When a person tries to dm me to help me, I dont respond. Trust issues. No one to really trust. 

I want to talk about it to my dad but hes a narcissist. Hes my only parent. He will make it about himself, admits how stressful he is because of me, that I told him I was suicidal. So what's the point in asking him now. 

My family are shit talkers and gossipers, they wont understand. 

So... who am I suppose to talk to about this? 

I've realized tonight, I was just a faceless person to a lot of people. I'm always alone. Even in family gatherings. 

I wanted to die in January 1st 2020. I couldn't because my dad took the long thick cord to charge his car outside. So I found a new method few months ago. I'll use it. 

Maybe I'll die on my birthday next. May 21. 2 months away. 

I know how to kill myself. Learned it. 

If I'm damned for this... no words. But, I'm lucky to never witness anything in this horrible world. 

I already wrote my suicide note. It's just sitting in my closet. 

.

I hope I will find the courage to end it on may 21. I already set the date on this virtual calendar too. 

Before my birthday, I will go to that same church and talk with that women who helped me when i went to that church for the first time in 2017. She helped me a lot. She will be the last person I'll ever talk to. It's worth it. Shes a precious woman. I'll give her a homemade necklace that I will sew. 

Shes the only genuine human being who really loved me. My elementary school teacher.
