Iâ€™ll never be goodEven if everything goes my way Iâ€™ll still be fucking mentally ill and the way so iety views my disorders is so awful. Iâ€™ll always suffer even if things get better around me. Iâ€™ll never be lovable, Iâ€™ll never have someone who can love ALL of me. Because I have Dissociative Identity disorder. I have â€˜multiple personalitiesâ€™. Who could ever love one crazy person, let alone multiple? Iâ€™ve got so much against me. I really really wish I could kill myself but my parents would be devastated. They expect me to be the good son, the non suicidal one, because my sibling is so suicidal already they canâ€™t take two broken kids. my pain resonates in my soul. I canâ€™t see how anyone would love someone so broken. I canâ€™t be fixed. Iâ€™m sick, and Iâ€™m awful And a bad person. Iâ€™m haunted by the actions another alternate identity did. I didnâ€™t do it, but my body did, and Iâ€™ve got the scars and suicide attempts and Iâ€™m just so so tired. Iâ€™m tired of losing my memory. Iâ€™m tired of dissociation every single day. Iâ€™m tired of the smallest thing triggering me and everythin gn is so chaotic in the world right now. I canâ€™t tell anyone I know about my problems or experiences because all theyâ€™ll hear is that Iâ€™m hearing voices, having delusions, or that Iâ€™m dangerous. I just want to curl up into a ball and just die.
