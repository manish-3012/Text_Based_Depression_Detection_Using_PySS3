My girlfriend killed herself.I'm tempted to join her. Can't even tell my family because I'm not out.

I feel awful because I didn't even feel much when her brother texted me. I just read the message and it didn't register until a moment later that she was dead.

As that's it. My girlfriend's dead. She was the light of my fucking life. I thought she changed me but I'm still the useless piece of shit I was when she, idk, took pity on me or whatever. Fucking hell. I've been crying for hours and in thinking of just drinking myself to death.
