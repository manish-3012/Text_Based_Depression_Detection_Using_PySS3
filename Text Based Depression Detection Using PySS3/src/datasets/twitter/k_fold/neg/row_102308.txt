I'm really sorry to reach out.My boyfriend of a year just left me. I can't get into college until the fall. I haven't been able to get any kind of job and I don't think I'll be able to keep my insurance. I'm trans and I don't feel like a woman any more. I just want to give up and O can't talk to anyone close right now
