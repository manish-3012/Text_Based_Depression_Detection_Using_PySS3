My parents won't let me go to my friends houseI'm 16 years old and not allowed to go to my friends house. Its just a 20 min walk and won't let me go cause it's "school days" but its Sunday. Now he's cursing me out for being a bad kid and crying for asking him for a good reason why I can't he go and just says its "cold". Going to my friends way is the only way I stay happy and not want to kill myself. I hate it here so much. I don't want to stay here in the house and be alone all the time.
