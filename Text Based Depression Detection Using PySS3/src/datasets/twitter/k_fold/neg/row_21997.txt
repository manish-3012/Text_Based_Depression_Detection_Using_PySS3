I have discovered something simultaneously awful and wonderfulThe only thing keeping me from killing myself at the moment is fear of hurting my family and a lack of willpower. You know what I realize though? If I'm dead, I won't even be able to care about what happens to them, because I'll be dead. 

With this in mind, I can freely kill myself. Tonight.
