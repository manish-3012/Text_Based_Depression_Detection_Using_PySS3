Iâ€™m seriously considering hanging myself right now and I donâ€™t know who to talk to about itIâ€™ve got the cord tied, just waiting for my family to go to sleep to hang it up properly and well you know. I donâ€™t know if I actually want to die. Iâ€™d love to talk to someone, but Iâ€™m gonna sound like a manipulative, dramatic, asshole. The close friends of mine already know how suicidal I am, and that Iâ€™ve attempted several times, calling them would be rude, and I doubt theyâ€™d believe Iâ€™d actually go through it (and theyâ€™re probably right). My parents will hit me and yell if I bring up feeling suicidal, then go through my stuff and take away anything they think I could use. The hospital I usually end up after attempting is shit. I said I was more suicidal then when I came in once and the doctor immediately sent me home (but hey Iâ€™m still alive so maybe he was right, Iâ€™m fine). Iâ€™m feeling worse everyday and my therapist isnâ€™t helping, but my mom wonâ€™t let me leave the program. Existing like this is so painful, I keep thinking tomorrow I can make it better, but itâ€™s always worse. If Iâ€™m being completely honest the only reason I havenâ€™t done this earlier is because Iâ€™ve gained 35lbs and Im so disgusted with it and donâ€™t want that to be how Iâ€™m found. And yet, thatâ€™s what I said after gaining 15, 20, 25, 30 - maybe I should definitely kill myself before Iâ€™m 50lbs overweight and even more miserable.
