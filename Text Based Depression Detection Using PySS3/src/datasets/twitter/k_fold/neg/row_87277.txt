I don't know if im depressed or just an edgelordI say I want to die, but I don't really know if that's what I want or just something I say. I hate myself, I think of suicide frequently, but I can't admit to myself its depression. i feel like an attention seeking liar, and I'm so tired of my life. I have no reason to be sad, and I'm not even sure if I am, in just here, and I hate it.
