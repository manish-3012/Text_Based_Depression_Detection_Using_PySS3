Congrats. You did it.You've been bullying me for being the only trans man on testosterone in our "friend" group/queer organization for months. Now you're claiming that I'm abusing you, abusing my boyfriend, abusing the person who abused me.

You want me dead. You're threatening to "wreck my shit" because I asked the staff advisor of the organization to remove said abuser because seeing her name makes me sick to my stomach. You think I'm the literal cocksucking devil or whatever.

That's fine. You win. Next time my boyfriend goes to work for the day and I don't, I'm injecting the stockpile of testosterone I have and taking all 4 months of birth control pills I have, downing a bottle of rum, then laying down in a nice warm bath to pass.

It'll feel good. I'll be comfortable. 

My family won't miss me, I'm a fuckup. I do feel horrible for how my boyfriend's gonna feel, but he's handsome, smart, kind. He'll find another guy, or maybe date a girl after me, I dunno. But he's a catch. It won't be too hard.

You'll feel bad though. You'll feel horrible for having my blood on your hands, all of you. It makes me smile.

My name will live on. I'll be that kid in the [identifying info] program that everyone thought had potential but died tragically young.

Everyone will think of you as sick, pathetic, mentally ill little cowards who can't face the world around them, much less someone who won't be a doormat for you.

I feel sorry for you, honestly. I hope that every time you close your eyes for the rest of your life, you see me. You see the horrible pain you caused.

Rot in hell, bitches. I'll see you then.
