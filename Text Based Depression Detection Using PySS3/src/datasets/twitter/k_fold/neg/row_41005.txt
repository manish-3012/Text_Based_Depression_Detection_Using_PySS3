Burner phone for suicide hotline?I know this isn't the normal type of post here, but I was wondering if y'all could help me out. Here's the deal. Lately the impulse to kill myself has gotten a lot stronger, and I don't feel entirely safe, especially since I'm going to be living alone for a stretch in the near future. I'd like to know that I could call a hotline in case of an emergency, but I'm still on my parent's cell phone plan, and I don't want them to know if I call one. So I'm considering getting a burner phone for that purpose, but I don't know much about prepaid phones. Do I keep having to pay monthly in order to keep the number, or can I just add some minutes one time and forget about it? Do I have to activate it ahead of time, or can I wait to activate it when I need it? Thanks for any help
