I have dealt with persistant feeling of killing myself for the last decade. It REALLY does get betterI've been at the end of my rope for like 13 years. I know that the mantra in your head says to end it. But through personal experience, LEMME TELL YA! IT GETS SO MUCH BETTER. Pm Me if you want some consolation for how absolutely shitty things appear right now
