I guess I made it, kinda.2 suicide attempts, 100s of self harm scars, days of endless crying and years of depression but I'm finally 18. This means pretty much nothing, except I did something I never thought I would. 


I don't really know what to do now, I feel worse, I feel more alone than ever. Maybe I can make it another 18 more, I don't think I will but who knows. Happy birthday to me I guess.
