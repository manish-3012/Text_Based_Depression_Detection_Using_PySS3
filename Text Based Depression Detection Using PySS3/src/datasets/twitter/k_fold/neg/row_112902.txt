I donâ€™t really wanna die. I just want everything to be over.Why is life so hard? Everything is hard and I donâ€™t even see the point. 

It just gets harder every year and every day. After you conquer a challenge, a harder one comes. Why can we all just be chill and happy? 

I just want to sleep and never wake up.
