Iâ€™m a failureI donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna graduate high school on time. I used to have good grades but now Iâ€™m a failure with no ambition and no friends. I donâ€™t wanna hurt my dad though, my mom died 2 years ago, it was my grandpas funeral on Monday, and I donâ€™t want my dad to hurt even more after I die. But I canâ€™t do this anymore, Iâ€™m useless and I have no future. Iâ€™m so tired, Iâ€™m just scared of hurting the people around me even more by dying, Iâ€™m sure my one friend will get over it and my brothers wonâ€™t care and my other family members also, but idk about my dad and my little sister
