I suck at everything. I think it's time to go.I'm 16 years old and there's nothing in this world that I'm good at. I suck at everything. I'm just a useless piece of shit, loser and a failure. I was diagnosed with autism when I was 13 and my life started to get worse when I was diagnosed with it. I lack social skills and I barely have any friends. I've had a speech impediment since I was born and I barely speak because of it. I don't do well in school so most of my grades are terrible. I  can't even take part in most activities properly because of the fact that I also lack motor skills. I can't even hold a pen properly and my handwriting is terrible. I can't draw. I'm extremely bad at math and of course I don't know how to use a compass thanks to my stupid motor skills. Let's talk about my free time. I play video games in my free time and one of the reasons why I play video games is because I want to distract myself from the fact that I'm autistic but I can't really keep a conversation going when I'm talking to people online because I just don't know what to say. And I suck at video games too. Yep I suck at my hobby. I play Minecraft and I suck at PvP(Player vs player)  even though I've been doing it for over 5 years. I just can't do it well. One way of being good at pvp is to jitter click(you pretty much vibrate your hands) and put your fingers in a certain position on your mouse which I can't flipping do because of my motor skills. I'm not good at any video games. I'm not not good at any sport. I can't do anything so I think I'd be better dead because I'm just fed up with all of the mess that goes on in my life. I'm tired of being bad at things. I can't fix my life at all. I don't even think I'll get a job because of the lack of skills I have. I don't want to live in this world anymore it's just too hard now.
