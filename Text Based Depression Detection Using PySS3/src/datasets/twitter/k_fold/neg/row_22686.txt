Iâ€™ve Posted Here BeforeWhy is that some people get droves of support? Whilst others get ignored? It seems the more articulated and astute the observation of their own suicidality is the less people feel the need to respond. 

I repeat! Just because someone can articulate exactly why they feel suicidal, doesnâ€™t mean they donâ€™t need support too. Sometimes it helps just to feel like someone....anyone cares.
