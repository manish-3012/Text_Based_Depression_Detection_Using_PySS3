Okay, I will finally admit it....I am lonely. 

It's been hard to admit. 
For years and years I have struggled with women. I am 28 M I go on lots of dates, we laugh and have a good time. I ask lots of questions, try to relate with what they are saying and then they just...leave. 
Say they don't feel a connection or whatever other excuses they come up with. I know that they just found a better man. Someone who offers something i don't. I don't know what else I can do. I have hobbies, I have a good job, I am pretty good looking and yet I am so very lonely.

I have read posts on reddit by men in there 40s and 50s saying despite all there efforts it never got better. This puts so much fear into me it's hard to describe. I have been feeling like suicide is the only way out more and more over the last few years. Why can't I ever get some god damn happiness?

I don't know how much longer I can last. But it's getting harder.
