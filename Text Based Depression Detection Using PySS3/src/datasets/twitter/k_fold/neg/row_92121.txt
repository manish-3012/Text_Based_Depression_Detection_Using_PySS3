23M can't seem to get my mental/emotional act together, would prefer deathI am 23M. 6'2, BSc with good grades, great GRE scores, was an eagle scout, in marching band, have had multiple romantic relationships. But right now I am living with my parents, struggling to even move during the day out from under a weighted blanket. Taking 10 mg of lexapro and 25 mg of adderal xr a day, 8 + cups of coffee, sleeping 6+ hours, eating decent. I recently got a gym membership and I am trying C25K and some beginner lifting. I stopped drinking recently. I am talking to a therapist. Nothing seems to be helping

I have no desire at all to work. I have no desire to go out and do anything. I see photos of my most recent ex girlfriend who is roadtripping out west right now with new people, a new guy in her photos, looking like a million bucks and super confident. They all look really happy. I am incredibly envious of this even though there is nothing stopping me from doing this myself. I know its immature and unhealthy. But she looks hot, happy, she is traveling, and I am at my parents house under a weighted blanket at 3 PM wanting to die. 

I never knew my mom's dad but she said he made her childhood hell. He was an extremely narcissistic, conceited, manipulative man apparently. Lectured my mom and her siblings about Christianity while beating them senseless, beating them if they took quarters to buy food at the corner store, wouldn't let friends over, talked about himself constantly. She also suspects he was a frustrated closeted gay man who always wanted to be an actor but failed, lied to himself, and became a computer technician. He was a chaotic, selfish, unhappy individual who took out rage on his family. At family events he would only talk about himself and his fancy new stuff. He jumped around with jobs because he "hated unintelligent people telling him what to do". Honestly some of this stuff sounds like me and I hate that. 

My romantic relationships start out with a lot of passion or joy and then slowly and inevitably I wear them down with tedious arguments, bickering, jealousy, even though I am really attracted to them and like to see them smile and help them. Its like tourette's, but manipulation, I can't describe it. Like I intentionally sabotage and push people away and get a kick from it. I hate it. It is extremely shitty and maniacal. I have pleaded for help with different therapists but one of their responses sums it up, "I can't give you a pill to make you not an asshole." 

Essentially I have the worst of both worlds. Not only am I conceited, selfish, and struggle with feeling true love and empathy, but at the same time, I feel overwhelming guilt and shame for having hurt these girls feelings, especially my most recent girlfriend, who planned for a future with me. I said senseless things I don't understand. I looked through her phone expecting to see cheating and found literally nothing but cute notes about me, photos of me, things I might like, like dinners and dates. It broke my heart to see that she really did care and I was being batshit crazy, and hurt her tremendously and she stopped putting up with it. 

I don't get it. I don't see a point to life. People like myself are not supposed to reproduce. My grandpa was a horrible, snot nosed, micropenis of a human and I have received his horrible genes related to emotional regulation and sociopathy. I desperately crave affection, good memories, joy like giving raspberries on bellies and seeing my friends and girlfriends at their best, but have pushed every single person away through crazy paranoia, bitterness, and self hate. 

To add to this I am dependent on adderall and antidepressants and stress about it constantly. I am on my parents health care plan but adderall, being a controlled substance, is a massive headache to coordinate if I move or get a new job somewhere else. The days I don't take it, every second feels like an hour. I don't want to take it but it helps me be productive and functional. 

Why not drink? My body is soft and shitty like Gibby from iCarly. Why not just be a drunken, fun mess of a person, destroy my body a little longer and just get blackout drunk and hang myself. Hopefully no pain. This girl was the love of my life it feels like, and for absolutely zero reason I made her cry multiple times, made her doubt my trust, and pushed her away, to find much more happiness elsewhere.
