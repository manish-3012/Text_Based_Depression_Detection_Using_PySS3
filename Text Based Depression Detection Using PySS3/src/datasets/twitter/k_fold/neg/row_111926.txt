Wife Attempted Suicide Today...I know that when my wife was younger she struggled with suicidal thoughts, but she has continued therapy for the last 18 years and largely been successful.  We've been married for nearly 4 years now and it's a particularly stressful time due to finances, my transitioning to a new job, several major problems with our home, and a viscous lawsuit from a neighbor who wanted our dog.  (Was dismissed but took a year to get to court and was very stressful.)

She seemed to be in fairly high spirits the last three days and this morning was in a particularly good mood.  As the morning went on we talked, I told her how happy I was she'd saved my favorite shirt from a stain, and she was laughing and joking with me.  She decided to do some chores and I played Xbox.  About an hour later I got up to get a drink and noticed she wasn't in the main portion of the house so I went upstairs to check on her.  Found her in bed with a bottle of muscle relaxers I got for a bad back and a bottle of her own daily mood stabilizers.  She had taken about 27 muscle relaxers and around 150 of the mood stabilizers in addition to a full bottle of Tylenol, and she had attempted to use razors to slash her wrists and throat.  Thankfully she is very afraid of cutting herself and was not successful.  I carried her downstairs and took her to the ER.  (Didn't know how many pills she had taken or would have called 911, thought it had been much less.). Took the bottles with me and they sedated her and put her on a breather.  It was absolutely terrifying.
She is in ICU but Tennessee has some rule where nobody can see or visit her until the doctor decides they can so I'm sitting at home trying to decide what to do.  I'm not allowed to call or be there so I got a nurse to let me write her a letter telling her I love her and that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to support her through this rough time.

I've noticed when she drinks she tends to get more depressed, so when I got home I dumped all the alcohol in the house.  I like beer but not as much as I liked her.  Hopefully keeping something that triggers her out of the house will help some.  I kind of feel like I'm taking her choices away though and I want her to feel independent and worthwhile not like a child who is in trouble.  Do you all think this is the right call?

Has anyone had experience with this in Tennessee and if so how long did it take for you to see/be seen by your loved ones?

Since she took my prescription is there any chance of criminal charges?  I don't care about the pills or lawyer bills I just don't think she needs to experience another trial.

Can the state forcibly put her in a treatment facility and if not as her husband can I put her in an outpatient program?  I think she will want to act like this didn't happen but I want her to get help.

If I can put her in an outpatient program do y'all think it would be a positive? Again I want her to feel free and validated.

What things can I do to better prep our home to be a safer environment while she's works through this?

Thanks for reading and for any answers.  It has been a terrible day.
