Can you help me?Like i don't now if i sad or something. But there's heavy emotional burden. Is it overwhelmed? How to be strong guys? I'm close to i'm gonna lose it but i don't know? Do you have any solutions?

It happened because my mom got breast cancer (it is treated now with surgical removal of her left breast and she is at her 3rd chemo now) she will worried so much if she feel some lump on her other breast, ( already checked and the lump is cyst with water, it is not dangerous) 
she will always worried too much, asked again &amp; again if it is gonna be okay and cry like there's no tomorrow, ask me if there's really lump, is she gonna be okay again and again and tell me to take care of my family if she dies.(mom has depression medicaly checked) 
i love my mom, and i need to be strong to hold my mom up, so i always try not to cry, or vent (if i have problem)  in front of her. 

But everytime it happened it is getting numb.
Do you have any solution of how to vent without everyone knowing it?  Or reduce the feeling like "i'm wish i'm asleep and not gonna wake up again"?

I never had any profesional checked my mental state, if i checked it right now im afraid that it will makes my mom more worried. (And i can't go out from my house because i'm the one who takes care of her 24/7 and because this Covid19). I have history of hurting my self if i feel any pressure or unwanted feelings. Need solutions.
