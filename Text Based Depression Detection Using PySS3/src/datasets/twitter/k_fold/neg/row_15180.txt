Not sure if this the right place to post this but for a moment of hopeYour neck isn't a shirt, so don't hang it
Your skin isn't paper, so don't cut it
Your heart isn't a door, so don't lock it
Your life isn't a movie, so don't end it
I'm sorry if this offends anyone or doesn't belong here but when I saw this I thought I'd post it here 
I'm in pain and don't want to live anymore but maybe I can make it one more day
