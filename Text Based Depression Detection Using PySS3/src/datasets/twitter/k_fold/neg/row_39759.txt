My sister attempted suicide and I need advice on what to doMy sister attempted to OD almost a week ago, my family didnâ€™t tell me until today because I knew something was up when they came back from the hospital. 

Idk what to do. Iâ€™m super close to my sister and never picked anything up, Iâ€™ve caught my friend multiple times so I guess I thought Iâ€™d catch someone like my sister if they were on the edge as well. I canâ€™t comprehend that she tried to do that, we live in a pretty happy and stable house and my parents do whatever they can to keep up happy. Idk how to approach her, she doesnâ€™t (and canâ€™t) know that I know that she did this and I just donâ€™t know how to help.

 I canâ€™t grasp the fact that she tried to take her life, I keep thinking she did it to draw attention away from what she did earlier that day, especially since she tried to use a painkiller instead of the harder drugs we have on the house for my mom or grandparents. But then I go back to maybe she just didnâ€™t know, and if thatâ€™s the case Iâ€™m glad she didnâ€™t because she wouldnâ€™t be alive if she did. 

The hospital reported the incident and sheâ€™s going to be on suicide watch soon, idk how thatâ€™s going to settle with her and Iâ€™m scared sheâ€™ll try it again thinking  itâ€™ll make it easier for us. If the court makes a decision within the next 6 months my parents are going to have to choose either her or myself to go to child protective services since weâ€™re both minors ( Iâ€™m 18 in 6 months that why I mentioned 6 months earlier) and if they take her it could make things worse for her mentally as well. 

Idk what to do, I canâ€™t grasp that she tried to end her life, idk how to help her or my mom or anyone in this situation. I want to just leave the house all day because no one knows I know and it hurts to see and talk to everyone right now, but I know thatâ€™s not the right thing to do since she canâ€™t be left alone and if Iâ€™m always out then sheâ€™s bound to be alone for some time. 

If someone who is going through something similar to what my sister is going through or has been in a similar situation to mine please help.
