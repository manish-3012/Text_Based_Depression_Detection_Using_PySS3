i made a constantly updated document thats basically an analysis on myself, my mental state, and my emotional state.throwaway account haha

I recently created a google doc that I'm updating constantly that's basically an analysis of my own mind, using examples, stories, and other stuff to explain it. I wrote it to put in the #vent channel in my IRL friend discord server, so there's some stuff that only they would know, but literally only one person seemed to acknowledge it so I'm just gonna post it here. Jokes are sprinkled here and there to lighten the mood hopefully

Some context to who I am, I am a junior in HS in Texas, I play a fuck ton of games (currently i have every d2 title for perspective for those who play) and I have been diagnosed.
