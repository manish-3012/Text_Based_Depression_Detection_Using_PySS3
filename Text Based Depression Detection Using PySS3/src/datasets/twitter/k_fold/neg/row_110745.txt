Im too weakNo matter how much I think about commiting suicide, I never can go through with it. I think about cutting my veins and downing all my pills but I never do.

I've held a knife in my hand and brought it to my arm. Nothing. 

I'm too weak to die, yet I'm too weak to live too. Everyday I go through life, sometimes okay, sometimes I feel as though no one gives a shit. I talk to friends and family and I know that if I told them they would never understand. 

I feel so alone, and I feel worthless. Like nothing matters anymore. Like I dont matter anymore. It feels as though I could die today and no one would notice or care enough. 

I was absent from school one day. A few people texted. When I didn't respond, I got nothing else. No more messages. No phone calls. Nothing. 

I could have died, and no one would have noticed until it was too late.

Thanks for listening to my ramblings, I guess.
