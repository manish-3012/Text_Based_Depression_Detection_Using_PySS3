"Just get help."I'm so fucking sick of being told to just get help every time I express difficulties coping with mental illness. As if getting help is an instant, permanent solution to all of the difficulties of being alive when you don't want to be.

I am now 24. I've been in treatment consistently since I was suicidal at age 8. I've been in psychiatric hospitals, and I've been in outpatient programs that were full time and limited my ability to work or go to school for years in the past. I've been to good therapists, and I've been to therapists so abusive that they fucked me up even more by saying it's all my fault and I deserve to suffer until I die. In spite of this, I still go to therapy, trying to undo the damage that therapy did to me in the first place. I've been on dozens of different antidepressants and antipsychotics for over a decade. I have consistently reached out to doctors, family, friends, and anyone I trusted for help. Most of the latter have abandoned me. Most of them just make me feel worse.

I have never stopped trying, and yet I am still fucking suicidal. Every time I hear "just get help" or "just see a therapist", I want to punch someone in the face. You really think I haven't fucking tried? You really think it's that easy? You think I'm so stupid that I never even considered doing anything to help myself?

Every time someone tells me to just get help to stop being mentally ill, it makes me want to give up just a tiny bit more. All it does is prove to me that I'm a complete failure of a human being, because even getting help doesn't work.
