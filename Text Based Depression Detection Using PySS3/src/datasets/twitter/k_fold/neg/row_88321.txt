A part of me wished I'd find a reason not to, a part of me knew I never would. Adult virgin catching the bus (at last!)&amp;#x200B;

"Catching the bus". I hope no one gets that reference. If you do, you must have been suffering for as long as I have.

But I feel at peace. At least I'm trying to find peace. I don't want to go out crying, but smiling. I'm not sad, but resolute. There is a slight spring in my step, a clarity of mind, though my body is utterly shattered. I have been thinking this over for the last few weeks (in the context of being depressed for 20 years) and now I realise, this is it. Now is the time. I've waited and waited, and I can't wait any more. There isn't going to be better time than now, with my failing health and worsening life.

If I could go back and be born as someone else, a different life, a better life, of course I would do so. If I could start again, I would. I am not happy to be exiting with a whimper, but I am no longer feeling sad about it. I'm neutral. Almost indifferent. (At least, I can at least fake that.) It has to be done. I'm resolute. I don't have a choice. It's probably always been my fate, and I've been fighting extra hard for a better life since I hit 30. But I failed. And I'm not really interested in fighting against the current any more. The universe has made it abundantly clear what it thinks of my efforts.

I have some things I need to do first. I need to find a way to say bye to my mum, without it sounding final. My mum doesn't deserve much from me, but she does deserve that. I need to clear out all of my writings, and personal belongings, though I can do that easily enough as I have access to a skip. It will be hard to say goodbye, my world has been books and movies, and I have so many fond memories - reading on the beach, etc. But it counts for nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I can't talk about my plan and I don't want to give details anyway. I will cross country to a favourite spot of my childhood, and early morning I will be found. I hoping that I can find the strength to smile through the pain and trauma. I doubt the painkillers will help much really but who knows. This isn't how I wanted life to be, but this is how it is, and it isn't ever changing. But that will be a final victory for me, if I pull it off, ending my sad, pathetic and loveless life with a rare smile.

Thanks for reading and "sorry you're here".
