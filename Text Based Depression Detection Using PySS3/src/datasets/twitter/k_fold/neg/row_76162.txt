I wonâ€™t do itI want to though. Life is ultimately pointless. You can be the most important person ever and theyâ€™ll never make a lasting difference. 

I want to kill myself. I want to slit open my jugulars. I want to see the blood flood out of me the moment before I pass out. 

I wonâ€™t do it, but I want to.
