Do others even care anymore?I've never been an ordinary kid as i've faced multiple occasions of physical and mental abuse growing up, so you can imagine what kind of effects that'll do to later in life. I hate being there for others and feel like i'm being fed bread crumbs and just taking the blame when things aren't my fault. I don't know what to think of myself and it's tiring to wake up another day with no hope, no future and no one to vent to without looking like an attention seeker. I'm always tempted to self harm but I just don't know what to do anymore...I just hate myself to the point where i don't really see myself anymore.
