The girl left me for a guy I used to hang out with and I just can't take it. [Update]I'm the same redditor that posted that post under a throwaway. I was talking to her today, and I asked if she and him were going out, and when she said yes, I just saw red and punched him in the fucking face as hard as I could. I beat the shit out of him, and I don't regret it. I reckon they're still going to the dance so I'm thinking of ending it during the dance right in front of her so that she can she what she did.
