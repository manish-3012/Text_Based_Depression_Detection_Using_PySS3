I want to dieHello. I want to die so bad. I was adopted from the foster care system in Oklahoma. My parents were very old and strict religious. I had very bad Tourette syndrome so I had to leave school and be homeschooled by myself for years. I didn't know about social justice. I only watched Christian shows, and didn't have internet until recently when I was 28. I'm divorced, and I'm trapped here. I'm traumatized by the things I've lost, the pain and what an awkward person I have been. I've spent much time alone with my thoughts. My son requires extra care in school. It's been exhausting. I also have bipolar disorder, and I forget things. I never feel like I belong anywhere. I'm empty fragments of disappointment, embarassment and confusion. Things weren't nice here. I could continue or elaborate, but there is no point. I'm trying to be strong. I'm still trying to graduate college. Love my kiddo. Things are getting harder for me to cope with though.
