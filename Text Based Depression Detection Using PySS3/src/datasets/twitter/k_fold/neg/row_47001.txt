Always been alone.My dad beat me... my dad rejected me.  just when I thought I found happiness, he left after 5 years... I thought the military would help and it didn't... I moved to CT for him and he still left.  I thought I found the one person that would love me always.  He promised... I think I'll always be alone... No one could ever love me...  I know people are going to tell me otherwise but I don't believe them anymore... Everyone leaves...
