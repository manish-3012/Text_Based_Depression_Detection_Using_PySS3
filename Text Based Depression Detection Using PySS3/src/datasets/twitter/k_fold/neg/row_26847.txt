Another Not So good DaySo once again, outside negative forces and triggers have brought me to my dark side.  Some days it just seems the fight is just not worth the effort, so why bother since giving up is easier and the pain would finally be gone.

Any thoughts, guys? Have you felt this way and how do you get out? I won't lie; these days, vodka ( a lot of it) seems to be my only best friend who seems to understand me.
