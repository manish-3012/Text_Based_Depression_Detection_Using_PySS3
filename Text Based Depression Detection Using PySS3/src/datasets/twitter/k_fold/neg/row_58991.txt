I want to end it all.But I'm to scared. "Killing yourself is selfish, you leave your family with your pain." That doesn't stop me. Just the thought of "where will I go after it is done." Will I start a new life with no memory of my last, is there a land of angels and a land of the damned, do I get to look over people? These questions will never be solved but the problem starts when I don't want to live because of how shitty life is, but I don't want to die for my fear of the unknown. I am a high school sophomore taking college and advanced classes that are killing me. They overwhelm me with homework and classwork to the point that I have little to no free time. I started sacrificing sleep to have time to do what I want but even that will never work. I do not want to spend my life slaving away doing work just so I don't stay in the low class. The only things keeping me alive are video games but if those cease to interest me then I am ending it all. How do you all deal with the garbage we call life?
