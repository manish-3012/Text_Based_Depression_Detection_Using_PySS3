Fuck off mom, you are not helpingA couple of days ago, I asked my friend if I livestreamed my suicide, would she watch it. I made it clear that I do not intend to do it and I am just asking because it is a fun question to ask. She was pretty chill about it and we had a nice talk and then I forgot about it.

Earlier yesterday, my mom comes to my room and starts lecturing me on how I should not even think about killing myself and how she got calls from my friend's mom regarding me considering suicide. My mom then lectured me for like an hour on how I should not do it and instead "pray more" and left me feeling worse.

Later in the evening, she again brought this topic up, this time in front of my dad and then he began lecturing me for like a good half an hour on how I should not do it and how I shouldn't talk about it with my friends either.

(I would usually not talk about this to anyone but I was feeling really down that day and really needed to vent somewhere and i consider her to be a pretty good friend of mine and someone i can trust. Im never talking to anyone again about suicide or how i feel ever again.)

Now, my mom has been randomly bringing this up since today morning telling me to pray more and not think about suicide. Fuck off mom, you are not helping.



Ps. There is no real point to this post. I just needed to vent somewhere. I'm sorry if this doesn't belong to this sub.
