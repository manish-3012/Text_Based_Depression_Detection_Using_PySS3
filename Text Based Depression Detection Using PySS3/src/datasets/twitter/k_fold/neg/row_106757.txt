Gonna start my note tomorrow I thinkI don't know when (max 6 months as I said in a previous post) but I feel pretty sure my life will end my suicide. I feel that if I do leave a note it'll end up extremely long and so I should start it as soon as possible. That way I have it on hand and can leave at any moment without any loose ends.
