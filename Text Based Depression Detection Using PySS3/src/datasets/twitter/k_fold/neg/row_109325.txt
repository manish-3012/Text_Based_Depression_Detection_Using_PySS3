All I can think aboutis taking a long drive to the beach. Watching the waves for a couple hours until the sun sets. And then driving home on the empty roads, before I run myself straight into a tree. 

I don't know if I'll actually do it. I've been struggling a couple years now, but it's been getting really bad these few weeks. Whenever I do drive to the beach, by the time I finish watching the waves, I feel a calm settle over me and I don't feel like killing myself anymore. My life these days is just constant flipping from extreme apathy to suicidal tendencies.
