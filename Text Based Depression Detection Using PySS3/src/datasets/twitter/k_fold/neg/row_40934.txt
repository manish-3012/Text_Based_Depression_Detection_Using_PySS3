Mixing up my depression with who I amI'm so scared of reaching out for help because I'm scared to try again. I've tried so many times. I've battled with depression for so long. I'm not going to get into my whole life story because that's not even the problem anymore. I am. There's something wrong with me. I can't even kill myself. I've tried, unsuccessfully, and I'm scared to try again because I'm scared of another failure. I need professional help but I keep getting in my own way. I was recently fired from my therapist/psychiatrist. I keep mixing up my depression with me. I believe that it will never get better. I think I'm only wasting the limited resources on this planet if I exist.
