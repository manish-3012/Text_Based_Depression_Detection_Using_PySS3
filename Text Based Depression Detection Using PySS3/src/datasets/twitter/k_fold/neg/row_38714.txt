Not sure how to report a suicide risk as they live in another country - trigger warningDoes anyone have any advice on how to report a suicide risk to law enforcement if they live in another country? This person lives in Bronx, New York.

A person on tumblr has made a post saying she will commit suicide in the next few days. They are posting a lot of other concerning things as well. They have made plans previously to do it, so they are clearly very serious. I have found their facebook and a few of their other social networks.

I have tried reporting the post to tumblr staff and nothing happened, and I have contacted various suicide watch type blogs on tumblr for advice, but received no reply. I'm not really sure what the next step is. I'm considering just messaging one of her facebook friends or something like that, but that could always inflame the situation somehow.
