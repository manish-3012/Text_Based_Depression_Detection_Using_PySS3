I'm currently planning my death, but I dont want to go trough with it.I'm currently going trough how I'm going to warm up my garage, so I can feel warm and well when I hang myself. I'm going to make sure the clean up is easy and not a big hassle. 

Even though I'm doing all of this, a part of me just wishes it could be all fine. Like it used to be. I was the most driven person people knew, I ran, lifted a lot and ate healthy. I was positive, helpful and worked with kids. Now I am the one in need of help and nobody seems to realize how broken I am. 

I want somebody to ask me "Are you okay, Rupvag?" and actually mean it. I want someone to care about me, someone to cheer me up and help me. I want to finish school, but cant get myself to do any of the work. I want to do the work, but I just CANT. I want to be helpful at home, but just CANT. 

Somedays I feel great and enjoy life, then when I come home and lay in my bed, I realize how shit it is. At least, how shit I actually feel inside. 

I already failed a class and about to fail some more, I dont want to be a drop-out. My brother was and I feel my family will be disappointed in my if I've thrown away a year doing actually nothing productive. I feel its better to kill myself then expirience the yelling and scolding, the talks about how fucked I am, how shit I should feel about myself. My dad realized I was getting shittier grades and said "You dont want to be a failure like everyone else in this town, dont be like them". I want to die rather than feel shit like that, again. 

Feel free to ask if theres anything you're wondering about. 
I have not set a date for my death, yet. I feel like I cant go yet, not sure why.
