why am I like thisIâ€™m 19 years old.  As of right now, Iâ€™m laying in my bed crying, wanting to die. Iâ€™ve felt like this my entire life even as a small child, I can remember not wanting to be in this world. The only thing that is really stopping me is my mother and how I can see her already losing herself just because Iâ€™m not there. Iâ€™m her first love she says (her first child) and I know sheâ€™d be broken because her favorite sister also committed suicide but I just canâ€™t take it anymore. Not that this matters at all, but Iâ€™m a pretty female with everything Iâ€™d need at my finger tips.. a phone, water, a nice bed, things other people donâ€™t take for granted.. so why am I like this, I feel like something is so wrong with me... I wonâ€™t take meds because they shoved stimulants down my throat as a child swearing I had â€œADHDâ€ .. and I feel like that kind of fucked me up a little inside.. I honestly never knew about this app but I feel like itâ€™ll save me from myself or at least hopefully potentially harming myself. I canâ€™t do it, I donâ€™t have enough courage to do this to the people who care for me but I want it so bad.. more than anything Iâ€™ve ever wanted.. I know itâ€™s selfish, itâ€™s so selfish but I will not be happy honestly truly happy until I am no longer feeling this pain. I know we all have pain but I feel it on a another level... to the point where I hit myself in my head very hard when I am mad at myself.. no one knows these kinds of things about me... Iâ€™ve always done it... just kept it to myself because itâ€™s so weird like who the fuck does stuff like thisðŸ’” I just want help and I want to be happy before It actually results in dying for happiness. I love nature so much, and animals theyâ€™re my best friends. People? Not so much.. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s me (probably is) but I always felt like I just never belonged like why as a child did I want to die? Iâ€™d always look at my mom and say â€œI hope Iâ€™d dieâ€ â€œI wish you never had meâ€ â€œWhy canâ€™t I just dieâ€ does anyone know whatâ€™s wrong with me... I donâ€™t believe any form of counseling will help me.. I do yoga to try and help myself but my head never stops talking to me ever.. even when Iâ€™m trying to talk it still doesnâ€™t stop
