I am existingSuicide is so simple with how it works.......... one step, one flex, one jump. the only way i am moving forward is with time. to preserve my youngest beauty, i should die quickly, so i can die young as it should be.

I do not leave the house. when people talk to me i cry, because it hurts too much. medicine doesnt help me. my psych doesnt want to prescribe me different medicine because a young person should not be taking them, and she's right. my current medicine doesnt help. so i guess i get to die.

i hve been neglected and abused by opiate addict parents since the day i was born. i have not known love, and i cannot accept love. i fight and kick away when its near me.

i havent opened up to my therapist yet even though i have had her for two years. all she does in our sessions is spout motivational quotes at me for 45 mins. lol. i often dont go. she'll never understand.

im not diagnosed with any mental illnesses yet because i do not have any apparently. somehow i have found solace with pschizophrenics. i pretend i'm one of them because they're all very kind and they panic and scream like i do.

i cant work because at my old job i went home early several days a week because i just cried all day. i had the job for a very short time.

I think im done existing. day in and day out. wake up, eat a chocolate, go on my laptop, nap, nap again, eat leftovers, nap again, go on my laptop, go to bed. it's a cycle i've worn into the concrete over the course of my entire life as i have never had friends.

no one will ever understand.

maybe God will though.

walk with peace. sip your coffee.
