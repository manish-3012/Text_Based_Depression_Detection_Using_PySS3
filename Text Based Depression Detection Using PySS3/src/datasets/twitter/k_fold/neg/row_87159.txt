i'm tired of living like thisi'm almost 19 now, i don't have a job, i don't go to school, and i'm not good at anything. i still live with my parents. i have no friends, all of my past relationships went to shit and i can't trust anyone. i'm constantly feeling isolated and alone. i can't even take care of myself half of the time. i'm tired of living. every day, i can't stand the feeling of being awake and conscious. i'm never happy. i use fantasy to escape from the real world, but even that's not helping anymore. i don't know what to do. i don't want to go back to the psychiatric hospital. i feel like the family disappointment and i don't have the energy to fix myself. i don't know how much longer i can take this. i'm so close to giving up on my life.
