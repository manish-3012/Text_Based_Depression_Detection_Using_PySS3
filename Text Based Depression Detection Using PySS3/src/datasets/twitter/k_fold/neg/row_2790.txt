Drunk, sad and alone.Last night I dreamt about someone long lost, probably impossible to contact and the only bridge to her won't help.

Also I'm thinking about a recent lost person a person who I put so much into. My depression scared them away and I feel useless because I loved them. I think about the time we started everything and it is not helpful that I'm rude to her when she leads me on. I know that's not healthy and is bad of her. I love her though.

Now I'm super drunk and I feel that even lice don't want me. 

Sorry if this isn't a good post, I need support, I tried overdosing earlier this year and I'm afraid I'm not all there.
