Itâ€™s just not worth it anymoreSince I was 8 or likely before, I canâ€™t really remember much on my childhood, Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself. I just canâ€™t shake the feeling that life isnâ€™t worth it, the effort is just... wasted, worthless; itâ€™s an investment made for you without your consent that generates pitiful returns everyone expects you to be hyped about. 

Well, Iâ€™m not, my job takes the things I love about what I do and crams them full of so much kafkaesque bullshit itâ€™s nearly unrecognizable. I have ADHD and struggle to do something if Iâ€™m not personally interested and while I have my meds they donâ€™t last all day. Hell, even when they are working it feels tainted with the knowledge that they could be taken away at any moment, and I would without question pop enough opioids to kill a horse six times over if that happened. 

Last time I took an IQ test was in middle school, back before I took meds and would be so miserable in class Iâ€™d end up running around for no reason so who knows how shit the results were but I got 135-140. Got put in gifted classes and couldnâ€™t do the simplest of logic charts, because I didnâ€™t care. Was basically seen as the class moron; whatâ€™s the point of being intelligent if itâ€™s all fucking useless? Its as if Iâ€™m being taunted by biology itself; I can teach myself anything I care about but the second I actually fucking need to do something Iâ€™m a pencil tapping, leg bouncing, chair spinning, thousand yard stare stuck in my own head sack of shit. Just salt in the fucking wound knowing you should be able to be a â€œsuccessâ€â€”whatever the fuck that meansâ€”but your idiotic lazy fucking ass would rather study shit thatâ€™s entirely irrelevant while the work you have to do stacks up and up and up. Iâ€™ve lived my life by the skin of my teeth and canâ€™t even feel last minute panic anymore; the fuck kinda adult even says that shit? 

I donâ€™t want to do this anymore; Iâ€™m fucking tired.
