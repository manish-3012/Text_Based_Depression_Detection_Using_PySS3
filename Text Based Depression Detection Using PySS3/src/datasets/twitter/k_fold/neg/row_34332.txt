A rush of memories from elementary school came unpromptedThis happens every once in a while. They are of when I was severely bullied. 

Remind me why I shouldn't regret being born and then shoved into a shitty institution and then told by my parents to "ignore them" when bullies beat me up.

I usually play videogames to unwind and escape such memories but today, for whatever reason, it didn't cut it.
