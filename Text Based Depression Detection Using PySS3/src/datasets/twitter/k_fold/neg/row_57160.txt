So much anxietyI feel like I have this need to wrap myself in a blanket and keep myself away from the outside world. I wish I could run away because I just can't take anything anymore.

The closest I've ever come has been driving down the expressway late at night, and speeding up whilst closing my eyes. I wanted to make it look like an accident. I just can't take it anymore. I feel so sad all the time. I feel like I'm trapped and can't get free from this endless worry. Happiness (even when good things are happening) is impossible because my mind won't let me. 

I keep hoping that someone's message or reply or anything will release me, and there will be some cure, but that's not happening.... I don't know how much more I can take.
