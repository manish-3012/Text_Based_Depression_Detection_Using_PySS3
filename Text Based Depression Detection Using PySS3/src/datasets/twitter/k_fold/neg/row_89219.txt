I wish I could be temporarily dead to see if i want to go through with thisI just want to know how people would react if i died. How long would it take my family to get over it? Will my cats miss me? I could just ask people, but then they'd know im suicidal and also they could lie about it. I wish i could be dead for a year or so to see if it affects anybody i know. its hard to explain.
