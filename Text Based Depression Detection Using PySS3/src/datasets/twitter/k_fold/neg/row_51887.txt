I just need to vent, Iâ€™m not at riskIâ€™m not actually going to kill myself, it would hurt too many people around me. But it would solve all of my problems. No more job that I hate, that made me start self-harming, that makes me want to vomit at the thought of doing. No more disappointment from my family. No more feeling awful and empty every day. No more scrolling through article after article about how weâ€™re all fucked and no-one in power cares. How everyone is corrupt, and greedy, and selfish. Killing myself is the logical next step. Thereâ€™s no future, for any of us. If I donâ€™t kill myself now, climate change will get me soon enough. Iâ€™ll never get to raise kids with someone I love, because Iâ€™ll be raising them in a dystopian nightmare. Thereâ€™s no point to any of this. Humanity is cruel, and ugly, and harms itself over and over. Everyone I know is fucking depressed. No-oneâ€™s happy, ever. I canâ€™t go on like this, but I donâ€™t see any way out. The only exit is the final one, which Iâ€™m not taking. So where do I go from here?
