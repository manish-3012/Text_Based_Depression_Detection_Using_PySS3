I want to liveI really do. I just don't feel alive. I feel like every breath I take, every movement I make, I just move closer to death, and I can't stop it. I can't stop feeling like I'm already dead, since there's nothing I can do to stop moving towards death. 

I don't feel as if there's a purpose between the time of being alive and being dead. How do I fill this void? Do I just exist between the two periods, the one designated alive, and the one designated as death? If so, what's the best way to do this? I just don't feel a purpose. 

EDIT: for the first time since I can remember, I can feel my heart beating.
