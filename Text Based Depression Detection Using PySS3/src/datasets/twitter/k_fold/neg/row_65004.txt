I brought this to myself.Almost ALL of my friends cut off my relationship with them.And that's because I'm dating my friend's ex girlfriend and started going out less with them,even though I had his permission.He suddenly changed his mind.Nobody talks to me.Not at school,not anywhere.I don't know what to do anymore.
