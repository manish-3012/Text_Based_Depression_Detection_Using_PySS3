Iâ€™ve made peace with dying(my apologies if this is scattered, its been on my mind for awhile)well, i guess for some background information im 14 and i started my first year of highschool not too long ago.  needless to say, im ready to give up. ive pushed away everyone who cared. my grades are falling, and i no longer have it in me. for a very long time ive always had thoughts of suicide, but ive always been able to ignore them, but that isnâ€™t the case anymore. everytime i wake up, i hear a loud voice that constantly tells me to kill myself, everyone hates me, and i would be better off dead. and i guess when i really put things into perspective, that voice is right. i donâ€™t do much of anything now. my days are spent under blankets in complete isolation(unless my mom or my cat walks into my room) i dont feel anything. i dont draw like i used to. my sketchbooks and old paintings laugh at me. its almost ironic, art used to be a major escape for me during middle school, and now I canâ€™t do it anymore. im pretty much useless at this point. but dying would be so much better for me. if i died, I wouldnâ€™t have to suffer anymore. i could finally be happy. nothing is really stopping me from finally killing myself, I already have a set date, time, and method. im ready to die.
