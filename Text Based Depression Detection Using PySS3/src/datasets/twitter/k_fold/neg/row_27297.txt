i honestly feel so shitty. my psychiatrist moved to iowa and i canâ€™t find a new one. everyone is supposedly not accepting new patients. i still have my mood stabilizer and anxiety medication but i donâ€™t have my prosac. i feel like i really want to die. i canâ€™t stop thinking of suicide.i know that i wonâ€™t but i canâ€™t stop fixating on it. iâ€™ve been committed before and i was much worse. i feel hopeless. i know i have people who support me. i feel like i canâ€™t do anything and iâ€™ll never be independent and that iâ€™m not worth the effort of getting better.
