Kill me nowStumbling down the halls

Planting my fist in every wall

I'm so tired of it all

Hating myself, hating the world

Wanting to pour pleach down my own throat

Kill me now

I don't care how

Hang me up by me neck

It's not like anyone gives a heck



The blood loss won't kill me

Cuz I'm barely losing any

Help me die

I'm tired of crying

When the tears come out

I feel so pathetic

Please, just end it

Kill me now

I don't care how

Give me sleeping pills

Make me ill



Razor blade

Memories fade

Thankful for forgetting

Tired of remembering

Cheating, lying

Blaming anybody

Afraid of admitting

That it was all my fault

Make my heartbeat halt

Kill me now

I don't care how

Slit both my wrists

No one's gonna give a shit
