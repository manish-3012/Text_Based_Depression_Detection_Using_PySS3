I feel worthless and emptyIâ€™m 18, I start University in two weeks and two days ago I had a Suicide attempt, taking 1.2 grams of codine.
My mother visited me in hospital, we had an arguement and she told me that she didnâ€™t want me as her daughter anymore and that I was now homeless.
Iâ€™ve been staying at my boyfriends house for the past two days but thatâ€™s only an extremely temporary solution.

I want to use the last of my money to just get on a bus and go to the middle of nowhere and just stay there for a few days. I want to disappear... to just cease to exist.
Iâ€™m tired of being a disappointment. Tired of failing to kill myself... I just want out..
