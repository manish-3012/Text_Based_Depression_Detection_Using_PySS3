Feeling even more hopeless after talking to my parentsTried talking to my parents about my issues, nothing good turned out of it, and was just told to suck it up. i feel extremely hopeless and the idea of killing myself feels more pleasing day by day. I never though that i will ever think of it. I feel extremely alone and all i do is indulge in self escapism. I dont want to feel like this anymore, i feel like im slowly losing myself and my mind.
