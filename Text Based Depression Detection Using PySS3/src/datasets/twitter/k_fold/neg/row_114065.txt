Issues.With all my other issues. I now know I have body dysmorphic disorder.
 Just great.
 Much more and I am just going to push up the time frame. I don't know how.much more I can't hate myself.
I know my abusers put most of it in my head, but it was gone for 30+ years and NOW it decides to come back. Depression, fucks you everytime.
I need help. I talking to the wife tomorrow,  if she can help I know she will. 
But is it fair to lay all my bullshit on her? I mean I'm a mess and I know it, but I don't show it.  I keep it all inside. I don't know how she will handle me all fucked up. 

Fucking a.
