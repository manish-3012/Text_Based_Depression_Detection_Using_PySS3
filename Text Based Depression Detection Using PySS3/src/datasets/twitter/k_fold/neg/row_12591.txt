I need help, pleaseIdk what to do anymore, my girlfriend said she doesnâ€™t love me and hasnâ€™t for awhile and I donâ€™t make enough to live on my own with my daughter who I have full custody of and idk what to do. What happens to my daughter if I die? Even if I donâ€™t die itâ€™s going to be hard on my daughter not seeing my girlfriend (whoâ€™s not her mom btw) anymore. I donâ€™t know what else to say or what to do but Iâ€™m probably going to kill myself this week
