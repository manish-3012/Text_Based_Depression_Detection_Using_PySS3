[24F] â€œQUARTERâ€ LIFE CRISIS ??? Idk I just know, that I canâ€™t.HELLO, Iâ€™m guessing this is a subreddit where we get to share our deepest emotions &amp; weâ€™ll all look out for one another, right! Ok so here it goes.

So I really do believe Iâ€™m in some sort of crisis right now. With NO WHERE TO TURN, NO ESCAPE OUTLET. First of all, My 60 year old dad has a girlfriend that is my older sisterâ€™s age , 29. So thereâ€™s the first MINDFUCK, yeah how the fuck am I supposed to view my dad the way dadâ€™s are supposed to be viewed? It makes me sad sometimes but generally angry, but heâ€™s making these active choices &amp; saying â€œhave a nice lifeâ€ with his actions to the family he made with my mom. So heâ€™s still legally fucking married... and he asked me if I could help him file for divorce from my own mother. #1 DAD. But anyways, moving on. 

My mom ... EVERY FUCKING DAY WOULD TELL ME TO STOP WASTING MY TIME, GO TO SCHOOL , GO TO SCHOOL , GO TO SCHOOL. So I can pick up the pieces where my dad left us off at!!! Thatâ€™s all she wants mainly. MONEY. She also makes no sense. I got offered to train for a manager position at my current workplace , I told her about it and she CHUCKED IT OUT THE WINDOW so fast JUST BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL LOCATION OF WHERE I WOULD WORK. I said I could come home on weekends and she was like â€œyou wanna be on your own now?â€ WHEN THE FUCK CAN I BE ON MY OWN?????? DO I HAVE TO GET MARRIED???? 

MY SISTER IS A BITCH. Straight up using me and my mom so that her and her boyfriend can live together. Making my mom pay majority of the rent. My sister ALWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYS says sheâ€™s broke but goes out to buy ALCOHOL EVERYWEEKEND. So my mom and I live with her and her boyfriend, I fought my mom so hard for me to not move in. Like let me live somewhere else. But she fuckin wonâ€™t let me :) and I listen because I donâ€™t want to regret it later on in life when I miss her down the road. So thereâ€™s that. 

Iâ€™m paying rent with them but I sleep over my boyfriends house and my mom doesnâ€™t know but Iâ€™m her mind Iâ€™m at my friends house and APPARENTLY SHES FUCKIN FINE WITH THAT BUT NOT A WHOLE NOTHER CITY. 


SO CURRENTLY.
Iâ€™m with my boyfriend in his moms house mainly. His mom is a fucking hoarder. The whole bitchass HOUSE IS A FUCKING STORAGE!!!! 3 cars in the driveway that dont fucking work. 4 STORAGES IN THE BACKYARD OF THINGS SHES NOT GONNA NEED IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS. 
But, I got no say. So whatever. 


CHURCH.
I havenâ€™t gone to church in months.
Theyâ€™re a cliquey bunch . When I first got in , in 2018. This girl was all over me just because I sat across from her fucking crush ONE TIME , sheâ€™s gonna be passive aggressive when talking to me. Now sheâ€™s all goody two shoes cause they ended up getting engaged. DING DING, I never wanted your dude in the first place. 

They also say to be content being single but are HELLA EXTRA during social interactions , trying to get this guy to this girl. Trying to stop this guy from talking to this girl. &amp; I let them do it. I had a crush, and that same girl got started asking me about it cause she knew her friend likes him. He was messaging me, sitting at my table whenever there was a potluck. But it never was really straightforward and OMG Iâ€™ve got to add he made me really nervous because of how much I thought he was amazing, cute, just everything I ever wanted. Well when I stopped going to church... on my life , heâ€™s made multiple attempts to try to get me back to church... but MY EATING DISORDER wonâ€™t let me. &amp; so the girls friend and him well, they recently got married. 

It does hurt me. I donâ€™t know why . But it does, he was always in the back of my mind since I got to the church... I was soooo sure we would workout somehow but now. Yeah.

My boyfriend tends to me. He does everything I want him to. He addresses my concerns. HES SHORTER THAN ME BY THE WAY. BOOOOOOY does he need to GROW UP. He plays video games 24/7 and has a tax business that his mom gave him from his grandpa. (But his mom mainly does the clients) 
I would test him sometimes. I would open the door for him. He would walk through. Idk itâ€™s a long ass list.


&amp; YEAH I HAVE NO OUTLETS. I HEARD SOMEWHERE THATS WHY PEOPLE COMMIT SUICIDE BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER HAVE AN OUTLET TO EXPRESS THESE EMOTIONS. NOTHING TO FALL BACK ON. 
&amp; I FEEL LIKE IM ON THE VERGE THERE. 

So fuck this life , tnx for reading I guess.
