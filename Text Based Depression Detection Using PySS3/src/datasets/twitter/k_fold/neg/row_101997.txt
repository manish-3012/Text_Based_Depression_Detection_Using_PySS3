I think Iâ€™m going to shoot myself tomorrowAs it says in the title Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m going to kill myself.        

My life is a wreck my dad hits me and my brothers and he cusses us out constantly. My mom is to much of a bitch to do anything about it.Im 15 year old male sophomore who is on the varsity wrestling team.Everyday I try to go to at least 3 practices per day to get from my house and parents. The only things I like doing are video games and wrestling but now even those probably wonâ€™t work the way my life is going.i canâ€™t do anything about my dad because I live in Texas where it is legal to hit your kids. I struggle with un diagnosed depression.(I know many of you will say to get meds but Iâ€™m pretty for the air force itâ€™s a disqualification).the thing that was keeping me going so far was to make sure that my brothers didnâ€™t do it first.But today my dad put his hands on me.I donâ€™t think I can last the 3 years before i can move out.
