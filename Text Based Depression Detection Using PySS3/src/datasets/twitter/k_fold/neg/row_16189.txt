failed suicide attempt, depression getting worse.after the ordeal the other day with me trying to kill my self, life has gotten 100x harder. everyday i wish i actually did succeed.  each day is getting harder for me to be alive. everything feels like itâ€™s building up and is going to explode. i honestly donâ€™t know what to do at this point. i have appointments with doctors and councillors for the next few days and my medication is being increased. iâ€™m honestly getting to the point again where i donâ€™t see a point in living anymore. iâ€™m a burden on my family and if i was gone it would be easier for them.
