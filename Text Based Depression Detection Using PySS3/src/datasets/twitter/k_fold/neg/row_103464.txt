Just had an interesting conversation with someone and now Iâ€™m fucking lividWas talking to a girl about depression and how she doesnâ€™t understand it. She just tells meâ€why are you depressed just be happy, thereâ€™s so many good things in lifeâ€. This is coming from an extremely attractive girl with a good job, good friends and has never encountered bullying in her life....
Me on the other hand fucking flip everything I just described about this person and thatâ€™s me. 
â€œJUST. BE. HAPPYâ€
fuck off
