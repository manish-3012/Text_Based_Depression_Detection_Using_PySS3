Tired of people saying theyâ€™re â€œhere for meâ€Iâ€™m sick of hearing that at this point, where Iâ€™m obligated to kindly say â€œthank youâ€ and â€œIâ€™ll keep that in mindâ€ only to never contact them when those thoughts pop up.

At this point Iâ€™d rather never tell anyone when Iâ€™m having those thoughts, just so I can avoid statements like these where Iâ€™m forced to act nice and appreciate them for their pity statements.

Itâ€™s the same for the people I do turn to. My best friends, the typical â€œwhy didnâ€™t you tell me youâ€™re feeling this wayâ€ and â€œIâ€™m here for you anytimeâ€. Iâ€™m done with it.

Iâ€™m stupid. Iâ€™m a waste of space that shouldnâ€™t be here yet here I am. My family doesnâ€™t care less about me, my friends care too much to the point where I canâ€™t die without them doing the same. Iâ€™m never going to go far in my life, so although Iâ€™m young whats the point of me trying? Yet Iâ€™m still too afraid of death. Iâ€™m pathetic. Sorry for having you deal with/read this rant
