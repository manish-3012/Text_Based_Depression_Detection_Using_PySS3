I don't know anymoreI keep sabotaging my relationship. I keep hurting him. I keep making crucial mistakes. I don't even know how to keep holding on to myself right now.   I want to end it all. It's happened too many times. He has been hurt by me so many times and I'm so scared for him and for myself. I don't know how to hold on. I just want to end it. I feel like it would be sparing him, better for him right now. I feel like it'd more good than this constant pattern of me fucking up. I just want everything to be okay. I want him to be happy. So WHY? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME ANYMORE? I'm just a literal piece of shit but the worst part is that he feels like he is. I hate myself so much. I can't think. What if this is it? It's like I'm subconsciously wrecking everything, subconsciously making him feel bad, over and over and I can't even believe myself. I don't even know why the fuck Im fucking posting this fucking shit. What? For someone to tell me its going to be okay? For comfort? For fucking validation that I'm not a horrible person? For advice? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK ADVICE COULD HELP. apologise? Pathetic. Calm down? It's pathetic. Fucking pathetic. He's hurting so bad and I can't help because im the one that hurt him. How do I do this? And maybe that should be a rhetorical question because I should be able to handle this. I should be able to know what to do, what to say, how to move forward but I don't. Fucking whatever. Time to read self help articles and try to work on self awareness and say its different now just like FUCKING ALWAYS BUT IT MEANS NOTHING ANYMORE BECAUSE IVE BEEN A PIECE OF SHIT TOO MANY TIMES. I cant keep doing this. I don't want to live.
