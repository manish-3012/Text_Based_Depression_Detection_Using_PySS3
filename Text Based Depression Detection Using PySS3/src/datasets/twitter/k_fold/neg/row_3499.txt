Critical - Help for victims of emotional/mental abuse?Every day I fantasize about ending my own life. I feel the daily pain, the deep ache that never subsides and I ask when it will end. People always told me it would get better - that it gets better... But it never does... It never has and I've struggled with this torture for almost half of my life.

Big surprise - I am in a relationship that is mental and emotional torture. It is what's driving me the most to want to end it all, because we are trauma bound and there is no way out without feeling like I am tearing my skin off with it. I have no friends because this relationship has isolated me, I can't afford therapy, and I am from a broken home where no one in my family speaks or is close enough to me to trust to help.

I see help everywhere for rape/sexual abuse victims, people in dangerous situations - but where is the help for us in emotional and mental abuse situations? Am I doomed to this until I finally cut the life line and end it all?
