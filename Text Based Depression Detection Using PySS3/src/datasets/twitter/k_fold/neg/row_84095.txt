I know.I know this for fact. I know I'll be missed. I have a boyfriend, we're devoted to each other. I have several best friends. I have a huge network of good friends. Everyone fucking loves me. But I'm in college. I'm not doing well here. I'm either failing or on the edge of dying. This just means debt without any success to be able to pay it off. I don't want to live. I haven't wanted to since I was a freshman in high school, only now I might have the balls to do it.

I've given the key to my medicine drawer and my knife to my boyfriend who is currently at class so I won't do anything stupid. But I'll get the key back when he returns. I'm currently debating if I should drink glade air fresheners but I worry they won't do it.
