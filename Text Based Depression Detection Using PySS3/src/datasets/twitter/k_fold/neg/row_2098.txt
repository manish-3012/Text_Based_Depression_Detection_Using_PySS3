Any advice for someone feeling suicidal?My therapist recently left the practice I go to and it kind of sent me into a downward spiral. I've been feeling overwhelmed for the past couple of months and i think that kind of set me off, I've been extremely anxious and pretty suicidal lately so if you have any advice to send my way it'd be super appreciated.
