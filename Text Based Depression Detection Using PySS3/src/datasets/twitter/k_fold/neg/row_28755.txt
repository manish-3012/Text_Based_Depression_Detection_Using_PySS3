help...please?For all you TL;DR's out there, I don't think I'm gonna actually commit suicide, if you care.

Here's the deal- my father's dying.  He's been getting sicker for the past 4ish years, and now he's transitioning to hospice.  It could be days, weeks, I don't know.  My mother tries to keep me in the dark (I go to college on the other side of the country), which doesn't help me not worry (sorry for the double negative).  As of yesterday he's pale, confused, has a temp of 95F,  falling often, and refusing to go to the ER.  So I really have no idea how much longer it'll be, or if I should wait till Christmas to go home.

I have so many things I want to ask him, but now it's too late, because of his dementia.  I can't do anything but sit in my bed in cry all day.  It almost just hurts to live.  I want to go out and fuck some stranger, or get drunk at 10am, or shave my head, or cut myself...anything to let other people know how I feel.

Nobody at my college knows what I'm dealing with, except for one person, my BFF and roommate.  He's currently at his new girlfriend's place right now (midnight), and I don't really want to interrupt them (I'm a girl, and wouldn't blame her for resenting me).  The thing is, I don't know how I'm going to get through the next five minutes.  I've had way too much wine and Nyquil, can't sleep, and my roommates will be back soon so I can't even cry without them knowing.  My HS friends are on the East Coast, and we've grown apart, so I really don't have anyone to talk to.

It feels like my mind's in this endless loop, about how much of a failure I am, and how my life won't get better, and how I could just take 2 more Nyquil now, 2 more when I wake up in the morning, and have a full day's oblivion.  I'll see my friend tomorrow afternoon after his classes, and bawl my eyes out then, but I don't know how I'm going to make it till then.  It just seems like things shouldn't have to be this hard...
