ThanksI have everything but I'm unhappy in spite of that. lol

I am feeling ashamed for that. But I also feel bad for all the opportunities I have. I have to cry when I think about the suffering of this world, but I do not do it enough, I just think of myself.

I do not know what to do.

I'm a basically bad person, I've always been selfish. I am arrogant and live from the compassion of others. I want love!, I want to be carefree. But I only spread hate, sorrow and worry.

I do nothing to help my fellow human beings, be it parents, siblings or the many victims of my doings, the world or even here. It's not right that I can live that way while others are so suffering. And yet I can not distribute my options.

I do not know what to do, I'll write a new farewell letter and take it this time, think it to the end.

Thank you for listening to me in my last selfish act, you are the best, I do not know you long but you have been a great joy. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I could not help anyone, that I've hurt so many, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. But what good is it to apologize here? I can not even do it in real life.

Please don't waste your time, help the others here, I just crawl for the attention.
