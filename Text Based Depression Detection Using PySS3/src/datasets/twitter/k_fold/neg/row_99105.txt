In the pitIâ€™m too old for this shit. I should have beaten this by now. I should be able to appreciate my life. I have the most beautiful babies in the world and I still dont want to be here. Which makes me feel even worse because what sort of selfish piece of shit feels like that? Driving around thinking how easy it would be to just put the foot down and aim for a tree. But then what? I just condemn my babies to a life of thinking they werenâ€™t enough to keep me around? Iâ€™m tired. Tired of being broken. Tired of fighting my own goddamn brain and thoughts. I just want to not wake up.
