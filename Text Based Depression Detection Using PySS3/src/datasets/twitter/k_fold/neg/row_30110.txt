Why won't it endI can't bring myself to do it, I just want to never wake up. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I don't want to do anything. I've been a miserable failure to everyone who knows me. I can't even keep my temper under control. Every time I snap I bawl my eyes out right after, I've been living in a roller coaster of emotions and it's just so draining. Nothing seems to be working, and nothing is important. Nothing I do or don't do will be important in the next 100 years, not even the next 10. We're just a small speck and I'm just a smaller dust particle in the grand scheme of things. I'm painfully below average and shitty at everything I try to do and idk I'm sick of it. I try to be better and it never works. I'm sick of being told I won't amount to anything, I know I won't, but there's no need to rub it in my face...

I'm sorry for the short ramble I just needed to say something.
