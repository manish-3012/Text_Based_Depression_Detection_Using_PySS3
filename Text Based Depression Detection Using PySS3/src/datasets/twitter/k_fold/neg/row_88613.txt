I need to get some helpI've had depression for a really long time already and suicide thoughts for a little less, i didn't notice it at first and brushed them off since i was sure i would never do it. 

I used to think about death constantly since i was a child and was really scared of it, im not scared anymore, i always think about that and seems more welcome than before.

Lately i've been thinking so much more about that, i have even planned my own death on multiple times. Today was different, my parents are thinking of getting a divorce after almost 40 years, it was a really bad day at a work that i feel stuck and i don't even think i should get out, it wouldn't even matter if im not here anymore.

Im thinking about my parents, my aunt died lately and my dad (he also has depression) got to a really bad place, i don't want to be the reason for him to get worse, but i don't know if i can make it.
I think about my mom and what would she think i did it, would she blame herself? I think about my dogs and what would they think happened to me? I do feel selfish about it, taking my pain away and passing it on to the people i love.

Those feelings stop me every time, but it's getting worse and im afraid someday that won't stop me anymore.

I used to brush away those dark thoughts as something normal, but now i realize it's serious and i can't keep brushing them away anymore.

I need some help...
