The only thing keeping me from ending it is knowing that I would fuck up my family's livesEvery day I wake up and go to work and then make myself some hope that there may be happiness for me in the future just to come home and get overwhelmed by the feeling of hating myself and wanting to die. The past months I've been trying to get out of this. I've worked my ass off and did things to make me feel good about myself (eating healthy, working out, socializing again, working towards goals) just to fall in even bigger of a hole. I wish I could give y'all an inside of my mind so you could see the mental barriers I have that keep me from opening up to anyone. I'm a burden in most people's lives. I don't even answer texts of my loved ones anymore. I feel awful about myself and hate that I have to be the way I am. I fucked my entire life and knowing that i have to do this for maybe 60 more years just hurts so much. My life only causes pain but I know that my death would cause even more pain. I've just written a suicide note because I know I can't deal with it much longer. I don't need help I just wanted to get it out and not feel alone for once in my life. Thanks for reading this mess &lt;3 (I'm 19 y.o. btw)
