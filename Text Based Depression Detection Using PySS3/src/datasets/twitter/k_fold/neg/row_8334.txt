Iâ€™m tiredIâ€™m tired of life. Iâ€™ve been beating down more times than I can count by people who I thought loved me, I feel like a shell of someone I once was. Sometimes when I look in a mirror I donâ€™t even recognize myself anymore. I wonder if I were to die now would there be someone to mourn me? To remember who I was? I doubt that my family doesnâ€™t care about me and whatever friends Iâ€™ve picked up over the years have moved on and forgotten me. And any new ones Iâ€™ve just pushed away, If I were to die now who would come to my Funeral? My mother? My father? Any relatives? No I would just be another statistic for the world to scoff at. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m already dead and I just havenâ€™t realized it yet. Iâ€™m just tired I just want some peace is that so hard to ask?
