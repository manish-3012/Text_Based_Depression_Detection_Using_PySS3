I went to a mental hospital for my birthday- and I'm already ready to die again.I have this gun. It's fully loaded- ready and waiting for me to finally tire and finally pull the trigger. I can't try to live for anyone else anymore, I can't even live for myself. I keep trying to better myself &amp; remain optimistic but I've always been a cast aside/defective human. It won't be long until I'm forgotten.
