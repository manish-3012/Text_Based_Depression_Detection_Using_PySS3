THIS IS kind of stupid but has haunted me for 4 months but i dont want to give in hurt myself ALL MY FRIENDS OUT THERE I IRECENTLY WATCHED AN ANIME ABOUT A GUY SACRIFICING HIS SON TO DEMONS FOR PROSPERING HIS KINGDOM THEN I SEARCHED IT ON THE INTERNET AND GOT TO READ A VERY DISTURBING THING ON WIKIPEDIA ABOUT A CHRISTIAN FOLKLORE ABOUT HOW DEMONS OPERATE. I AM SCARED AS IT SAID THAT THESE KIND OF THINGS RESULT IN DEATH ETC. I AM NOT CHRISTIAN AND NEITHER HAVE I EVER USED ANY SUCH PROCEDURES AND I ONLY JUST READ ABOUT IT AND I SWEAR NOTHING ELSE AND THIS THOUGHT OF SOMETHING HAPPENING TO ME HAS LINGERED ON FOR 4 MONTHS AND I AM NOT EXACTLY A ATHEIST BUT I DO LACK FAITH AND THIS IS KIND OF GIVING ME STUPID THOUGHTS LIKE LOOSING CONTROL OF MY BODY AND INDULGING IN SELF HURT ETC. I CAN CERTAINLY SAY THAT I HAVE STAYED AWAY FROM SUCH THINGS ALL MY LIFE PLEASE HELP ME GET OVER THIS FEAR AS IN OUR COUNTRY THERE IS NO MENTAL HEALTH HELP AND I SHARED THIS WITH MY PARENTS AND READ THINGS ABOUT THIS BEING FAKE BUT I STILL CANT GET OVER THIS FEAR AND I THINK YOU GUYS ARE MORE WELL ACQUATINED WITH CHRISTIANITY PLEASE HELP AND TELL ME WETHER THESE THOUGHTS ARE HARMLESS OR I NEED TO SEE SOMEONE. I JOINED REDDIT FOR HELP PLEASE HELP NO ONE HAS HELPED ME I DONT WANT TO SUCCUMB TO SUCH THOUGHTS. ONCE I THOUGHT  THIS MIGHT HURT SOMEONE AND I TRIED TO HURT MYSELF BUT THEN I REALISED  THAT I DONT WANT THESE THINGS AND I WANT TO BE FREE OF SUCH THOUGHTS. I WAS TOO SCARED OF TELLING ANYONE BECAUSE CHRISTIANITY IS NOT OUR RELIGION SO NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO THIS MIGHT HAUNT THEM TOO
