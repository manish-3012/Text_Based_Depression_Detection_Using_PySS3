I don't want helpThe thing is, deep down, I don't want to change. I don't want to let go. Sure, I wish my life would get better. Sure I wish everybody would love me, but nothing will change because I will hold onto these thoughts and feelings forever.

Suicidal ideation is my crutch. Mental health and alcoholism are my diseases. Actually, I have a spiritual disease. And I've done all I can. But I'll keep it with me forever and I've accepted that. 

Sometimes when I'm on vacation, or doing something really fun and I ask myself: Hey man this is great, do you still wanna die? I always answer yes. I know it won't ever change. But I've accepted it.
