I wish 'reaching out' was as easy as people say it is.Because it's not, I don't want to put a burden on my friends, I don't want to force them to take care of me, struggle to think of what to say to make me feel better. I've pushed all of my friends away so I can't just randomly message them "hi I'm really suicidal" so I continue to write suicide notes every night and cry myself to sleep listening to Frank Ocean just to repeat the next day.
