Going down a slippery slopeIâ€™ve been depressed for a decade now. I keep trying it make progress - baby steps, get on meds, seek therapy, go out and meet people but I keep ending up in the same place. Except each time I get a step further. I now have a plan and the equipment. 
Iâ€™m getting closer and I think this time around Iâ€™ll do it. Iâ€™ve just had enough of this â€œit gets betterâ€. Iâ€™ve tried and tried and tried. I donâ€™t have a single person to call at this time of need. I donâ€™t have a single person who would come by to give me a hug. Honestly I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still bothering.
