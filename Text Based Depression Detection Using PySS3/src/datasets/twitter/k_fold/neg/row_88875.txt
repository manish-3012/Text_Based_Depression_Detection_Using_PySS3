Why does there only seem to be sites and search results of people trying to prevent people from suicide?I'm 37 and have been battling with mental illness and wanting my life to be over for more than half of it.  Why is suicide such a frowned upon, terrible thing?  Why is it not possible to be viewed as a real reprieve, and relief?  For the last few weeks I've been searching for Dr Kevorkian like people, but it seems impossible to find anyone that supports it.  Why is assisted suicide so frowned upon?  Is it really that impossible that it is the preferable path for someone?
