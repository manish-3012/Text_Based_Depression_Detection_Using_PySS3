I miss her so much...The only person I've ever loved is gone now, before her I wasn't happy but I did not intend to kill myself.

But now that I know true happiness I want to end it.
She was my happiness and the only thing I lived for, she now hates me and doesn't want to talk to me. I hate myself.

I hate being alone, no one that cares about me, no one there to listen. I hate it.
