I'm about to be deadFirst of all hello to everyone.
I'm a 20s something guy and I think in a few days I'm about to commit suicide. I have already read so many posts here about people committing suicide and nevertheless the scenario behind, even the shittiest, there are always some guys with such a bright view of life they think they can change everyone's mind and life. But I'm not that optimistic with my case. My life is already in such a bad shape (25% not my fault the rest I can say are totally my fault) that I cannot tollerate it anymore. I'm gonna write down why I'm about to kill me. Maybe this weekend or Monday. Whatever. Here they are. The reasons I'm depressed and suicidal:
First let's talk about genetics. Small penis cause of an half expressed klinefelter syndrome. People think I'm normal because it's not totally expressed and when I'm dressed yes I think I look kind of normal to strangers but besides my small little penis I also have round hips like girls, man boobs lack of body hair and a little beard that looks like pubes. But yeah. In this all I guess the part that frustrated and frustrates me more was the fact that I was a reason to class gags after taking shower in the locker room. Ok. Maybe having a penis smaller that boys 6 or 7 years younger when you are like 17/18 years old is a thing to make fun off. Of course the fact that I'm probably infertile is always a bad thing. It and my small penis had always compromised my relationships with girls. Never had a girlfriend and still a virgin. And I had opportunities to not write those two things. But the fear of being a reason for a girl to make fun off (the penis thing...) and you know how girls are. They share things with their friends and I don't like the fact that my little secret (literally) could be more exposed. And imagine I got a girl that besides my small penis she still loved me. How could I stay up to her when not being able to give her a child. That's why I avoid to further any relationship with girls. And I'm not gay believe me. I'm totally straight and It hurts sometimes seeing girls you had as friends now with boyfriends and stuff. Bah. All that because of genetics. That's the 25% i think are not my fault. Maybe the percentage is higher maybe is lower. Who cares. 
Now is the part that it's my fault. Yeah. I totally fucked it up. I was kind of a great student. Until university. Alcohol was not a good idea and I lost an year because of it. Didnt told my parents because I was with fear of their reaction. My father is kind of really rigorous and he gets really mean when something bad that lets him down happens. I was not prepared to the upcoming events. Lied to them. Then a normal year passed by. Managed to told the lie to almost everyone. They thought I finished 2 years of my degree but I was still on the first one. I managed to stay away from alcohol and let the hospital visits because of alcoholism behind. Then when I was on my third year at university, technically the 2nd of my degree, I got into betting. I turned out as a compulsive gambler. Lost my money, and the others too. From my family. The amount it's way too big and I'm shocked today to see the state I got in. Lost another year. Now my parents think I got my degree but I only finished with success 2 semesters when they should be six. Everyone in my circle of family and friends think I got that degree under my arms. Only my class at the uni and the teachers know the real story. Now my parents want me to continue the studies but I'm not even done with those 4 semesters. And I don't want to continue at the uni. I'm not happy there. The areas I see myself earning my life and being happy at the same time are areas that I know for sure are not of the like of my father. And I know if I get to told him all this he would never look at me with the same eyes. I'm gonna be such a waste of time and money to him that being his son is gonna be the only thing to link us two. And my mom are gonna cry so fucking much. God. Now I know why lying is so bad rated. My life is in such a big mess right now... Besides the problems I already had!
I know my friends are never gonna understand why I committed suicide but I'm not ready to face the lie I created. The snowball effect got way too big. Like 2 years big. And the small penis thing is an add-on to the list because I got into alcohol because I was depressed with it. I still don't know how many days I'm gonna wait to kill myself but I cannot prolong it to many days because it would create a clash with my parents because of my academic life that should be running on and my lie would be unmasked. I would rather die and throw away my pathetic life and body and bury my problems with me that see the disappointment in my parents eyes.
