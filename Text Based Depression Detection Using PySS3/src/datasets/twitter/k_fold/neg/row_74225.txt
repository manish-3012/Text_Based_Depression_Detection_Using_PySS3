Tonight I tried to kill myself for the first time.As you can probably tell from my username, I'm 13 and I tried to kill myself about 15 minutes ago. I took a strong cord and wrapped it around my neck and just pulled really hard.

I made a post a while back and I got a few responses. I tried doing what people suggested but nothing worked. Nothing was helping me.

I don't know what to do with this flood of emotions, I hate myself and I'm very angry but I'm also terribly sad... I leave for two weeks tomorrow at 6:00 AM and it's 1:30 AM right now.

I guess I'm just asking for new advice? I dunno... I just need help and I don't know what to do.
