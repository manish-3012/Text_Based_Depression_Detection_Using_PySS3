I donâ€™t know what to do anymore...I have been at the point of suicide many times before. One time being saved by my sister by taking the knife out of my hand. Havenâ€™t truly been happy for as long as I can remember. Whenever happy comes up itâ€™s very short and is always overshadowed by the same darkness that is with me everyday of my life. I have friends that will probably support me if I asked them to, but I hate having people worried about me. I am getting ready for college, and working, and doing all these extra curricular activities on top of school work and things at home arenâ€™t helping and itâ€™s becoming too much. Sometimes it feels like the world just hates me I donâ€™t know what to do.. suicide has always been an option for me but i have family I love and friends that I love and care about.
