I have nothing left to live forI am very young to be having these thoughts but they plagued mr for far to long. My life is not like anybody else my age, Iâ€™m nothing like the people around me, Iâ€™m dirt poor, like poverty level poor, Iâ€™m lonely as shit, all my â€œfriendsâ€ are moving away from me sometimes when Iâ€™m with people itâ€™s like I donâ€™t exist, like Iâ€™m just a nobody. Also Iâ€™m inexplicably ugly, very, very ugly. Itâ€™s not fair Iâ€™m a good person with a good personality and Iâ€™m intelligent, but all of that is immediately put down because of my looks, I have no idea why Iâ€™m so ugly my parents are good looking people and get complicated all the time and then they go around and say I look like them, and then people tell me Iâ€™m the most disgusting looking person in the world. Every one my age are growing and moving on and getting relationships, but of course nobody will ever like nobody.....my death would not effect anything. I was dealt a bad hand in life and thatâ€™s why I lost all my will to live....I am the only person in my group of people who have never been in a relationship no joke, if nothing changes soon I will end it all
