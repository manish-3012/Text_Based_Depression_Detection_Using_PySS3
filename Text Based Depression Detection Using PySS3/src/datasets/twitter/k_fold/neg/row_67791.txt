Good Job. No debt. Masters Degree. I want to hang myself this week.I am a 27 year old single male. I have a good job in the software industry. I make significantly more money per year than the median household income in my area. I have no debt, and a master's degree in Electrical Engineering.

Despite all this, I want to end my life. I want to hang myself this week.

Why? I am bald, short, and I have a small penis. I haven't had sex in over two years. I caught my last girlfriend cheating on me over two years ago and I still havent gotten over it. Over these past two years I have gained a lot of weight. I think my BMI is 35+, which would put me in the morbidly obese category. I know the weight gain can be fixed, but the baldness, shortness, and small penis cannot. Why should I continue to make any effort to live my life if I will never find love again? If the girl will just cheat on me again?

I have recently been given a lot more responsibility at work. This requires me to gain a lot of new knowledge and coordinate activities to make rapid progress on a critical project. However, instead of spending my nights and weekends gaining this knowledge, which appears to be absolutely criticial, I am filling all of my watching Twitch and YouTube, often until 2:30am. Literally 80% or more of my waking hours this holiday weekend have been spent lying down watching Twitch or YouTube on my phone.

I don't see the point in making any effort with this project if I can never be happy again. Why should I pour myself into my work if there is no payoff (even in the distant future)? I am still going to be a short, bald man will a small penis (also probably fat). 

I don't want to see this scenario play out. In which this project fails and I am fired and my reputation is ruined. I am simply not interested in life anymore. So, I want to hang myself this week.
