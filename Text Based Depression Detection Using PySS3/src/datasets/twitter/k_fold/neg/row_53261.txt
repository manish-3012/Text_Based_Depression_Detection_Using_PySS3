â€œOhhh but wHaT aBouT yOur fAmiLy? tHeyâ€™LL bE sO saD!!!!â€Like fucking hell I care about my family but I every time I hear someone say that to me I literally want to just slit my wrists right then and there. Like I know!! Stop telling me how selfish and horrible I am because I know!! I fucking know so shut up!! Please!! 

I also feel like Iâ€™m only a burden on everyone and in the end everyone else will be better off without me anyways. Like if Iâ€™m thinking of other people then I still think of suicide. If theyâ€™re sad when I die, then Iâ€™m really fucking sorry but can someone just be happy for me for once because at least Iâ€™m gone and everyone elseâ€™s lives will improve without me dragging them down. 

I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going but I just hate it when someone says that to me. It just makes me feel even more selfish and guilty and doesnâ€™t take away from the fact that Iâ€™d still like to hang myself
