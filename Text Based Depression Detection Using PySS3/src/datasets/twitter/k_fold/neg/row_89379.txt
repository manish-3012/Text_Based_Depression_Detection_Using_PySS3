Itâ€™s been about a year and a half (?) since I last tried to kill myself...Long story short, Iâ€™ve been severely suicidal since I graduated college in 2014. Even before that, if Iâ€™m being honest. I was constantly in and out of inpatient for about 3-4 years. My most recent attempt landed me in the ICU for about three days with â€œseizure likeâ€ brain activity and a breathing tube shoved down my throat. One of the worse experiences of my life. It really sucks that Iâ€™m feeling suicidal again, because I really donâ€™t want to put my family or myself through something like that again. I thought I was past this bullshit.
