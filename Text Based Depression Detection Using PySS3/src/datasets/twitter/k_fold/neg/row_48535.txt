My partner is harming themselves.So i have know my partner for a while now almost two years and I have been told that they have contemplated suicide before but never acted upon it. Though they did say that they donâ€™t want to right now, they donâ€™t hope to hit 25 . As in they donâ€™t want to do it right now but later.  There is something going on in that persons life that I do not know about. Me and this person have been together for nearly two years and is struggling to tell me. They keep saying â€œthey are fineâ€ and that they are â€œokayâ€ when they are not. This person will not tell me why no matter how much I ask. I am super worried and i donâ€™t know what to do i feel like this can lead to suicide and such and iâ€™m so scared i donâ€™t want to lose this person this person deserves everything in the world and i appreciate them. What can I do in this situation i feel annoying. I am super worried and scared please.
