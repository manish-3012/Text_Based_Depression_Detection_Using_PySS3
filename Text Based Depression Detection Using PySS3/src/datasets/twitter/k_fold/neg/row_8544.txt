The person I'd thought I'd be isn't going to happenI have spent my entire life building up around this image of what I wanted to be. I'd join the army, I'd become the first woman to pass special ops training. If that didn't happen then at least I'd be serving my country like I always wanted. When I started getting pain while exercising I changed my plans. Police force would be my goal. After several years I'd work toward becoming a detective and help the local community. Pain got worse.

I can now barely walk. People used to describe me as street fighter tough. Haven't been able to walk in the last couple months and I'm in pain most of the time. The kicker is that, after physical therapy and mri's, no one can figure out what's wrong. Am I purposefully sabotaging this woman I wanted to be in my head? I never wanted to be a mother or a caretaker. I wanted to be a guardian and it's fading. Everyone always tells me that, "you're so smart, you can accomplish anything." Well I'm piss drunk and realizing I don't want to do anything, I wanted to do what I wanted.

I spent my life building myself around this image, my major was planned around this image, everything I am is in this image. What's the point if it can't be achieved? There is literally nothing of me beyond it, this is all I am and it's very likely that's it's gone. I'm a burden on my family at this point and I'm weak. I can't see myself working a 8 hour office job. I wanted adventure and risk. I'm getting none of that.
