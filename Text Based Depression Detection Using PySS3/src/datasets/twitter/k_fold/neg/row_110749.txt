Today is a moment of truthI have my drugs and alcohol.  Last time I took half this dosage without alcohol and I got sick and my organs began throbbing.  I was in a stooper, and then catatonic, then out of it.

Today Iâ€™m going to the woods with my headphone, doubling the dosage and no one will find me until itâ€™s too late.  

To my students, make good decisions.  Be careful with your heart.

To my family and loved one, good luck in your endeavors.  My heart cannot take anymore.  Itâ€™s not your fault, Iâ€™m sorry.
