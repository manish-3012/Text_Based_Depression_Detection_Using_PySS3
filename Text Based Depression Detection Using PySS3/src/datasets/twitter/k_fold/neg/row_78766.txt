The physical pain has now overridden my emotional pain so at least now my reasons for wanting to kill myself are more valid.Depression + loss of job = Bad hygiene + No insurance

Bad hygiene + No Insurance = Rotting, painful teeth + No way of getting it fixed

I canâ€™t live with this pain anymore and I have no money to make the pain go away. Thousands of dollars of student loan debt with nothing to show for it. It hurts so fucking bad and I canâ€™t stop crying. I have to make it stop.
