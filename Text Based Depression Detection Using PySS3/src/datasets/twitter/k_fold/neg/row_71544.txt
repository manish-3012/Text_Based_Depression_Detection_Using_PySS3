I just donâ€™t knowI donâ€™t even feel like I belong here. Iâ€™m in a constant balance between slightly numb and daydreaming about suicide. Iâ€™ve done everything i fucking can to feel something over the past few months. Iâ€™ve cut myself so many fucking times, and i finally stopped a few weeks ago when it bled so much i thought i hit a vein. Although, sometimes i wish i I had. I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with all of the fucking noise around me, all of this bullshit. There are so many ideas, so many people who think they know it all, and i just canmt tune it out anymore. I feel like everything is coming to an end. 
Im only 16. I shouldnâ€™t have to fucking go through this. That sounds so selfish, but i feel it. I wish i didnt have to be aware of everything falling apart around me. I wish i didnâ€™t have people my age shaming me for not putting my all into acting against the bullshit thatâ€™s going on. Iâ€™m just so tired, and nothings getting better. Im drunk out of my mind right now, and im trying to make thingS coherent, so forgive me for this. Fuck, this is pointless. I want to drink until i canâ€™t move.
