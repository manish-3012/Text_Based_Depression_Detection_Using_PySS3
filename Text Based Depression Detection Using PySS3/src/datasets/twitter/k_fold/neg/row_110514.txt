25 Years of SuicideMy suicidal ideation started at 9 due to trauma. That was also the first time I self harmed and drew blood. I continued to be traumatized through various unfortunate events and environmental conditions periodically throughout my life. I have struggled not to kill myself for 25 years now. My dad and aunt both killed themselves and my brother and myself have both attempted suicide. Extended family- My momâ€™s aunt, cousin, and uncle all killed themselves.

Everyday it is a struggle to wake up.

I have no friends, no close family aside from a complicated relationship with my NPD mother who I hear from occasionally, and rarely have had any close connections.

Even if I do meet someone nice Iâ€™m so frightened for them to know and reject me I try to keep them at arms length. Because Iâ€™ve come to learn my background makes it hard for others to relate to me. 

I was in various friendships and relationships throughout the years and the moment they knew about my past, or my trauma, or hospitalizations, or therapy, or family history, it was like I was no longer a person. I wasnâ€™t an equal. I was an alien, some foreign creature they no longer recognized. 

They immediately would act differently. And any natural emotion I had was no longer respected as valid.

Following a change in reception, I would either be undermined and infantilized, openly pitied, or ignored.

No matter how compromising, or understanding, or quiet I became just to have any interaction with others, even if I was treated subhuman, it changed nothing for me positively.

Over time I just forgot how to even try to have a relationship with others at all. I forgot how to talk. I became very shy and reclusive.

I learned through countless rejections that if people knew my whole story, Iâ€™d be ghosted or excluded. No one likes to feel pity or uncomfortable feelings, and no one can relate, I get it.

But I get so tired of being a Martian.

Itâ€™s so lonely.

Iâ€™m naturally a fun, joking, light hearted person. Like literally thatâ€™s how people describe me â€œ Fun!â€

But the moment people ask, and I open up, things change.

Iâ€™ve been excluded as long as I can remember.

I miss my dad and my aunt especially.

They never excluded me. They were both very loving people.

My father and I were very close. He was my best and often only friend.

I know eventually Iâ€™m going to kill myself because I donâ€™t know how many more years I can continue to live like this.

Are some people so devalued by the stigma of trauma that they no longer have a worth in society?

It may not be now in this instant. But I know at some point, maybe soon,  Iâ€™ll break again, and I wonâ€™t be able to hold back from the hopelessness. At 25 years, I donâ€™t think anyone could argue I didnâ€™t try my best.
