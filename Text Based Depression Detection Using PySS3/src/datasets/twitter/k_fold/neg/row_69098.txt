I want to die but I'm too scared to do it myselfI really wish something would just fall on my head or I get struck by lightning I really do. I have shallow cut marks across my arms so I'm too afraid to come out of my room in case anyone sees. I've been depressed for three years and I've had an anxiety disorder all my life that's only gotten worse.

I just want to end all the pain and shit. I don't really have all that much to live for and I'm a selfish asshole so I want this more than anything else. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. There's a hell of a lotmore pain than happiness in the world so why not, right ? The chances are I'll just encounter more pain as I go along in life.  


So many people are assholes. So many people make me lose faith in humanity every fucking day. My mother just told me that she didn't raise me right and that she tried to raise me to be "a man" but she failed whatever the fuck that means. She also made fun of me for being terrified to go back to school because I'd do anything not to go back. She's been making clean up the garden and do all this physical work and shit because I don't exercise enough and that I'm going to turn into a fat fuck.

I don't know whether or not to believe her. On one hand she's kind've right but on the other I know I've grown up with abysmal self esteem so I don't know if she's just angry or not.


I hope I develop the balls to end it now. Wish me luck.
