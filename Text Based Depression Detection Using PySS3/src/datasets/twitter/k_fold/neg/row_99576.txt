BPD, now, maybe...New doctor, new "potential diagnosis but we're not there yet"

Keep asking wife to try and work on certain behaviors while I work on mine, I'm not seeing the effort from her (she obviously has to put up with so much and does so much for me, besides)

But I feel like she's been devaluing me over the years, especially now that she has established a career and there's a new dynamic in our relationship

She's a good person, and so are my friends who are visiting from far away, so why do I want to go buy the gun right now, before I have to get them from the airport?

I'm using again to try and dull it

Anyone have a similar experience? Have you gotten better?
