GuiltI have no reason to feel this way. But I'm letting the smallest thing get me down. I've added to my note today. It's all taking shape a little too easy recently. I keep making changes for the better in my life but then disregard that at a moment's notice. Like. Where has this come from. Maybe because I shut myself off from people. Cut anyone out that could have cared just so I could tell myself nobody cares. 

Talking doesn't seem to help. And I'm scared of being too honest and open because I don't want to upset anyone. 

Maybe this is all attention seeking and I've just come here to vent a little. I'm not expecting much to change anymore.

Reading people's positive stories and ways there lives have turned around is quite nice. But I just can't see it for myself
