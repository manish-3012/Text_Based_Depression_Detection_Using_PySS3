Would you kill yourself if you could never get anything good going in life, if you felt your mind worsening year after year?I'm 30 years old. My bipolar manic depression has never gotten better. I've abused marijuana for 16 years now heavily, and my cognitive ability feels very limited. I have no real friends, no women are interested in me, I have nothing. I'll be in my 30's renting bedrooms. It took me until last year to finish a bachelors (information technology), yet since then I've failed each certification I've tried to take, and I can't seem to remember or focus on anything anymore. I can't study and remember any information. My mind is gone.

I always thought getting my degree would change my life, but since graduating I can't seem to land a job anywhere. Everyone wants certifications, and I'm too fucking idiotic to get any. My brain and memory.. my cognitive abilities entirely.. gone. My friends and family.. gone.
  
I can't land a decent job paying remotely decent money. Currently I'm a loner with a past of mental/physical abuse, barely coping, smoking because I have nothing else, living out of strangers bedrooms.
  
I tried hanging myself with an old cable last year and I woke up after it broke. I'm thinking about throwing everything away. I'm thinking about using a stronger cord. I can't see myself living this type of life for another 30-40 years. 
  
Alone. Not smart enough to get certifications. Stuck inside my head. No one to turn to. No family. Barely scraping by living in strangers homes.
  
I'm ready to die. Its funny because I'm scared of the existential, scared of the afterlife, whatever that is. But I feel like I'm running out of options. All I have is debt and I can't afford to have a decent life. I'm no longer smart enough or capable enough to forge a way.
  
I guess this is my cry for help.
