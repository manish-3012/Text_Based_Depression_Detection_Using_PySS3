I want to run awayI can't go through this vicious cycle of binging/purging/starving anymore along with the fact that I have no reason to live as my mum has completely given up on me. I have nobody to talk to and I can't deal with the constant thoughts about self harm, pity and killing myself anymore. I plan on running away and possibly kill myself wherever I end up at. I am in so much pain mentally and 5 years has been enough. I guess I am not going to make it to 18 years after all.
