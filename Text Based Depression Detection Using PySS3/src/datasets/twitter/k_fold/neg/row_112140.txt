How do I find a reason to liveI had gotten my girlfriend pregnant 18 weeks ago, completely taking both of us by surprise. We are only 20, so we had to get our lives together very quickly. I stopped smoking weed and drinking and got a job roofing. I make good enough money to get us what we needed until we both finished school. I had gotten a credit card because I had no credit and needed to apply for loans. I got pre-approved for $100k from the bank, and we were looking at houses. I started saving and we started buying baby things; diapers, crib, stroller etc. We both had our wedding rings and were planning a date. Everything was going smoothly. I couldn't wait to marry my girlfriend of 2 years and raise a baby with her and grow old. 


A week ago tomorrow, my fiancÃ© had a miscarriage. We were both devastated. I tried to comfort her as much as I could, but she isolated me. She won't talk to me unless she needs to get something of hers from me. She is hateful and insults me whenever we are together, and hates coming into contact with me. Every time I text her asking how she is or telling her I hope she's doing well, I don't get a response. I miss her so much. 

Every time I think about our baby I lose myself. I go into the deepest slump of depression I have ever felt. Every time I see a baby or child I go to it. I think about holding it and watching it crawl and hearing it laugh. I think about its first word and what school it would go to and its friends and the things it would like. It's so hard to get my mind off of it. 

Everyday after 12 hours of roofing I drive around and smoke nearly a whole pack of cigarettes. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I can't find joy in anything. Life seems hopeless and dark. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so alone.
