School work + depression = suicidal gingerAt my school we have to do senior speeches in order to graduate. This year, since it isnâ€™t in person, the school decided that having just over 3 days to write, memorize, and record a speech is fair. Granted, we were assigned an essay that we were able to turn into a speech but the whole thing is very stressful. In the chaos of writing, printing, and attempting to memorize my speech I forgot my math assignment I have all Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s in all my classes except math where I have a D and my teacher gives 100s or 0s for homework grades. Tonight it was just too much.

Iâ€™ve quit therapy because online it doesnâ€™t do much for me (partially because of my awful internet) and my depression is getting so much worse. I canâ€™t keep living like this. I donâ€™t know if I will. I just want the endless work and my pain to stop. Iâ€™m always so sad and thinking about ending it all and I always have school work to do afterwards. Itâ€™s not even much, Iâ€™m just so useless that the work crippled me. Iâ€™m so done with life.

Sorry for the long read, just needed to get it out there.
