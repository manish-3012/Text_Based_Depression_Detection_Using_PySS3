I think I'm Trans and I want to dieI can't even leave my house anymore. It's so hard to function. I'm daydreaming about jumping off a bridge and playing it all the way through in my mind. I also have addiction issues and am sober, but I don't even want to drink or use. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. That would be so nice. I just wish I was a passable woman without needing to go on HRT and possibly surgery. My partner is dealing with me telling her I think I'm trans very hard and I just don't know if I can bare to live much longer. I'm too scared to call a hotline so I posted here.
