This is it.After dinner, Im heading into the woods. I have a rope ready, it will be very dark so no one will notice.   It should be nice and quick. I guess this is the end. If I don't commit, ill die anyway but why wait that long? Why wait till I'm old, weak, ugly and disabled. Why go through all those years of pain for nothing.
