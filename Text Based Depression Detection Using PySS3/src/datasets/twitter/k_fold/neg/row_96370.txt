The end is near. I can feel it. I canâ€™t handle the pain anymore. Iâ€™m trapped.I have been cursed in this life and I want out. Sad thing is I donâ€™t completely hate the world or myself but, Iâ€™m feeling super hopeless and left with little to no choice. 

Same situation, living in hell, every day. Itâ€™s boring and I donâ€™t want to experience it anymore.
