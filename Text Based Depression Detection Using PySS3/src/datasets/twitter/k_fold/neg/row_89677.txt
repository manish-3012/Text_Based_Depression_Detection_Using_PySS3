I'm sad, lonely and don't want to be aliveI don't want to live. My life has since I can remember been full of sadness with very few happy moments. I am lonely, I have no friends or colleagues. My best ally is hard music like dubstep or extratone because it makes me forget about life. But it's only temporary. The only reason I'm still alive is my mum, but I secretly wish I could just die in an accident or something I can't prevent. I've cut myself in the past and have had serious suicidal thoughts before. Back then, it got a bit better after I started seeing a psychologist, but now over the years it's been getting worse and worse again. I don't know where to start. I want to have... anybody. But I'm a bad person - not funny, moody, anxious, full of negativity and just quite boring overall. And loneliness is what's killing me.
