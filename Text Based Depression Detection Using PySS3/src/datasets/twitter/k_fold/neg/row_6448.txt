DecisionHello, I am stuck and donâ€™t know what to do. Let me share my story. I am 19 years old and I have the decision to stay with my mother and her husband who has been tormenting me (he is the reason why I attempted to take my life) or my real dad who was only there for like a fraction of my life and my only memories of him are the ones him physically abusing my mother. Ive live up quite the difficult life leading to this day and my options are to stay with my mom and work or stay with my dad to study post secondary (college) the thing is, I donâ€™t know what to do I want to study but I am still scared of my dad. What if heâ€™s still the same as before he has a new family now and is offering to take me in and let me study. I really donâ€™t know what to do and its at that point again where I only think of taking my life to just avoid everything.
