I (30f) kind of realizing how worthless my life is.Not in a sad way but just in an objective way. I wasted a lot of time and have nothing to show for it. The only thing I like to do (learn languages) is a really useless skill because I'm too shy to even talk to. I feel like I've let my family down by not getting married or having kids (they go to weddings and showers for their friends daughters who are my age, and I feel I disappointed them for not giving them those moments.) I think I'm ready to give up though, I really have lost every hope.
