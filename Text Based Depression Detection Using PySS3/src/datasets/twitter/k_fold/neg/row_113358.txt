Is this what it feels like?So sad. Just. Been empty for awhile. Nothing makes me happy. My dog of course but, really nothing seems to keep me going. 
Been depressed for 5+ years, but now Iâ€™m finally realizing the truth. I donâ€™t belong. I donâ€™t matter. Nothing matters. 
Tried friends, family, even people I donâ€™t really know... no one seems to, care ?
Itâ€™s been very sad. Very lonely.
