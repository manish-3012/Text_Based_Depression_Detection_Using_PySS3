Please helpEveryday I wake up I always have one recurring thought; "still alive huh." After coming home from my 8hr job today I got no time to rest, family wanted me to do something for them before I could even get out of my work clothes. By the time I finally changed into my home clothes, they called me cause they wanted to play a game with me. It's like I can never have any time to relax of be by myself. I don't think I can keep my will to live anymore. I just want to end it all. I'm not like the rest of my family. I'm the only person in my family with depression and believe that I always will be until I'm gone. But that's okay for me. Cause I'll be long gone by then. I'm not like the rest of my family. They don't understand me. When they ask why I look a certain way, I just tell them that I'm tired. Why I'm spending so much time in my room? Cause I want to sleep. When people come over I try to not be home. I just can't deal with people who think they know me better than I know myself. I've tried killing myself plenty of times, but it's never worked out for me. Someone always finds me before I can completely die. I just don't have the will to live
