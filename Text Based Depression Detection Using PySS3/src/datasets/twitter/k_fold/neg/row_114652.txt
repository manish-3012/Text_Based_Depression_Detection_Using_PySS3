No one would be burdened by me anymore if I just diedI don't see the point in living anymore. No matter what I do life won't get better. I'm fucking useless, every job I've applied and interviewed for turned me down, it'll be highly unlikely I'll make it as an artist if I can go to college anyway, and everyone would be less burdened if I were just gone. My parents wouldn't have to worry about spending money for college and a car, my friends won't be bothered by me pestering them for rides all the time, no one would have to deal with my stupid comments and voice. 

My parents constantly compare me to my brother, sometimes without even realizing it. There's no competition in the fact that he's the better kid. (When i was a kid and would be upset i woukd say to my mom that she "doesnt love me as much as she loves my brother" as any kid would, and she would just agree with me) Has consistently had a job since 16, makes an effort for his career, has passion, and is stable by himself. Then there's me who is jobless, useless, lazy, and to top it off, I'm bi and gnc. While both of my parents are homophobic.

Everything is my fucking fault. I'm headed nowhere and deserve to die. I can't feel anything in this life for me and all I can do is disappoint people. My parents barely talk to my any way even though we live in the same house. The only thing that makes me sad to go is leaving my dog and kitten alone since I'm the one they've bonded to the most. I can't stand being human garbage for much longer.
