If they really loved me, they'd let me do it.One of the few things keeping me from pulling the trigger is how my therapist--and family-reinforce the effect it will have on them. 

I don't understand this because there is nothing of me to miss. I am merely an inconsequential, scarred shell of my former self. 

If they truly loved me as they say they do, they would let me have my peace. I just want to sleep forever.
