Another FailureWish I wasn't afraid of pulling the trigger, that would make things so much easier.  It's just so messy.

I'm going to make another attempt, maybe mix up some old ones sitting in a box somewhere.  They, being addiction clinics when I needed pain management, really messed me up when the doses I'm taking should kill a horse.   

I've counted the attempts too.  8 times since beginning of may.
