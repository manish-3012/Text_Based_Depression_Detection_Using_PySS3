I'm the closest I've ever beenI'm a 21 year old male who's watching his life fall apart in front of him and can't do anything about it.  I've all but failed out of college with 1 year left to go, I have 0 friends or social life, and I'm borderline obese but can't motivate myself to do anything about it. Worst of all is I'm a burden on my parents. They have done nothing but try to put my life back together but I'm too fucking useless to fix myself.  My last year of school I missed so many classes just laying in bed and staring at the ceiling or sleeping through them. I try to joke about it and make light of the situation but I'm so fucking lonely.  I would go to the grocery store or order food just to have human contact. I no longer qualify for financial aid because of my grades and I was in a specific enough program that my credits wouldn't really transfer to a more affordable school. I had a good internship but it fell through because of things completely outside of my control. The only reason I haven't ended it yet is that I know it would be devastating to my parents but as more and more stuff piles up that excuse just gets weaker and weaker. Every time I get into an argument with my parents or hit any roadblock my mind just goes straight to how much easier everything would be if I died. I know that there are people who have way less opportunity than me and worse lives than me but I don't fucking care.  I just know that I have almost nothing that brings me joy and I go to bed every night hoping I won't wake up.
