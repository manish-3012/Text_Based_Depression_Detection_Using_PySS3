I'm unfit for this worldI freak out about little things, I stress out about little things, I get anxiety about little things.

It's too much, I can't function anymore. I lost my job and i haven't been paying my bills. Thanks to this virus thing, I won't get evicted. I might just call it once this is all over. I can't function in this world anymore. My depression is out of control.
