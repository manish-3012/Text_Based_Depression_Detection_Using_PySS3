nothing changesit has been two years after my first suicide attempt and nothing changed. when i was reading the note i left that time it brought me to tears, because it made me realise that i'm still the same. all this time i was trying to escape myself through alcohol and self-harm, but i never focused on the core problem: me. 

looking back, i see myself lost and hopeless, and looking forward i see myself dead. i know i wouldn't attempt suicide again because it would hurt others even more, but i still hate being awake. 

did/does anyone else here feel the same? like nothing changed, even when you became more emotionally stable?
