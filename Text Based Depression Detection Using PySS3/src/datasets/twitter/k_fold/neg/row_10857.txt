From a formerly suicidal person, here is what changed, and what didn't.What changed: nothing. My circumstances are still the same. I am still single, still alone, still living a half-way life. What did: I started to take medication regularly, stopped drinking and using cannabis, and the improvement in my emotional state proves that I suffer from a chemical imbalance and that medication is the answer for that. I am more stable today than I was with my own apartment, a girlfriend, a job and a car and I have none of those things (although I still miss them a lot, and am very unsatisfied with my life). Please, if you are feeling so bad you are suicidal, explore medication and talk to a doctor. What is there to lose? You have everything to gain. Today I have an opportunity for a more rewarding life because I am medically stable. Love to everyone reading this, think about it.
