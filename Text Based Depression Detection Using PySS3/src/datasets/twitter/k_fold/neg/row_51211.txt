It gets betterNot 6 months ago I was suicidal. I was so depressed that I couldn't even get out of bed. My mother became worried and had me institutionalized. Once there, I decided this was not the place I wanted to be. I was lucky in being rational enough even in my state of mind to talk myself out after only an 18 hour hold.

I got out of the hospital with one goal in mind. Improve. I left my old job that was hindering my ability to socialize and live happily. I enrolled in college. I set goals and made plans. The depression was still very real, and I still struggle against it every day. 

Well, now I'm gathering around positive people. I deleted my old facebook. I have a new one and only people that I feel are positive influences on me are friended. I have a sciences study group at the school. Another friend pushed me to work on my science fiction writing. Yet another new friend introduced me to the woman of my dreams. I'm building a new support system. You must do this too.

I'm never going to tell you that I understand your pain or what you're going through. I'm never going to let you think that life is always a bed of roses either. There's good and bad...but you can only find the good if you open yourself up to it and live life with the idea of finding it.
