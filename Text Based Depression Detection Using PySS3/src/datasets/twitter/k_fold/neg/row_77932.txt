There's an app for thatIt seems there is an app for everything these days, well except for finding a suicide buddy. If I want to screw a complete stranger there's an app for that. If I want to crawl around like a dog &amp; make a six figure income, there are apps for that. But if I want to find some like minded individual(s) also ready to depart this life there's no app for that. Pedophilia is becoming more &amp; more tolerated yet suicide remains something one is forced to do alone in secret, in shame. There are no apps that support a persons right to choose life or death.
