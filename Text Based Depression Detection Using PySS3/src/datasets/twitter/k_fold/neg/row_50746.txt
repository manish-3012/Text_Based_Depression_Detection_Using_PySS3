18, birthday in 5 days. feels like i'm living a life that shouldn't have lasted this far.i don't know where else to turn at this point as i've severed contact with everyone i've ever known. this life has been just filled with insecurity, failed attempts to help others as i've given up on helping myself, trauma, and nothing of benefit.  i serve no benefit to anyone around me. i feel like i am getting old and it is miserable. i miss my mom. it's like a video game where you somehow glitch out of the main area into a part of the map where you were never meant to be. everything is fucked and so far away from what it's supposed to be. does it get better with time? i have a girlfriend of nearly 4 years that i feel i cannot provide for.  i don't even know what i'm saying anymore i just want to rip my head off my shoulders and be done with it all. i want closure so i know that i'm not in agony for nothing.
