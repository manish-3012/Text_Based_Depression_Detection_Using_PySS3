Can't talk to anyone I know about this so here I amThursday night I didn't want to feel anything anymore so I downed some benzos I found in the house and got drunk. 
I blacked out and I can only remember small bits of the night like they were a dream. 
At one point in the night I got into my roommate's lancets and insulin and I began stabbing myself in the arm and face with the little lancets. I believe I injected insulin into myself as well since I woke up surrounded with the stuff.

Though I was still dazed I needed someone to talk to, I tried online support groups but no one would answer, so I called the suicide hotline wanting to talk
They didn't talk to me, they just called 911 on me.

Paramedics arrived, took me in, and after spending 5 hours in the ER they tested my blood and fed me. Found nothing physically wrong with me and sent me on my way. They offered to admit me for mental treatment but I said I couldnt, my roommate is out of town and I have 8 animals to feed.

Upon being released I had to figure out my own way home as I knew no one who could come and get me. 

The entire Friday was a blur and I've spent most of saturday sleeping and crying. I texted my mother saying I really need to go to the doctor ASAP 
I'm going to either have to tough out the last 3 weeks of classes or drop out of the classes so I can get treatment asap 

Until then I guess I'll see the school councelors 

I hate myself so much, my mom's father committed suicide 10 years before I was born. If I succeeded I can't imagine what that would do to her.

I want the pain to stop so bad, but I sit and think about the student loan my mother co-signed, my 9 year old cat that has separation anxiety when it comes to me, the cost of a funeral being $8,000-$10,000.. Etc etc and so on. To dump all this and more on my family would be horrible on top of the emotional pain they'd experience. This is the only thing keeping me from trying anything else
