''im too tired.''thats always my excuse. its constantly ''im too tired.'' hey, do you wanna hang out? sorry. too tired. hey, do you wanna come over? sorry, im too tired. and its true. im just constantly, too tired. i want to lay down. close my eyes. disappear. die.

i wouldn't worry had i been hit by a truck while crossing a street. everything is getting to me. so many people are trying to help me and are trying to get me better, i have an adjusted special schedule for school, there are so many who want to see me be the bubbly person i used to be but its all too hard on me. them trying to help me is stressing me out. getting pulled to the side by the school counsellors  and asking how im feeling and how im doing whenever i go to my place to take a breather is so stressful and everyone trying to give me a hand is ruining me 

im so ungrateful, am i not? they want me to get better. they're trying to be a part of me getting better, and here i am, wanting to die. still wanting to die. not getting better. only getting frustrated when everyone is getting up in my face wanting to help.

i don't want to live anymore.
