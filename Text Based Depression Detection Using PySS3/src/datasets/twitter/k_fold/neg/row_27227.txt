Things are not going to get betterThings are not going my way anymore.
My life used to be so good.
I had an awesome boyfriend. I was attending UCLA, the school of my dreams. I loved my family. I had amazing friends.
But now everything is going down hill.
I had to quit school because I couldn't afford it. My boyfriend lost his job and is now depressed. I cant even help him i have no job and ive had no luck finding one for over a year. I don't see my friend anymore because they're all enjoying the college life. My family for some reason is against me. My older sister hates me and my younger sister too. I don't know why. I can't stand their rude comments. My mother won't even help me she just takes their side.
I feel so lonely.
So lost.
So useless.
I don't know where to go from here.
Death seems so peaceful. I would be able to see my father again. If that even is possible. He died 2 years ago.
He was the only thing that kept my family together. I miss him so much.
I want to kill myself but I'm such a coward.
Everyday I tell myself I just have to hold on for a bit longer and things will get better. But thy don't they jut keep getting worse and worse. I feel so worthless and a burden.
My boyfriend has been caring for me since I dropped out of college. He has suffered so much because of me. I don't want to kill myself because I want to grow old with him. But he might be moving to Arizona because he lost his job and can't afford rent. I don't want to move there because we went to visit a couple weeks ago and its the same living situation I'm in. Tuition would be even harder to pay if I decided to pay for college.

I'm in a spiral going down into a black hole. It doesn't seem like things are going to get better.
