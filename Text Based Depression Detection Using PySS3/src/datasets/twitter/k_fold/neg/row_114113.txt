I just can't take itSo I just recently turned 18 and my parents just started considering throwing me out.  I've always been the good kid...I don't do drugs, I don't drink or smoke, I get good grades (private school), I play sports, etc...but I don't think I can take it anymore.  I realize these seem like trivial things to many of you who are much worse off, but for the first time in my life, suicide looked like the best thing that I could do.  I am scared of being alone really.  I don't have many friends and now my parents who I love so much are thinking about abandoning me.  There has always been a promise in my life that my college would be payed for, but it just came to my attention that this might not happen.  I do not have much money and I am at a boarding school so a job would not be possible until the summer.  I am scared that I will be lost without a job, a home, or anybody else.  I love my parents so much that I am scared of losing them too.  My mom had cancer about 5 years ago and that was scary enough for me.  I understand that there is so much left in my life but right now it just doesn't seem worth any of the pain I am feeling right now.
