Iâ€™m gonna die alone so why shouldnâ€™t I just end it?Iâ€™m 21 and before anyone says oh youâ€™re too young to die alone well Iâ€™m physically incapable of talking to girls in a way that could develop into a relationship Iâ€™ve never had a female friend and Iâ€™m just garbage Iâ€™m unattractive and boring and I donâ€™t wanna live my life if Iâ€™m never gonna find love so why even go on? Iâ€™ll be at best mediocre in my career and Iâ€™ll be alone forever so why even live? Right now Iâ€™m just existing thatâ€™s not life snd itâ€™s miserable
