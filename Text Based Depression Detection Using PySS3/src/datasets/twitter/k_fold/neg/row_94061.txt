I've made up my mindOk, so I'm sad today. I have to fill out some paperwork for a guide dogs organisation at the doctors. But here's the thing: I've had other issues on and off (can't go into details) and I eat a pretty good diet. It's certainly not the type of diet that would cause major illness or malnourishment. I feel ok when I eat, just that these on-off problems only go away for a little while, then come back. I've accepted the fact that my health won't change - it's actually not TERRIBLE, just that my problems do get very uncomfortable. Now the doctors have tried to help me. But the recurring issues aren't curing properly, meaning I can fix them but the issues come back after some time. And due to other complicating circumstances, doctors have to be careful of what medicines to give me, which means I'm very very restricted with medications (currently not taking any medicines which is a good thing), but anyway the doctors have done their best. And I've tolerated my issues for long enough. I'm not willing to keep persisting at getting better while swimming against the current. So guys, I am going to start making memories. For as long as I am willing. And after a certain point when my patience finally runs out, I am retiring. Good luck guys. Tank you for any support you're led to give, VERY much appreciated! But, I've made my decision to live as much of the happy life that I can, then I'm saying peace out. Quality of life over quantity of life for me. Take care guys. I'm putting my life in order which will take a while. If the doctor comes up with a brilliant solution, that's good. But as it stands currently, I'm just buying time now until I'm worn thin. Life doesn't get better.
