Why shouldn't I?People say there is so much to see and so much to live for. But for some people like myself, that is a lie. Not everyone can live a productive life. I pray to God for healing. I think of what could be, but it's all a dream, a distant dream.

The people at the bottom of the barrel just have no place in this life like myself. Only people who are beautiful, talented and have value succeed, and those who don't have any of those do not. This is reality, I do not know why people dismiss this.

Suicide is not selfish, it's my and their choice. You don't have a say in my life, how I should live or how I should think. You only have an opinion, I give you that.

Giving up is not a cowardly move, its a smart and efficient move. Fast, simple, and soon forgotten.

Not everyone is going do well in life or commit suicide, but the choice is theirs. Can you imagine if all the weak go away and how humans can advance without worrying about the dead weight on their shoulders. People like me are a burden to those who have been blessed.

I'm sure I have more to say and lots to contemplate. Others will of course try to bond or encourage me but will probably not because it's easier. A lot of false hope will be preached. People pretend to care, but in reality they do not and is mostly a mask they put on to feel good about themselves.

I am still pondering of such topics and discussing with myself, why shouldn't I?

I do apologize for the longish post and don't want to inconvenient others of my thoughts. I will most likely prove most of not of my points but we'll see. May God be with us all....
