Hmm... what can I do?OK, I'm not sure how to start this but I'm in a predicament. I have terrible anxiety, it's so bad I can barely leave my house and I have trouble doing anything as I'm terrified of everything, especially people. I have a job which at first was OK, now it's just a chore, my commute is 1.5 hours each way on a packed bus. I'm terrified of walking past the receptionist of my work, I'm terrified they will talk to me and I'll have to talk back. This is only one aspect of my life that makes me want to kill myself.

I probably have cancer as well but I'm not in a normal position, I'm a temporary resident of Canada so I really can't afford to get cancer as I'll get denied permanent residency and ruin my families hard work to get here. They love it here so I can't go to the doctor, I'll need to go soon for the residency medicals, I know my family would move back with me as I'm 19 and they wouldn't let me go alone. I really don't want to put them through this, they have just got settled in here after thousands of dollars spent. 

I can't go back home as I'll need to live with family members (If I go back alone), as I said before I have terrible anxiety, I left everyone behind without telling them where I was going, all my old friends wonder where I am. I know if I go back they will find out I'm there and come and see me (I know how stupid this sounds but it's really scary to me). Not only that, I have nothing back there, I left high school due to my anxiety and can't even imagine going to college. 

What can I do? I can't stay here but I can't go back home. That's why I think suicide is really justified here. It all just feels like a bad dream...
