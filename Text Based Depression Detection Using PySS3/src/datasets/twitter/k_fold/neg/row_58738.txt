If you had succeeded when you attempted suicide, how long ago would you have passed away?I saw a post about this on Facebook. It almost seems surreal to think about. If I had succeeded, it would have been 3.5 years since I had passed away. It seems crazy to think about everything I would have missed. Thinking about this is what keeps me going sometimes.
