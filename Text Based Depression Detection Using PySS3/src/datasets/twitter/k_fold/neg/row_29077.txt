Anxious, Live at home at 25, See Everyone but Me Moving Forward. Want to Blow My Head OffShould I? Maybe take 60mg of Klonopin and a pint of vodka?

Idk, I don't wanna fuck up, man.

I tell myself why not get out there one last time if I am really going to end it. I am just filled with fucking rage. Everyone has it so easy. Instagram makes me want to fucking die. All you have to be in this world is a pretty girl with a fat ass and companies pay you $10k/month to sell their shit. Then they prance around in they $40k Jeep while I rot at home for YEARS. And they get upset when Covid ruins their trip to Italy. Eat a fucking slug, bitch. I fucking hate you so much.
