Suffocation takes too long...I don't want to go into details, but just tried something that would have worked if it weren't that I couldn't fall asleep.  Damn pain.  Won't let you live.  Won't let you die.

Not sure why I'm posting.  Afraid somebody here will figure out my normal username, I'll end up committed, or... who knows?  Anything but an exit seems bad right now and even that is hard to pull off.

Wish I had sleeping pills.  Nobody to talk to.  Isolated.  No choice.  Almost expect nobody will be here.  Or somebody will just tell me to do it.  I just wish the pain could stop.
