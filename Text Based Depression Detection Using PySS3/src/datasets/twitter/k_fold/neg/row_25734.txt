Maintaining anonymity and required contactOne of the hardest and lonely things about the way that I am feeling is that I am so worried about telling anyone. It is likely transient and I will feel more normal when I figure out how to break out of this cycle. I do not want anyone to take action to protect me that is likely unnecessary and has lifetime implications. I also have people close to me that are likely required by law to report such concerns if I confide in them. I also don't want to burden anyone I care about with such knowledge because I don't want them to feel like they were complicit.

I don't  understand who is safe to tell about such things. Are some people required by law to contact help? What are the long-term implications of such information getting out?
