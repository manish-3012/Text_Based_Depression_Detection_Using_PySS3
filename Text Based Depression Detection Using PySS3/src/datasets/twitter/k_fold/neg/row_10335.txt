i canâ€™t.i feel so done with life. iâ€™m in my early-mid 20s with no job experience and living with a parent. nevermind i do actually have experience, i held a job down for a full hour before having a panic attack and walking out. i feel so hopeless, i canâ€™t take care of myself with my crippling anxiety and depression. i donâ€™t go to therapy because i canâ€™t afford the gas money to get there. so i donâ€™t think iâ€™m going to be accepted for any type of ssi or disability. every bill is past due, they have turned my internet off multiple times, and they have turned the water off today, seemingly for a good long while, and showering is how i cope with my anxiety..  i donâ€™t have friends, just one. and i donâ€™t have family. i donâ€™t even understand the concept of family. my future is me ending up alone when my parents die and become homeless and resort to killing myself. i would love to kill my self right now so i donâ€™t have to live through the torture anymore, but my anxiety keeps me alive. i hate it. i donâ€™t want this life anymore.
