Discern between genuine suicidal tendencies and attention seeking behaviorI generally have suicidal ideation pretty much every day throughout the day. I do have a plan but the chances of me acting on it are slim. I get annoyed by my family like everyone does. I've romanticize suicide. I'll leave a note telling my family to change their errors in hopes they'll finally listen. That's not good. My family has the right to act however they choose regardless. Suicide won't solve a thing.
