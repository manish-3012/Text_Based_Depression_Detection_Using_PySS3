Drunk right now, thinking am going to depart tonight.I'm so pathetic. Everyone I grew up with is more successful than I am. Unemployed, no girlfriend. Future is dark. No light at end of tunnel. Ending this pain seems like the best option. Otherwise I keep suffering. Don't see the point of this pain anymore. Just going to end this, lights out, and I won't feel anything after that.
