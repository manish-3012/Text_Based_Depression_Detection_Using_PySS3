I hate life. 2020 is going to be another lousy year.I'm a failure at everything I enjoy nothing. I'm getting nowhere in life. I feel completely isolated. I'm addicted to reddit YouTube porn. I sleep all day and domt go outside much. I work 2 shitty jobs. 

My mental health caved and I never graduated from boot camp or college. I want to kill myself before the fucking new year. Everyone and there fucking happiness. Society rejected me the only solution I see is suicide. I tried medication exercise pills dating drinking counseling. Nothing worked. I tried religion. Fuck everything. IM DONE!!! If I'm dead before the new year just know I fucking tried for 3 years to succeed. To no avail.
