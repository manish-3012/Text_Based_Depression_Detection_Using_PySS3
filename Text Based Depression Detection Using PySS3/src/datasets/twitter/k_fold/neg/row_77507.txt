I'm so lonelyI'm young enough that I'm told to not worry about getting rejected or feeling lonely but that doesn't help. I've never had a girlfriend and I don't see it happening anytime soon. I can't tell you the last time I got through a day without thinking about killing myself mostly because I always feel lonely. I've felt this way for a long time really I don't remember a time when I was truly happy. I don't think I'll kill myself anytime soon because I always get too scared about what people will think about afterwards especially if I fail in killing myself. I don't actually want to have a discussion I just wanted to get this off of my chest.
