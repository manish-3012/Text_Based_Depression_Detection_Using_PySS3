I donâ€™t have a reason to get out of bed anymoreYâ€™all idk what to do anymore. Iâ€™m so fucking beat. I feel like I have no where else to go. Iâ€™m in therapy and on meds, Iâ€™ve made big huge steps that were supposed to help and honestly Iâ€™m even more miserable. I work full time, also do school full time and had to start a little side business because my guys hours have gotten cut. I hate working 8 hours a day and the place I work got new management so itâ€™s weird but itâ€™s a super small business so there isnâ€™t anything I can really do. My parents keep telling me every job will suck which I know and everyone else keeps saying to wait until xyz and then itâ€™ll all be good. But it isnâ€™t. As soon as my guy leaves early I just wind up crying in bed until I have to go to work, I havenâ€™t called out once. I feel trapped. I know weâ€™re not going to fix the economy and Iâ€™ll always struggle with money and I just feel like so many of these problems donâ€™t have solutions. My psychiatrist and therapist have both come to the conclusion I have lots of physical health issues NOT caused by my mental health which I tried to figure out almost two years ago so although I am continuing therapy with my therapist my psych says thereâ€™s not a ton left to do because weâ€™re putting a temporary bandaid for something that needs stitches. Doctors completely wrote me off even though tests were coming back abnormal. We get a new insurance on the first so Iâ€™m going to basically start all over and have to redo all the test which just exhausts me to think about, Iâ€™m tired of having to tell people Iâ€™m not lying and that Iâ€™m in real insane pain. It just all feels impossible and like nothing has the potential to change. Iâ€™ve been told to wait my whole life to finally be happy and I just donâ€™t feel like itâ€™s possible. I have the best guy and he keeps telling me he couldnâ€™t survive without me but thatâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m hanging on and that isnâ€™t healthy. Everyone keeps just telling me it will get better and I donâ€™t want to he ungrateful for peoples help but it ends up feeling minimizing and I feel bad because I know people want to help. I just, itâ€™s really bad and with all the â€œchangesâ€ that will happen itâ€™s still years before potentially things even out and even then I know itâ€™s different day same shit. I canâ€™t be hospitalized right now because my guys hours were cut so Iâ€™m kinda it money wise, plus my job has so few people it would put them out. I just donâ€™t know what to do. I literally feel like itâ€™s never going to get better and Iâ€™m so goddamn tired of crying and being so fucking miserable. I just donâ€™t know what to do but I donâ€™t want to keep doing this
