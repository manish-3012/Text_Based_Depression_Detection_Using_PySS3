You ever start to think that maybe you lost your mind?I'm playing with the animals that terrified me, walking into traffic, putting myself in harm's way at work for no reason. 

I'm agreeing with my family, putting down others. Nothing makes sense. I'm tired and going through withdrawals and I just don't want this life.

I'm torn between screaming I hate one person and still wanting to say I love you. 

I really think I'm broken. I just want to get sober. Better. Not angry.
