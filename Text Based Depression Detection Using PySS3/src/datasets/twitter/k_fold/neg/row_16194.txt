2021 ResolutionsMy only resolution for 2021 is to still be here this time next year, as if Iâ€™m honest, I really donâ€™t see it. 

I know 2020 has been shit for all of us, but for me, itâ€™s been catastrophic. I split from my ex of 10 years, losing my partner, my home, my dogs, and my entire life in the process. I eventually find out that all the things Iâ€™d found and heâ€™d talked his way out of since March had been true, and heâ€™d replaced me with a younger guy. So much so, that I go to visit my dogs the other week and he answers the door in briefs with his new guy sitting on my sofa with my dogs. 

Iâ€™m now living in my brothers spare room, alone, with nothing but a 3m x 2m patch to call my own. My anxiety is through the rough, I donâ€™t see a brighter day on the horizon, all I see is me being crushed every day. 

If Iâ€™m still here in a year, itâ€™s been a miracle that has saved me.
