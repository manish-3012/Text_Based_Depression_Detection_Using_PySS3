I canâ€™t do thisI have no control. I am only alive out of a sense of obligation to my family. Iâ€™ve been going to job agencies because I know I have to justify my existence somehow and I need to be useful, but Iâ€™m selfish at the same time because I know that Iâ€™m fundamentally useless and Iâ€™m incapable of doing what most people donâ€™t even think about. Life is just happening and I have no sense of agency Iâ€™m just doing shit because I want to make my parents proud of me because thatâ€™s all I have I need to feel like Iâ€™m of use because otherwise Iâ€™m just taking up space. I canâ€™t do this anymore Iâ€™m so fucking close to just ending my stupid insignificant self and Iâ€™m terrified that Iâ€™ll end up doing it and breaking the promise I made to my family that I wouldnâ€™t do it but I canâ€™t live like this I hate myself i hate myself so much
