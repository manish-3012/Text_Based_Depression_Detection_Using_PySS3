Suicide feels like something that's going to happen one dayI dont understand any of this. One day Im absolutely sure that sooner or later Im going to end it. My head is a mess and I even go to bed crying which rarely happens. But then the next day I feel okay'ish but I still cant stop thinking about it.  
  
I know suicide is something I should not even consider. But for some reason its something I feel like I have to do it. I dont belong to this world. Here I am surrounded by cousins and other relatives. Everyone is laughing and having a good time. But I feel nothing. Like I should not even be here. Only way I can feel being part of the group is being drunk.  
  
I dont know what to do with my life. Few days ago I felt so sure about this decision of just ending my worthless life.  
Im sorry for this shitty post. Im drunk but I just had to write.
