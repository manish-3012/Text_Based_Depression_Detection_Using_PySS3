Going to a crisis home, kicking myself out of my parents house because I donâ€™t want to go to jail for homicidal ideationTitle says it all. I hate my mother and want to kill her. So I am going to a crisis center and never speaking to her or my dad or my brother or any of my friends ever again. Iâ€™m 25, no car or money or job. I had a job in 2017 but then got fired and got a nursing certificate in 2018 but quit doing that because I felt under appreciated and overworked. I need to get out of my parents house and ASAP. I have no choice but to go on the streets or a crisis home. My mom said i am lucky that I live here. Well I donâ€™t wanna be lucky anymore. I want to take very chance I can get to die so I donâ€™t have to grow old in this shit society. I wish my mom gave me up for adoption, like I hate her so much and I wish she would just rot. But she wonâ€™t. Sheâ€™ll continue to watch movies in her room after sheâ€™s done with work and go out to eat and gossip with her sisters and live her stupid life. Iâ€™m honestly happy she had kidney failure and I am gonna vote yes on that prop 23 just so she can die faster. Sorry not sorry. But I hate her so much. I wasnâ€™t given a chance why should she have a chance. Thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m going to be homeless after coming from a good education, taking AP classes and accelerated courses and all for nothing, just cause I couldnâ€™t finish college. I have no purpose to live to an old age because itâ€™s just gonna get harder and harder and life just sucks. I wish I could off myself right now but I am a little masochistic and want to see what will happen.
