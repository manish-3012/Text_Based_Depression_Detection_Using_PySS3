I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me.From a very young age, I knew that I wasnâ€™t normal. I didnâ€™t like the same things that most boys did. I didnâ€™t hang out with other kids. I didnâ€™t feel things the same. Things that the other kids found funny, I found pointless. When everyone would laugh and play, I would sit by myself, bored. I constantly felt miserable and I barely smiled. I hated it.

I decided that I didnâ€™t want to be me anymore. I forced myself to like things that I didnâ€™t, and to play with everyone else. It was a struggle at first, but eventually it became second nature. As if my body was on autopilot. This did allow me to have some genuinely happy times, and I met some amazing people who I loved. Everything was fine, and it lasted for some long years.

Now Iâ€™m out of high school and I feel terrible again. Itâ€™s like the autopilot just turned off, and I canâ€™t turn it back on again. My friends try desperately to talk with me, but Iâ€™m â€œjust not there anymore.â€ â€œIâ€™ve changed.â€ Everyone can see it, including me, and I hate it.

Iâ€™ve lost all motivation to see people at all. My friends, who Iâ€™ve grown to love and consider family, all seem worthless to me now. I used to jump at any moment to be able to see them, but now itâ€™s changed. They ask me to go places, and it disgusts me. The thought of interacting with them makes me sick. Itâ€™s fucked up, I know, and itâ€™s all my fault.

I want to be happy so bad, I truly do, but I donâ€™t know how to anymore. Iâ€™ve been interested in art for as long as I can remember. I loved being able to create things and express myself. I took an art class all four years of high school, and I loved every second of it. But now whenever I try to paint or dry, I feel empty. The fun is gone. Everything is gone.

My days and weeks have started to blur together and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m sleepwalking through life and I canâ€™t wake up.

Winter is coming soon. I loved the cold seasons, but now my brain is becoming full of fog. I donâ€™t think of the snow as enjoyable anymore. All I can see is a way out. It sounds terrible, but I want freeze to death.

I find myself imaging just waiting for a cold day, and just leaving. Walking far into the woods until I canâ€™t find my way back. Lying and down and just letting the warmth leave me, and the cold take over until Iâ€™m finally gone. That may sound like a terrible way to die, but it seems so peaceful to me. It shouldnâ€™t be.

I hate feelings this way, and I hate saying this but I donâ€™t know what to do. I want to fix myself before my heart becomes completely numb, but maybe itâ€™s too late for that. I feel so worthless and awful about myself. Would the world really even notice if I just disappeared? Who cares if Iâ€™m gone, there are billions of other people on earth. One gone wouldnâ€™t even make a dent.

Iâ€™m sorry.
