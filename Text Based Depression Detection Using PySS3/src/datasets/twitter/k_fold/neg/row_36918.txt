I don't know what else to do...I've been through a lot in the past year or so, went on a deployment that changed me, came home to an emotionally distant wife who left me a few months later to move in with her boyfriend, work sucks, they just keep grinding us into the dirt out there. After months of just wanting to sleep I thought I was finally ready to be happy again, got a girlfriend that i adore and focused a lot of my energy on making her happy, but now my self sabotaging ways have probably fucked that up beyond repair and now I feel like I have nothing all over again. I slept for 18 hours the other day and for the first time ever had suicidal thoughts, this morning I typed out a note and cried and cried. I feel like I can't talk to anyone I know because that will either hurt them(what few friends/family I have) or they are just not close enough for me to let them in, I feel like a cliche coming back from the war and my life crumbling all around me but don't know what else to do :(
