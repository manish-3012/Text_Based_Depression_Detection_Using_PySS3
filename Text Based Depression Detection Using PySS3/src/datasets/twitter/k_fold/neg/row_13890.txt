I think it may be the best option for meI absolutely hate myself. I am not pretty. I am not smart, so why should I continue living? I don't think I will be able to achieve any happiness, and I might always have my anxiety issues. I am worthless, and I know I'm eventually going to kill myself. It seems like it's the best option. Someone could easily say "well... there's more to life than being smart and pretty", but come on, both of those traits are very where I live. Honestly, I'm having a hard time going outside because I hate how I look. Thinking of suicide makes me feel so much better, and I know I'll do it one day.
