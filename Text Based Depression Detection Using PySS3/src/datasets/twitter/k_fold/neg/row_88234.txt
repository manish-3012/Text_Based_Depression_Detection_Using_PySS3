I'm giving up today.No one has any reason to care about this. Everyone wants to kill themselves on here. This is just for me. I've gotten enough hints that I'm not supposed to be here. Bullying messed me up, and having no social skills has just ruined my life overall. So I have no friends and no SO, and given the way my interactions go, I no longer have faith that that will change. I've always been pretty stupid, so I don't think I'm getting far in school either.  I think I'll right my family a note, just so they know I'm not mad that they ignored me when I talked of suicide. I'm sure they were just scared and didn't know what to do. I'm just sorry for being such a worthless child. And for the people on this sub that seemed like they genuinely cared, thank you. My last couple of attempts to reach out were met with hostility, but overall I really loved having a place to express my feelings, and I hope this place continues to be that for others.
