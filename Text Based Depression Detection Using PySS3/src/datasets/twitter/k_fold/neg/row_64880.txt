ThoughtsHave been thinking really dark lately dispute trying. Iâ€™m just trying be awake and fight to get up but itâ€™s exhausting. My suicidal thoughts make want to escape this world so bad. I havenâ€™t truly got the courage to attempt. Just mostly depressive and suicidal thoughts. I donâ€™t know if that invalidates me being as suicidal as others. Iâ€™m in a really bad place and self-destruction is how Iâ€™m self-harming. I just donâ€™t matter to myself. Iâ€™m just not strong enough to pull the plug. To all the people on this thread, you arenâ€™t alone.
