So very tiredI have a stupid amount of money owed to various places, Â£1000+ owed to the council due to the fact me and my flatmate initially failed to declare our tax exemption. A court hearing for said owed money on the 5th of Sept.

Divorcing parents tearing a whole in the family set-up, a farewell to an abusive husband and father for my mother and me. 

My flatmate is leaving to go live with someone else, I expected it to happen, he was growing tired of living with me and I could tell, it is not hard. 

I can find no work in my chosen career and depression impedes any efforts to do work in those few times I have. 

I am tired of feeling this dull, constant ache throbbing in what feels as if my very being. Of nearly breaking down in the middle of supermarkets, of being unable to tell the people around me how I feel. 

I would gladly cease my own existence, oh yes, it's been on mind for so long now but I do not wish for those around me to have to deal with the aftermath. My mother, my step-father, my friends and such. 
The aftermath would be horrible, a note would not fix anything, no brothers or sisters to fill my place, I know the feeling that the death of another leaves, that  open wound, so empty and so bare. 

If I could die and have it affect no-one, that would be so lovely. I'm not throwing my hands in the air shouting one last "FUCK YOU" before jumping in front of an oncoming train. I just want to go quietly into that night and nothing more.
