I don't want to die I just don't want to live like thisI've attempted once and don't want to repeat it but everything hurts so much, I don't want to die I just want to stop living like this. I'm out of options, my entire life is going downhill, I don't know what to do I'm lost. I can't talk about this to anyone because they would panic and make me feel worse. I'm so so tired.
