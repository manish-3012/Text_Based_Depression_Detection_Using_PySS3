Fuck luckshit just doesnâ€™t get better, doesnâ€™t matter what I do Iâ€™ll never be enough. Will I always be compared all my life? Tired of being lonely, tired of being nothing, too useless to be something. I promise you it doesnâ€™t matter what I put out there. None of it fucking matters. Everyday I feel like I become less and less of a person. I donâ€™t see myself living much longer and thatâ€™s the truth. I know there are times when I go silent and donâ€™t talk about whatâ€™s really going on, but these thoughts are really catching up to me and itâ€™s taking its toll. Thereâ€™s nothing I can do about it at this point. I feel stupid for even trying to live in this world knowing I donâ€™t belong. Iâ€™ve never stopped wishing death upon myself. How unlucky I was to be brought to this world.,
