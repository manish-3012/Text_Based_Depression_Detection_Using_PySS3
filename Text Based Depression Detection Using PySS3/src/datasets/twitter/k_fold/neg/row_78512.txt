"Unbeing dead isn't being alive"This is a quote from Edward Estlin â€œE.E.â€ Cummings. Itâ€™s basically about the idea that even if youâ€™re breathing, that doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re alive. It simply means you are unbeing dead. Itâ€™s fascinating, isnâ€™t it? You can go through your life, day by day, just surviving the best you can, keeping all your biological functions intact, and subconsciously, you know itâ€™ll never be enough. In everyoneâ€™s sober reality, life is dull and grey and mechanical. Itâ€™s bullshit. I believe that the bigger part of the population is currently not alive. The real reality, for those whoâ€™ve felt the magic of being alive, can be found in the spaces in-between. The places dead people can't seem to look. If you do, though, youâ€™re finally free.

In The Culture of Counter-Culture, by Alan Watts, he says the meaning of life is simply, "to be alive.".

How could such contradicting opinions exist? Evidently, being alive is harder than anything I've known. I've been dead for such a long time until I met Eliza. I was not made to be consumed by others like this. My "living" was being with Eliza. There, I felt truly alive. Now, I am unbeing dead once again. What's the point? How many of you can tell me that you're even really alive?
