Why do I change moods so quickly?Tried to hang myself a couple weeks ago and failed. Since then Iâ€™ve been in a good mood. Felt more motivated. Even gathered the courage to go out on a date. Which went well. Today is a brutal battle of not falling back into the pit. The thoughts of whatâ€™s the point. Fuck it. Your worthless. Are all piling up this morning. What the hell is wrong with me?!
