Fear of happinessI'm feeling better and less suicidal than before. Haven't even touched my rope in a couple of months. This feeling of hope is uncomfortable. I wish I was worse so I could cry and hang from a rope. I know it makes no sense, but that's how I feel.

Anyone feel the same or understand this?
