Nearly doneMy mother screamed at me when she wanted me to drop out for community college at 15, and I wanted to just change schools so I'm not bullied. "Don't try because I'll win."

She screamed at me when I said I wanted to go to college. "You never do anything to help yourself."

She wondered why I don't say anything.

She said "you have to turn everything into an argument" when I tried to explain why I want antidepressants, even though she doesn't want me on them.

She didn't believe me when I said I wanted to commit suicide until we saw a counsellor.

I'd repeatedly hear "you're too sensitive", "can't say anything around you."

She would give me so much constant criticism that I just didn't want to be in her view. If I had a task to do, I'm not going to do it in front of her.

She threatened to cancel university when I said I feel like I have to justify everything. "Don't get cross."

Now I've left home and they're kind. But I just want to give up. I'm in $50k debt and dropped out from 4 institutions when I could have just been supported instead and not be in a train wreck. ðŸ˜Ÿ
