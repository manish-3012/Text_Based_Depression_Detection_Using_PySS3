I'm the biggest piece of shitToday this girl invited me to her home to make out and cuddle, so I went and we were there in her bed for a couple hours. Things got hot from time to time, all was good, but she started mentioning she had a mild headache and didn't put much effort into it anymore. I didn't give it that much of an importance and kept going. It wasn't much, just making out and touching, nothing too far into sex.

Thing is, when I left she texted me saying she didn't wanna see me again. That she didn't have a headache and she just wanted me to stop at all but I didn't do it. She hates my guts profoundly.

I've always hated myself but this is a whole new layer. First thing I did when I got home was puke and cry for hours. I wish I didn't do anything that day. I hate myself. I shouldn't ever have been born so she wouldn't have to had gone through that. I've always had my fair amount of suicidal idealization but this is the first time I actually have the drive to kill myself. Am I a rapist for that? If I am then I really really should be dead.
