Lost My Therapist. And Any Desire To LiveFour years. I've been meeting with her twice a week for four years. I wanted to kill myself when I had my first appointment. She helped me hold on. I could call her anytime I was suicidal and she would talk to me. 

Now she's gone and I want to be gone too. She was literally the only person who cared about me. I have no reason to hold on anymore. 

I've been upping the pills I take at night so hopefully I won't wake up one morning.
