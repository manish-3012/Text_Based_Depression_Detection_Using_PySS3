I don't want to stop being alive, but I do really really want to kill myselfRecently I've had a really strong urge to kill myself. Not because my life is bad or I want it to end, I just have... an urge. An impulse. 

Like I could jump and it would all just end and no one would know why, not even me. And a large part of me really wants to do it. 

I don't know if this counts as suicidal honestly, it's not what the other posts are about... but it does scare me. 

More than jumping I want to stab myself in the stomach. And, this seems so gross outside of my head, pull out my intestines? I kind of want to feel my own organs in my hands. Again, I don't know why. I think about a moment when something went wrong, something forgettable, like using one word when I should have used a better one. Or a moment when a friend called me out on the bullshit I wasn't ready to face. Or something. I forgot to do a task that was important. Someone catcalled me out of their van. It could be anything.

The trigger is so small it's laughable. But the urge is so strong sometimes I physically move to do it then stop myself.

Life is good to me, I don't want to stop being alive. I do want to end my life though. For seconds at a time. Then I snap back and realise that's not what I want at all

But a second is a long time. Long enough to die, or to irreversibly disembowel myself if I happen to cringe while holding a knife. 

I haven't had thoughts like this since I was a young teen, I'm twenty now, and my life is on track...

I don't know what to do other than maybe seek therapy or wait for it to pass.
