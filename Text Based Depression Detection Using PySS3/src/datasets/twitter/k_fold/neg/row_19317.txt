Off my mindIâ€™ve been depressed  for a long time and nothing is getting better . I have thought about suicide but I canâ€™t bring myself to it. I act like a different person for everything and everyone so I just maybe fit in or appease people. No one really know who I am, I feeling like Iâ€™m lost and not only that I canâ€™t find any love. Everyone else loves someone and Iâ€™m feel like Iâ€™m slowly fading away. I do not talk to anyone and no one bothers to talk to me . Sometimes I wonder what will happen if I die right here and who will miss me ? Will I just be remembered for a few days and forgot the next just liek the other kids? What good does my life give ? In order to deal with my pain I scratch myself and choke myself till I almost pass out. I am not sure what I am anymore and every time I look in the mirror something has changed on my face, I am more uglier and fatter . I starve myself at times to lose weight and compare myself to other guys. Any advice?
