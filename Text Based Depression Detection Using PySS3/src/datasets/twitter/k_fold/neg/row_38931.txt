I feel like I'm out of optionsEver since I was 10 I've had depression and terrible anxiety. Every day since I was 15 I've thought of killing myself, and now I'm 20.  Recently the thoughts have become more and more recent and aggressive. My parents argue a lot and I fight with my mom non stop these days. I just feel like offing myself would be the best way to do anything from here on.
