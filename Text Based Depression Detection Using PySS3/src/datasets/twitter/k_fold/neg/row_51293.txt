Tired and over itI thought I was getting ahead of the stupid rat race nice job, nice house all the good stuff, my mental health getting back on track after years of it being horrible. Guess not though because this morning I woke up to a $13,000 debt from overpayments from Centrelink (Australia's welfare system) from when I was a student back in 2015. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I've already been on the phone trying to sort it out but it looks pretty bleak. If they are correct and I owe that much might just go for it and do what I have been wanting to do for years. 

I'm just getting tired of getting ahead and then falling behind again for what ever reason.
