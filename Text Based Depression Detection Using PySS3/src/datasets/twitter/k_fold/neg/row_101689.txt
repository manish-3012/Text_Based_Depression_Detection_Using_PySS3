I think itâ€™s time to goAs of right now Iâ€™m a high school student I know that Iâ€™m going to amount to nothing Iâ€™m in classes with kids who have no understandings of the topics(because of my mental health issues) I had great grades while I was in school till a semi recent diagnosis messed up everything my mother does not believe me all and says i have to be in classes with â€œPeople like meâ€And it has ruined my Hopes bad dreams I was removed from all electives and AP classes And any higher classes I was in and most of my classes were higher.  Iâ€™m now in classes which are ruining my high school record and is not going to meet my requirements or the colleges that I was interested in applying to.  Iâ€™ve basically given up my mother Has no respect for me and will not listen and my father no longer talks to her and by association me.  my life feels worthless Iâ€™m never going to go to the schools I wanted to go to.  my older sister is in a psychiatric ward and my greatest fear is to end up like her Iâ€™m seriously considering ending it all.  I guess this is just a futile attempt to get any help or to at least stall some time and get some advice
