I think about suicide all the time nowI hate this life and I hate this world. i always have. nothing ever works out for me and things only get worse over time. i have sought help a million times already but nothing ever works. medications, therapy, meditation, exercise, self help, you name it, I've tried it, and nothing works. I've always had shit "friends" that only care about themselves and have no capacity to care about me. I've tried a million times to make new friends but it never worked. My family is ok but they cant do anything to help me, and i only make things worse for them. I fucked up my job and had to leave it. Ive applied to hundreds of jobs. No one wants me. Hell, i wouldn't want me either. All i do is fuck up and all i think about is dying. I wish i had the balls to go find a way to buy a gun and just get the fuck off of this sick and disgusting planet. Im just so tired of it all and i don't even care to wait and see if things will get better because even if they do, i will have nothing left in me to enjoy it. just let me fucking die already.
