This sounds patheticBut Iâ€™m not truly suicidal yet

I often feel like I need to see someoneâ€™s sadness over the loss off me in their lives. 

Their regret or lamentation over how they treated my that may have lead to me taking my own life. 

I know it would be fleeting, but Iâ€™m out of ideas for acceptable ways to express how devastated I feel about how my life turned out.

Iâ€™m almost 32, and Iâ€™ve felt this way since childhood. I have a loving bf but itâ€™s not enough. I feel selfish. I self medicate. Iâ€™m tired of seeking out professional help. Itâ€™s too much work. Chronic fatigue due to my ms? I donâ€™t want people to feel sorry for me. I should just give up. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling this way, disappointment, and too tired to do anything about it. Iâ€™ve done it all.

Iâ€™m tired.
