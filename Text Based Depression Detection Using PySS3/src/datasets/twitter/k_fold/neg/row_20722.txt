Can't go on like thisNo matter what I do, or how hard I work, I can't make ends meet. I am in a lot of debt and can't even make a dent in what I owe. I work full-time as a mental health support worker and currently eating a meal on average once every two days, I am behind in rent and have major council tax arrears, I have cut down my bills to the point I can't cut any more corners (hence the no food issue). I have been trying as hard as I can for over 12 months now, I have developed a general anxiety disorder and also have recurrent depression disorder, the only thing that's kept me alive is the thought of my kids being without me, but I don't think I can hold on for much longer.
