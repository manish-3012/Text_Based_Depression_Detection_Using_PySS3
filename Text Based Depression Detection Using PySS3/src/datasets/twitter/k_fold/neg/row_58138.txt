I hate thisi really just wish I didn't have friends so thinking about killing myself would be less hard. i don't have it as bad as others but i can't stop wanting to die. right now my mind keeps comparing a friend who sexually harrased me to one of my current friends so I've been avoiding her. and she don't deserve that. memories just keep coming back and I wish I could just fucking slit my throat and make them stop
