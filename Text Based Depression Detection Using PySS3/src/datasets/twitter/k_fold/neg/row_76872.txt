this is why i want to die.When I'm nice people mistake that as being vulnerable,  when I am quiet people mistake that as stupid, dumb, irresponsible. I could go on. I am not comfortable in my mind anymore. I know I shouldn't care what people think, but we are surrounded by people, thoughts, opinions where I don't feel like I have room for my own, so I feel obligated to care.

I can not emotionally adapt to this world, I am looking for happiness in my own ways, I really am trying. I want to be..a SOUL to this body, a good one, treat it with more respect. 

my deepest secret is that I am a pathological liar, iâ€™m lying to create scenarios that don't exist because i don't like my current life. I wish i was more honest with myself and the people around me. i wish I was comfortable in this world, in my body, in my consciousness. 

I was born unlucky, I feel the world crashing all around me, i'm watching people change and grow and improve with no way how to do it myself. I am trapped, I am lost. I feel like i'm gone! I desperately don't want to be here anymore.
