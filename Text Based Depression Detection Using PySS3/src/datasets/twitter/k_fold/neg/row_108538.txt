I really need someone to talk toI am having a panic attack and feel like I am going to puke.

I have been staying with a very gracious friend, while I get back up on my feet.  Just last week I found a job, which I start this week.  Everything was looking like it was starting to work out for me.

Last night my friend came to me to say that he is getting stuck in family issues.  The big thing to note is that he is rushing to buy a house (currently rents), because some family member's landlord foreclosed and needs a home for their family (with kids).  Apparently he is closing on the house on this Thursday.  He has this current apartment until the end of March.

I have $13 to last me for food until my first paycheck.  I have no car.  I walk to work.  This house he is buying is decent ways away and even if I were to crash at his new place until I got an apartment, it is just not feasible to get to this job.  I would possibly working night shifts, while no bus service is available.

I have no idea what I am going to do.  I just got this job, which is my first job in a long time (I am 23 and cannot go back home).  I have no idea if I will even be able to get an apartment with no recent work history except for possibly a 1month job at the time of getting an apartment.  I am not sure if I would even have enough money for the deposit + rent by the time I need the apartment, as I do not know if my employer will hold my first paycheck or how long between pay periods.

Things just started to get better and now I have no idea how to even handle this.  I just found this job, and it makes me want to cry.  This is just too much for me to handle combined with my previous luck.  I do not want to end my life, but I cannot take this anymore.
