Ever felt like completely cut off people?Like you just seperate yourself from your family, gf and friends? That you move away with no guilt but yet you doubt if its the right thing to do. Sometimes I feel really down or just suicidal but you don't want help. You don't reach out for it anymore. You gave up because you know there's no hope left for you.
