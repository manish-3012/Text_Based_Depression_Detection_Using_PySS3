I just want the pain to stopHi everyone. 

Iâ€™m 23F, Iâ€™ve been having suicidal ideation since high school. Since the end of last year my life has gone downhill - my parents are separating after a long and messy relationship breakdown where my stepdad ran away from our family and stopped paying for my younger brotherâ€™s and my school fee. I had my own relationship breakdown as well that snowballed into an overdose about a month ago, but miraculously I survived. I myself an currently trying to take an interruption of studies because Iâ€™m so burnt out from everything that I canâ€™t continue to go on. My ex whom I loved so dearly dumped me around the same time I found out that my mom and brother are going to be homeless because my stepdad is planning to take our home and car in the divorce. 

Iâ€™m not a good person, I have done things I am not proud of, I have said incredibly hurtful things I could never take back. I feel like I ruined everything I loved. Now Iâ€™m going to be homeless without a uni degree. 

Everyone is sick of listening to me and my endless problems. I ruined my exâ€™s health and studies because I was depressed, suicidal and crying every night when we lived together that he had compassion fatigue and it ended up getting in the way of uni. I have no one to talk to anymore, Iâ€™m just bothering everyone. Iâ€™ve used all 10 sessions with my psychologist that my insurance covered up, and it takes a month to book an appointment with a student counselor. I donâ€™t have a good relationship with my parents, my mother and I are total opposite and all we do is bicker, my biological father disappeared from my life when he divorced my mom and got himself a much younger wife, my stepdad hated us so much that he left us in the middle of the night. 

Iâ€™m just begging to the universe to let me die because I cannot go on anymore.
