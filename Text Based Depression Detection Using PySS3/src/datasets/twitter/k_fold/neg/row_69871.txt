Growing Impatient With LifeHere's a bit of background before we begin. Im 17 years old and I've been to an institution once before almost a year ago on voluntary suicide watch. I can remember the depression starting when i was around 11. I have no struggles in life to think of, my family has money and has a healthy relationship, I had plenty of friends till i graduated and began isolating myself, but yet I still have trouble moving on.

I can't remember a day that went by when i didn't think about suicide. As i sit in my room everyday i replay the various images of me hanging/dying to suicide in various other ways and constantly wish that something would go wrong while im going about my daily routine that would end my life. I've tried to find a reason to live in life and it worked for a while but at this point i just dont give a shit about how my family or friends will feel. When i look at life, i see a 90 year (or however old you live to be) stretch of time that is made up of primarily negative feelings with the reward of a positive feeling when something valuable/rewarding is achieved. I just do not see the point in this repetitive game of life. I want to do things that i know are not possible to me. I want to pursue a career in music if i hold myself over long enough to let that happen but everytime i hear music i create or lyrics ive written, my conscience repeats how terrible my product is and how ill never amount to the people i listen to. I even have a girlfriend in my life too that does nothing but good to me. I feel ive already become bored with life at such a young age that i already feel the need to want to move on to whatever after life there is (if there is one). I really just wanted a place to vent how ive been feeling without being judged by another tangible human being.
