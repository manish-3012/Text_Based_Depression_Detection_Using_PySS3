A bad yearNot sure if anyones going to see this but I here it is anyway, my son was still born just over a year ago... a few months after that my 10 year relationship fell apart, i moved out, a month later i had a motorcycle accident which ruined my career as it's a very physical trade so I lost my job, my house, my car, and my bike, my ex is engaged to a guy shes been with a couple of months, we already had a daughter and now shes not letting me see her really and I know shes playing happy families with her new man. My daughter is going to grow up thinking someone else is her dad, shes the only thing keeping me alive,  I do still love my ex with all my heart and I always will. I went from having everything. A beautiful family, house, nice car, my dream bike, a brilliant job.. to absolutely nothing.. I have no job and cant work as what I'm trained to do because of my injuries and I'm having trouble finding employment in other fields... im living with my parents not bringing any money in, I hardly see my daughter, I have one friend, I've never felt so alone... I feel like my time has come or is coming. Take it from me ladies and gents, do not take anything at all for granted, even the little things, appreciate everything and all the moments you have with your friends and family. If you have actually read this then thank you! Peace out guys âœŒ
