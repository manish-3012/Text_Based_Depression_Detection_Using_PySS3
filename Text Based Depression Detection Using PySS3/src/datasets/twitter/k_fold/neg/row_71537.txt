I want to learn how to forgive myself&amp;#x200B;

I am young, so I do not know if these are really life problems.  Maybe I am just hysterical

I have made horrible mistakes, which led to hurting persons but one in particularly.

I never really were a positive person, but after several mistakes it became worse.

My inner world changed, I became bitter, my world darkened.

My daily life is a circle of numbness, depressive thoughts and anger.

So freaking much anger.

I am angy at everything, sometimes desevered, but mostly with no good reason.

Angry at my family for trivials, angry at coworkers for bothering me, sometimes at my SO.

I realized these are just proxies. Before everything else I am angry at myself.

I  hate myself for all the mistakes I've made. For all the opportunities  I've let slip through my hands. For all the times I failed to make  someone else happier.

I loathe my many many flaws, even more that I fail over and over again to improve.

From time to time I think about my younger self. The happy child.

And how disappointed this child would be, what kind of man he would become.

Today I am depressive.

I do not think I am sucidal, but I think about death every day.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to learn how to be not angry all the time. At the world, at others but mostly at myself.

I want to learn how to stop letting others feels miserable just because of my fucked up personality and bad mood.

I want to learn how to stop seeing only darkness.

I want to learn how not to avoid every mirror because I can't bear my face.

I want to learn how not to expect and see always the worst.

I want to learn how to let go of everything that tortures me.

I want to learn how to make the boy I was proud.

I want to learn how I can find peace.
