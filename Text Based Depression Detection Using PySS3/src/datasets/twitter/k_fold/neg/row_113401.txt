21, Never had more than a glimpse of happiness. It'll end soon I hopeWanted to die since I was a child, used to hit my head against the walls till I passed out. Starting cutting and contemplating legitimate plans when I was 11, first attempt at 14, had 2 girlfriends that cheated on me both year long relationships, second attempt at 16, another girl cheat on me, another year and a half long relationship, another attempt at 17, dated another girl for 2 years and she cheated on me. Surprisingly no attempt.

Since 16 I've been on meds and therapy. Dated the girl of my dreams recently. She knew about my depression, she dumped because of the depression. She said it made me seem like a baby.  When it got bad after I had surgery and couldn't workout for 3 weeks. Lifting is a huge part of my life, I have state powerlifting records and have won 2 bodybuilding shows. She dumped me, felt bad and got back with me for a week then dumped me again. I gave her everything. I never hurt her intentionally or otherwise. I only gave her love and care and support and now she has me blocked on snapchat, twitter, instagram and unfriended me on facebook despite keeping to her wishes that I not contact her ever  because she needed to get over me or something. Cue 3 more attempts and stitches all over my legs and me frustrated that it's impossible to hang yourself in a dorm.

She's seeing someone else now but still insists on pushing me out of her life. Again, I never did ANYTHING but love and support her, I even empathized and understood her decisions but acting like I never existed and now treating me like dirt. This fucking hurts.

On top of all this, I've lost 20lbs from a week-long gastrointestinal bug that is not letting up NOT A GOOD THING. I have a state meet in 3 months and now I'm 20lbs down and weak as a stick. 

7 of my good friends have left me this semester after saying "i'll be there for you" because I'm just too depressed now. I'm there for them still but they runaway when I have problems. All my life has been unstable and betrayal. Why shouldn't I succeed this time? I have copious alcohol,a scalpel, and 30mg of Ativan. All I can think of is the sweet relief of it all being over. I've tried all therapy, all medication, nothing has helped. I'm running out of money for treatment. There's literally nothing redeeming left. I'm wasting away physically and emotionally. I'm done
