I didn't think I would be back here again.About a week ago I was planning to kill myself. I was stopped by my school counselor and for the first time in my life I told someone about how I was feeling. I went to the hospital and my therapists to talk about it. I was put on a new medicine and felt happy for a few days. I have not felt depressed but since the incident I have still been thinking the same suicidal thoughts just as frequently. I feel like I have been pretending to be happy. I know that I am just ignoring all my problems but the longer I ignore them, the worse they get. I just don't know what to do anymore. Is it normal to feel this way?
