I can't anymore.I can't keep this in anymore. I have to talk to somebody. It feels like every day is getting worse and worse. The happy minutes don't seem worth it compared to weeks of pure dread and sadness.  It's so easy to do it. I planned to do it a week ago. I couldn't. But as days go by, the more I welcome death. I have never opened up to somebody in real life. I can't. People won't like me when they find out the truths about me. I'm just a freak. I feel so alone.  I can't do this anymore.
