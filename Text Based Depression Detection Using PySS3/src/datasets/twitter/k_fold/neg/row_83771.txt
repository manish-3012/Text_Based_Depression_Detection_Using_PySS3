I don't know if I'm going to live through this one.For the past six months, I've been in a severe depressive episode that I haven't seen the likes of in almost five years. Just a few minutes before making this post, I realized I don't know if I'm going to live through this one.

It was a very visceral feeling. Like, I could envision my failure in perfect clarity. It was different from any other suicide/death/disappearance fantasy. My last episode, I never realistically thought I would kill myself. This time, however, it just actually feels like a possibility.

I'm sorry, I don't know how to explain it well. It's just different and I needed to say something.

I'm in therapy again. I'm doing the "right things." I just really don't think it'll be enough this time. I'm so tired.
