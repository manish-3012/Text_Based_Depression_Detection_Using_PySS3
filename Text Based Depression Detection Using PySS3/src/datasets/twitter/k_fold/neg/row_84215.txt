Its getting worse and worseThis is going to be a rant because i have no one else to talk to and i cant sleep and i just need to get these things out somehow. Ive been depressed for a long time but ive never had suicidal thoughts. Until recently. My mental state has hit an all time low, and i dont remember the last time i felt okay, and its like i lost the ability to feel happy and at peace, even just for a few minutes. I feel lonely all the time, even when im sorrounded by people. I feel self conscious all the time and it has gotten to the point that i dont leave my house because i dont want people to look at me. I can barely look at myself. But the thing that hurts me the most is the fact that i feel like nobody loves me. I have a big family, i live with 5 other people but it feels like i live alone, sometimes i dont talk to them for several days. I have a few friends but they all have their lives and i dont think our friendship means them much. I know that if i died no one would care. Maybe they would for a few days but they would get over it. The tought of ending my life is getting more tempting each day, and i think i will actually do it.
