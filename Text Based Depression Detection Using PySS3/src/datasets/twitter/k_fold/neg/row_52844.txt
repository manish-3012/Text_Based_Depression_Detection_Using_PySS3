I'm suicidal, and I have to take a two day suicide prevention training for my job as an RA.I'm really angry about this situation because it means I have less alone time for myself. I'm on vacation with my family in my safe haven childhood home so it also means I have to face reality and people sooner. Not to mention the $150 change your flight fee. 

But I'm trying to fix my negative behavior and be more optimistic (NY Res), so could this be useful for me? Maybe this is humanity's way of saying, *I want you to live*? Or, *here are some resources since you're closer to killing yourself.*

This isn't a threat and maybe I shouldn't be posting this here, but it's so interesting I thought I'd share.
