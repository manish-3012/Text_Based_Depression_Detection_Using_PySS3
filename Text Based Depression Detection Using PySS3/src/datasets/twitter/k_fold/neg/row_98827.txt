I canâ€™t take the silence anymoreThereâ€™s no point in living, Iâ€™ve tried to find a reason but there isnâ€™t any. Since I was 6 Iâ€™ve thought about dying, I never really thought I was meant to be born. My childhood was just a series of moving towns, schools, and always being the one who was excluded from everything, and being bullied. Maybe that impacted me in later years. When I was 12 and me and my parents moved to a city things got worse. I canâ€™t exactly pinpoint what, it would be too long of a post if I described every detail. I guess I developed an eating disorder (but honestly I had the thoughts since I was 5) which I still have 5 years later (now, at 17) and surprisingly I managed to keep it low-key even at a BMI of 14. Because no one really cared. In school I only had one friend. I had other people who were friendly, but the majority seemed to hate me and I was just called weird and crazy. When someone did want to be friends, they were fake and turned on me each time. Iâ€™m in college now, and Iâ€™ve lost that one friend. I was keeping in touch, but she didnâ€™t seem interested. For two years now, Iâ€™ve had no friends. I donâ€™t consider myself an introverted person. I can be quiet a lot, but I do try to initiate conversations etc, but no one reciprocates, no one likes me. No one smiles back at me. I must me repulsive. No one wants to make friends at this age. You may want to say that I donâ€™t need friends, but say you wake up tomorrow to find everyone in the world to be gone, what would be the point? I would safely kill myself. In reality itâ€™s even worse for me because people actively reject me, no one wants me, and I have to see everyone else having fun with each other and actually doing things. Normal people things like go to the cinema. But itâ€™s not about the cinema. Itâ€™s about going with someone. Lately, I havenâ€™t been able to get myself to leave the house. And when I do, I begin to panic and so I rush home and have a panic attack. And I have moments where I have hope but... hope for what? Iâ€™m just an insignificant being. Itâ€™s too late for me. My life is 17 fucked up years and I canâ€™t fix them
