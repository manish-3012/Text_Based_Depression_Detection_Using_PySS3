Late night thoughts ...I committed a misdemeanor 5 years ago and like many people with a criminal background I cannot find a job. It really sucks because I went to a really good 4 year University, 2nd best public university in the US to be exact and I really thought that things would turn around. Everyone that I knew found a job, except me. I have a child who depends on me and a girlfriend who has been sitting here waiting to be married for 10 years. Iâ€™m just a piece of shit, I messed everything up. I was hoping to one day be able to take care of everyone and now here I am watching paint dry. I have been painting for a week now. I just do not know what to do anymore. Everyone tells me that things will be better because this is a rough patch but I do not think they understand that my misdemeanor is here for life. The funny thing is that I took a $15 item and now I cannot find a way out. I cannot get an expungement because I plead guilty. No one is willing to take a chance on me but I do not blame them. I am the problem not them. I am getting to the point of being scared to apply to jobs and I prefer to stay indoors. I am in serious debt and can barely afford food. At this point I am waiting to be kicked out of my home and have my child taken by the government since I am a piece of shit parent. I sent a pardon request to my governor but who knows when I will hear back from him. If he rejects it I think I may need to find a real way out of things. I cannot handle to sit here and provide a shit life for my child all over a $15 item but that is our law. I just do not know what is expected out of me? Should I sell drugs or keep committing crimes. Why are things this way. It was a stupid choice and mistake.
