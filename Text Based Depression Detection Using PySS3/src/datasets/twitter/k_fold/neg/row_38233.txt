have you ever called a suicide hotline?I've had intrusive thoughts about suicide ideation since I was like 7, but as I've gotten older it's gotten harder to ignore these thoughts or convince myself they'll be gone soon. I've thought of calling the hotlines, but I'm pretty sure that I would just break down into a sobbing mess the whole time. I wouldn't even know what to say to them or what they could say to me that would help.

Has anyone here called? What's it like? TIA
