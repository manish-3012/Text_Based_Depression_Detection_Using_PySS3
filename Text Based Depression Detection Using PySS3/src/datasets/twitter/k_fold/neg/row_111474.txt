Listen. Share. Empathy. Literally just fucking talkI am not looking oft a pitty party. I know it should not but my pride hurts coming here. June 1st was the 1 year anniversary of my best friend and our other buddies death, and our old friends would not even see me for my birthday. what's wrong with me why can't keep people around. I'm 23 in a couple days, and i have no fucking idea what I'm doing.
