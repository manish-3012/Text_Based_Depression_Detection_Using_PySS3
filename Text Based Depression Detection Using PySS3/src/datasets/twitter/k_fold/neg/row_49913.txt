in case donâ€™t make it..I may have ingested what might be considered, for my medical history, a dangerous amount of caffeine and cocaine last night. in case I donâ€™t make it, I am sorry for all the wrong I have done all the women in my life. i only ever wanted to respect, want and be wanted appropriately. unfortunately all I learned growing up were toxic masculine traits traits that lately, I have felt I would give almost anything, possibly my very life, to unlearn and take back. I had to get this off my chest. thank you for reading and stopping by
