Things aren't going to get better. I'm shown that time and time again.My mind has already split into two parts, myself and another that takes control of me at random and attempts to hurt me. I do all I can day by day to suppress it, but what's the fucking point anymore? Why don't I just let it take over? I already came so close to succeeding in killing myself in March, and shit's just gotten even worse since.

Abused by family for over eight years, found the one person who ever showed me what it's like to have someone love you, only for them to get sick and fade away. Had to move away from home because me being suicidal was a "threat to my family", because why can't they put themselves first at all times? And now I'm living in the middle of nowhere, completely isolated from anyone and anything I know. Potentially blacklisted from the only industry I've ever had any passion for over some company's shit communication internally. Impossible to find anyone here who can help drown out the constant noise in my head. I can't get job and am barely surviving. I don't want to live anymore. This isn't a life worth living. 

I should just let it take over. Every time I have hope it's immediately crushed. I'm done.
