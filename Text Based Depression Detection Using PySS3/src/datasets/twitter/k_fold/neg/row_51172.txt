I Just Want To End It All.Hi Humans of Reddit!

Here's my situation.

I'm from a country where conscription is still practiced, which sucks big time. I graduated from college last year and my career was really taking off when I received the draft from the local army recruiter. I was left with 2 options: I had to either avoid the draft by escaping the country and be declared person non grata (it's that serious) or get enlisted and have 2 years of youth taken away from me. I chose the latter, and needless to say, I'm in great misery right now knowing that I have to serve a government whose ideology I don't stand behind and that my career has been put to a tragic end. It hurts me real bad seeing my friends thriving and me getting stuck here in the army. There's the third of option of bribing my way out of service but  the cost is ridiculously high (\~10,000USD to 20,000USD) and I just don't have that kind of money.

I feel lost, devastated and just want to put this pain to an end.
