I need serious help, and I cannot get it.First of all, I hate this. The one thing that most kills me is writing about how I feel, but if I don't do it, then nobody will have known and people might blame themselves. I don't want to put anyone under pressure. That part of my brain that occupies at least half of my thoughts now tells me to stop typing and "looking for attention" and whatnot but this time it needs to shut the fuck up just once. I will come across as a dramatic fucking retard but it doesn't matter anymore

I should start with some background. From an early age I was diagnosed with autism, and my school at the time refused to give me any help even with the required documents, and managed to squirm away with no consequences for obvious neglect due to pretty much everyone in charge leaving in a hurry, and my school being turned into an academy by the time I left. To say the least, everybody with any responsibly escaped with no consequences. 
This fucked me up in my ability to do simple maths, and to this day I still need a calculator for the most basic of jobs.

I don't really need to say I was bullied my entire school life because you know damn well what kind of sad prick I am. Never had a girlfriend or really decent friends during school. 

Since birth I had major facial defects in my nose, teeth and lips. A cleft lip and pallete for anyone who knows what that means. I had serious deformities that 10 years of surgery had to correct and braces for 6 years. To say I have had medical input my entire life is not an exaggeration, and it fucked up my social skills to the point where I can't hold a friendship for longer than a year because I was out of school so often.

My parents, unsympathetic and clueless but so they should be. It's affected them just as badly as me and I do not want sympathy. 

I cannot get a diagnosis for depression or anything else mentally as I am a year too young for proffesional help, and the 'Children's assessment' or whatever has a waiting list of over a year at which point I'll be old enough for the government to consider helping. It seems like the whole world has given up at this point. I know I'll never amass to anything and it doesn't matter if I do or don't. 
I do not have the feeling of empathy. Nothing at all. This is a known psychological problem that I have. 

I somehow managed to find the love of my life, and for a short time I felt like things could really get better, but my constant social problems and communication fuck ups are straining the relationship and apologizing never works. She knows of these issues but I do not expect her to treat me any different. I don't deserve her for putting up with me, and understand if she doesn't love me anymore. I know it'll over soon. 

I don't see any way out of this, and real "help" is another year away if at all. I take pills for constant tiredness, and they are starting to fail. I get anger spikes which I can only really assume is the side effect of being a teenager as people agree, and I just can't go 10 minutes without feeling sad, angry, or anxious. I have made several attempts to write down how I feel, and this is the only one I will ever publish.

I am done, and I want out. Life is a cruel joke, and I can't laugh.
