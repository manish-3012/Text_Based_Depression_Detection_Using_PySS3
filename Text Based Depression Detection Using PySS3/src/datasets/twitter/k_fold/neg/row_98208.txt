I've got a dateI'm gonna do it on my birthday in a few months. At least, that's the plan anyways. There's something poetic about ending it on the day it all started.

I'm getting things prepared at work for my departure. I have to get rid of some personal things at home to make it easier for my husband to go through (don't wanna leave him with all my crap).

I have tried writing notes but they all sound stupid. I kinda want it to be a giant F U to my parents and other people who don't give a crap.

Method is the trickiest. I have to find a way I won't be discovered before I am finished. 

I haven't told my therapist I have a date set, but he's been aware I've had these thoughts off/on. They upped my medication, which makes it slightly harder to focus on "the plan" at times. But I know it's for the best.

I could do it right now, actually, but Christmas is my fave time of the year. I want to see the surprise on people's faces when they get their gifts, and then I'm out. I deserve to be happy with this at least.
