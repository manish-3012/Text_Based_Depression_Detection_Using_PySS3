i feel it coming.i do. i know i am on the brink, and intellectually know i should be scared, that i should probably get help, but i am not scared, and the "help" has never changed anything before, as i am sure is the case still. i have been dealing with feeling like this for a few years now, but the difference is that before, i was not confused by my feelings- they were intense, yes, but always distinct and self-defining. lately, i think i have stopped feeling anything at all, and even going to extremes with self harm (dozens of stitches, major blood loss, etc.) no longer helps. 
before now i thought the always feeling in extremes deal was as hellish as it could get, but i was wrong to say the very least. feeling nothing has given me the impression of being already deceased, the isolation (the cycle of which i cannot break) only amplifies the illusion (though many times i have been convinced that i really did not exist, which worsens things tenfold).
not even sure why i am posting this- i guess as an excuse to say "i tried" one last time before i do what evidently needs to be done.
