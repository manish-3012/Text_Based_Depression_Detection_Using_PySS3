I'm a fucking monster and need to dieIt's been almost a year now since I lost the only true friend I ever really had. I seriously hurt them and fucked things up so bad between us, I'll never forgive myself. I've never really been the kind of person to let others get close to me and the one time I actually did I completely ruined it. I'm such a toxic and despicable creature of a person. After what's happened, I've decided to never let anybody else get close to me again, I don't want to put someone else through that same torture. I've tried to kill myself multiple times recently but never had the confidence to go through with it. Standing at the top of a bridge, speeding over 100 down the highway, staring down the bottom of a NyQuil bottle; I chickened out each time. I'm just numb now going through each day like the last, I hope that I get shot, get in an accident, or something because I don't know how much longer I can take this. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about them and wonder how they're doing right now. I seriously want to end this pitiful existence that I don't even deserve...
