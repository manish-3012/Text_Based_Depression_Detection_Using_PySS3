Advice needed.Hello, I'm currently needing some opinions. My boyfriend has been extremely anxious and has depression. He was hospitalized for a week where he was able to seek help. The past few weeks were looking up for him where he was getting out of the house and doing other activities. However, recently he has fallen back into a loop and admitted he started to hurt himself again and is feeling at a complete loss. He asked if he could stay over tonight because hes scared of what he might do. I told him that he could of course and that we would figure things out together and that he was not alone in this. I want to possibly suggest when I pick him up if we should maybe go back to the hospital. He's admitted he needs help. I'm just wondering if anybody knows what would be the best action to take? Or if we should just go back to my place and make a plan together on what he would want to do next?
