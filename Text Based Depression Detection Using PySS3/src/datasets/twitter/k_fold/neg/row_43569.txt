Im so tired of hurting everyone around me.I'm 17, dropped out of school at 16, am addicted to opiates. This may be long i don't know i'm not smart as you can tell by my education. i just don't know what to do anymore. i get all my pills fro my parents  what kind of parents get there sons addicted to opiates . I dont even wanna stop because its the only thin that brings me joy. This whole Drug relationship between my mom me and grandparents has ruined our relationship they never have enough pills for the "medical reasons" because of me if i just killed myself they would have so much more. These drugs have ruined my life i'm never happy without them,cant sleep without them. oh i'm also 315 pounds so got them small dick problems. I just want to die all i do is stay in my room all day play video games and plot how to get the next high, nothing constructive  . I've even stolen from my grandma. I'm the worst kind of person there is. i just want someone to listen i have no one. i just wanna kill myself but i'm to much of a pussy too do so. i'm not a man i'm a fat mass of toxic waste to all those around me.
