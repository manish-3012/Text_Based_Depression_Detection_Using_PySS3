Again.Today it hits me like a ton of bricks. Itâ€™s happened like this before; Things seem to be going well and suddenly Iâ€™m back thinking life isnâ€™t worth it just in the space of a day and after months of feeling that Iâ€™m getting a semblance of life back together. Today started really well, but somewhere along the line everything went completely wrong and I couldnâ€™t even tell you when, how or why. Iâ€™ve had this happen before.  I used to worry about the depression coming back even when I was feeling well. The thing thatâ€™s really getting me this time is that I really didnâ€™t have that worry about it returning hanging over me. I know it sounds ridiculous, but just in the space of a day I suddenly feel that all progress Iâ€™ve over the last few months is pointless and that I never should have let my guard down and dare hope things would be different. The thing that worries me most though is that this has happened so many times now that I feel itâ€™s inescapable. I know that objectively I could be a lot worse of and there isnâ€™t really anything much that changed about my situation between yesterday when I was feeling completely fine, but for some reason I find no consolidation in that.
