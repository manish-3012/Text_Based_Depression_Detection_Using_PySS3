I just need to talk to someone.I'm having a very hard time right now. It's not all that different than it normally is. 
But honestly... I just want someone to distract me. 
The biggest part of my life, someone who made me happy, made me feel special and loved and a million other ways I'd never felt before, is gone. I spent every single moment of my free time giving myself to him and now he's gone. 
I'm young. I know it's stupid. I have so many other problems that have plagued me my whole life, but while spending over a year with him, I thought they didn't matter. Nothing mattered anymore because I actually felt happy. He left on Christmas. He said it was a break. Well... He lied. He told me today. New Years... I've always loved the holidays. But now I can't help but feel worthless and depressed, even worse than before. This is probably all just a ridiculous rant so I'll stop... Just.. Someone please help me through this stupid countdown. I don't want to be alone...
