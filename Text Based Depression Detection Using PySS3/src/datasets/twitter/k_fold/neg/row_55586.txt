Did I cure my depression but I still get suicidal thoughtsI was very suicidal 2 years ago and then last year I started going to therapy. I never talked about suicidal thoughts just self harm and stuff but I also started to feel myself getting better. Over the summer was one of the first times I thought to myself that maybe I wouldn't be better off dead but I also still have never felt truly happy. Recently I think about killing myself all the time even though I don't have a specific method in mind right now. I've never been diagnosed with depression I don't know maybe I fixed myself or it was never real, but then also why have I never been truly happy
