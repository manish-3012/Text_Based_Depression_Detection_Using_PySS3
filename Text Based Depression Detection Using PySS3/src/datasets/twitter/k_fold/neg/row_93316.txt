as you could guess, i would really like to not be breathing at the moment.i would walk out the front door, sit on the train tracks and wait for the train to kill me. but i know i would chicken out, return home, then have to make up a lie. none would be believable. the door is loud, theyâ€™d know i left. 

iâ€™m afraid, but i donâ€™t want to do this anymore and iâ€™ve known that for a long time. iâ€™m young, very much so but at this point i donâ€™t think that matters. i would gain nothing forcing myself to not kill myself for 14 more years just to be still want to die, but also have real world responsibilities and shit. i cannot see a reason to bother with this further, but iâ€™m not strong enough to go through with it now. i hate myself just enough iâ€™ll continue to subject myself to life.
