Slowly steeling myself.Convincing myself that it wonâ€™t matter that mom will be sad because I wonâ€™t be alive to care. The shitty thing about me is that I donâ€™t even deserve to feel this way.

I grew up with a normal middle class family and as I slowly grew up Iâ€™ve noticed that my gaming hobby isolated myself from them. I donâ€™t have a strong bond with family like everyone else and I donâ€™t have friends to tell how I feel. 

I wish I was someone who was happy but thereâ€™s too many things I hate about myself to ever, genuinely enjoy life.
