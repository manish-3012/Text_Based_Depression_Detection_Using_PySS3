I have about 70 grams of Quetiapine and am contemplating treying to kill myself via overdoseI've been struggling for a long time, longer than i care to admit. I'm currently taking a month off work to sort myself out. i've tried seeking treatment multiple times and it never goes anywhere, I still have the overwhelming urge to kill myself but i'm scared that i'll fuck it up. I have about 70 grams of Quetiapine along with a bunch of Diazapm and  Desvenlafaxine and i want to try and end myself tonight. I know this isn't a place to seek approval or be given the green light but i don't know where else to turn. i'm lost and don't know what to do anymore. This might be my final night if it works and i have the balls to go through with it. I don't even know how to end this, just... goodbye.
