I've given upIn the past, when I wanted to kill myself, a part of me was still trying... But after losing the only person who ever really made me happy... I have given up.

I can't fix things with her, everything else without her is fucking meaningless. Every day the only reason I'm not killing myself is because I've failed so many times and the only thing that keeps me going is the tiny sliver of hope that she'll love me again, as much as I love her... But why would she...

I'm so tired of everyone's advice. I'm so tired of 'do you want to talk about it?' No... I don't...

All I want is her...

It's too late tonight, but it's time to put a plan in motion and get out of this life...
