The only thingReally, the only thing that has stopped me in the past and is stopping me now is that I'm an atheist. I don't believe in an afterlife. I've got a suicide note written up and everything, but I'm just too scared to do it and it annoys me. I'm going to fail midterms, so I want to do it soon, but I'm too scared that when it's done, I'm done. I wish I had the courage. I keep trying to motivate myself, but I'm still scared. Life isn't going anywhere for me anyway, so might as well get it over with now.
