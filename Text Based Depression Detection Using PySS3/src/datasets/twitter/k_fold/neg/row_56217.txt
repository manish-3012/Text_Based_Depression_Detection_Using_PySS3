Friend contemplating suicide, need help ASAP.On of my friends have been contemplating suicide for several months now and I think he's at his limit. He's said he's though of several methods with things around his home. He's getting shit from his parents saying that his Dad calls him "worthless" because he gets bad grades and he says "it sheds a bit of his humanity away" whenever the dad gets angry at him, his mother is hardly around because she's a Jehovah's Witness and he says he can't find help. Its gotten to the point where at this moment, I'm afraid that he has ended his life at this very moment and I don't know where to go. Please Redditors, help me with this situation and we maybe able to save a life.
