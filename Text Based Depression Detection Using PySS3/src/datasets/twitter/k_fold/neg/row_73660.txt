I just had to walk away from my last solid emotional supportThe person I loved most in the world spiraled into this self-destructive abuser, and I can't help her, at least until she starts caring about herself again.

But she was my last solid piece of support in the world, and now I'm just a complete mental wreck, and I know every hour of the next week is just waiting to see if maybe something good will come from the seeds I have sown in other parts of my life, or losing hope and spiraling. But every moment of waiting is going to be another moment I just want to die.
