My mother doesn't love meMy mother just essentially stated that she'd become tired of "enabling" me and she responded to my suicidal statements by getting angry and making it all about her. She either doesn't believe me or is too selfish to care. Either way, I'm out. I have no friends and I just quit my job due to depression, so nothing lost there either. Tomorrow after work I will stop by Dick's Sporting Goods and buy a 12 gauge shotgun and buckshot. Then I will kill myself sometime this weekend. Not sure of the exact plans yet, but my mind is made up. I reckon I may have to use a little vodka to get enough courage, but it's on. Wish me luck.
