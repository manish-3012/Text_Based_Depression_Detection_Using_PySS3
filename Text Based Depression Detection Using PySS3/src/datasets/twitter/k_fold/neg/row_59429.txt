My dark tunnelMy grandmother said that around the age of 15-25 all young men go through a dark tunnel.  Some are darker and last longer than others but the vast majority go through them.

I'm 23.  I have been in this tunnel for over a decade.  I have tried therapy, medication, exercise, eating healthy, I have even been institutionalized at a psych ward for my depression and none of it even brings a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.

I fantasize about killing myself.  Sometimes this is what gets me through my day.  I often fantasize about it for hours on end and I think I'm very, very close to going through with it.  I have been quietly killing myself with my life style so that it looks "natural" when I'm diagnosed with something terminal, this may not be quick enough.

I feel inadequate, uneducated and despite my best efforts I fail.  I feel like a horse in quicksand.

I tell myself to make the best of this shitty situation.  This does not make the situation any less shitty.

I don't have it very hard.  A loving family, girlfriend and satisfactory job.  I am prepared to give all of this up.  I know deep down they all want me to be happy.  I can't remember the last time I was truly happy and checking out early will remedy this.

There is a lot of traffic here, I understand if no one reads this.  If you do read this thank you.
