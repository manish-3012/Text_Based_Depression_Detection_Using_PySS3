Give me a reaaon to not do itWhat's the fucking point?
I'm alone, I'll always be alone, no one gives a shit how good of a person you are, no one will ever see the good in you, so what's the point of all of this? I'm convinced I was born to suffer and die alone, all the love I give to those I care about means nothing, I swear I'm trying to be a good person, I help the homeless whenever I can, I try to break fights, I listen to those who need someone to listen to them, I care about everyone way too fucking much, and then what? Everything's always the goddamn fucking same, broke up a 5 year old long distance relationship that turned toxic at the end in hopes that I might find someone who's actually able to be with me, but no one ever tries to see the good in me, i know I'm ugly and fucking fat or whatever the fuck I am, but I'm not a bad person, I swear, why should I keep going if I'm always going to be alone? No one will ever love me.
I wish I could just get a hug, just a single hug, that's all I need, but I'll die without it.
There's no hope left for me
