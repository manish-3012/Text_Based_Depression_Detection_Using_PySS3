I'm getting more and more done by the dayI'm tired of my mood shifting every hour from extremely depressed to happy for no reason. I'm tired of my parents not believing that anything is wrong with me. I'm tired of being impulsive. I fucking hate I may just end up being another statistic in the amount of trans people that kill themselves. 

I am so afraid of hell. I am so afraid of pain. I am so afraid of dying. I'm so far gone at this point in afraid of getting better
