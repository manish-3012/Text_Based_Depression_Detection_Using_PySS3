I don't want to grow up. Thinking about ending it.I'm 18 at the moment. I have a very good family and I'm pretty well off in terms of money. However, I simply don't want to grow up. I want to go back to my childhood when I was a happy kid.

I don't have friends, lost all of them because I simply was locked in my room for the last six months. I can't go in public anymore since I get anxious by watching people there are about my age passing through. I can't concentrate to study. I can't go to classes because AI get anxious and start hurting myself. To sum up, I can't do anything besides being a complete failure.

I just wanted to disappear. I just can't explain. I feel like there is a void inside of me. I don't have ambitions, goals, concentration, motivation, desires. The only thing I care about, at the moment, is my family, but, unfortunately, I also don't want to see them because I feel that I don't deserve them.

I'm thinking about suicide. I have considered it before, but was too scared to try something. Now, the situation has got worse. I don't know what to do. I'm scared. I constantly get anger attacks and start throwing everything on the wall. I'm crying typing this. I don't know what to do.
