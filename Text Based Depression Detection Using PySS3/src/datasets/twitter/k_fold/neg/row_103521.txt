Words won't save me. Only medical treatment will do.Please don't bother with useless fucking words. I appreciate the support, but I need more than that. 

When your car breaks down, you don't offer it words of encouragement. You repair the broken part. 

When your friend needs your help, you don't wish them luck and then blow them off. 

You should get the point by now. 

I'm broken. I need fixed. I'm fucking tired of words of encouragement because they don't do any good unless your problem stems solely from one's own discouragement. 

I need advice. I need to know exactly what I must do or where I must go. I'm an American with no health insurance, and if I exit this world, It's going to happen inside their headquarters so they are forced to witness the consequences of their stupid fucking policies. 

As an aside, if anyone in New York or Washington D.C. is sklled with a video camera, I welcome you to film the event. These sort of videos make good money.
