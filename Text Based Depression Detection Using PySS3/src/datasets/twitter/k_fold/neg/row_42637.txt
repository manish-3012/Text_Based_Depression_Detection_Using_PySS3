GoodbyeI wanna end this nightmare. I screwed up so much in my life. Despite my physical disability and the fact I look rather odd, I managed to find true love 4 years ago. But from the beginning I was the toxic part of the relationship because I tend to be very cynical/provocative and say hurtful things that I instantly would regret. So I pushed him further away from me.
This spring he got me pregnant but over some thoughts and fightings we decided it would be best for me to have an abortion. After that we fought even more. After a major fight about my anxiety and depression 2 weeks ago, he broke up any contact with me and he didn't give me the chance to apologize to him.
This all wouldn't be so bad if I had any other social contacts. I've been pretty much lonely all my life except for my partner. I also can't just visit him right now because we're in a long distance relationship (I'm in Europe, hes in the US). I just want him to hold me and give me the chance to at least apologize but since that won't happen anytime, I have to die tonight.
I won't find anybody else neither as a friend nor as a partner because I don't talk to people irl.
Goodbye
