I finally got the courage to ask for help and I LITERALLY DIDNT GET ANYSo I told my therapist on Monday how bad my depression had gotten and that I thought I needed to go to a psych ward. She agreed completely. But ofc everyoneâ€™s mental health is crap rn so all the good mental hospitals r full and Iâ€™d have to stay in this er psych unit with only a bed a tv and my mind to keep me entertained for like two weeks before I even got into a real psych ward so thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m doing that. Iâ€™m doing a partial hospitalization program rn but itâ€™s online and only three days a week rn bc the corona and Iâ€™m so bad bc I FINALLY ASKED FOR HELP BUT I CANT EVEN GET IT AND I HATE IT SO MUCH
