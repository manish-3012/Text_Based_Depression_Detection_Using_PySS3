I don't know who I am and I don't want to liveI don't even know who I am anymore. My girlfriend was incredibly upset with me because I'm trying so hard to be like her. I've tried to push away the things I like so I can be like her. I don't like who I am and never have. 

I've struggled with severe gender dysphoria since I was 8 years old. It causes me to hate my body and everything I am. I can't change anything about my body and I hate it. 

She's so open about everything and has two lesbian friends. Whenever we double date it causes me to hate myself even more. 

I hate it so much. I don't fit in with them. I'm not like them. I can't see myself as anything more than a disgusting man. All I am is a white male. And I hate that. 

My girlfriend is an atheist. I am a Christian. I want to be an atheist. But no matter how hard I try, I cannot become an atheist. It makes me feel small. I feel like less of a person. I feel so stupid and foolish. 

She held an intervention today and told me to stop trying to change myself because she doesn't like that. She wants me to be me. But I genuinely do not know who I am. Suddenly now I can't think of ways to impress her and I don't know how to be myself. I'm too afraid of what people might think of me. I'm far too afraid she'll leave me. Because before I started to try to mold to be like her, she loved me for who I was. But I don't know who that person is anymore. 

I just want to die and not have to deal with this. It isn't the first time it's happened. I feel helpless and hopeless. I'm doomed to hate myself forever. I just want to be free from this misery.
