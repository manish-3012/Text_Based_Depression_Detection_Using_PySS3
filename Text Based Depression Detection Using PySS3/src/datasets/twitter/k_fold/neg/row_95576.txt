I know this is dumb, but I can't stop thinking of other options I could have in life. It's terribly upsetting.I think of the time I should've told someone I wanted more help. I think of how that could've been good, but could also be bad. And my body keeps punishing me for the potentially bad thing. I see the worst outcomes of past scenarios, and my body hurts me. That time in elementary school where I made fun of that kid? There's another scar. Then there are times that I think of stuff like "What if I could've tried to help someone, but only made myself look dumb because I can't do anything right?" My bruise gets bigger. That last one isn't even based off of any thing and I still can't stop thinking about it. I think if I had to sum up my existence in one word it would be "upsetting". Everything makes me upset. I just recently saw a ladybug who looked crippled, it looked sad and its wing looked broken. I felt bad for it because it was in pain, but at the same time I'm terrified of bugs, so I couldn't do anything other than stare at it in agony. That was upsetting. I think of the time someone did something that was unintentional but still ended up being bad, and how they must feel after doing that thing unintentionally. So it ends up with me getting a shit end of the stick because someone else screwed up, and I still manage to feel sorry for them. Fucking hell. I can't function right. I'm not meant to exist here, it's like a freshwater fish in saltwater. I can't be normal. I can't do anything. I can't. I can't remember anything. "Am I supposed to take this pill? Or was it this pill? I think it was these two pills but this website says they interact poorly together. But the doctor prescribed me these. Your current pills aren't necessarily the best but they work, so I'll just continue taking the old ones." I ended up throwing up a pill because I thought it was the wrong one, it ended up being right. I live in filth. I'm afraid to put my feet on the ground because a rat could bite my foot. Not to get too emo, but I really feel like this sums up my experience recently "Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know,
Feels like I been down this road before.
So lonely and cold.
It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door.
Kinda feels like deja vu.
I wanna get away from this place I do.
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why? I just don't know..."
I can't handle anything. There is no point in taking my pills or going to a psychiatrist. It's just going to delay the inevitable. I will eventually slit my wrists or hang myself. Once I can make myself that is. It'll happen some day. Some day I can stop existing. I can stop worrying about everything. The only thing keeping me alive is my own ineptitude. I don't know why I make these posts. No one will read them, even fewer will respond, and fewer still will have anything meaningful to say. Sorry for the long post.
