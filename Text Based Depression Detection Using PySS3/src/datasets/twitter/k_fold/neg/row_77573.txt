ðŸ†˜It feels like I'm going to end my life but I always thinking of my family, if I kill myself I didn't want to see them crying all day long and fell sorry about me this quarantine I have no hope losing faith bcs i didn't go to school this year because of some financial issue and I started overthinking what if I don't have any future waiting for me, this week I'm always wish to be dead but I don't like brutal suicide I didn't want to go in hell I just need some peace of mind.
Oh God if I do this please accept I don't want to go in hell
