I'm getting ready to dieHi

I suffer from suicidal thoughts in periods, it comes and goes but once they dhow up they usually last for a while. I have commonly been afraid of death my entire life, I've constantly been struggling with existential thoughts ever since childhood, most often regarding death. This time around it's different however, it feels like a weight finally have been dropped off my shoulder: I accept the inevitability of death, that I will ceaseno matter what I do and that the likelyhood of it resulting in an eternity of nothing is overwhelmingly large.

It does not matter much if I die this year or as an old man, 50 years is nothing in a sea of eternity, not to mention that everything I was will be wiped out either way. I have no social life, no friends or love interests and I have no motivation nor will to have any either. The game of social hiearchy, belonging and personal connections no longer interest me - I just want to be left alone. There is no hope for me in ever leading a succesful life nor bearing a family of my own and to be honest there shouldn't be either.

Life right now is nothing but prolonged suffering, outdrawn suffering which result is always death no matter what happens. There was never a chance for me, I guess I always knew deep down but not untill now have I felt at peace with the idea of ending my life. I want to leave the world during summer at a nice river on a warm day. I like the idea of relaxing there for a while then never leave that moment, end it all in the midst of this serene beauty - a beautiful ending, I would like to give myself that.

Just wanted to leave my thoughts here, see other perspectives of my thought processes.
