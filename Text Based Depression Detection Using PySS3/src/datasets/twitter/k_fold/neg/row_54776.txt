Weird I will be dead soonI've never posted on this sub reddit before and I'm not really sure why I am - maybe just to say goodbye to anyone who will listen.

I'm in my early 20s and I've thought about killing for years, but now I am getting close to actually doing it now I have a trigger (losing my job).

There are many reasons why I want to go and the main one is that I am gay. I hate that I am and I never wanted to be. Another reason is that I feel so depressed every day that everything I do is such an effort. Nothing even matters anyway when you think about it. I'm definitely going to die so why does it matter when. It doesn't

 The method I have in mind will definitely kill me.  I've had enough. I'm just so tired. I've got to go now. Good bye.
