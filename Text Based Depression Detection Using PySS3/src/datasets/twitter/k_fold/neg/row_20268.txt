Going to be completely alone for xmasSo my life has been falling apart one small part (or not so small) at a time, I got my first criminal offence as I tried to kill myself and handled the situation with the police poorly and swore at them, other smaller things like losing my job, possibility of getting evicted, and on top of it all, because of the suicide attempt, not a single one of my family will return a text or call. I hate this and have no one. Worst part is I relatively recently moved to north east of England but I'm from Belfast so I don't even have my old friends to be with.

I Just feel so helpless. My life is truly FUBAR and I don't know what to do, I think the only reason I'm still alive is I'm too scared of actually dying but I'm certain I don't want to live anymore
