I donâ€™t want to go to college. I donâ€™t want to do anything.I wonâ€™t be able to handle college. My alarming amount of self doubt, insecurity, depression, low self esteem wonâ€™t allow for that. The process of getting in has turned out to be complete hell, but Iâ€™ll feel like Iâ€™m letting my whole family down if I donâ€™t follow through. Iâ€™m too immature do to what is needed to get into college and have a normal life. Iâ€™d rather bitch and moan about what I could have done than actually do it. Because thatâ€™s the type of person I am. A failure. I have no drive, no ambition to do anything of worth and I have no idea why. I have nothing to offer to society. So why should I live? Death suits me more as I wonâ€™t have to do anything. Iâ€™ll just be gone and wonâ€™t be a burden to people in my life anymore.
