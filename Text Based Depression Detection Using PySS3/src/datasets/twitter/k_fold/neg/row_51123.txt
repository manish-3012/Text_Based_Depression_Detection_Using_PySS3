It's killing meFor the longest time ever I've considered suicide. It's this thing that has bothered me for such a long time. It started in April. I was in horrible pain, more pain than you can ever imagine. 

There were a word in my head repeating it self, and as the weeks went by it got worse and worse, louder and louder. Where ever i went this was the only thing surronding me. 

At this point i am about to pull the fucking trigger, and end my life. I can't stand the pain anymore, It's too much for me. The only way i can see this pain ending is by ending my life. I hate my life. Because if i ever hear the word DESPACITO and that ugly fucking voice again I'll just kill myself.
