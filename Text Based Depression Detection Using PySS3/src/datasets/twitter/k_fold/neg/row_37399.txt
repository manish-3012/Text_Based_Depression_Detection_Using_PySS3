NumbI donâ€™t feel anything right now. Iâ€™m to depressed to even smoke weed and if I did Iâ€™d just have a panic attack. Everything is boring and uninteresting. I feel sick every time I wake up like I shouldnâ€™t be. I donâ€™t know if I can honestly do this much longer. Iâ€™ve called hotline and talked to everyone but I just canâ€™t do this much longer. Iâ€™m 18 and everyone says you have your whole life ahead of you but I donâ€™t want it. I donâ€™t fu***** want it. I canâ€™t even cry anymore. Everything just builds and itâ€™s unbearable. I self harm and canâ€™t bring myself to do even that anymore. Iâ€™m lonely, Iâ€™m tired, Iâ€™m disconnected, Iâ€™m done and I honestly want to lay in bed all day every day but I canâ€™t so I put a mask on and ware myself out faking myself through life...I just canâ€™t anymore itâ€™s too much. No meds Iâ€™ve been prescribed ever work and therapy feels pointless. Idk if Iâ€™m gonna be alive an hour from now honestly...
