Totally lost, thinking of ending it tomorrow.Background: One year and a 2 months ago I took a huge step for my life. Switched majors, moved back to my home country to try and hustle it all by myself... A year and two months later I'm lost. I had to get  my dad into rehab for the 12th time, this time I had to pay. Lost my job. Lost my income for school. And now I'm no one, just trying to figure everything out for the 3rd time in my life. Can't take it no more. Drawing shades as closing door on this one
