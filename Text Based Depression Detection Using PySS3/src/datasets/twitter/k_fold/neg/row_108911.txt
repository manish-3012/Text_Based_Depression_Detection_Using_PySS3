Suicidality makes me poeticI'm tired of livin this way, it's gettin harder to stay, tryna force a smile every time you say hey/
There's sorrow at sunrise, tears fallin out my eyes, I'm tryna write this list out of all of my goodbyes/
A wasted youth, a wasted life, and all I ever wanted was to be someone's wife/
But who could ever love me? This hopeless tragedy, but I get choked up still at all that could be/
Tired of hidin this pain, every day feels like rain, can't ever get these thoughts out of my fuckin brain/
But I don't really wanna die, I wish I was fine, I'd make sure I was never born  if I could go back in time/
Spent too many nights in tears on the floor, wish I had the strength to just string up the door/
Wanted to be so much more, than just some useless whore, I look at my life and wonder what is it for?/
I pray every day that I get hit by a car, or fall from some place where the bottom is far/
But it'd be such a mess, even a burden in death, just throw my body in the river let the fish do the rest/
Might not be today, might not be tomorrow, but I'm livin on time that already feels borrowed/
Who knows in time maybe I'll start to be fine, can't tell you how many times that I heard that line/
I tried all the advice, I think it'd be nice, if it were that easy but that's just not my life/
Swear if it weren't for my sister and how much I'd miss her, I'd be long gone, popped off like a blister/
Don't know how to end this poem, just like my life, guess I'll leave it open ended like a butterfly knife./
