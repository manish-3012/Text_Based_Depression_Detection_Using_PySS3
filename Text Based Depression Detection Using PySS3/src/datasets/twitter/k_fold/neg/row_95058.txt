Iâ€™m emetophobic which essentially means I have an irrational fear of vomiting. And I think Iâ€™ll kill myself if I were to get the fluI live in constant fear and I donâ€™t know what to do. I would seriously rather put a bullet in my brain than throw up. I know itâ€™s irrational but I canâ€™t stop it
