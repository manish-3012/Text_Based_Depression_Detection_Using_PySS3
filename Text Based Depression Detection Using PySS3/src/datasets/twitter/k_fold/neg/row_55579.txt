Should i kill myself if i'm clearly lacking basic skills for surviving/living in society?-I'm talentless, even if i'm creative and imaginative, always daydreaming or thinking something,there is nothing unique or special about me, and i can't put my creativity artistically be it by writing or drawing. 

-I'm unemployed, tried hard in this season(  beginning of the year) and nothing.

-In a high quality University but i feel really bellow-average here, had a exam today and messed up.

-I'm from a poor family, and fell like a waste of space and money in home.I'm adopted, son of two criminals.

-Being extremely anxious, i fear that i'll never get a decent adult life.

-I have five friends, some are struggling too but they are really above average in something, be it music, academics, crafting, technology or cartography.

-I lost my faith in religion some years ago, i just can't help but doubt everything, and i am very pessimistic to believe
in a good almight spirit, still i think of suicide as a sinful act cause it will be a waste of resources for my parents, that's why i'm posting.
