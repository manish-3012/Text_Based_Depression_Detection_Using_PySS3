Tired of feeling suicidal and lonelyI havenâ€™t had a friend in ten years. Im too shy,anxious, and cant open up to people. Nobody gives me the chance either. I want to die but im too scared to do anything. I know if im in the moment though i can snap and do dangerous things to myself. I cry out for help on fb and no one cares to respond. There is no good therapists here. I feel stuck living in the same place all my life. I told my bf if we dont move this summer its gonna kill my mental health. And here i am, already. Idk what to do
