I've become codependent on my best friend/girl I'm in love with, which has put me in a crippling depression and given me a lot of suicidal thoughts. I don't know what to do anymore, I've lost who I was.I've known this girl, Madison, for 5 years now. We became friends and became closer over time. Around September has been the start of it all I guess. We were both becoming kind of depressed and so hung out a lot. We both dropped out to take online school so we both spent a lot of time together, up to straight weeks with each other, which I guess is when I started falling for her.

After time, the more we hung out, the more she consumed my life. Everything I did I did for her. I started liking the things she liked, saying things she said. She became all I thought about and all I cared about. I lost most of my friends, because I just kinda stopped talking to them since I was always with her. I did a lot of stupid things for her. These past few weeks have been the worst. She has literally been the only thing I can think of. I can't think of anything else, it's become impossible. Watching tv, hanging out with people, listening to music, trying to sleep, it's only her and it's driving me insane. When I'm not with her I'm depressed, to the point where I can't sleep or eat. I don't have fun doing anything anymore unless she's around. When I'm not with her the depression sinks in so much I think about just killing myself to make all this shit end.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared, I'm scared I'm gonna lose her, scared I'm never gonna be ok again, scared that I'll never be able to just be her friend again, scared I've completely lost myself. I've thought about putting myself in the hospital for awhile to see if that might help me. I'll be forced to stay away from her, which will probably be good for me, and I'll get help. I don't know if going is a good idea or not though.
