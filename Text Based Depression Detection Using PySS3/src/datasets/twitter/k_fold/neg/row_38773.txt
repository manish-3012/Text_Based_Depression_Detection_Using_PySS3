In a dark place of planning and I need to talk to someone.As the post title says. 25 years old. My life's alright. I'm tired of being a depressed anxious mess is all. I've been here before but have had fluctuating coping abilities, been in a particularly dark place for the past month or two. I need a friend because I know it's getting beyond a reasonable point.
