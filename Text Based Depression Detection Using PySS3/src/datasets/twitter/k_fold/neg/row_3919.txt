No one care unless your posts are twitter length or shortereven this sub is guilty

the internet is all about being a digestible length, and if your rants and musings arent in so many words or less, no one gives a flying fuck about what you have to say. 

no one can be bothered to read through an essay about how miserable you are, or the advice you have for them, even though youve poured your heart out and felt like it had value.

i know that my feelings of isolation and hopelessness have been nothing but amplified from this sub and other ones like it. i probably place too much value on upvotes and comments, but i just really want a lot of people to relate to what i post. 

ive never once felt validated in what im going through. am i narcissist or something?
