My surroundings had enough of my threatsHelp me find the courage to do it. I sent an e-mail to my professor how i was doing. He was totally shocked when i told him i visited the cemetery and contemplated suicide. He sent this email to my therapist. He asked me to stop sending them threats because he is not guilty of my problems. Help me show that my therapist is wrong and that they were not threats. In the end the vast universe will collapse on us anyway. I myself don't understand why i'm still living.
