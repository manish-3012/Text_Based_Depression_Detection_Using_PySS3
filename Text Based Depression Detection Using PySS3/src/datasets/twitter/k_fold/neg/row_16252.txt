nye and alone. again.My entire friend group is hanging out tonight and theyâ€™re all sleeping at one of their houses. Every single one of my friends. Even my best friend. And they didnâ€™t invite me. But Iâ€™m looking at these pictures and fuck, Iâ€™m so sad. My little sister came home from visiting our grandparents- they asked my parents to send HER down and not me. She keeps talking about really sensitive topics and making little comments and Iâ€™m already dealing with my insecurities and sheâ€™s making me feel even shittier. I must be such a burden on my friends, and I hate myself. I really fucking hate myself. I feel so alone, and I have no one to talk to. My parents donâ€™t realize that they actually just make everything worse because they are so so so insensitive and the donâ€™t understand. They thought I was faking my depression at first until they caught me cutting. God I feel so alone and I wish I could die. I canâ€™t go through another year of this bullshit, but Iâ€™m not sure how to do it. Iâ€™d vomit pills, Iâ€™m not courageous enough to hang myself or slit my neck, and Iâ€™m too young to get a gun...
I have never posted to this sub so idrk what to expect but typing that out for a bunch of strangers made me feel a bit better.
