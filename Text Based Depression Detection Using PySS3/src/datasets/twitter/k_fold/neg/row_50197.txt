â€œIt gets betterâ€ â€œjust put yourself out thereâ€ â€œjust work on yourselfâ€. Itâ€™s all bullshit to try and stop me from killing myself.How fucking selfish can people be that they see a person who suffers enough that they want to die every day, and their first thought is to try and bullshit them into prolonging that suffering.

At what age is it acceptable for me to just kill myself because Iâ€™m a pathetic failure of a human being? There is no acceptable age to these people. Theyâ€™d rather I live a shit life solely so they donâ€™t have to have the inconvenience of feeling kinda bad when they hear I died.

Iâ€™m depressed. Unemployed. Mentally ill. Ugly as fuck. A virgin whoâ€™s never had a relationship. 

But hey, just keep pushing on through, youâ€™re only 10 years behind everyone else in basic fucking human experiences so far. Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll work out if you keep trying hahahaha

Well fuck that. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of failing. Iâ€™m tired of feeling bad all the time.

I hope I get the bravery to end my life by the end of the year. Iâ€™ve planned it so many times in my head already
