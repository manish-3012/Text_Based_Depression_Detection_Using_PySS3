How I wish I can dieYesterday, I nearly drowned at the beach. My friend saved me. 

So I went home, and did some reflections. So what I died yesterday? I can feel nothing. Even if I have regrets, I can no longer feel any regrets. My conscience, gone forever, in a few minutes. So what if there's pain? My lungs were filled up with salt water - it burns, but the pain does not last and I will have no memory of the pain. So what if I had things unresolved? I just die, I will never feel the future. My brain can never feel regret simply because I am dead. So what if I had never done anything worthwhile? I am dead - dead don't feel emotional pain. 

Death isn't so bad.
