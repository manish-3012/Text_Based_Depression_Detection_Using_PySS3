I feel like I have it too good to commit myself to a hospitalSince I don't know what it's like to be dead, I don't have any major desire to kill myself, but I don't necessarily like being alive either.

I am a sophomore at a good college (19 F).  I have friends and a social life.  I am involved in clubs and have decent grades.  I have a good relationship with my family and they care about me deeply.  Finances are hardly an issue.  Mental health issues are well understand among my family and friends and I've gotten an incredible amount of support from everyone around me.  

For some reason that neither me or any of my therapists know, I became cripplingly depressed in my Spring semester of last year.  Going home for the summer was of no help, and I still feel miserable to this day.  I've tried 8 different antidepressants and none of them have worked.  I feel absolutely hopeless and have an desperately want to turn to drugs or alcohol to escape this pain.

I absolutely dread waking up every morning to face another miserable day.  I feel like the only thing that can help me at this point is spending some time in a hospital where I'm completely safe and have everything I need.  I'm afraid to tell my family that I'm feeling this low.  I just want a solution.  If nothing has worked up to this point, what else will.
