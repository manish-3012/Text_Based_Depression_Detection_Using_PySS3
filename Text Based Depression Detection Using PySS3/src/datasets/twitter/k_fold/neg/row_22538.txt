Everyone said it gets better.For 10 years now I've heard that, and I've tried so hard to make it better, but ya know what it dosent get better it fucking never does. Fuck this shit fuck everything im tired of putting in all this effort into "bettering my life" and getting shit on at every possible moment. It gets better my ass, I live in a wasp infested house with mold and literally no money for food, if you had told me 10 years ago this is where I'd be now I would've just offed myself then. Im not going to do that now, but Jesus fucking Christ just let something please stop sucking. PLEASE!
