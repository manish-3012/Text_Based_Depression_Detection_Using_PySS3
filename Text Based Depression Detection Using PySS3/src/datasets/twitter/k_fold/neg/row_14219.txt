I'm a complete failureI was an A student, and now I'm lucky to pull C's. I have almost no friends, mostly because I pushed them all away because I became too scared to talk to them. Everybody I know has their shit together and I'm stuck with no energy and this hopeless feeling that won't go away and takes away all the purpose to anything I do. I'm alone and miserable and most of all I'm a complete failure and disappointment to the few people that still give a shit about me, and for three years, no matter how hard I've tried to change that, I fall right back into this hopeless feeling. I don't even have the energy to do basic shit like shaving and showering anymore. How am I supposed to keep getting through the days and putting up this facade like everything's fine?
