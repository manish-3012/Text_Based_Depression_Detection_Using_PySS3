I hate the stupidity of the human race. It's eating me alive.I don't know how to explain. I have sympathy for people, even understanding of their toxic behaviour. 

but ffs I just can't accept it. WHy the hell do you need neverending growth of economy, of population/slaves?  

Seriously what's wrong with balance? Do you realise your silly economy can only exists, because nature haven't told you sayonara yet? 

It should be Earth and lives first, economy later... Not the fucking other way around! 

NO Earth == NO economy... Why the fuck is this simple logic so unfathomable to narcissistic humans?  

Stop with this bullshit parasite mentality. If you kill your host, you're gonna die too. It's also simple logic, yet not for so called "very intelligent" humans... 

I just can't deal with this bs
