I'm done tryingI hate myself I always failed at everything I try to do either because I lose motivation or someone tells me that I suck at it, i've only had 1 relationship and it ended terribly both times we tried, it was the only time I felt good about myself and now I feel worse than before and just want to die but I'm also too scared to die. I'm tired of everyone telling me that things will get better because it doesn't and people telling me that they have had it worse than me.. I just want to feel cared about again..
