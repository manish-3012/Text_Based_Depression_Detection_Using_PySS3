There is no light at the tunnel. There is no tunnel and there is no light. You misunderstood.Things don't get better. Nothing changes. Everything around me makes me depressed. That doesn't change. That doesn't get better. What changes is how hard you cope. I don't want to live just coping forever. That isn't a life worth living. Nothing changes. You go into therapy for a hour and exit back into the same shitty world with the same people and friends that hurt you over and over. there isn't even a light. Either you cope or you die. That isn't light. That's a brick wall. if I think about my life for even a split second, well, it doesn't go good. What's worse is nobody sees or care. If your pain isn't visual enough then nobody cares. You need to justify your pain for people to give a damn. and then they do give a damn. And then they get tired of you because nobody wants to be around someone who is suicidal. Same reason people don't like being around annoying or mean people. They give off "bad vibes". I want to let go. I can't. I come home from work and all I have is myself. And I hate myself. I'm a bad person. I hurt people. I'll hurt you. I (don't) want to kill someone. No one imparticular. Just seems like the natural flow of my life. I don't think I can even comprehend taking a life yet I yearn to take my own life. There is no light worth walking for. You might as well stay in the darkness of the tunnel bc atleast you will have certainty of your situation. 

I don't want to kill anyone. I'm not a violent person. This is all just over dramatic emo mouth barf I've decided to post because I really do want to kill myself so I guess that statement is wrong. I do want to kill someone. Myself :)
