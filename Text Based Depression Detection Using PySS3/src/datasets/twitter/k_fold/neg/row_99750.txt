IdkItâ€™s something that comes to mind often. Everytime I feel this way I always google different methods of suicide or if thereâ€™s an article or blog post about someone else in a similar situation as myself. I found this Reddit group through one of my google searches. Sometimes I feel like I canâ€™t really tell my friends how I feel. I tried sending a cry for help to one of  my friends but I guess I made it seem too much like a joke and she didnâ€™t react. (I have a hard time taking myself and my emotions seriously when I express them to other people) calling a suicide hotline doesnâ€™t seem like itll help.. My mom has made me go to therapy two separate times in the passed but itâ€™s never helped. I really donâ€™t plan on living longer than a week... itâ€™s hard to imagine. But even then, I know Iâ€™m too scared to actually do anything... I donâ€™t want it to hurt and I donâ€™t want it to fail. Iâ€™ve found a few options but i donâ€™t have the resources.. I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m not sure how making this post is supposed to help me in any way but Iâ€™ll make it anyways.
