Chronically Suicidal Autistic GirlI've had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I've acted on those thoughts multiple times which all ended in trips to the hospital.

I've tried several therapists, medications, group therapy and yes I've even tried pot. Nothing takes it all away. I'm on disability so I don't work, I have one friend and a dog. I am diagnosed with "high functioning" autism or what used to be known as Aspergers, severe depression and anxiety.

I spend most of my days trying to distract myself from my thoughts with various forms of media: videogames, books, tv, movies, and podcasts.

My thoughts are really dark again lately and I wonder if I even matter. Why do I keep fighting this? I feel like a friendless leech on society. 

I know there are so many people who have it worse than I do but that doesn't help my depression. A lot of days I feel like I really want to die.

Thanks for listening. &lt;3
