Slept like shit. Went to the doctor. Now all alone. Still feeling suicidal.So a night's sleep didn't really make me feel better. I woke up feeling depressed. I went to the doctor to tell him the antidepressants weren't helping and that I tried to kill myself last night. He put me on a new antidepressant but I don't know when I'll be able to get on it because of the hoops we have to jump through with our insurance plus my family has no money right now so I may not be able to get on it for awhile.

Now I'm alone in this room. Plenty of ways to kill myself in here and it sounds like a very appealing thing right now.
