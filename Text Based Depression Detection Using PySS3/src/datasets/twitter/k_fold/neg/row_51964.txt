So here's my situationMy suicide date is my 22nd birthday which is a year and a half from now and things don't look look so good. I was bullied to hell and back in highschool and had very few friends. The ones i do have seem to leave and im left all alone again. I try to make new friends but im one of the most socially awkward adults in the world. I had a girlfriend at one point that i fell in love with. It was my first semester in college and things went great, i had even called off the suicide date. About 6 months in she took my virginity and things went bad from there. She eventually found someone else and left me. On the day she left i had bought a promise ring because it was almost her birthday and  i had things planned for us to do and just before i could give it to her she left. Its been almost a year since she left and i feel more depressed than i ever have in my entire life. Some say there are plenty of fish in the sea but why chase them if you cannot have the one you long for. Im still in love and i cant handle it. Yeah some people have gone through far worse and i'm just being a pansy about it but have i no right to feel this way? I took to using psychedelics like acid and shrooms and i take kratom daily. The mood boost from maengda kratom help but it just suppresses the  feelings and one the kratom wears off they come back and much much worse. My grandmother is dying as well from end stage COPD and i cant do anything about it and she's all i have left. My siblings hate me and left home at young ages. My mother is on drugs and my father is dead so once my grandma dies i will be all alone. My dream is to one day get married under the midnight full moon in the middle of autumn but my dream is a joke since im so fucked up in the head that no one want to even talk to me. I almost purposely crashed my car the other day. It just tempted me to, almost like the reaper himself was calling me. Help me
