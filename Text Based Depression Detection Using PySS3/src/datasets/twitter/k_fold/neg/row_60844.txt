I really donâ€™t know how to cope anymore and Iâ€™m thinking about ending it all tonight.I really canâ€™t do it anymore. I am so fucking confused what my emotions mean and half the time I canâ€™t even feel anything. Itâ€™s like my emotions just cut out. And then my therapist is a fucking asshole, all she wants is to get paid and never actually does anything. I have tried asking for a new therapist but my therapist always says she is the best one for me. I have been cutting and I just keep going, I only do it on my hips so no one can see but it is getting harder to stop myself from doing it elsewhere. I donâ€™t want anyone to know so they can stop me, I just want to be done. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore, I just want it over. No one cares I have tried to say things even to friends and all they say is how much worse their life is going to be. They donâ€™t care about the fact that Iâ€™m gone theyâ€™re just using guilt against me. Whenever I try to say something anymore even to my sister all she says is, â€œdonâ€™t say that itâ€™s not a jokeâ€ uh yeah I fucking know that I wasnâ€™t joking. I just want to be done with it all and experience the next great adventure. Iâ€™m not afraid of what comes after Iâ€™m afraid of dying I know it will be painful and Iâ€™m not sure how I want to do it yet. Please someone help me before I get lost in my thoughts and do it.
