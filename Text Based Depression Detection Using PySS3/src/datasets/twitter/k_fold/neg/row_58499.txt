I cannot understand what I am thinking or feelingI posted a couple of days ago about the toxic environment ar my home and how I have been suicidal for the past 4 months.

The thing is that I don't really know what I hoing through. I have started very mild self harm, I slap myself sometimes for no reason really hard a lot of times in a day. I feel like I am doing so just to convince myself that I am depressed, I feel like I am doing so only because other people do it. I don't know why am I feeling or thinking so. I think that I am not actually going through emotional distress and I am just pretending to be depressed and anxious and I that I am intentionally overthinking, All of this makes me think that I am a terrible person who is just a dumbhead. I feel like I am intentionally making myself sad and anxious. I don't know if this is true or not for real but the voice in my head keeps saying that I am faking it all just to not study. This all is making me scared and tense. I just don't know what's happening or I cannot understand what I am thinking for real or feeling for real.
I know most of this doesn't make sense but that is just the way I am thinking and feeling. Has someone else gone through something similar? Or is there anyone who knows what is happening with me?
