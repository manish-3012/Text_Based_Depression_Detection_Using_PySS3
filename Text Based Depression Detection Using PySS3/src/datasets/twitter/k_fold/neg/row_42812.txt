Things could have been good. I regret so much in my life.Relationships are the most important thing to me. And all of them are fucked up. I can never have a happy family.

My whole adolescence was so lonely. I wish I had friends and good memories from that time. There is almost nothing but loud arguments, fear of my alcoholic father, anger, isolation, exclusion by peers, emptiness, whole summers wasted inside, numb in front of a computer...I missed out on so much...and it was mainly my fault. I could have just been braver and left the house. But i had severe agoraphobia on top of everything and the idea of stepping out alone was scary.

I'm stuck at home with abusive family members. I am turning into them. I've become angry and bitter and violent.

I think about suicide almost daily. I don't know what there is to look forward to.

My parents are getting old, everyone i would ever love will die and i can't take any more weight in my heart. I have no support. I can't connect with people, i'm tired of feeling overwhelmed.
