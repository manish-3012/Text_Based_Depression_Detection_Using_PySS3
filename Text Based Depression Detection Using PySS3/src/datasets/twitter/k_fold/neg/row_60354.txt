Today I start the act againAfter 4 years I finally told my parents about my depression and suicidal thoughts. Now after three months of them knowing I'm getting sick and tired of the way they treat me. So today I start the act again. I'll be a healthy and happy person until they treat me like they used to. Though I have never been closer to wanting to kill myself. Luckily news hasn't spread throughout the whole family yet so hopefully the parents can just act normal soon like everyone else I know.
