I'm as close to certain as you could be that my plan would work, so whenever I choose to do it it'll be done for me.Actually 2 methods put together, both of which themselves are lethal. I have a very strong combo of 3 drugs, and then I'm gonna use a firearm too after I take them. Can't get the gun yet but I'm 21 in 13 days so then I can finally get a handgun and then it'll be over. I have the other things I need ready.


Once I buy it, it'll be what a week waiting period? Two?



So max a little less than a month left for me.
