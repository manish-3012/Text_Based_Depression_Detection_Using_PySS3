What do I doIâ€™m too scared to post anywhere else because I donâ€™t want pity, I donâ€™t want to seek attention I just want the pain to stop. I havenâ€™t seen anybody about my problems because Iâ€™m scared to tell my parents about me always thinking about suicide and being depressed. I just got in a huge fight with my best friend, and it always the same thing we get in fights over, that I cannot stand up for her. I am a pussy. I am too scared of confrontation that even when people are saying bad things  behind her back or to her face I canâ€™t say anything, Iâ€™m frozen with fear. The first couple times she understood but recently it is not an excuse. She is my only true friend and now I think Iâ€™ve lost her . She said she accepted my apology but she doesnâ€™t regret saying or acting the way she did (it was an in person fight) 

Not to mention Iâ€™m failing university and I donâ€™t know what I want to do with the rest of my life. I try but I never succeed.

Everything seems so pointless now. I donâ€™t have a SO, I donâ€™t have friends- I keep messing up all the time, I have a bad relationship with my parents. I am a burden, I recently got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes so itâ€™s costing my parents a lot of time and money to take care of me. I think that life would be better off without me in it. I know my family and my best friend would be sad but I just think that Iâ€™m a nuisance  to everyone around me. 

I donâ€™t think it will get better for me my life has been on a downward spiral for me since grade 10, Iâ€™m going into 2nd year university now. 

Thank you all and I hope everyone here gets better
