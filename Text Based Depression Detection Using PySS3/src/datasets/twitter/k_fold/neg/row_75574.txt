I've thought long and hard about where my life is going but I don't see any point in carrying onI got no one to talk to about this, they either won't care or just be too much for me to drop on them out of no where since I've been fairly good at hiding how I feel infront of others.

I just feel tolerated and never a part of someone's crowd, the last time I was told to be myself and that it'll get better ive become more self aware and more self hating and lonely, and I feel I can't blame anyone but myself. No matter how I try I'm never taken seriously, and just look like a stupid careless weirdo all the fucking time.

I haven't got much to live for other than another 60 years of work, I have 2 reasons to live and they're going to run out very soon, and to be honest I don't want to live through that when it happens.
