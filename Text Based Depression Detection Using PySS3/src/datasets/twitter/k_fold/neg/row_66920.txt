I will be dead within the next few days, strangers on the internet are all I have left.I guess this is just text on a screen and there's not much you can all do besides trying to make me feel better, and I respect all you people who comment to posts here, you're saving lives or helping others with their situations. Unfortunately some situations just don't have solutions. I'm only nineteen. I know what my future holds. Sadly, I and others destroyed this life. There is no recovery besides suicide. 

A human being can only handle so much. I have suffered so much... It won't be today, but my death will happen within the next few days. It's pathetic but having somebody empathize with my situation, even pity, it makes me feel even a little bit better. 

If you told me the first seventeen years of my life would be all right, eighteen would be the beginning of a spiral and nineteen would be a literal hell with no recovery, I'd tell you, shoot me right then and there. I'm very hellbent on ending it, it's not going to be an impulsive suicide, I've been thinking about this for months. It's terrible but I'm gonna throw myself off a bridge and be done with it. And if there is an afterlife, so be it. I was praying to God to send me back in time, but it doesn't work like that. I am so far gone, but I have just a shred of hope; everyday it dwindles away, and soon it will be completely gone.
