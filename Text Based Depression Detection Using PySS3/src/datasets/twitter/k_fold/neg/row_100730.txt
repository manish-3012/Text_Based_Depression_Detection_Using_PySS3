I attempted to end my life yesterday and i think Iâ€™m gonna try againSo I have attempted so many times before this and so I tried again yesterday I had done so much research so that it could finally work but no instead Iâ€™m just left with a mark on my neck and I have a bit of a limp in my leg (nothing too serious)I want to try again I didnâ€™t tell my parents about the attempt I know I probably should but I already know they are going to scream at me I did tell 2 of my friends tho but I lied to them saying that I had told my mum and dad even tho thatâ€™s a lie because I donâ€™t want to risk them telling my parents so Iâ€™m probably going to try and end it tonight or tomorrow night I just need to get this done life is just to hard
