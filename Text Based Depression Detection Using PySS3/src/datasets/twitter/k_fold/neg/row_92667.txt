No pointShe was my happiness. She was my world. She was all i wanted. I was going to kill myself before i met her. She changed that. I didnt even know it was possible to be so happy. It doesnt last. Things change. People love other people. That didnt happen to me. She saved my life. More times than i can count. I made it so hard for her. I made her cry so much. I did so many nice things for her and then made her cry. I hate seeing her cry. It tears me apart. Now shes gone. She saved my life but she isnt in it anymore. I should have died on that hospital bed. I should have died that day. I want to kill myself. I want to commit suicide and not be saved this time. Shes moved on now. Shes gets sad still. But not because she misses me. Because she knows im hurting but doesnâ€™t love me anymore so she cant keep coming back. I want her back. I want it to be different. I want to marry her. I want to be a parent with her. But thats not my choice. She likes someone else now. I lost her. And my happiness left with her.
