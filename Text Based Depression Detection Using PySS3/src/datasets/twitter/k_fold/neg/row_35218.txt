I have no support system in my life.Telling me I fucked up... isn't being supportive.... not when i realized it, and ma trying to move on.

Not making time for me when I need it, is not being supportive. I needed help clearing out my abusive ex's crap from my life, you were to busy to help, not even a single day out of a week, but ill be damned if you didn't demand my presence at your random bull shit.

When I called at 2am, because I had a PTSD type nightmare, where both of you had died, yelling at me.... is not being supportive. I woke up thinking you were dead. I called to make sure everyone was safe. I am sorry i had a relationship that left me broken, but saying i was calling because I was "lonely" is so far from the truth it hurts.

When I was working with a person on the psych unit, who had been raped, and heard the psychiatrist tell the parents that they have to be there and support their daughter, as she deals with major conflict and change in her life, all I could think of was how when I felt the way this child did, when it happened to me, I was not given that support, my mother blamed me, and basically said it serves me right.

You may help me out financially, and you may have provided for me. But in the long run, you have not given me the one thing I crave, real love, and support. It has left me broken. It makes it hard for me to get up everyday, it makes it hard for me to see a reason for life. If i don't have the love from my family, then who is going to love me? Who can I turn to when I get back flashbacks or nightmares, who can I share the good times with, or the bad. Suicide has been on my mind a lot recently. But even then, I realized, it could be days to weeks before anyone really realizes I am gone. No one would notice.I just don't matter.
