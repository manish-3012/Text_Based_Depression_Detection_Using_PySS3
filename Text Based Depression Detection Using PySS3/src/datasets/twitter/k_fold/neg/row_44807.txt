People claiming suicide is egoistic are egoistic themselvesSo you're telling me to not kill myself because I will destroy my parents' lives, maybe also my siblings' (I'm not even that close to them), my other close family members would feel miserable, my 3 close friends would feel miserable...But wanting me to feel like shit for the rest of my life so that I don't have to hurt others sounds pretty egoistic to me as well. I just think that if you truly love someone you would let them go even if it hurts YOU, it does't hurt them when they finally leave this earth, they will finally get their release. This might be a very controversial opinion but I think that if someone truly wants to kill themselves then you should support them and not make them feel like an egoistic piece of shit. That's the only reason why I just can't bring myself to do it. Everytime I want to do it I start thinking that I'm an ungrateful egoistic asshole for just wanting to fucking die. It's unfortunate I would make other people have to go through grieve but that's not my fault, I never asked to be born.
