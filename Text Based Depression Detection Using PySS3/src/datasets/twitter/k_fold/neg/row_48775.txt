this time last week i wrote a suicide noteand right now i want to rewrite it, and actually do something about it. 
i couldnt get away from people last week, but tomorrow i have the chance to try again.

secretly though, i just wish someone could be with me right now and stop me from feeling this. just sitting next to me and holding me close, telling me its going to be alright. a friend who i dont feel like im imposing upon, because this fucking depression is hard to carry and i dont want them to bear any load unless they can handle it. 

i just feel like i have no future, no goals, no potential happiness. the earth is breathing its last breaths, and we're all going to die so why not do it in a way i want beforehand.
