My best friend with various conditions is contemplating suicide and I am worried about him.Hi Reddit, 
I've lurked here for years, but never contributed.
I wish I could've contributed something before this, but unfortunately I'm a bit short on time, and can only ask more of you all. 
Please give me some advice.

My best friend is and has been undergoing huge stress. He has been diagnosed with various conditions including mTuberculosis and Schizoprenia. His family is extremely poor as well, to the point where his mother steals things like paper towels because they can't afford it otherwise. His parents also argue and fight frequently, and his other relatives don't treat him well either.

He says his dreams last for months and years and are usually filled with death or pain. Apparently I'm his only close friend as well. This isn't the first time he has been like this, but recently he said he's been rethinking me as his best friend. I'm hurt by this, but I still consider him to be my best friend, and want to find some way to help him. 

He's contemplating doing something dumb like overdosing or going to the police station with a weapon, because he can't find a reason to live.

I'm really bad with giving advice. I can't think of any reason for him to continue living other than the fact that people will be sad, which is... honestly, very weak.

Please don't upvote this. He browses reddit, and I don't think he wants any pity or anything of the sort. Just please, give me some advice. 
I don't want my friends to end up in some extremely bad situation.
