I'm thinking of suicide latelyI always feel like there is a black liquid inside my chest that keep increasing. I can't think of any cure for that. I can't listen to music or watch a movie anymore and these 2 things have always been my only hobbies. I get distracted by my thoughts. and I always imagine myself as a different person. I feel happy when I'm doing this. After returning to the reality I hate myself more than ever.
