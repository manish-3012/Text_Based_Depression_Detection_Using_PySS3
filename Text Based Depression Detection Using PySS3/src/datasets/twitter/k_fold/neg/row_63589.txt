I keep thinking this week is finally the time to go. My life is ruined.My life is over. I was a social work student getting As, volunteering, advocating for survivors of abuse, and in the middle of a three year custody fight. After my I picked up my daughter from school she started yelling at me for being 10 minutes lates. There is a long history of her treating me poorly. I was driving the car and hit her with the back of my hand and got her in the boob. First time I ever hit her, and there was badly a mark.â€™ Slightly discolored nut but not noticeable and definitely not abuse. She called 911 and started fake crying on the phone. I was charged with felony child abuse with barely even a mark. I donâ€™t feel what I did was abuse. 

My life is ruined. I lost the custody case and was ordered to supervised visits. I have to pay child support, her fathers attorneyâ€™s fees, and all the guardian ad Litem feeâ€™s. I wasnâ€™t there to fight it in court because I was in the state mental hospital after I was found incompetent to stand trial. Her father terrorized me for years and I got no justice at all. There are so many other things but this is the main one right now.

I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Iâ€™ve been through too much and now I have a life ruining charge. My mother shit herself because I was going to speak out about her abuse- she did it for nothing. I canâ€™t be a social worker, foster parent, or advocate like I was.â€™

Iâ€™m ruined and I donâ€™t want this life anymore.
