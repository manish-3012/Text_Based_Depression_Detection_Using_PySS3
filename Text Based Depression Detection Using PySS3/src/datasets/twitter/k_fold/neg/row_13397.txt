CowardI feel my will to die is stronger than my will to live yet whenever I try I am not strong enough. I tried again tonight for the second time in 6 months but stopped because I live at home with my mother and don't want her to be the one to find me, I go outside and I can't think of anywhere good to do it so stop in my tracks. Has anyone else have this problem? I feel it would be much easier if I had a gun or access to something where that I would have no time to fight myself.
