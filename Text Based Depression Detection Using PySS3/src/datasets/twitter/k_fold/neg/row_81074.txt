What is all the fuss about...When we die we all go to HEAVEN!   Even if one commits suicide and if you ask for forgiveness then "HE" will forgive you. So what's the point!  I sit here and day after day I listen to people rant about GOD. The president, the corporations, my so called friends, family, just everybody.  If there was a GOD, this place would not be like this.  


Just follow the rules and you will be "OK" .  It is all bullshit - all of it.  Just read the headlines, U follow--- There is enough food to feed the people of the world, but do we do it. NO  WE WAR-WE LIE-we are just a bunch of evil people.  

Yea there are some good people but it is just not worth it anymore.  I can not wait to leave this place.  

Oh by the way- called the hotline number =  they need more help than I do.
