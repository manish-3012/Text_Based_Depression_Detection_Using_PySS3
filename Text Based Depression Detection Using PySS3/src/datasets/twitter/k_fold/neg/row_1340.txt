I want to dieI got into a heated argument with my dad, long story short he told me to kill myself. I told him that I would. I've been thinking about committing suicide for a while (since I was 14, now I'm 18) but my mother started screaming at me that I'm being selfish and shit like that. 
I hate myself way too much. Death seems like the only way for me to stop being a burden to everyone.
The only thing that's keeping me alive at this point is my boyfriend. And that's it.
