Friend said he is considering suicide last night but won't get help. What can I do?So, I have an old friend who just moved back to Portland, from NYC. He has always had problems with depression, and sort of thought this move back to PDX would solve them. But he is actually depressed; so as you can imagine, moving didn't solve the problem. He talked to me last night and said he was thinking about suicide. I'm trying to get him to go to a walk-in psychiatrist today but he doesn't want to. He thinks moving back to NYC is going to make things better, but it won't. I'm worried about him and don't know what to do.

I made an appt at ZoomCare for 5:00 (2:40 from now) and am basically trying to force/guilt him into going because I dont know what else to do. I'm not the best with gently coercing people to do things, I'm more like blunt and deliberate because that's just how I am and I know that might not be the right solution here but I can't think of anything else to do. Calling the police etc will make him angry and cause him to stop confiding and possibly make things worse so I am at a loss.

Any recommendations? :( I really want to help my friend, he has been there for me a lot through the years and I don't want him to do anything to hurt himself. I know he just needs depression care but I dont know how to go about convincing him to do it. He said he went once in the past and they gave him some meds that made things way worse, and now he doesn't trust it at all. But I know it sometimes takes multiple tries to get it right, everyone's brain chemistry is different. Help :(
