Lets Talk NumbersThe way i see it, i have a high chance of succeeding in school as i have slightly about average intelligence. after that i have an ok shot at getting a job in the field i want to go into (programming/pen testing)  as its a new and quickly growing field. Then it starts to go downhill, i more than likely will not make that much money because of 1). im shit at programming and despite my best efforts have never gotten any better and 2). there are alot of people going for jobs in that field and due to the basic principal of supply and demand this will drive down wages. next thing to worry about is social relationships, these have a very slim chance of ending up well for me as im a fat loser with crippling social anxiety. and to top things off i have a incredibly low chance of enjoying any of this, i haven't enjoyed anything i have done in over a year and nothing ive done has seemed to help this. It seems to me like i have to roll a 20 to end up in a life that is even remotely worth the effort i would have to put in to get there, my choices as of right now are A). Roll the dice and hope for the best or  B). take a 9mm aspirin and never have to worry about  it again. im here looking for reasons not to chose option b as i have stopped being able to think of them.


sorry for the long post im shit at formatting ^(and most other things)


as a side note ive talked to 4 therapists/psychologists and am currently not in school and on antidepressants but nothing is helping me.
