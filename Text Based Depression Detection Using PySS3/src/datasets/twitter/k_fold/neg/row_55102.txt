Do I have a Plan? Of course I have a Plan...I hate this question.  I get to the edge, I am obviously depressed.  I have a history of depression. I am bipolar.  Then they start down commitment lane.  "Do you have a plan?" I can't convincingly lie about a plan.  It feels like it is up on the JumboTron of my life.  On my forehead for everyone to see.  After one failed attempt I admitted to a shrink that I couldn't face the idea of pills going wrong and ending up sick or a veggie.  I live in a state with strict gun laws, 4 hours from the most pro-NRA state in the union.  I realize I could drop the kids at school and be done before lunch, and on one tank of gas.  "Do you have the means?" Sort of. Sometimes I don't. It depends on whether I've just gotten paid.  And we are pretty paycheck to paycheck.  The money thing always really puts the squeeze on my brain.  But if I just accepted that I wasn't going to pay the bills, I'd have "the means." Just accept that I was going to leave the family without lights.  That makes me feel really shitty. How do you plan a nice suicide?  I already feel unimportant.  I don't want to leave a crater.  Anyway, this is tl;dr already.
