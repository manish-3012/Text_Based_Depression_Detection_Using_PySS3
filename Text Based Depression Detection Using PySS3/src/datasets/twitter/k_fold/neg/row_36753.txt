I have no purpose other than starvingIâ€™ve been suicidal before I even knew what suicide was. I also developed anorexia over a dark time in my life and Iâ€™m recovering. Whenever I feel the pants of hunger Iâ€™m tempted to live longer to grow skinnier. Only when I feel hungry do I feel I have purpose. Canâ€™t be skinny if youâ€™re dead
