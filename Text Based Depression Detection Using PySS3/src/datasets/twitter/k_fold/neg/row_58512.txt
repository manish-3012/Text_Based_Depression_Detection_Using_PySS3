in agony.this is gonna be really unorganized, i apologize. 


Iâ€™ve been drowning in agonizing pain ever since I can remember. Iâ€™ve always tried to hold on and look ahead and itâ€™s never been worth it. How can I trust that it will get better?? 

I hate every single part of myself with every ounce of my being. It feels like everything about myself isnâ€™t right. Like this body or life wasnâ€™t meant for me. like the person I am now isnâ€™t supposed to me be. It isnâ€™t me. Iâ€™m trapped in a body and in a life that isnâ€™t mine. It hurts so bad. I hate my height so much. I constantly stress over it. I wish I was short like 5â€™0 tall. I canâ€™t stand up without wanting to cry or hurt myself. I have this desire to feel protected and small because It makes me feel safe. Something I donâ€™t have much experience feeling. 

I hate my face, my body, my personality.. etc.. 
Every time Iâ€™m around people I analyze everything I did wrong and I feel Shit. So I just donâ€™t anymore. And even when I did it was a one in a while kind of thing. 
(Sorry is that doesnâ€™t make much sense) 

Every night Iâ€™ve been praying to god that I donâ€™t have to wake up the next day. That by some miracle I wouldnâ€™t have to exist in this world anymore. 
I hate the way the sun shines through my window in the morning. I hate the beating of my chest. I hate the little things that remind me that Iâ€™m alive. That Iâ€™m me. 

I have tried committing die once before and I didnâ€™t do it right, Which is why Iâ€™m still here unfortunately. I would try again and I want to but itâ€™s so much work. And what do I do if it doesnâ€™t work again? Go through so much more shit that I donâ€™t even want to think about. Medicine, hospitalization, treatment centers, more therapy, more medicine. Iâ€™ve tried 14 medications over the past year and a half/2 years and none of them have worked. 
I just wish I never existed. That I never had the chance to be alive so that I didnâ€™t have to experience the pain of being me. 

I told my mom that I hate her for having me. For making me exist. I feel bad but itâ€™s true. Iâ€™m so mad at her and my father. Being alive is incredibly demanding and exhausting. 
Every single morning I wake up I want to cry because itâ€™s another reminder that I have to continue on as me. And I hate being me. I hate it so fucking much. My life is excruciatingly grueling. Every day is a nightmare. Itâ€™s been like this since childhood. Ever since I can remember. 

Iâ€™ve cut myself off from everyone except for my parents, my sister, and my therapist. I have no contact with anyone else. I figure itâ€™s best so that people donâ€™t have to deal with me anymore. I just want to disappear. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t want to do anything anymore. life is so exhausting. 

I wish I knew why I exist. 
I wish I had an answer for why Iâ€™m in so much pain.
