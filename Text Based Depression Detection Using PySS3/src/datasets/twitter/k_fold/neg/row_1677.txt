Suicide is always on my mind. But its hard for me to go through with itPart of me wants to just die and not exist. The other part is afraid of not existing. I'm afraid of going away forever. I don't know if a next life is a safe bet. Would i even be happy in an afterlife? 

There's so many thoughts that are always racing through my mind. Im scared of killing myself because of how much it may hurt. I can't think straight with this contradiction. But I do want to be happy. I just dont want to try anymore. Not for anyone and even less for myself
