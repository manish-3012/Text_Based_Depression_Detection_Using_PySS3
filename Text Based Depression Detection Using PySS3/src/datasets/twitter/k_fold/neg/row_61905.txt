Odd romance with suicideI have a strange problem. For as long as I can remember I've thought of suicide, and the idea was always strangely romantic and comforting, as if it was a sort of last resort. I've read books on suicide, watched movies, become a sort of expert on the subject. How sad, I know. I never fantasized about how people would miss me, or anything so childish. Just the obliteration of the self seems to call to me. Pure self destruction, complete and eternal. I don't have any illusions about leaving a good looking corpse, and I've looked at gruesome accident and autopsy photos to deglamorize it. 

When I was younger I made two serious attempts; I was able to cover them up as accidents, though I did land in the hospital for some time. 

That was 20 years ago, and I feel stronger now, I have a lot to live for, I don't want to kill myself. Yet the romance is still there. I want it out of my life forever. What should I do?
