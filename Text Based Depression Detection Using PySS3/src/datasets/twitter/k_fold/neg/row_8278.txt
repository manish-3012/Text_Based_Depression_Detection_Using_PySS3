I need helpToday some teachers came into the classroom to talk to the students about a guy in our class, some kids were calling him gay and stuff for the pass month. But this guy was also bullying me and some other kids, he was in my class last year and called me a Lesbian. I have absolutely nothing against the LGBT+ community, but this pissed me off. I was called a whore and other things through out the year, I told teachers on two times. Nothing was done, I gave up this year. The guy insults my art, and my weight, sometimes we could hit each other. I tried being his friend for a while I felt bad that he was being called gay, I became his personal punching bag for a while. Today was my breaking point, I wondered where were the teachers when I was being bullied. When I was being hit, when my sleeve fell as it showed my cuts. I know I sound selfish, and itâ€™s not all about me. But I seriously was mad, I cried in the classroom and went to the bathroom. I had a breakdown. I donâ€™t understand was my suggestion not as important, I know there are many kids with bigger problems but still. Many people might be asking â€œthen why donâ€™t you ask for helpâ€, because I doubt myself. Because if I say something I feel like Iâ€™m being selfish, heck even writing this makes me feel like Iâ€™m just hungry for attention. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m on a higher dose of pills, Iâ€™ve been thinking about death more. I donâ€™t say anything because, I feel like part of me is just waiting for something to push me to my breaking point. Something that will end all of this. Iâ€™m stilling hurting myself, itâ€™s frustrating that everyone thinks Iâ€™m getting better when Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m not getting better, people think itâ€™s ok to put me in a crowd full of people. Thinking I wonâ€™t panic, hey youâ€™re wrong. Everyone is wrong, not a single person gets it. I tired of living, in tired of dealing with people that at the end of the day will just leave you. Thereâ€™s not a single person in this world that i trust. Iâ€™m better of dead.
