Getting kicked out.Iâ€™m 18f and my parents are threatening to kick me out. Iâ€™ve been struggling a lot lately with worse depressive thoughts, self harm etc. and I have been going to school on and off. Itâ€™s hard. I have a job but I havenâ€™t started it yet. I try to talk to them about this, but now theyâ€™re just saying to get the fuck out of their house and find a full-time job because theyâ€™re convinced Iâ€™m a drop-out, which Iâ€™m not. Itâ€™s been like this every year, but now that Iâ€™m 18 theyâ€™re pretty much pressuring me to just give up. I donâ€™t have a car or my license, I donâ€™t have any friends to stay with or family. Iâ€™m screwed, and all I can think is the only solution is to just kill myself. If they kick me out, thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m done with this, I canâ€™t be fixed.
