I'll never find anyone. Why even try.I'll preface this by saying this is a throwaway account and if anyone tells me "It's okay to be a virgin" or "You'll find someone" or stories of how you lost your virginities then fuck off. 

I'm literally the only person out of all the people I know who's still never had a girlfriend and is still a virgin. People tell me not to worry about it but all they do is patronize me. I'm nineteen and I just keep seeing stories about people younger than me finding happy relationships. Wherever I go, it's everywhere. 
Just today I thought a girl I was gonna be with - even made out with her - told me we're better off as friends. In other words, what I've heard for the past three years. I refuse to live a life all by myself. 

So I'm fucking done. I'm giving it ten more years to find someone who'll give me the time of day or I will jump off a bridge. I will jump off a bridge and there is NOTHING you can do to stop me. 
I'm done. Fuck this shit.
