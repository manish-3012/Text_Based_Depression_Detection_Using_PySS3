Help me understandMy name is Calvin and I'm 16 years old... I don't know how to slowly get Into this. My grades are fine, but my history teacher (also football coach) failed me last semester. I've grown to believe he's bias an only passes his football students. I don't appreciate that. I really want to know why I was born. My mom dated a guy, had sex, and had a kid at 15 years old. Then years later, she married my dad, had sex, had me, and then they divorced. Now she's been with this other guy for 10 years, and she says she regrets it. And I don't appreciate that. I want to help her decide for things, but she says I'm young and makes me feel like I'm stupid. She takes my advice as an insult, and she just hates me for it. Then I thought of why she wanted to have me. Did she think about having me even though she knew she wasn't at a good condition to do it? Did she think about how I would feel about my future with her? All I know is she obviously wasn't ready to have another kid (me). And when I try to ask her how she decided to have me, or ask her why she made her bad decisions, she doesn't want to tell me. She hates me, she doesn't care about me anymore. And the more I think about why she had me without thinking about how I would feel, it makes me realize how selfish she might have been, maybe I was an accident, maybe she wanted to just have sex. I just want to end my life because when I try to benefit, its considered an insult. And I don't benefit anyone right now because whatever I say, its taken differently than what I intend it to mean. My mom doesn't love me, I don't love me. She can't provide for herself, she can't provide for me. WHY DID SHE HAVE ME??? I DON'T WANT YO LIVE ANYMORE!!!! 

If there are any questions just ask. Just please help.
