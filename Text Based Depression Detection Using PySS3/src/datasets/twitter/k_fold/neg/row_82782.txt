Its so hard to do itI'm 18M suffering from OCD and depression for the past few days it's been a literal nightmare as my mental illness wouldn't let me sleep or be happy I'm just so scared and have extreme anxiety I tried to hang myself with a belt but my instincts took over I tried jumping from the highest roof but I got scared and stabbing myself would be messy and painful I keep thinking about my friends and family it's so painful I hate it
