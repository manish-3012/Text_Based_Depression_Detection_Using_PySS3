Iâ€™m a 20 year old college student who has failed hard so far.I have extreme anxiety about my future, I feel totally unimportant to the people I used to feel so loved by, and I wake up every day feeling incredibly depressed. I hate this. I used to be one of the happiest people I knew, and now I literally cannot think of one good reason why life is worth living.
