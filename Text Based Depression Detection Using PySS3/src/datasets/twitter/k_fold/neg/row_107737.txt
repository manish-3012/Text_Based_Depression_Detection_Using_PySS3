FuneralsWhen Dad passed he already had a marker made for his grave. Made from wood. I want to honor him properly with a plaque.

When my mom passes, i dont think she (or my siblings, for that matter) will be able to afford her funeral. I'm also going to save money for her.

I'm also saving for my own.
