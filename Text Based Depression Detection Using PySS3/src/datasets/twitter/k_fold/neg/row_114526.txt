I guess if you post here you donâ€™t want to really die...But itâ€™s becoming so hard, the weight of life is literally crushing me now. Im so alone, yet I donâ€™t want to be round anyone either, I have friends, I have health, Iâ€™m intelligent, attractive, my own place, successful in my field (writing) so why am I so ungrateful and just want to end it all?! I had a major gambling addiction losing 32k 2 years ago but been clean 2 years and lost my mum to bone cancer when I was 23 (nearly 42 now) but Iâ€™ve got through all those really bad times. I really miss my ex and never got to explain the reason behind him dumping me by telephone after 4 years. I ended up with a restraining order last year and 3 month suspended sentence as I just needed closure so wanted 5 mins of his time to look him in the eye and explain. I have borderline personality disorder and major abandonment issues and this is still eating me up beyond caring about restraining orders anymore. I feel like everyone I give my heart to just rips it up and stomps on it and Iâ€™ve tried to find someone the last 2 years but itâ€™s just hopeless. April 2017 I was on the ledge of the 10th floor of a multi-storey car park and as I pushed off police who had snuck up because of cameras grabbed by coat and pulled me back, I quit gambling that day and and was so grateful for them giving me a second chance, these days I just resent them. Iâ€™m so angry I stab a pillow with a knife and scream into it. I took drugs and alcohol to mask the pain but nothing works anymore. Iâ€™m only living as I couldnâ€™t put my sister through it mainly. 

I could really do with someone to talk to as if I call 111 in UK theyâ€™ll just send an ambulance and put me in care of mental health facility Tooting, which Iâ€™ve been in 3 timeâ€™s now and thatâ€™s not helping anyone.

If anyone can reach out and talk to me Iâ€™d be grateful. Iâ€™m not going to kill myself but feeling crushed by the weight of stopping myself every day is really hard.
