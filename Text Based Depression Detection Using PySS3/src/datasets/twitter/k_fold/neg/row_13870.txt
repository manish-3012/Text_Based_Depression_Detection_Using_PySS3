I hope they forgive me for ending my pain. Will they?I hope my 2 cousins/ old and new friends forgive me for ending my pain. They are so great to me. I'm so appreciative, but I don't know if I can make it past June at this point. I hope I can. 
I hope people forgive me, and I hope they remember the good times instead of the negative ending. I simply can't shake the feeling of being a burden on everyone. My death will be less of a burden than me being alive. I know this feeling of blaming myself isn't rational, but I can't shake it, and it's so painful with everything else .
