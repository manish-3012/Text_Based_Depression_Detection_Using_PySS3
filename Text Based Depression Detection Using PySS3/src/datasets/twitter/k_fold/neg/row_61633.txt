I am lost, please talk to meI have become what I decided to work as hard as possible to never become. One day when I was a teenager I spoke with a guy in his thirties and he was really struggling with money, driving a car that looked like it was ready to be retired, and just generally unhappy with life.

That moment burned itself into my mind. I decided to go to college. Work as hard as possible in my job. Eventually graduate and move up to some sort of white collar position. I wanted to experience life and make sure I wouldn't have to struggle with money like I did when I was younger.  


It didn't happen. I couldn't make it happen. I had a couple failed relationships, the last one really seemed like it was going to be the one that led to marriage. We both were on the same page. I blew it though. I can't keep up with relationships. I can't provide girlfriends with the attention they need. I can barely fake it. I reach a point where I lose all focus and just self destruct. 

I do this with jobs too. I put forth everything I have in the beginning and get noticed and apply to advance and usually do. Then after about a year something happens and I sabotage myself. Show up late. Call in too much. Those are the main ways. 

Eventually I'll get fired. Then I'm in need of a new job, however, this is my main problem; I don't apply for anything. I have a mental problem I think. I always wait for an opportunity someone comes to me with and it's usually something terrible, but I don't feel worthy of anything else. 

I couldn't make it on my own. I'm back at my parents and in a downward spiral. I don't do well in my hometown. I am falling apart and can't get my failures out of my head. My best friend of over 20 years seems to be moving on. 

I hate what I have become. I hate me so much.
