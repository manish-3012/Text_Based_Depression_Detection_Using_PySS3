every time i make a mistake, he takes it out on my momi am 15m, a very flawed person, and to be frank, i fuck up all the time. specifically my life skills are very underdeveloped because of how my parents raised me. my dad blames this on me playing video games and whenever i make a mistake usually related to life or any small thing in particular, heâ€™ll take it out on my mom. heâ€™ll yell and scream, threaten to kick her out or smash my things if hes super angry, but most hurtfully heâ€™ll degrade my mom, brother, and me. this led to me and my brother having depressingly low self-esteem and self-worth, leading to me becoming a cutter and my brother developing an eating disorder. i want to end my life often so that my mom doesnt get verbally abused... iâ€™m too socially awkward to go anywhere in life anyways, and Iâ€™ve done everything Iâ€™ve wanted to do (by the age of 15 believe it or not).
