fuck itI was raped in my freshman year of high school. I'm currently a senior, and I'm finally getting angry about it. my rapist was a stranger, about 10 years older than me, and he took my virginity. I ended up switching schools for my sophomore year. it really fucked up a lot of things in my life. right now I've been having a lot of issues with sex, and I don't know if it's just because I'm depressed, or if it has something to do with the rape, too. I don't know anything anymore, really. I'm just tired as fuck. I can't believe that I was raped. jesus christ, I wish it had never happened
