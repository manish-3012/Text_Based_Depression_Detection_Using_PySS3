Working with depressionMy mood is becoming worse and worse at work, before I used to be pretty good at faking happiness, but with 15 days left, Iâ€™ve been so miserable at work, it doesnâ€™t help that all my colleagues are in good moods, I know itâ€™s difficult for them to work with me and I know they hate it, it doesnâ€™t help that I work in retail which goes without saying how much of a shit show that is, does anyone have any tips for working with depression?
