I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m going to make it through this year, or this monthI have a plan. I havenâ€™t gone through with it because my cousin is over. I think I will once she leaves. Iâ€™m tired of being alone. Even when Iâ€™m around others I feel like a miserable little bitch, I still feel alone. 

Guess I could say itâ€™s me giving up, Iâ€™m just lonely, Iâ€™m homeschooled so Iâ€™m constantly alone, and when Iâ€™m around others itâ€™s my friends from my religion, and all I can think about is how Iâ€™ll lose all worth in their eyes once they find out Iâ€™m gay. Being alone constantly feels torturous, sorry if thatâ€™s over dramatic but Iâ€™ve been homeschooled since I was 10 or 11and Iâ€™m 15 now. My current goal is to survive till Iâ€™m 16 but thatâ€™s January 22 so Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™ll do after that. 

Once my cousin leaves Iâ€™m gonna go back to being alone and I dont know if Iâ€™ll be able to handle it. 

I have a therapy appointment tomorrow and I dont know if I should tell my therapist I have a plan or if itâ€™s make things worse.
