I dont know what this is. Last ditch effort perhaps?So I'm a twenty-something working in the sex industry. One of my mates died a bit ago and we talked about it before they went, not extensively, but enough. I've never been completely homeless, but its always in the back of my mind. Work is tanking. Maybe its because I'm not trying as hard, or maybe my meatsuit is showing its age. I don't want to stop. 

HIV/AIDS is scary. Last test came back negative, but its really only a matter of time. Sometimes I wish I was, if only for the suspense to be over. 

I am not okay.  I'm too depressed. I know what suicide does to people. Its really tough on everyone who was close to them.  The blame, regret, pain, feeling like it had something to do with what you said or did somehow aided in solidifying their resolve. The fighting over what little they owned. Picking up mannerisms they had in a subconscious effort to keep some small part of them alive. Getting angry at old friends for not being able to relate. severing ties because it hurts too much. Waiting for them to walk in the door and smile, so your heart can melt just one more time. Trying to fix or mask the pain so you can get through the day without breaking down.  It will probably destroy the people who care about me, if any of them are still left.

I don't even know why I'm writing this. I'm tired, old, and burnt out. I'm still human though, so maybe I want answers that don't exist. Maybe I just want someone I can relate to.

 I've done a lot in my lifetime. Maybe not all the things I wanted when I was little, but I'm okay with that. I know I'm not the first, and I wont be the last. My biggest fear is that I wont get to pick where and when I die.
