I think I'm going to kill myselfI'm so depressed these days every day is a struggle I quit my job because I was depressed working there and now am just even worse being unemployed my sister like left our house to live at a friend's for a while because her and my mom haven't been getting along and I barely even talk to her our relationship is damaged and it kills me. I have no clue what I want from life but I do know I don't want to fucking continue I'm not going to go the way of pills or wrists if I do the anticipation will be to much I think I want it done quickly.

I just feel like I have nothing to offer this world and being alone doesn't help I have friends but really how much of friends are They? They don't care what is really going on people are ignorant a few friends asked me what's up and I straight up said I am more depressed now than ever and people just laughed it off like I was joking or something? I know I'm alone and I can't talk to my family cause were all so distant and I don't want to worry my mother more than  she already is with my sister. I would have done it already if I could get over the fact that it would destroy my family probably my mom and sisters life 100%. I don't know
