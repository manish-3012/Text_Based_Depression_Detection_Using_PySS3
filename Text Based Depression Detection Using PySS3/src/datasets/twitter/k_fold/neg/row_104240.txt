I just want to talk to someoneI originally started writing a long post here practically my life story but it just felt like to much and it was taking forever so really to be honest all that you need to know is that I'm a completely a isolated 22 year old male living with his parents. My family loves me but I'm depressed and have all sorts of issues with mental illness. I feel completely alone and worthless, I moved away to another state last year and in my new town I have no friends and I took this semester off of community college because I was really depressed and I wanted to focus on other things. It's complicated but I'm obsessive and hate the things I do. I have shit self esteem yadda yadda. I know all the advice people give, I've read all the self help stuff, all I want is to not feel so empty and lonely. I wish my self worth wasn't defined by other people, I wish I didn't get jealous, I know those are normal things but my ocd symptoms make it so much worse. This isn't  exactly the post I had in mind don't want to sit here forever editing and changing it.
