I'm afraidI am afraid of the fact that we will all inevitably die one day. I often stay awake at night because of my thoughts on this.
I want to die, but I'm afraid of death.
I want everything to just go away, yet I don't want it to.
I want to be able to feel nothing anymore, but I don't want to leave my girlfriend behind.
The thought of killing myself has become more frequent and more possible in my mind. But I'm still afraid of death.
I want to die now, to get it over with. I also want to die now because I can't be happy anymore. There's nothing now that can make me as Happy as I was before.
Honestly I just want it all to end
I'm sorry if this was confusing
Just needed to let it out..
