Right now, I am a bigger mess than I've ever been before. (Do I need to put a trigger warning?)My boyfriend hasn't been around for a while, hasn't texted or called. He's always depended on me to help him get through life because he's too sad to do anything. He cuts more than I can stop him. He never told me that anything was wrong before he stopped contacting me. He probably killed himself...and it's my fault for not doing enough. *Think positively:* he's probably just ignoring you. That would mean I've messed up yet again. 

Yesterday I cut myself until I passed out, today I slammed my head into the wall until it left a dent. Also today I cut myself a bit. I deserve to be dead, I know. I'm not a good person, I'll always mess everything up, I've never been useful. I've always been in the way. All I can do is apologize for not being even close to enough. 

As long as I'm alive, everyone I knows lives will continue to be ruined. That's okay though, everyone will just forget and move on once I'm gone. No one liked me anyway.
