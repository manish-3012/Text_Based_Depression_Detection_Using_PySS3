I need help and adviceIâ€™m 18, lonely, and Iâ€™m starting to think I have clinical depression. When I was 12 I had a really bad depression stoop that lasted 4 years and during that entire time I was suicidal and self abusive. I overcame that with some help and no antidepressants, I realized I still need to grow as a person and that I can fill in my issues and learn. But Iâ€™ve done my learning, I try to be the nicest person I can be and Iâ€™ve started to go down the path of soul searching and living happily. I recently have felt that Iâ€™m losing ground, everybody suffers in their life and most people have depression and have the natural lows and highs but I just feel like itâ€™s not right. Iâ€™ve been constantly fighting these fucked up thoughts and feelings but no matter how hard I try and what I do I always feel like suicide is my best option. But I know itâ€™s fucked up, your ruining your life just because you are sad!? Thereâ€™s still so many great things to see and feel, but Iâ€™m just so exhausted from fighting this. What do I do?
