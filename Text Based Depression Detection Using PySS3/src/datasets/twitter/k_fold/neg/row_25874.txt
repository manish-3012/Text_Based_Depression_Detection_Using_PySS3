Canâ€™t afford therapy anymore. Insurance sucks. Extreme guilt and anxiety. Iâ€™m just... done.I canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t. 

I had to quit therapy. I can barely even afford my medication now. Iâ€™m afraid to even make another suicide attempt because if I fail and Iâ€™m hospitalized again I wonâ€™t be able to afford that bill either. 

I want to slap younger me in the face. Iâ€™m wrecked with guilt for what I did. Iâ€™ll probably be the next person to get called out or â€œcancelledâ€ god I want to die. 

I wasted my entire summer. I donâ€™t do anything. I donâ€™t have friends to do anything WITH. Iâ€™m an outsider looking in and I donâ€™t relate to anyone. I canâ€™t even go on social media because Iâ€™m so intensely jealous of what other people have. 

I have a job where I sit and do nothing all day. Iâ€™ve had no new projects in months. I think my boss forgot I even work here. Iâ€™m just a body in a desk. 

I want to die. I just want to be dead. Nothing gets any better. Summer is over and I fucking wasted it. I hate myself.
