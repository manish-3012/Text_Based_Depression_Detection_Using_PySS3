idiotall my friends just left me because i fucked up. its been almost 3 days now and i cant stop thinking it would be better if i was dead.

my friend was being groomed by my other friend (15 and 19) and i didnt do enough about it. they also said i talk about weed too much and i dont care about my friends so roughly 11 people just cut me off completely. good things are coming up and i know i can change and be a better person in the end. 

i know im not a victim in all this, in fact im the one who fucked up, but im miserable and all i can think about is killing myself.
