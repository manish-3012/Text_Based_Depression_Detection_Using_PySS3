In 10 yearsDoes anyone else have a long-term plan for suicide?

I've been staunchly decided for several months now that I'll kill myself in approximately a decade. I've never seen it any other way, for as long as I can remember. It's not even an emotion-based thing at this point, just a logical decision given how I am and will be. I just need a few years to finish getting my education and repay some debts to people (namely my parents), and then I'll be ready.

Just wondering if anyone else has had similar thoughts. If you're reading this, I really hope you have a wonderful day!
