So alien (sorry for the bad English)I'm so sorry great people, I most share my feelings with you now or I will never be able to tell it.
I was born in small village in Africa, very poor family, we was 7 brothers without a father and so poor that we eat one eag all 7 of us in the hall day.. Poor that I most walk 5 km to get to the school and put a plastic bag over me and my foot because it's raining and I don't want my only notebook to get wet.. Is had very rough childhood, I remember my father coming home just to beat my mother and go back to the unknown..
I remember my first day going to school to register for my first class, alone and very scared, skinny and sad.. It's was hard for a 6 years old child to get so much responsibility in this early age, my mom, my other 7 brothers.. But after all I make it to the college, actually I don't know how i made it..
Now I'm just 24 years old, I live in Germany but I feel so depressed and tired of being on this planet..why?
I did a crazy combat with the life sense day one, I had to make it on my own.. But I didn't make it, Im tired of trying..
I did married last year, now she want divorce so that's means  I go back where I come from, and I'm scared of hunger nothing scares me more than that.. Scare to see my mother again, scared to meet old faces or see the old places where I grow, I mostly scared of the ZERO POINT where I most do it again from the beginning from nothing..nothing makes me feel better except thinking of death or non-existence, nothing makes ma smile coz I had it all and lose it all and will win again if I want.. But I know that life doesn't worth it.
...
..
It doesn't worth it at all.

I have no friends, no psychologist, no father or mother to give me love, I have no girlfriend no boyfriend, and when I walk in the streets I feel I'm so alien, so strange so weird so fucked up and nobody trust me or try to talk to me, but me I just want to till my story and bye.
