I'm done guys. I'm out. idk why I go on anymore.For the past month I've had some decent positive things happen to me I got a new job, I turned 21 on the 15th, and I witnessed my 2nd oldest brother get married to the love of his life, and I reconnected with the love of my life. But...idk why I'm so sad all the time I try to go out every other week I try to go out with my friends but when I go out it feels like I'm not wanted there like I just invited myself even though I was actively invited. But everything feels wrong I feel like I dont belong anywhere with anyone. The only person I feel even remotely safe around is the girl I like but she has a man and I'm not going to ruin their relationship what do I do i feel wrong in my skin i feel like I'm not supposed to exist here and like everyone hates me for things that's never happened or is always annoyed with me for something I said or did. I feel like disappearing forever is the only way to quell the voices and fears in my head
