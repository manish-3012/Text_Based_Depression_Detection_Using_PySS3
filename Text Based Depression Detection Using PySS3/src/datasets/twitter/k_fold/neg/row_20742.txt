Fuck everythingI cannot function. All i can do is stare at the fucking television. fuck life. Why the hell is death a bad thing? It is the exact same as never existing in the first place. Death only exists while you are alive. You are infinitely unaware when you die. how can death possibly be a bad thing? Death is not a bad thing, therefore it is a good thing. Absence of bad is good. suicide is only seen by society as a bad thing because they wont be able to make money of you anymore. It is an attempt to control you and make you do work for them.
