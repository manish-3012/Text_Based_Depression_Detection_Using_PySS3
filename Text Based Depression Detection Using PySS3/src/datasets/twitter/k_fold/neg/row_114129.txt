UselessI want to die.

Iâ€™m a failure.

Failed high school.

Failed my family and friends.

Failed myself.

I am useless.

There is no point to my life.

All my friends are moving away for university.

I am alone.

All alone in this retched life.

I got a job.

Iâ€™m going to get my fire arms license.

Iâ€™m going to buy a gun.

Iâ€™m going to shoot myself.

I am going to die.

Soon it will all be over.

Soon.
