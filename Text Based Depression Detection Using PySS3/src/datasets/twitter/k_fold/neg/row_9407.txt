Itâ€™s terrifying how random life really is.I always, like many, thought things generally work out. That was my childhood but of course that was just ignorance. I quickly learned life is just random. Some people are fortune enough to save themselves from bad situations if they happen to be born in a rich family. Thereâ€™s no story or meaning to anything. Life is just continually learning to be okay with what you have because you have no real power.
