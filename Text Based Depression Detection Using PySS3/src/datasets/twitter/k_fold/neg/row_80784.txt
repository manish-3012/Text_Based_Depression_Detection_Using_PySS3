I think i'm going to just do it, things don't have a point anymoreSome months ago I just stopped, I don't have any motivationead ( things that I usually love to do), schoolwork is just torture, I can't concentrate and even trying to do it make me feel worthless, my room is a mess and the list goes on. 
   All I can do is sometimes force myself to eat, shower and get some sleep, I feel pathetic.

  My friends are getting tired of me cause I disappear for days and can't even respond their messages, but I don't really wanna bother them with my problems. I haven't received a hug or any kind of affection in months and it's probably my fault to be honest. 

   I had one friend that talked to me almost every day and always made me feel better, but recently he found a girlfriend and just forgot me, he talks to me two times a month at best and generally just for short periods of time, he's always doing something with her and only come to me when he needs to talk about his own problems. I don't blame him. 

  So i was thinking if I die it would solve the problems, my friends wouldn't be worried, and I could maybe find some peace. The fact that I am home alone most of the time don't help this thoughts. I know no one will honestly miss me, maybe cry a little and forgot that I ever existed, I would be just one less problem. 

I have planned it, and I think it won't hurt, I'll have time to go to my bed, fall asleep and never wake up again.
