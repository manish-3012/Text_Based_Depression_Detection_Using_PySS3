I've managed to screw up just about everything in the last month.I can't believe how much I've managed to ruin everything. I've started falling behind in classes, and haven't been able to do any assignments, thanks to extreme depression and laziness. I don't have any more mental energy to do my remaining coursework, which consists of 5 projects and 4 exams. My anxiety also prevented me from calling back for a job. My BPD makes friendships difficult and nobody really likes me anyway. Damn it, I've managed to completely ruin any good thing I still had. I have no hope for my future. If only I wasn't too lazy to end my life. It feels like the only way to be truly happy, and not ruin anything.
