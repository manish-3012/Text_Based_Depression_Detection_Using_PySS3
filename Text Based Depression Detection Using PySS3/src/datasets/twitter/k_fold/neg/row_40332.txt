Help please someone helpI need help so badly. These suicidal thoughts are controlling my brain, thereâ€™s no room for real thoughts because my brain is so crowded. I want to die. I try so hard and the thoughts wonâ€™t go away I need someone to help. I have nobody, I never have had anybody. I am alone all the time. I just want to end it all. How do I get rid of these thoughts, I try soo hard to read self help, go to therapy, take supplements, do all the good things. All of them combined are not powerful enough to overcome this monster of suicide. I feel this way on good days. I fear the next bad day I have he will finally catch me.
