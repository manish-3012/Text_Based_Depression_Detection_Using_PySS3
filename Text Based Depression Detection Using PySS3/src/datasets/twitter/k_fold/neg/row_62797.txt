I spent most of my life suicidal and depressed, here's a vlog and a blog I am making about it.So I just thought I would put this out for you guys. I feel it is  necessary part of my recovery. I have struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life. I dropped out of 2 colleges then joined the military, I was discharged early for being mentally unwell, I was suicidal and also self harming. In the next 10 years I bummed around, place to place, country to country. I have had like 40 jobs, I became an alcoholic and abused drugs a lot in my 20s. I told lies that almost kiled me and at 27 I was hospitalised a few times, in wards with varying levels of  security.

I have had my neck in a rope more times than I can count.

By 27, I was washing dishes in a pub, an alcolholic and living at home on parents sofa. I had completely lost hope. I can't explain how deeply I had lost hope. I was LITERALLY counting down the days until I would be old enough to die.

Now I am 30, and I am happy, stable and starting to move forward again

If I can recover then so can you. that is all I want to say

Here is the blog, it's kinda new, but I would love some feedback
