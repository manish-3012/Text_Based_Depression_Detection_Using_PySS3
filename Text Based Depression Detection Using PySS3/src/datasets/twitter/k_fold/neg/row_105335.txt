In a holeI dropped out of college, can barely hold a job, haven't had sex in years and find it hard to see a future worth living. I always get really optimistic about something and within a few days I just want to end it all. It's like a cycle I just want to end. I don't want to be in my thirties living with my mom with no friends because I'm not confident enough to follow through with anything. At first I thought I had ADHD but now I'm pretty sure I have depression. It might have sprung up as a commordity disorder. Idk.

Like I said...I try to be positive but I keep on getting depressed. I've started to isolate myself as well. I've deleted all of my social media and am thinking of running away from my family and leaving my cellphone. I'll go somewhere where I wouldn't be able to get back home from. Then I'll be forced to make myself commit suicide. I also know that I'd probably think myself out of it but if life keeps going like this I feel like I'll eventually just end it.
