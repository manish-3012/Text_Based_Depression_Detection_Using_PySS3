Lost my only reasonMy daughters were really the only reason I haven't literally and figuratively pulled the trigger on ending it all. Tonight I found out that my kids don't want to visit me anymore because of the bullshit their stepmother has been telling them about me. So I guess now that they don't care about me, it'll be the perfect time to just disappear. They are young enough that this won't traumatize them, plus like I said, they don't want me around anyways. So, off I go. I guess I just wanted to tell someone how this broke me. Not that any of you care about some stupid stranger bitch that's going to off herself.
