Felt good for a whileGot on a new med and felt good for quite a while until recently. Iâ€™m not sure if I need a higher dose or what, but Iâ€™ve taken more Xanax than I should have today and drank too. 

My mom is trying to help and I appreciate her and my family so much. 

I just hate feeling like such shit. My mind wonâ€™t shut off and all I want it to do is shut up. I donâ€™t like having these feelings back :(
