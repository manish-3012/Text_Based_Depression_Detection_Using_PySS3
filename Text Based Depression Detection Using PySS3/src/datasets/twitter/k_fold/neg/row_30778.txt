can't keep doing ittalk of abuse ahead i guess

i can't go on four more years in this shithole town. i can't stay here for college when i know so many horrible people live so so so close to me i just want a fresh start but i can't have it, can i. i can't afford to leave and i can't live here anymore i can't live in the town with all the painful memories i have. i'm sick of passing by restaurants and i'm sick of hearing her name in casual conversation or having to worry about running into my father in town somewhere or just living in a town where everyone either ignores me or treats me like scum. i'm sick of being a fucking idiot who can't tell directions or talk or do anything for himself. i hate how i have to live in the town with the person who assaulted me in the fucking school bathroom and felt me up in class and i hate how i have to just constantly hear "it's just four more years you can leave after college!" i didn't even want to live THIS long but my boyfriend talked me into it and i got a kitten who's extremely attached to me. i thought i'd be able to start again and start transitioning and 18 would be a new beginning for me but all i'm seeing is the same dim tunnel up ahead and god damn i can't keep doing it.

i'm sorry this isn't formatted/written well it's 2am and i feel like i'm going to vomit my guts up, i have no one to talk to because i already worry everyone in my life enough. i just had to get this out somewhere. i'm probably just being dramatic but i really can't live this way for four more years
