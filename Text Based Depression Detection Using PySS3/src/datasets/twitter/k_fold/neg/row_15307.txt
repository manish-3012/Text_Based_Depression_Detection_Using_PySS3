UglyHi everyone! I want to apologize for my minimalistic english skills (it's my 3rd language)!! Well, I am half japanese and half european, I have spent my entire live in switzerland. I have had a few issues with self-esteem and depression and I still struggle with it today. I meet a Psychiatrist once every week. Sometimes I don't go to school and stay at home because I am so depressed, it often hurts so much it's hard to breathe. 
I have developed this kind of thoughts, that no one cares about the Character of another person. And that ugly people, like myself, will never get love from a individual outside the family. When a ugly person does something bad, it's a dusgusting act. If it's a beautiful person, suddenly, it's perfectly fine. I love to educate myself and get informations about politics, etc. Also, I have a passion for writing (in my 2 mother languages). But no matter how hard I try to become better than I was earlier on in my life, the beautiful people will always have and get more. I don't go outside that often anymore, I barely visit the libary I love to be at, because I am so ashamed of my looks. I have read about Body Dysmorphic Disorder, but I think I am just ugly. I hate the fact, that I don't even have something, that makes me special. I don't have any special abilities or similar. I am just a disgustingly ugly piece of meat and fat.
My apologies for this messy Text and thanks for Your answers.
