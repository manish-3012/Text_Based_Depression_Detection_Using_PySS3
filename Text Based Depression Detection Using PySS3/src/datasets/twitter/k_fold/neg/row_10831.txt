On the edge after my examJust wrote an exam and can't even remember how it really went. I feel depressed and anxious and think I failed. Crying as I'm typing. Swallowed a handfull of anti depressants and hope I never wake up. This test was the tipping point. Doubt I can make it in life being bipolar
