spiraling downhill since August '16I'm renting a room in a basement and I have a crappy job. I'm separated with my ex wife(not divorced) so I'm sending her money constantly. The girl I've been dating since after I split just found out that I'm separated or technically "married" still. I have no friends no family that actually cares no one near me that notices the signs. I've cheated I've lied I've grown up spoiled and people say I leech off of them and ruin they're lives. I'm head over heels in debt. I have nothing going for me at all like AT ALL. How do I tell them that I'm ending it all tonight ?
