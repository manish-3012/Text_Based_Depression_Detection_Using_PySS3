Ah yes christmas, i love having to spend time with the people who are responsible for like 60% of all my suicidal thoughtsHaha how great. Also yeah donâ€™t bash me for celebrating xmas in this pandemic,  i genuinely donâ€™t want to, but iâ€™m a minor and i live with my parents and i literally have no choice. So thats fun.
