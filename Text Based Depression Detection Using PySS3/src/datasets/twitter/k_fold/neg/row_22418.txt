The world is a beautiful place, I'm just not worthy of itThe usual life conception that I see among people with suicide tendencies is "the world is horrible and life was unfair with me, I need to end it all because I will never get justice in this defective place".

In my personal case, I went through the total opposite process. Despite its countless and massive flaws, the world is still beautiful and rich and vivid and full of wonderful things to do. But I am horrible at everything and I have made such gigantic mistakes in the past that I cannot enjoy life any more: I will always be way too ashamed of my past to ever enjoy life in any form.

The world out there can indeed be a great place to live in, but I am not even close to being worthy of it. This is a matter of my personal worth, not the rest of the world's.

**It's hard to say bye when there is so much good out there**

Thoughts of suicide have floated inside my head for so many years now but I haven't had the guts to do it yet because there are others who would weep for me. And every time I do NOT do it, I see all those goods and beauties the world has to offer and I think of how much I will miss once I'm gone. I still want to end it all, but hell if it doesn't feel like a huge shame that all these positive aspects of life will be entirely missed.
