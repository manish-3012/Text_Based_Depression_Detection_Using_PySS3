Donâ€™t want to live or die.I just get the feeling that this world isnâ€™t for me, even though my life is pretty good in terms of academics. Every day is just boring and dull and I have to feign interest is what my peers say and I find it incredibly hard to focus and try to do anything. I donâ€™t want to die because I have a caring friend group and family, and I donâ€™t want to let them down, so I keep living my dull life. To sum up my feelings, I canâ€™t find a reason to live ( but it canâ€™t be said that I want to die ). Not asking for a conversation, but instead can somebody try to tell me how to find a reason to live

Note: Sorry if some of this doesnâ€™t make sense, I find it hard to put my feelings into words.
