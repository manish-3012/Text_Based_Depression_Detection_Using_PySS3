I canâ€™t keep living like thisI just Iâ€™m at a loss of what to do anymore. Iâ€™m miserable and I have been most of my life. Nothing makes it better , Iâ€™ve tried self help , therapy , faking it till I make it. Iâ€™m tired and I just canâ€™t keep doing this. Iâ€™m miserable to be around and make everyone around me worse off simply by being in their lives. Iâ€™m trying to finish my degree but is there even going to be jobs when I graduate? Will I just be saddled with student debt. Should I drop out and try to find a trade. I just thereâ€™s no good answer and I feel like my only way out is by ending it. Iâ€™ve never thought I would make it to the age I am now and I just I donâ€™t know what to do? Iâ€™ve screwed my life up so royally that I donâ€™t even know if I can come out okay. I just want it to end and not wake up anymore. Iâ€™m so tired of having no friends , a toxic family and being told that we need relationships to survive. I know this but I just canâ€™t manage to make them stick and I just Iâ€™m tired guys. Iâ€™m really tired and I donâ€™t know if I can do this anymore.
