I hate my lifeLately I been hit with a wave of depression, not such a new thing it's happened before. I just don't feel like I'm good enough for this world, I can never live up to anyone's expectations, they always set the bar so high for me it's always impossible to impress them. My life would be bearable if I was good at something but I'm just not, the closest thing I have is math and I'd say I'm just above average. Things just aren't going right right now and it sucks. I'm trying to lose weight which is pretty successful however it's like I take a step forward and ten steps back. To top everything off I haven't had a girlfriend in like a year and haven't texted any in like 6 months, life just isn't looking good,I've often thought about ending it but never gone through with it.
