I finally have access to a handgun. It's the only method I'd go through with.I don't usually post on this site but i have some shit on my mind and im kinda hoping someone could maybe have some guidence with my situation.

But here we go..

I recently started dating my now boyfriend for about a month now.. We've been seeing each other for quite some time though, and I really enjoy the time we spend together. But.. the shitty thing is I only get to see him weekends, as we work/live about about an 2 hours from each other... I've been having a really tough time dealing with my symptoms, and even though im heavily medicated I still constantly have the feeling of just wanting to dissappear. 

My now boyfriend is a big gun collector and has quite a few handguns.. which I just loaded a bullet in one and have been staring at for a good while.

I've thought of many things and people as I stared at the loaded gun but my empathy for my family and friends is really making this hard.

I have this chance to just finally end the pain of the horrible thoughts and feelings that I've been trying so hard to let go and I'm alone so there's no better time than now
