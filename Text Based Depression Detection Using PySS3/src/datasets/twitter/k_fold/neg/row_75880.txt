Why should I bother?Honestly, I'm so tired over everything. How do you guys find the energy to wake up every morning &amp; tackle the day?
I'll be honest, I'm drunk and i want to kill myself right now and i've tried to reach out to friends and family that are online right and so far i've been given empty platitudes like "I know what you're going through" or "just get some sleep, we'll talk tomorrow". 

I seriously want to just go to sleep and never wake up. the next best thing for me right now is to just slit my throat and watch the city lights as a i go out.

I don't know what else to to do. I'm on antidepressants and all they do is give me the motivation to kill myself. but the only reason I haven't done so yet is because I don't want my mum to be sad.
