Can't see anything positive in anything I've ever done... What's the point?Honestly, I've never had an impact on anyones life and never will. I'll always be that weirdo in everyone's peripheral vision that dies without anyone noticing. I have no friends, not attractive, not going to be successful, not charming or charismatic, not funny, not hard working, virgin who's never so much as had a friend in the opposite sex because of incredible anxiety, get anxious asking for help even in a book store. I've not done anything with my life and it will always be a morose existence. I really want to die, I don't want to live like this anymore. I hate every single thing about myself. I cannot think of a single positive trait I have...

I get no satisfaction out of anything in life, the only thing that motivates me is trying to not feel constantly sick from the stress of things that normal people breeze by. This is no way to life. Fuck this.
