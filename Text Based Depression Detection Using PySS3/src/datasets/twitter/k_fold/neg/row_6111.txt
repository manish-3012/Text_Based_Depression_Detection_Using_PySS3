Today was supposed to be a good day and I somehow still fucked it upI did so much more today than I have done in the past month, activities that are supposed to be fun

But I still felt like shit the entire way through and just ruined the mood for everyone around me

I feel so guilty because I have so many things to get done and yet I tried to do something that was supposed to make me feel better for once but somehow fucked it up and still felt terrible. 

I probably should of never tried to begin with.

Why am I even still trying at all

I just want to disappear
