A success story... thanks guysI posted here about a year ago when i was literally minutes from doing something i could never take back. Since then, with the help of a few fellow redditors who wish to remain nameless. I have done a complete 180, nothing in my life has changed other than my perspective on it. Take it from a guy who has never been kissed, relatively ugly, and overall just not date-able. It doesnt matter how many girls you get with, there is someone out there for you whether its just a friend or a spouse who will care for you. You just have to know where to look and not to feel sorry for yourself. Ill admit self pity actually felt good for a while but it wasnt helping anything and nothing changed until i dropped that attitude. 

Adjust you outlook on life and I promise you, good things will come in time. 

EDIT: Ill certainly be wondering around on my other account helping those in need. Its the least i can do  for this place for helping me.
