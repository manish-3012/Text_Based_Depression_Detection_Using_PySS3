I don't know if I can take this anymoreI moved to a large city from the small city I lived in the Midwest. Nothing has gone right since Iâ€™ve moved here. I found out my partner had cheated on me, I lost most of my money and my job. Thankfully my partner feels so guilty that heâ€™s let me live in his apartment without any contribution on my part. I can hardly get out of bed. I havenâ€™t met a single person since Iâ€™ve moved here. Iâ€™ve gained 20 lbs. I have PTSD that was being managed with therapy and medication and I havenâ€™t found a therapist or psychiatrist. Iâ€™ve never been this poor. Iâ€™ve never been this inconsolably depressed. Iâ€™ve never been this lonely. I spend 12+hrs a day by myself. I think about killing myself constantly. I canâ€™t move back. I have nowhere else to go. I donâ€™t know what to do.

The thing is, this is nothing new. I've spent most of my life in emotional pain. Therapy works a little bit. Meds dull the pain. I still spend days stuck in bed. I still cry all the time. Even when I'm at my best I'm just waiting to break again. It's a life of maintenance. I don't have hobbies anymore. I can hardly read a book. I lost all my friends after a traumatic experience. I've been labeled a liar by my peers. I moved to get away from that experience and now I have nothing to hold on to here. I exist only in my head. 

I think about dying all the time. The first time I wanted to kill myself I was 13 years old. I just want these thoughts to stop. I want to have hobbies and dreams and goals. It's been years since I've felt true happiness. Every day I get closer and closer to what I feel is my inevitable end. 

When I think about killing myself, I think about how beautiful I would make it. I would turn it into a ritual. That even if I was doing something to end my life, at least my last moments would be enjoyable. 

I'm not getting better. I'm too old to live like this anymore.
