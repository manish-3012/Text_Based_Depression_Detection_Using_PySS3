Test run of suicide plan I hope tomorrow. I feel so guilty for choosing to commit suicide. I am so tired to living. I don't want to anymore.My family constantly tells me how I do not do things right. I don't do them enough, I need to be different. 

I am sure most of my "friends" say and think the same. They probably do not care.

I have devised a suicide plan. Hope it will work. Test run tomorrow I hope. The guilt for this is suffocating. please make it stop. Everything I do feels wrong. I deserve to die.

I want to die. Please make it stop. it sould look like i jsut died. I hope it works. My family thinks depression or suicidality is a mental disease. It's not. It's just wanting to stop this.

I've had a triple shot now. Hopefully i won't feel so much for a few hours.

The guilt is overwhelming. Why does this have to be wrong? Kill me please. I will probably not even be allowed to kill myself. I will probably be forced to stay. That is what  I deserve. To suffer. I deserve to suffer.

I just want someone to talk to.

The guilt is so much. Please kill me. My family and friends would never let it go if they fund out. I do not want to keep going. i hope God, if there is one, strikes me dead in my sleep tonight.
