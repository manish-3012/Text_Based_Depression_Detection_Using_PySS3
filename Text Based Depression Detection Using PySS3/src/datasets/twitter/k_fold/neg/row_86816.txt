Another Suicidal TeenThat's sorta how I see myself. I'm just another depressed teen contemplating ending it all. I'm a statistic. So it  shouldn't matter if I just up and die. And it wouldn't. The only thing I do is cause problems. Offing myself would do everyone I know a favor. And I'd be doing everyone I would get to know in the future a favor. I'd be getting myself out of the way before I messed up their lives. That's what I'm good at. Messing up lives. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm plagued with indecision and the only way to shut all the voices in my head up is to die. I've never made any concrete plans or anything, but it's been in my head for a while now. And once something's in my head, it will not fucking leave. It's like the only way out. I hate myself for thinking like this. All the more reason to do it. I'd be doing my god damn self a favor. Shit.
