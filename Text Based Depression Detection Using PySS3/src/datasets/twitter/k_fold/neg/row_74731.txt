Really trying to talk myself out of thisI've been feeling suicidal for a while. However I've been madly in love with someone and it helped calm down that side of me. We have broken up, and now the suicidal thoughts are here more than ever. I've planned out two different ways to off myself. I just don't want anyone to think its because of him and I don't want him to feel guilty. I'm just not sure what to do right now. I'm trying to tell myself life is going to get better but since one of my best friends died in October from an accidental overdose I have the overwhelming urge to join her. 

Also, sorry if this was a big paragraph of word vomit. I don't usually post a lot.
