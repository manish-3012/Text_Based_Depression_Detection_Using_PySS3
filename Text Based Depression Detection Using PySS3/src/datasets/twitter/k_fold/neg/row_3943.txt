I did something awful, and I want to end myselfI am a kid, but please know that this isnt some kid messing around, i just really want to end myself or talk to someone

I have had a voice in my head for quite a few years, saying stuff like "you should hurt your friend" "you should kill them" and I knew that this stuff was wrong so i haven't until now. A few hours ago, i attempted to poison my parents. they kept nagging me and i was In a bad mood and didn't want to listen to them, and they yelled at me after me yelling at them. I put bleach in their tea and waited, i was home alone. I realized that the bleach wouldn't work after a while then i dumped out the tea and realized what i had just done. I had just tried to kill my parents. I'm so disappointed and disgusted at myself. I want to end myself for this awful thing i have done. That weird voice in my head though always tells me to hurt people. I got in school suspension for hurting kids that don't deserve it, twice. I realized all of my past actions and my actions today, and I want to end myself for this awful thing I tried to do. If I don't end myself, I will end up telling my parents and they will submit me into a mental hospital, I don't want to go into a mental hospital. If i don't kill myself then I will just suffer forever until I die. I don't know what to do, and I'm scared.
