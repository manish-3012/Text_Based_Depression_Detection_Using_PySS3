Don't know where else to turn.For everything I want to be and dream to be; I have failed at all attempts. The constant daily failures over the past 20 years of my adulthood have been snowballing with every loss. Any goals I have achieved have been drowned by major depression.

It is a barrage of defeat and disappointment and I am starting to waver now more than ever. I am unsure of how much longer I can withstand the tide of it. It is wicked and it is crippling.

I keep a proper noose in my place and a means to commit at any time. I know I need to get rid of it but I can only keep thinking of the peace it could bring.

I have considered literally everything and have planned it out the best that I can - all the way to leaving a note on my door informing Emergency services there is a dead body inside so they can prepare their minds at least a little bit. I have notes for my family and have organized all of my personal finances and taxes so that they may be handled easily when I am gone. I have completely cleaned everything in my home and storage unit - all trash and clutter is removed in order to make it easier on my family who will have to empty my stuff out. 

I have notes to my family but they are short as I don't want to ramble on about it. I say what I mean and mean what I say and keep it at that. I plan to somehow have emergency respondents show up first because the last thing I would want to happen among this whole mess is my mom or another family member coming across my body after I am dead - its bad enough I'm taking my life. 

My family and most importantly my mom are the only reasons I am still here today. It will absolutely crush her soul and I cannot bring my self to do that to her or my family- yet I can hardly operate from a day to day anymore.

 I have been in and out of hospitals, taken many different types off SSRI's and wellbutrin, and have had various different psychiatrists and therapists. My current run is my best yet I have been to counseling every week for the past year and have visted my psychiatrist to adjust meds appropriately. I have taken my medication as prescribed and have jumped through all the hoops and loops in dealing with side effects. Now I'm on Seroquel to help augment Prozac and BuProprion. I have dozens of empty pill bottles following the regiment as directed. 


Yet here I am, still in a hole that I just want to sleep in forever. I have no control and no self discipline. I am a waste of potential and worthless to those who love me and myself. Constantly failing to get a hold of my life. 

I continue to live because I know that there will be no attempt - when I go through with it, that will be it; lights out. So I choose to wait one day at a time.
