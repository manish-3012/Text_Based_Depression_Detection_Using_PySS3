I'm not sure what to do anymoreI'm hoping someone can help, I got into a "fight" kind of with one of my best friends. She blocked me and I've been blocked for two weeks, I finally texted her through SMS and she said she has no reason to unblock me and that her life I'd better with me blocked. She then blocked me on SMS, or at least wont respond.

The thing is, I want to talk to her before school starts, because I will be with her then and it will be awkward. I would love to talk over the phone but she wont do that, I doubt she will even text me. 

I'm not sure what to do anymore, I feel lost. My birthday is this Monday and I was gonna plan to do something with her and some friends but she said no which was kinda how the fight started. 

I'm planning on just going on a ride on my dirt bike somewhere. I'm having suicidal thoughts and I'm not sure what to do, I've been up crying every night. I don't think I'm suicidal, like I don't think I would actually kill myself. But if something happened where I could die and it wouldn't be my fault (a drunk driver hitting me or something) I don't think I would mind that. I just don't want to participate in life anymore. I'm not sure what to do about this situation and I'm lost and helpless.
