Stress Building UpIâ€™m gonna make this as brief as I can, but I just needed to vent real quick 

Transferred to a big university from a community college, and today was my first day. Already anxious and felt so alone all day, but on top of financial worries and shit piling up over time and my laundry list of diagnoses, I broke down today in the parking deck because I couldnâ€™t find my car

I sobbed and people walked by and stared as I contemplated jumping off, texted my mom and told her I wanted to and she ignored it, bf also ignored my call for help and just told me to calm down 

I eventually found my car and now Iâ€™m home. Suicide is still heavy on my brain, but Iâ€™m too broke for any other method.

I feel really incoherent and my head is swimming. Idk why Iâ€™m posting here, but I guess Iâ€™m hoping someone will understand what itâ€™s like to feel the pressure of the world on you, and others not getting it.
