Itâ€™s only a matter of timeI am getting dangerously close to ending my life.  I will break soon. One day Iâ€™ll have to cut off every distraction and face the truth. I am destined to kill myself. I will always be a worthless,  garbage person who leeches off of everyone for my own benefit. My death will lift a huge burden off of many peopleâ€™s shoulders. When I die, the world will have lost nothing of value. Iâ€™m better off killing myself rather than being a waste of resources
