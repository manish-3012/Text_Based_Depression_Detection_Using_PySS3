What is the point of continuing to live if I fail at everything I doI am incompetent in every aspect of my life, from working to fitness to school to basic adult functions like cooking, cleaning, grooming, etc. I have nothing on my resume and bad grades. I have few friends and am generally disliked by most people that meet me. I don't care enough about anything to join a cause or a club, and I have no legitimate interests. From my perspective, if I continue on this track, I will be such an absolute failure in my life that I will most likely commit suicide anyway, and I am too incompetent to even begin to change myself or my situation. I see no hope in my future, so why should I continue forward if I am only going to stumble through my life failing at everything I try until I finally hit a low enough point to off myself?
