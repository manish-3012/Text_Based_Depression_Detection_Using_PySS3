Lost Another JobTied to anxiety and just my lack of ability to function or be useful in any way, I just lost another job. Only a few months in and I couldn't even keep myself together to get past that pruning phase.

I have already spent nearly 2 months in psychiatric hospital, and the lead psychiatrist for my medical team has made it very clear he does not want me returning, at least not without an actual suicide attempt to bolster the previous loose-hearted attempt and continuous feelings of the sort.

I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like an abysmal failure incapable of keeping even the smallest parts of life on a functioning path. I don't want to be sitting here at home alone on a day I should have been working, I just keep thinking that it's the last straw, this is the point to stop trying.

Everyone I care about has already wasted so many resources, hours and their energy trying to keep me from falling apart, and I've never been together to begin with.
