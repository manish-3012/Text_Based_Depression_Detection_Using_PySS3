Whole day in bed crying [23m]I can't stand seeing other people happy and not understand what is wrong with me. It's over. i was s good student and this year should have been the best, but im havingâ€‹ a meltdown. I hope i get reincarnated. I wasn't a week person before. Something happened to me unconsciously and... While my friends would get a girlfriend, i would wonder why not me too. Why ??
Monday is the day i have test of knowledge at my faculty. From someone that cared so much about grades to someone that is not doing anything now.
Wanted to jump off my building but cutting with razor seems the best. Things are getting worse every minute. I will miss a lot of things but than again maybe im just some kind of an idiot so im doing myself favor.
I missed a normal family my whole life since my parents divorced when i was 2 yr old. Missed for someone to give me advice. A lot of things never happened and will not happen. Never had any friends because i always missed my dad and never learned to make friends. I remember feeling normal only in his presence when i was a kid. Never had a sister or brother. I had nobody and still nobody.
There is nothing absolutely nothing worth living for except for things i miss and wonder if there is any chance they would happen.
