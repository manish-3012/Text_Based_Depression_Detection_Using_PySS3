im so tired.im tired all the time. my bodyâ€™s giving up on me and i just want to die.  im such a failure to everybody. im an asshole. im an idiot. i want to give up. i dont have anything anymore.  nothings helping. nobody cares. i just want to sleep. i dont have cancer or anything like that. 

its like im on a boat. except the boat crashed and i fell out. only to sink. deeper and deeper. but never drowned. 

the way i see it is -I am a corpse, but my body is still breathing- 

i dont want to wake up tomorrow. only to keep pretending im fine when i have nothing left except for my skin and bones.
