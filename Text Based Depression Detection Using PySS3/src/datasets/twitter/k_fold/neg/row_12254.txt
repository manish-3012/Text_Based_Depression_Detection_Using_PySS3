My friends one by one feeling depressed, and even become suicidal...It is become common to me that, my friend told me he/she wanna ends their lives, and I could not do anything but just listen to their sorrow. Part of me was like, yeah, life sucks and if they have think thoroughly, I have no right to stop them, if I do, then I am a selfish one that only want them to live painfully.  
All of them suffer in depressed a long time, some of them even has it before we were friends. Some of them are getting help from doctors, some of them don't. Some don't know how to live, or stop feeling sad. I don't even know how to make them fell better, but only just keep listening. Some them have financial problems, and I could not help, cause I am only 23 and try to make a life too.

Sometimes I feel sad and powerless.
