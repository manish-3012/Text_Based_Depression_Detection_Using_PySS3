I am alone. I have no hope.I am transgender, and I can't afford SRS. And, on top of that, I'm fucking hideous. I've been having a shitty ass month. People have kept calling me by male pronouns and titles, and what set me off was that someone said I look like an emo guy, while hitting on the two other girls near me.

I hate myself. The next chance I get to end my life, I'm taking it.
