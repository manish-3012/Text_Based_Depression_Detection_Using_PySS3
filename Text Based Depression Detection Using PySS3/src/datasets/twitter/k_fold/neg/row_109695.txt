I wish to prevent my father from commiting suicide.I'm 13M and my father is in his 60s, he lives in a different country than i do. 

I was borrowing his pc and i noticed a bookmark on a website teaching how to commit suicide with helium, and some (bookmarked) ebay pages selling helium tanks. 
He is in his 60s and he doesn't have insurance so he can't retire. I fear that he will kill himself. 
I am only with him around every 4 months, so I can't really stop him while i'm not with him. 

Sorry for any mistakes, i'm not English.

What can i do to help him?
