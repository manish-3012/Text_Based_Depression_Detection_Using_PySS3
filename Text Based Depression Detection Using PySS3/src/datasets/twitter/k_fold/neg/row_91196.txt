So.. I just want to kill myself or to just stop existing.Like, rn i was clenching my teeth. But i just noticed it. I've been doing it a lot lately without realising it. My chest aches. There's this piercing pain and heaviness around my heart. I feel like im lost in this abyss of emptiness, exhaustion and pain.
Im falling apart. My body and mind want to give up. I can't escape. And i know its my fault. Im slipping away from sanity and happiness. Happiness feels so far away now. Im tearing apart from the inside. Being alone is hell but being around people is too tiring and makes me anxious. I feel lonely and empty. There's no way of comforting myself. Ive pushed everyone away. Im no good for anyone. I just. I want to stop existing. Am I asking for too much?? No. Im just a coward. A hypocrite and a fraud. Truth is I deserve to die. Im useless. A waste of space.
