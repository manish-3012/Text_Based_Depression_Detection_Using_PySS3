All alone in San FranciscoAbout a month ago I posted an ad on craigslist and then someone decided to pay for my ride and help me get set up in SF. Turns out, a lot of people are fucking weirdos out here. A lot of people do care but i donÂ´t really think enough to get my fucking emotions out. Since IÂ´ve been here I just been having sex, fucking with a lot of different drugs. A lot of people say they care, but I feel as if itÂ´s more of a lust type of thing. I have gotten drugged and raped since IÂ´ve been here. There is many oppurtunites for me to be a success but itÂ´s so fucking hard when I dont have the motivation to even try to start small. I have a fuck ton of foxy and Valium in my bag and I was planning on taking them later tonight. I could do a lot of things better in my life. I really can, I just donÂ´t want to or even give a fuck. I donÂ´t get to use Reddit as much as I used to because my bag got stolen and I have to go to the Library. I always ramble but I have no idea what to say even though my mind is racing. I just feel like no one wants to listen and that my problem because I keep going but that because I always bottle it up and have no one to say. FUCK
