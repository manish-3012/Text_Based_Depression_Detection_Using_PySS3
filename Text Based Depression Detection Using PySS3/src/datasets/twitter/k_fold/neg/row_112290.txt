Sobered up from last night but I'm still feeling the sameLast night I came on here for a drunken rant and wanted to get off my chest what I've never said to anyone. I feel the same way today as I felt yesterday and am really thinking about ending it just to stop feeling like this. I'm just afraid of how I will be seen by my peers and chain of command if I even try to reach out and get help.  I feel like I if I just act and do something i won't have to worry about them or anything anymore
