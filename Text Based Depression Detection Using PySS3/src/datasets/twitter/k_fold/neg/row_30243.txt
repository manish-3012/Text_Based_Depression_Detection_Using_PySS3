Because of this sub... I'm back!The thoughts are gone, I feel free and happy. I couldn't have done it without this sub, I can't thank all of you enough. To anyone who has talked to me, thank you. Seriously. I just woke up today, and did a lot of thinking, it made me realize that I am a small part in a large picture, if I was gone, the picture wouldn't be the same. I know this all sounds stupid, but I had to share this. Also, anyone who needs to talk: Message me, I'll listen, I promise.

Thank you all :)
