University makes me depressed, I want to kill myself but am too cowardlyI'm from Germany, 20 years old female, and am studying Law

I dont know if this is all due to Corona or not.

Currently I'm studying around 11 hours a day, home office

But I still dont understand shit, everything is just so abstract, I dont get it

But i dont know what i want to do, if I drop out, I dont know which career path I want to go on, if I want to study but something else, or want to work straight away

And all this is making me depressed, my whole life my self worth was dependent on my grades, always a straight A student "oh you're so smart" etc. And now that all comes tumbling down, I feel like when I drop out, I have given up, that I failed. Because it's not like i just stopped because "it wasnt my thing" No, I will drop out cause I've given up, and that's destroying me.

Atleast I dont have student debt to worry about...
I dont know what I like what I want to do, but I want to be one of the smart people, but I also dont want to study 11 hours a day and dont understand a thing.

My current semester is only half the time as usual, 10 weeks instead of 20, but we need to learn everything regardless.

Maybe it's just that... maybe that's why its so much for me, but I'm okay with studying that much, my problem is that I dont understand it, and that it's all for nothing

I just wanna chill with my boyfriend, play pen n paper games and that's it, I just want that. 

But maybe I think I just need that cause I'm so deprived of any sort of free time, maybe when I'll work a job then I'll be dissatisfied again cause I dont make enough money to do nice things, like traveling 

I just dont see any way to be happy right now, no matter what I do I'll always end up sad and depressed, there is no right way, only wrong turns 

I honestly just want to end it all, but I'm too cowardly to do it, so I'll just wither away while continuing studying cause I dont know what to do.

So I'll just keep on existing, but not living.
