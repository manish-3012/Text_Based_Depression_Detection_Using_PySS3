Don't want to continue.Why should I continue... if there is nothing but pain and tragedy ahead? I've paid all of my dues, since I have hit rock bottom yet again, and I no longer want to be here, but it is only out of some morbid, distant, very vague sense of duty that I'm still around.

To be honest, I always feel and felt forced into getting into situations, or even hooking up with certain women, that I never loved, and am always forced into things though I am completely against them. I can never be with who I want to, and then another side of my comes out and says you don't need anyone. I am constantly swapping between personas throughout each day, probably out of split personality disorder.

I'm tired of being told what to do. How would you like it? Yet... you do it to me, and I'd rather be fucking dead, not having to play this game any more. I want to quit the game, and I utterly don't give a fuck. It's hard to continue, when you can never have the questions answered that you want answered, and also when you can never even begin to have faith that the person you dream of being with is actually even possible, and it isn't. It's just another deception, like all of the deceptions my entire life has been. This life is literally about reproducing and experiencing the world. That's literally it, there's nothing more to life than that, and I just can't compete in the game. Too much harm has been inflicted on me, and I simply can't handle any more. I can't handle anything more, and all I ask is nothing, because there's nothing to ask for, nothing to gain, and nothing for me to lose.

I've had enough.

You know how people say, "Do what you love and you'll be successful?"
My honest response to that, is that I love to do nothing but sleep and disassociate from the world. I don't actually enjoy doing anything, and thus I cannot do what I love. I love nothing about this world, and it's hard to be motivated to even do things if you just don't care.
