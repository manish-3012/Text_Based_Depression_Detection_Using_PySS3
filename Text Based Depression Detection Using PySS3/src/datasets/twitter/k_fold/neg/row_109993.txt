Apathy. A couple of days ago I randomly felt really happy. I was excited about trying to figure out a possible career (I'm a sophomore in college). The last couple of days I feel nothing but bored. Who cares if I find a career?I don't know what I believe in spiritually at all. I don't know how the hell I could ever be 100% sure of believing in creationism (the social norm of my country - USA) or even atheism. Honestly, every single part of this world just seems like complete bull shit to me right now. I don't even feel like happiness is real. I feel like its a fake consciousness society wants me to think I feel in order to survive. Why? Why do I need to be alive? Why does anyone need to be alive? Maybe I could go to school and become super smart and write fancy articles for some fancy magazine or newspaper. I could have opinions and back them up with impressive arguments. But why? Its all just complete bull shit. None of that stuff is going to make me happy. Nothing really makes me happy. I want to hop in my car and and just drive it off the bridge into the river. Why? Because I hate sitting here and having thoughts like this. I just want them to go away. The only thing I don't feel apathetic towards right now is suicide. I have feelings like this all the time and have never voiced them. Thought I would give it a try. I won't do anything. And I apologize for the horrible grammar in this... I've also been having a hell of a time articulating myself. 

Edit: Also, I'm not going to take any stupid medications for some ridiculous mental disorder society decides to brand me with. Been there, done that. It doesn't really work. Just fucks with my head more.
