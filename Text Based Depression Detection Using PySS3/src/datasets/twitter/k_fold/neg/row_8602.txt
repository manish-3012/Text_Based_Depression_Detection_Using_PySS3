I flunked out of college and my mother sabotages my social life. I feel hopeless.I couldn't stay focused long enough to complete my assignments and the university I went to lacks support services, so my parents decided to stop paying for me to go to college. Since then, I've applied to jobs at every store, every fast food place, every Starbucks, every restaraunt, every mall, etc. but haven't had any luck. My friends are too "busy" to spend any time with me. I started have some luck talking to some girls at Starbucks, but my mom suddenly showed up, told me to get in her car to "talk to her," and then drove me home. I Ubered back to Starbucks, but the girls I was talking to were gone. I feel so hopeless.
