It seems so easyIâ€™m drunk. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m sad. Iâ€™m tired of being sad. It was so easy to cut open my shoulder while I was trying to satisfy myself. Wouldnâ€™t it be just as easy to slice my wrists open and bleed out without anyone ever knowing?
People keep telling me itâ€™d be selfish if I killed myself and it would cause them pain, but itâ€™s not selfish for them to want me to stick around and feel pain just for them?
