No one likes me for meI've always had problems making friends. The only time I've ever been able to make friends is by pretending to be someone I'm not. I'm tired of pretending. It's been so long since I've felt wanted. I could deal with any shit that comes my way if I had someone to talk to. I wish online friends satisfied that feeling of loneliness. I just sit here every night texting the same 8 people- getting shot down eight times over the next hour.

Being an unlikable extrovert is not a life to live.
