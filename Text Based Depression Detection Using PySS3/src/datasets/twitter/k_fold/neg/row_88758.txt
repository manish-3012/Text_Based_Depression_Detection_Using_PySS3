I was wondering if anyone has time to talk for a bit...I feel like I might need this to get through tonight or to have hope to sleep (it's now 10 pm). I would like to have a PM conversation with someone. I am alone and feel a little desperate. But I don't even know if I should ask for this, because I don't think it will be a very interesting conversation for the other person... I'm a very awkward and shy girl and probably won't know what to say so I need someone who can just talk about random stuff and help me talk about random stuff as well. I don't want to talk about what's wrong in my life or why I'm so depressed and suicidal right now, I just want to... talk. I got this idea to ask here because of what another redditor did for me not too long ago. I posted on r/gonewild to feel wanted (straight forward and bluntly said, yes) and some guy, although he initially just wanted to see more photos and find out if I was anywhere near him, PMed me. But after finding out I'm thousands of miles away in Europe, instead of not messaging me anymore, he decided to start a question game with me where he asks a question, I answer, then I ask and he answers, etc. It ended after a few days because I just didn't answer anymore, not because I didn't want to but because I ran out of questions and everything I tried to come up with sounded so stupid I got embarrassed and decided not to reply. But what that guy doesn't know is that with those few days of simple questions and answers about each other, complete strangers, helped me through those few days. It's been a few really, really rough days and I was hoping that maybe it can work again, doesn't have to be the question game, it can be anything, and just tonight, so I can breathe and think about something else than killing myself. Sorry if this all sounds really jumbled up and confusing, I'm kinda just pouring out words.
