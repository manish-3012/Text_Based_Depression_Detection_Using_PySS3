IdontdeserveanythingHi, I've read some of confessions here. I just want to do the same maybe I want some of unknown person know what Im feeling right now. I don't know how long I have this thoughts I want this to end I want everything to end. I always feel like I don't deserve anything that's why I don't ask them for something like the things I need. Because I don't deserve it I don't even deserve to be loved. Crying myself to sleep is the best way. There is this one time I'm so depressed and lonely that continous voices that I don't deserve my life because it's just cruel I held a blade slowly cut my wrist. But it didnt go well because I love my family even if they don't, I love my friends, Most especially I love my gfriend. I'm so fed up with school and life at home. I don't know what to do...
