I want to do it. Please help me.About five years ago, I lived with a narcissistic mom who was physically abusive as well as emotionally. It took a huge toll on me and left some pretty horrible scars, both inside and out. It really messed me up. I tried to commit suicide three times while I was living with her. Each time, I screwed up somehow. I'm not even strong enough to put an end to it all... But every fiber of my being is telling me to try again even though I've gotten away from her. Because of her, I absolutely hate myself and everything about me, and I don't think that I deserve to live. But, to be honest, I'm scared. The past three times hurt so badly that I don't want to try again, and I don't want to die. But I can't see any other way out of this mess. I need help.
