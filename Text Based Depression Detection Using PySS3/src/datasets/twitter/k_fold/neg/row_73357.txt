My reasoning for why I'm not cut out for this life and I'm prepared to end it.My sensitivity keeps wrapping me in a black hole and just making me want to end it. The fear of living is much stronger than the fear of not existing. I don't think I fear nothingness anymore. Some people were born equipped to handle their existence. I truly believe that I can't even handle myself. My struggle is purely emotional. Everything seems to take a huge emotional toll on me. I get too attached to people. 

I always end up getting hurt. I'm not only talking about romantic relationships. I'm talking about relationships in general. I can't trust anyone anymore. Some people can move on from things, I couldn't and I'm convinced I never will. This had led me to prefer loneliness. Ironically, the loneliness is leading me to want to end my life. 

It's seem like the most logical path for me: I can't handle life, that led me to loneliness, which led me to want to end it. It makes complete sense to me.
