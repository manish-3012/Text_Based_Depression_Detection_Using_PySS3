When the hospitals aren't as packed I'll be throughAt least I hope so . Turning every single assignment late because I'm a miserable braindead piece of shit &amp; not even deadlines help at this point. I could be studying linguistics for free even if I didn't like it as much &amp; not be a financial leech on my family. I wish they didn't encourage me to go to these useless art classes that cost them money. It's 4 am and I should've handed the assignment this evening. Every single investment into me goes down the drain because I'm that worthless &amp; I keep getting lazier &amp; less capable of keeping up even with basic shit like household chores! I don't wanna be a burden to anyone anymore. I'll wait until the hospitals aren't as clogged. been suicidal for however many years &amp; seeing my peers in universities while I struggle with the simplest tasks &amp; the future (since I spent these years thinking i won't make it to 15-16) definitely doesn't help it.

19 is too old for me. I'm overdoing my stay, I shouldn't be there in the first place &amp; I know it. It's only gonna get worse
