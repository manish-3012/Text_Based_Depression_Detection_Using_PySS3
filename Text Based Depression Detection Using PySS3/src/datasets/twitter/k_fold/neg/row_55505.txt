Here goes nothingHello 28f with a birthday in a week. However I would like feedback on something I want to do.  I want to kill myself but i need to get to a place where medically assisted suicide is available I basically need help with staying there for a while to become a resident so that I can ya know get the process started. Iâ€™m tired of calling the suicide hotline. You can bet your ass I wonâ€™t be calling my family for help because Iâ€™m not trying to hear their shit. I noted my birthday only because I feel like a week is a long enough time to hear back from a genuine person. You sure as hell donâ€™t get fast responses on Craigslist so I figured this would be the same. Anyway just looking for help since I canâ€™t quite contract the virus (not working) so Iâ€™m stuck inside. Please donâ€™t take my post down Iâ€™m not doing anything right now I just need help to get to do something legally. Itâ€™s my choice. Everyone else always gets to make choices for themselves this is one choice where I know Iâ€™d be happy with it. Itâ€™s gonna take time for them to get all paperwork done for it maybe Iâ€™ll change but as for now I donâ€™t see that happening. Alright well Iâ€™ll go back to trying to find info via the web. Thanks for the help
