throwing myself into the voidi think my deepest desire is to die, and i try as hard as i possibly can to get rid of anything that might make me want to stay alive. im numb, i havent eaten in the last 48 hours, im kicking everybody who genuinely cares about me out of my life, and i probably feel better this way than with the intense guilt that comes with feeling that ive tricked somebody into thinking im a good person.

every time i eat, or take a breath, i feel like im wasting precious resources that would be much better used elsewhere. it's harder and harder to get out of bed in the morning.
