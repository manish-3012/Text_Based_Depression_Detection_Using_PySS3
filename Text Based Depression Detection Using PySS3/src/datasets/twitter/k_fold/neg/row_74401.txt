Where to turn when you have literally zero support network and absolutely nothing left to live for?I have quite literally zero friends, and my family is abusive. I have nowhere to turn at all. I have tried every avenue at this point...literally every angle that I've thought as a potential stepping stone in life. At this point I've exhausted every option and am completely trapped, hopeless, and alone. What the fuck do I do?
