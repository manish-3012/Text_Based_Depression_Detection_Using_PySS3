Titling these seems stupidHullo SW. I understand that most people who post here are suicidal for psychological reasons. Has anyone ever posted about the philosophical merits of suicide though? I can't think of a single compelling reason I should continue living. Maybe to spare those who know me some additional suffering, although to be honest that doesn't really matter all that much to me any more. On the other hand, I can't really say I've found a single compelling reason *to* commit suicide, either. I don't have any reason to keep living, but I can't seem to quell my apathy long enough to actually act.

I guess what I'm really driving at is, since either option available to me ends the same, is there really any significance in making a choice? And if not, then I really can't imagine not killing myself.
