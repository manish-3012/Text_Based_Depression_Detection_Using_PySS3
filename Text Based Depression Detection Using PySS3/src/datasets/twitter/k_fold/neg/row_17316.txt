I want to try again.I tried to jump off the 9th floor 3 weeks ago but fell and hit my head after fainting from the fear of heights and I regret not falling forward. 

Iâ€™m in a mental hospital now because I thought I could stay here and get help so the girl I love doesnâ€™t have to go through knowing I was trying to kill myself.  In the hospital I was sexually and physically abused by a different girl who fell for me. That happened because I rejected her. This is the second time Iâ€™m being abused in this hospital and Iâ€™m starting to want to find the head of the hospital and kill him. I donâ€™t want these thoughts.. and he did nothing to the girl obviously. If this was the other way around I would have been kicked out. By tomorrow Iâ€™m going to jump the fence and escape this mental hospital. I canâ€™t live on this planet much longer. I wish you didnâ€™t tell me that I didnâ€™t love you over and over because I do love you and Iâ€™ll always love you vered.
