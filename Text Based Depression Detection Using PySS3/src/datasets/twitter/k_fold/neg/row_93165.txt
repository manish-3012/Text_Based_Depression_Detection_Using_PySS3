Came here for answers but seeing most of you are early 20's or younger. You haven't even experienced enough of life to give up so fast.Here I am approaching middle age having lived with unipolar depression and acute anxiety my entire life. Always running from that inevitable dark cloud. The last 16 years w/o even any meds and only NOW am I done with all this shit. I don't mean to be so crass or insensitive, but being a teenager to early 20's really gives you such a minute amount of your life, I struggle to comprehend how thin skinned some of you are. Fucking christ, it's just a bunch of sad sacks around here. Make an effort, live your life as an adult for at least a decade, AT LEAST, and if those emotions are still there when you're middle aged then I'd say you've considered it long enough and know what you want by then. Your attitudes make my upcoming farewell put a bad taste in my mouth. I don't want anyone feeling sorry for me now, or when I'm gone. Guess that's the difference. I see my illness as my struggle and mine alone. Younger me did feel better shifting part of the burden to others, but if you truly believe you're alone in this world you can learn to manage that demon until you've at least made an attempt at life.
