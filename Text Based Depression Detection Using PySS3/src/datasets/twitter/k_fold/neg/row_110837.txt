Im not sure if this belongs here, but I met a user who is in needThey posted to r/confessions about how they plan to kill themselves, stating they would do it after they move and they would do it by drinking fenni-something, it was a chemical. I tried talking to them but they seem deadset on it. Based on their lack of post history and account age I'm guessing it might be real. But the post they made just got too real for it to be a joke. I'm gonna post their username below, I just want somehow who more experienced in helping to help them. God knows I don't know how.
