Why the fuck does no one listen to meIâ€™ve been depressed for about the past 6 years and I cut my way through 4 of those years. Iâ€™ve attempted and been open about the fantasies Iâ€™ve had about committing with both friends and family. Regardless of asking for help Iâ€™m still the friend that walks on the grass and mud instead of the sidewalk and I still get told that my interests are dumb. I know my sisters needs more attention that I do becuase of her court shit and pending charges but I feel like I still deserve to be heard but no one listens. When I talk to someone they make it about themselves so Iâ€™ve just been letting them. Cuz when I do die maybe they will think back to how shitty they were.
