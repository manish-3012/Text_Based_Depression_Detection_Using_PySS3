I'm dreading college graduationCollege graduation is just around the corner. Yet I dread graduating because I still have not locked down an engineering job. I grew up in a small town that doesn't have a ton of opportunity, and thus it would be hard to "network" or make new friends who could help me land something. People tell me to not worry I have experience but it isn't enough. Everyone these days has had at least one summer internship. A friend of mine told me a friend of his may get me an interview for a position starting January but that isn't a guarentee. I have a bad habit of not keeping in touch. 

I just turned 27 a month ago and if getting a real career at 27 isn't bad enough already I can't imagine how pathetic it would be to not start a career until 28 or 30. There is nothing positive about being a late bloomer, it's  just another word for loser.

With girls it's even worse. Most people my age or younger are already in serious relationships and about to get married. I only had 1 girlfriend in my life so I have no where near enough experience for a wife. 

"Everyone moves at their own pace" was something my mom always said. Yet the guys who move faster get better everything and are liked more by everyone. 

I don't want to marry a former slut who had sex with more than 10 guys. Yet the only girls over 25 who arent sluts are either in serious relationships or fat. I don't want the table scraps of early bloomers. 

I decided if I don't get a job 2 months after graduation I'm going end my life. It will hurt my parents but 10 years from now they will forget I even existed.
