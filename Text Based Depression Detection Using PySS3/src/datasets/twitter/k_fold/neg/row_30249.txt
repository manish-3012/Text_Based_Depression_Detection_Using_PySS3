I'm lost in painI'm having atacks at nights. I'm shaking, ticking and crying a lot(really a lot, and It gets worse in each day). I don't have mental illness(as far as I know) it's all about depression caused my self-hatred. I tried talk with some "friend" that I have. They tried to help a bit through talking but then they just stop trying. Probably they think it's useless because i didn't get even a bit better through many years or they just basicaly don't want to talk with me because they think i'm a cold, disgracefull useless piece of shit.  This makes my self-hatred even worse. They dont even try to talk if i dont push them. Nobody's asking if i'm good or bad even tough they know my mental condition. Also i have only 3-4 friends which i never met face-to-face, only in internet. I don't feel like this pain will stop. Only solution that i can find is suicide but i'm too afraid of physical pain(altough i'm a cutter) and possibility of surviving with a disability. I'm also afraid of to talk with a psychologist because i'm too shy and i don't want my famility to know who i am in truth. I have a lot more to tell but... I'm so lonely that i ask for help in reddit... Please, i really need to talk with someone before i compeletly lose it.
