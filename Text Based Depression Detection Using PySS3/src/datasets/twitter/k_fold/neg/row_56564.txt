I need helpMy girlfriend tried to commit suicide last night while I was asleep. She is a type one diabetic and luckily the smell of the insulin woke me up. It took me 10-20 minutes to convince her to drink some sugar to fix her sugars. I don't know what to do or how to support her I think I know what has got her to this situation but would rather not say it here. I'm at a loss for what to do everything was going so well but I guess this says otherwise. This is the 3rd time I've stopped her from ending it and I just can't find a way to make it better. I'm trying to get her to get professional help but she seems to think it doesn't work considering she did it for one year previously. I am deeply in love with her and don't want her to do this and am trying to get her to know that there is something worth living for but at the same time she asked me to let her die last night and I couldn't accept that. If she is not happy in this world should I keep stopping her or is that me being selfish? I just don't know what to do anymore.
