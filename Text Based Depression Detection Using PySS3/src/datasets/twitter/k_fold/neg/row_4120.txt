Why am i even here?......This will be kinda long,very sorry!!

Ive gained deppression at a young age.......i was 9 maybe? I cant even remember....my grandmother always complains that i used to be sutch a great kid. Doing all my chores...and makeing the bed........now i dont even eat....i know not many peoole even want to hear this. You dont know me. You dont know my life.....nor want to...but....i just want to share my true feelings with somehing for the first time in my life- ever sence i began the age of 10 things went down hill.... i started loseing my charisma...and my well known overall happyness....

School is hell . Not just because of the tests..but because of the people . The teachers dont care about you well being, they pretend to when people are around to make them look sweeter...but when your alome with them, they just brush you off and tell you your fine. And my classmates....our class in our school....were the 'chaotic' group.......heck....our afternoon teacher just quit infront of us today because " they wont listen!! This is horrible!! I quit!!" End.quote.....im only young...not 20.....i just want some suport.....to help me get away from here....

Recently i made a few friends....i regret it so mutch now...im a part of the LGBT+ Community....and my class is basicaly homofibic....and this one girl....shes a total bitch...fake,ignorant,and sweet all none the less....she makes me feel horrible about everything....and yet she dosent know it.....she has no clue on what she does to my mental health......

I have to end this quickly.....my grandmothers getting up......


I hope you all know that your magnificent......bye
