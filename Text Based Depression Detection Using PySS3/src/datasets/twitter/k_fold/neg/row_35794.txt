I just want to be done with it allI lost my job a week ago and have no prospects yet. I'm living with family that is also having money issues. My SO of over 6 months has had a stroke and seizures for the last 2 months. I'm playing caretaker to her caring her back and forth to work, physical therapy and various doctors appointments and yet she still manages to stay mad at me for being an "inconsiderate driver" and being "to anal" about how things get done (backstory: yes I am an only child). I just feel like a burden to everyone around me. They'd be better off without me around I think
