To die now, or die at a hundred. Except for time, what is the difference?Because you can't take your memories with you when you go.

And WHY ASSUME happiness is the most important thing? What good reasons do I have for believing that?

So why live, pretending a better house, car etc. is important, knowing the things we want are outdated in five years, causing us to want newer things again, year after year. If things weren't invented, you wouldn't desire them.

It's a trap. It's a lie. A cycle of death.

All the things we do, places we go, memories we cherish all get flushed away with history in the end. Why deceive ourselves progress is worth it, when really it is meaningless?

What's wrong with leaving now?
