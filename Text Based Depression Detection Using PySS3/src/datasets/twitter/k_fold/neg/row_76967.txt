Just wanted to tell this anonymouslyI was sent to prison for a crime I did not commit. I was told to plead guilty, I trusted my brief, I don't know what went on but I was sent to prison.

I am autistic.

I had a breakdown while inside, the prison staff were really nice and helped the best they could, and since then, every single morning I think about suicide for at least an hour. My character has been ruined and I have nothing to live for, I can't get a job - I've applied for over 600 jobs and no one returns my application.

I'm trying to train as a grafter, but can't afford the courses. It's a complete spiral. I am utterly worthless.
