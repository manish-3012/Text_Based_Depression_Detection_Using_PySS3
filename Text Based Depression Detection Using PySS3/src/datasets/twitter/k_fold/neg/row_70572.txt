Extreme BoredomSo I feel very different than a lot of posts on here, yet feel like I'm in the same result. On paper I have a very good life; steady job, married, have a good relationship with family, no money issues at all. Yet I find myself constantly bored which has made me really start to contemplate suicide and how. I know that the obvious advice is to find groups or clubs and do stuff, yet I've attempted that, but due to a combination of factors (I don't live in a city or near a city, so as much as I'd like to play soccer and basketball, I've spent years looking for an adult league and have failed to find one) this has been impossible. I just feel every day is exactly the same. I go to work, go home, cook dinner, talk to my wife, watch some tv or play a game, read, go to bed, get up and do it again. I just don't want to do any of this anymore. Part of me feels like its disgraceful though to kill myself when people out there have so many worse problems (being abused, money issues, etc). My whole life I've been relatively well liked and never needed anything and yet here I am. Anyway, I just wanted to put this out there as I feel like my mind is right at that point.
