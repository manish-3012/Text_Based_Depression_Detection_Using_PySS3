why bother?I've been suicidal for 17 years now, starting at 13 years old. I had no interest in participation in society. I feel like the planet is on fire, and somehow worse than I ever could have predicted.

what gets me the worst isn't even my own emotional trauma from being repeatedly sexually assaulted and beaten repeatedly as a teenager, it's the horror of perception, the pain of others.

It's all I can see. everywhere I look, with anything I read, I can't escape this overwhelming dread.

I went batshit and attempted to drive my life as far into the ground as possible. heavy drinking, dating and having unprotected sex with sex workers, sharing heroin needles, intentionally making it impossible to ever get out of debt, etc. yet here I am, the guilt of my experience is immense. 


I've never been more ready to catch the bus. I am a useless parasite on the welfare system, just bumming out everybody I know. 

I just want to die so badly, I hate it here. I take take much more, it's been 2 years since my last attempt and honestly I would have been better off if I didn't get narcan'd back to life. 

sorry for the rant
