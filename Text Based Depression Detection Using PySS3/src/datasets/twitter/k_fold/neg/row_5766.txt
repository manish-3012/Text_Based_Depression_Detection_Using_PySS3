I just got my $1200 from the government. And I'm either going to buy a car, or a shotgun.Been suffering from Tinnitus since I was 18, and I'm not too sure what the culprit is. I make music so maybe it's from hearing loss? But I was also told I have TMJ disorder when I was 18, and recently I've found that putting pressure on my neck makes the Tinnitus worse.

I've been too scared to see any doctors or specialists due to the way they've "helped" me. it's always a ton of "maybes" and "hope so". And if you've had the misfortune of seeing an ENT you'd know how incompetent they are.

This has ruined my quality of life for nearly 4 years. And I understand nobody will really understand how this affects me. but obviously it affects me deeply. 
So yeah. I'm going to cash my check, schedule an appointment Monday, and if I'm told I can't be helped then I'm going to sit on the edge of a building and blow my brains out. 

I've already got the shotgun picked out from a local store.
I've already got the car I want picked out as well.

Here's hoping I don't have to kill myself. although I've already prepared for both outcomes.
