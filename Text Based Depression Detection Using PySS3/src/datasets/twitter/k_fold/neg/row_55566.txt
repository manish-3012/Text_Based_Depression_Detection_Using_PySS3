Guess what day it is today?It's my birthday, a friday and guess where I am?  Sitting alone at my computer at home.  

I'm so fucking down.  There's this girl I've been talking to, I let her know Monday that it was my birthday on Friday and would appreciate some company, just sit and watch a movie together, something that we've done before.  She said she may have plans but they weren't set in stone.  I guess she's not interested in me because she told me she was busy today. 

She's hard to get a hold of and takes hours to respond to text.  She just seems overall uninterested in me.  As the few girls I've tried to date in the past have turned out. 

I'm just alone and I'm running out of the ability to just shrug off uninterested girl after uninterested girl.  

I don't drink or party and I guess that's more important to women around my age (23) than a nice stable guy.  

There's really no point to life.  I go through life, I put myself out there, I get hurt and I retreat.  Rinse and repeat.  You work to live and live to work.  I don't have a job I'm happy with and nothing is going to change soon.  My current job has me working 11-12 hour days with no breaks on regular occasion.  

I'm physically and emotionally tired.  I wish I had been born a better person.  A smarter more social person.  A person who can drink alcohol and have a good time.  

Fuck, I really hope reincarnation is real.
