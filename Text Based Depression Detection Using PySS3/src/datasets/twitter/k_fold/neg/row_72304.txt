AnxiousI didnt know where to put this so tell me if it doesnt belong here and ill remove it but i just needed to get this out. 
Ive been to the ED so many times in the last uear and a half due to my own decisions... 5 1/2 weeks ago i broke my hand out of frustration by punching a pole and ended up there again. After i got home my poor friend/flatmate got really frustrated with me and told me that she was starting to think i self harmed for attention. We had a huge fight and made up over it that same night. I know she didnt mean it and i know she feels bad for it, and i know i shouldnt let what happened in the past shape me now, but thats where i get to the point of this post. On sunday i ended up in ED due to back pain, so something completely out of my control. But i was anxious going in, like they were gonna think i was faking, and the longer i was in there, the longer they couldnt figure out what was causing it, especially because i had been ill in the morning, the more anxious i got that they thought i was faking for attention. I know now that obviously the drs knew something was wrong because my heart rate was up, my blood pressure was down, i was noticably in pain, i was sweating like crazy even though my temp was normal... they saw me within the hour and put an iv in within 2. My point is that what my friend said to me in the heat of frustration has really affected me, i get this paranoia, that i know later is stupid, but in the moment i feel terrible, i feel anxious and then later i just feel stupid for feeling like that. Does anyone else get like that? Have you ever had someone say something simple that had affected you? Or is it just me and am i overreacting?
