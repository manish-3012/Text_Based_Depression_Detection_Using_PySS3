Is really worth itI wake up each day feeling like my world isnt worth the fight to push through. I hate my life, I hate myself for being too emotionally attached to people.

I try not justify everyones love but it's so hard when you don't receive the same amount for fucks back.

I end up pushing everyone away because i think it is the best thing to do.

Every second every hour every day everytime I can't get away from it no matter so hard I try.

I really just want to die.
