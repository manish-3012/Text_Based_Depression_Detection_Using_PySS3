What will happen if I tell my therapist that I am suicidal?What are the implications? I am 17 and very scared and reluctant to tell anyone but I also feel that if I don't get help I am going to do end up doing something I regret. While I don't care much about my own life I couldn't bear the thought of my parents suffering because of me. Anyways... what I'm wondering is what the process will be like after telling them. Will I be sent to a psychiatric ward and would I have much choice in the matter?
