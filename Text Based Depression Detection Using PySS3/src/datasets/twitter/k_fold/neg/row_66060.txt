I canâ€™t do anything rightIâ€™m not smart enough to come up with my own ideas.  Iâ€™m not hardworking enough to get things done.  Iâ€™m too afraid to do things by myself.  I canâ€™t do anything right.  I should have killed myself before everyone realized I was worthless.  Maybe someday Iâ€™ll be brave enough to end it all.
