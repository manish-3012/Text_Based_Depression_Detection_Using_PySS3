I don't know how I get through every dayOr whether I'm more scared to keep on living or of finally killing myself. Tomorrow will mark 2 years since I was raped (a word I can't even say aloud, I'm sorry for using it here) and every day I know the person who did it won. I can't tell anyone, nothing will ever come back to bite that person, but my suicidal ideation has been knocking around since before the new year. 

I'm so tired of being lazy, doing nothing to help myself, I'm failing uni and my degree is the only thing I've ever wanted to do and I'm failing it. Spent my teenage years self harming but I don't even have the guts to carry out that anymore. I just hit and punch myself instead. 

I'm sorry to ramble here. I have no idea what to do or where to go.
