I just donâ€™t really want to exist anymoreI havenâ€™t really had a bad life necessarily, so I feel bad complaining. But I feel so completely devoid of hope or desires. Iâ€™m not interested in doing anything. I canâ€™t even remember the last time I was truly happy. 

I donâ€™t have friends. Iâ€™ve never been very good with people. The friends I have had have been pretty superficial and didnâ€™t really care about me much, so I never felt like I could open up to them. And if I did, they still didnâ€™t really care. I donâ€™t want to talk to my family about things because a of lot of reasons. 

Iâ€™m 18, and I should be in college, but I decided to take a gap year after high school because I had no idea what I wanted to do in college. Iâ€™m not talented in anything, Iâ€™m not really smart, I have no goals or ambitions. Nothing. I just mess up everything. 

Iâ€™m so tired of everything. Feeling like Iâ€™m a waste of space, a loser, like I canâ€™t ever do anything right. Just pathetic. Not to mention that even though my family hasnâ€™t said anything, I *know* theyâ€™re disappointed in me. My siblings are much older and turned out very well-each have respectable careers and did very well in school. Iâ€™m just a fuck up lol. And I really just want to not be here anymore. I donâ€™t really have much to live for. But Iâ€™m just so tired. 

Just... wanted to get all this off my chest maybe talk to people. Iâ€™d really like to talk to someone. I donâ€™t know what to do
