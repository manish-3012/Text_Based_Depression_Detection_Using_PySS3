I'm really scaredHello, I am a college student who has been suffering from depression for a really long time. I've been thinking about ending my life for a long time now but today I think I may go through with it. I'm really scared because I want to be happy but I can't. I don't want to hurt my family and I don't know what to do right now. Right now I'm debating calling the Suicide Hotline either for help or just so someone can listen while I die. I don't know why I'm writing on this forum, I'm just really lost right now.
