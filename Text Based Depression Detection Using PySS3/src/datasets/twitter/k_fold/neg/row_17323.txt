Life is miserableI'm rather unintelligent and unattractive, and suffer from social anxiety and depression, amongst other things. Years of therapy and medication have stabilized the situation enough that I was deemed sufficiently functional to no longer need therapy. Yet I'm still in university going nowhere, having never held a paying job or been in a relationship. Amongst my former schoolmates, one became my TA, and at least two have gotten their PhD/MD.

I live with my family from hell. They are self-righteous and self-serving, patronizing and delusional bigots who treat me like a slave because I'm a burden to them. They also think of me as the idiot in the family, to be kept under locks and not to be talked about in polite company. As an example, for a while, one took to following me whenever I left the house, to make sure I wasn't seeing a pimp, drug dealer, or someone of the wrong race.

This school semester began on a promising note. I got in a group with someone I had a crush on, who at least seemed to take notice of my existence. The professor of that class was impressed with me and recommended me for a summer position with a colleague of his.

Shortly before reading week/spring break, we did a presentation that I was mildly proud of. This left me in a manic state, leading me to ask my crush out.

I didn't hear back from them and later learnt that they went out of town with friends, even though they'd told me they had no plans for the break. I still didn't hear anything after they'd come back. The summer position also appeared to be a bust, since I realized I was underqualified after the interview and couldn't anyway produce the two requisite references. I went from giddy to dejected. Now I don't want to go back to class anymore.

Last night, my sister started guilt-tripping me again for refusing to get a driver's licence. No one appreciates me for who I am, and I don't appreciate who I am. I'm disgusting and pathetic, and I wish I'd never been born.
