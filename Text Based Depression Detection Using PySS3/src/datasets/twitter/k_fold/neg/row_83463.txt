I've come to the conclusion that the entire world hates me and wants to see me sufferEven many people on this very subreddit hate my guts.

You want friends? "Hahaha, you're a loser"

You want a girlfriend? "You're not entitled to that"

You want a good job? "You have to work for it"

You want to not be depressed? "[Insert some bs fake advice here]"

You want to kill yourself? "OMG that's selfish" or "I can't believe he did that, *crying noises*, I would've done anything to help him *meanwhile just the other day called me a faggot and told me to kill myself* "

You want to be nice to people? Well be prepared to be taken advantage of or ignored

You want to not be taken advantage of? "OMG dude you're such a dick"

You want to be a dick? "OMG dude you're such a dick"

You want to wallow in your depression because you feel hopeless? "Wow what a negative person, you're making me depressed"

Want to sit around doing nothing because that's the only thing you know how to do? "Well it's your fault you're depressed then"

Don't believe x piece of advice is going to help you? Well you clearly don't want to be helped

Act weird in public because of mental illness? "Ewww there's something wrong with you wtf"


It's always you're fault. YOU'RE the problem. Not anyone else. Not your co workers. Not the people who bully you. Not your boss. Your parents. Not your mental illness. Not this stupid fucking society. YOU.

The only thing that's keeping me alive is the hope that one day I'll be able to kill myself and bring this entire goddamn planet down with me.
