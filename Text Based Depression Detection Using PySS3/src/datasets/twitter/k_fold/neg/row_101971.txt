I walked to the lake, to contemplate jumping in.I walked to the lake. I just want the courage to jump in.  I didn't so I made the disappointing walk back home. I took a few random pills. I'm hoping I have it in me to take the rest. Even if it's one by one. It's time to rid the world of me.  I've failed as a daughter, sister, girlfriend, friend.
