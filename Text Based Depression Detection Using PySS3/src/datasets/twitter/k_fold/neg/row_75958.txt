What's the point? (15 m)( rant)I'm just young and terribly depressed. What's the point of life? What is there out there? If I killed myself, who would give a flying fuck about me? Sure I have friends but they'll get over me, right? What difference would it be if a 15 year old fuck-up from Missouri decided to take his own life. Somebody please answer me! Give me reasons! Please...
Edit: I apologize for this everyone. I had a temporary mental breakdown. I thank you all who helped... Or tried to.
