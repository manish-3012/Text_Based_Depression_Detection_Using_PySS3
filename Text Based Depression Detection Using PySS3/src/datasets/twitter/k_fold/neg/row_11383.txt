I don't know, I just don't fucking knowI've been on and off this subreddit for the past week trying to decide if I should post something. Not that I haven't tried. It's just that every time type something into this box it just sounds like somebody elses words. It is almost as if I can't even believe once more that I would want to kill myself. Maybe it's just ideation seeing as I haven't come around to planning it. I just don't want to think these thoughts anymore. The last time I had these thoughts they put me in a mental hospital. That was two years ago. And two months ago I ended up in a hospital after admitting to a friend at college that I had planned to end my own life. And now here I am again. Had to drop out of college, living at home. while everybody important in my life is off living their lives in faraway places. I'm just an example to them. A sign post on a tributary they should not follow. I am just going to hit submit real quick before I change my mind again. If you don't feel like replying than I understand. But if someone can empathize, than please do.
