I constantly think about hanging myself.I constantly think about suicide. I constantly think about hanging myself. I think that will be my preferred method and even though I don't want to hurt my parents or girlfriend but I constantly think how I want to do it.  
10 mins ago, even if i been drinking a bit... i got my belt between the door and its frame and I tried to do it, just to get the taste of it...i went down, my face got really warm and ears started ringing so i freaked out and I stopped but someone i wish I didn't...

I wish everything stopped. I feel like a huge letdown. Not being over dramatic but i cant stop thinking about doing it. I wonder whats there after I do it.
