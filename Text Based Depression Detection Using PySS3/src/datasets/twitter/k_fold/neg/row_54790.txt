Itâ€™s my birthday and Iâ€™m more suicidal than everToday I turn 19. And I feel frickin worthless. As of right now most of my friends are going off to university, and yet I am stuck here alone and unsure of what Iâ€™m doing for my future and itâ€™s really making me want to just end everything. I constantly feel like a disappointment to my mother, who honestly is most of the reason i started self harming and ended up depressed. Sheâ€™s a very critical and not very compassionate. but thats a different bag of horses. i have no job, i have a boyfriend and hes lovely. he truly is but it doesnt even feel worth holding on for him. and thats so hard for him to understand. although i love him my suffering is becoming too much to handle. with no job, no future plans i feel like a waste of space. i donâ€™t know what to do anymore and it feels like suicide is the only way out. part of me wishes an attempt from years ago had worked because then i wouldnt have met him and could spare him the pain. im sorry to rant like this and im sorry if i broke any rules im new to this and im just reaching out to strangers on reddit in the hopes somebody might talk to me
