the anonymity of suicideI met the son of a woman who killed herself recently. She stepped in front of a train. It was caught on tape at the station. My mother is a legal consultant so the son is suing and trying to get the train platform fixed to be more safe...      


I found it really strange to see how the son reacted. He was devastated I'm sure but he didn't show much of it. To someone like me and my mom this woman's suicide... was abstract and anonymous. Anyone who he could tell the story to would probably feel sympathy but the anonymity of it means that there is a disconnect there.  


I often fantasize about suicide and its become more real to me recently. My belief system is falling out of place and my career path is failing me---for me it was more than a career path, it was a purpose. So without any beliefs and any purpose I really feel lost and confused.

I had a god awful childhood and really worked hard to strive for a sense of stability and normalcy but I'm not sure why it matters. So much was ruined and I can hardly even think of anything in my past that wasn't horrific. Now that the present is growing to be more and more stressful, with no future peace in sight, I can't think of a reason to not give up.


So after hearing the story of this woman who killed herself who left her son behind (no other family members), I wonder about the significance of suicide and how I guess it seemed so simple and affected so few people. The fact that the world goes on without you is a sort of sad thing... like for instance, if I killed myself, no one would care after long and I'd be forgotten. The actual part about being forgotten doesn't bother me... what it translates to---the fact that it proves how little I matter, is what bothers me.


It makes me wonder about my importance in the world and how little it would matter after just a few days. Some people would remember me but eventually they would forget. What difference does any one person make in the world?
