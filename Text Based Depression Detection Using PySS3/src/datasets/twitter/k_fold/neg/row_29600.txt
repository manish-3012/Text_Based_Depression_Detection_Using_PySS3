Confession and situationThree days ago, I left my children years 4 and 6 in the car for less than five minutes while buying a hygiene item at the pharmacy. When I came out, someone was parked behind me. I think the person that looked distressed and went straight to the counter as I was walking out was him. I was able to maneuver and drove away before anyone came outside. If that individual was smart enough and filmed my car with my babies in there... I will have to face charges and possibly losing my license and children. They may not have, but there is a chance. I recently divorced. In retaliation during, she filed a complaint with the board of medicine to use against me in court for custody. My license is still currently under investigation, and I have had other investigations in my past due to alcohol and drugs. I bought a gun yesterday. I have had intrusive thoughts for about 10 years. I have lost friends and family to suicide before. It is devastating to lose people you love so much in such violent ways. I lost the person I loved most that way. I hope nothing becomes of this, because my children and job are the only two things that matter to me. But, if I ever have to face the possibility of more complications like a charge for child endangermentâ€”I wonâ€™t, and am prepared not to. I will not face it. I can only ever express this anonymously. I want others to not make these mistakes. I want to encourage everyone on this subreddit to stay safe, healthy, and seek help if you need it.
