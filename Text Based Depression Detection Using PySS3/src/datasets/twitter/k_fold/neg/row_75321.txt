well itâ€™s happening againYet again one of my friends has found a girl that he likes and is now completely ignoring me. To be honest iâ€™m not jealous, because i never liked them romantically. However, I will miss the friendship. It is sad to watch someone say that â€œiâ€™ll never leave youâ€ and then proceed to not talk to you for days. Iâ€™m very happy for them, as they both seem way happier now. Itâ€™s just it reminds me that deep down nobody needs me. And itâ€™s okay. Nobody actually wants to talk to me, theyâ€™d rather talk to a pretty girl who finds them attractive. I donâ€™t blame them, iâ€™m not fun to talk to. I will just miss it. Itâ€™s weird how close you can get to a person in just one month, and then the second they find another person youâ€™re thrown in the trash, just to be taken out once in a while and looked at all funny. I used to double text, because i thought maybe they just forgot to text me back, but now i realize that they just donâ€™t want to have conversations with me. I am the type of person that people donâ€™t want to talk to. I talk to much, i complain too much, i donâ€™t know anything about tv shows, i have a trash taste in music and fashion. Honestly, I just miss a month ago where I felt like I was actually making friends. It feels so good to feel like you actually have a purpose (to be someones friend.) But now I just feel like iâ€™m forcing everyone to talk to me (which is true), and it makes me feel terrible, i just miss having a friend to talk to and call. I know i can probably find another purpose, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to be making anymore online friends. After 7 months of the same thing happening over and over again I realize that people online donâ€™t actually want friends, they want someone to entertain them and make them feel
better for a month while they try to find someone better. And that is also okay, but I just never realized it so now i feel like shit. Thanks for coming to my ted talk
