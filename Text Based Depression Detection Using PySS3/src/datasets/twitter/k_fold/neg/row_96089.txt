I don't know what to do about my friendSo my friend and I have been best friends since the first year of middle school. Since then we've gotten really close, and spent a lot of time together, but he has never really opened up to me about anything personal one way or the other.
I found out recently that he had been cutting and having suicidal thoughts for a while now, which he let slip over the course of a few conversations, but always refused to talk about it further. Whenever I ask him if he is ok he always says he is, but he obviously isnt. He never wants to tell me anything. He's also been doing a lot of drugs, but I'm not as worried about that.
I am worried that he doesn't feel like he can tell me these kinds of things. I feel like I have failed him as a friend somehow, because I am his closest friend that lives anywhere nearby and I can't help him.
I really don't know what to do. I don't want to force him to talk about it if he doesn't want to, but I also care about him more than most people in the world and want him to be happy, and I don't think doing nothing will cut it. I don't want to refer him to the school cuz he probably won't tell them anything, he'll deny everything and hate me for it. What do I do?
