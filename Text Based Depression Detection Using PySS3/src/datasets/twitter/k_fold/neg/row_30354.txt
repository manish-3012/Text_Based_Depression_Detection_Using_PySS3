x-post from /r/depression - I don't know what I'm doing.Iâ€™m not going to kill myself. I promise (for at least the next 10 years, lol) Iâ€™m not going to kill myself. 
Iâ€™m so sad. I know in my bones that life is pointless. I donâ€™t want to know that. I want to be a social, blissfully ignorant butterfly. I want to be satisfied by binge watching the Kardashians and buying lipstick. I want to be shallow and dumb and work minimum wage - Anything but knowing that everything I do, every thought in my head, is pointless. Intelligence canâ€™t be the steward of happiness. Intelligence is looking for a black cat in a dark room fully aware that the cat may not be there at all. 

I didn't read the rules of this space. My apologies for mistakes. I don't know anyone who can have this conversation with me and not be negatively impacted. My sincerest apologies for anyone that I have triggered - I am genuinely sorry. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I 'm doing. I just need to stay here, right? Stay here. Stay still. And breathe.

 I am safe - I am not a threat to myself or anyone/thing around me.
I'm sorry.
