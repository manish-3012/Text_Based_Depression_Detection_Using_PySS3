It's 1:32 am.I can't sleep. I can never ever sleep anymore. I feel so weak and fragile and numb. I feel like I should be admitted in a hospital. I feel like my soul has been replaced by sadness. I can't stop crying, I'm not even making any noise, it's just tears running down my cheeks. Everything is just breaking and falling apart. And the more I try to mend everything, the worse it becomes.

I just need someone who really cares about me. Not just because they don't want me to become a part of a statistic. Not because they want to be able to say that they've saved a life. Not because it's their job.

But, because they see something in me that I don't.

sorry that was all over that place..
