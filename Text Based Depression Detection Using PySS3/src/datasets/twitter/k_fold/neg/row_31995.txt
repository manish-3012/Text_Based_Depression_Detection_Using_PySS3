18/12/20Had depression since i was 15, only started to seriously wanting to die since i was turned 16, im tired everyday and the time i feel alright is when im about to fall asleep, my family has no idea, only downside to me ending it i feel is that i would ruin all the future Decembers for my family, i really dont know Y im typing this, im just tired of living, see no reason too anymore, my depression started from school, the rejection and stress just added to it, i tried to drop out of school to try and get my metal state right but my parents wouldnt allow it so its just been getting worse, as i read this back to myself it sorta seems like im lying but oh well i guess, jus hope i have the strength to actually end it when the time comes, to everyone that reads this, if your thinking about suicide dont do it, it may sound unfair for me to tell you not to do when im gonna do it myself but 99% of the time theres a better way to deal with your problems, good luck to everyone i hope you all live long and great lives
