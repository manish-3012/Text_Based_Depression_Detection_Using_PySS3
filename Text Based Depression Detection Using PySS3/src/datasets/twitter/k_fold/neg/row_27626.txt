My best friend may have just killed herself, but I don't know, i'm terrifiedMy best friend texted me a few hours ago trying to get something serious and genuinely awful off her mind, perfect timing for me, I was walking into a movie theater with my family as I got it. I told her I was so sorry and would text her as soon as I could. I couldn't stop thinking about it during the movie so I stepped out for a minute to text her, I sent some long message about how much that truly does suck and I hope I can talk to her soon and how she should never be afraid to talk to people about things like this, cause we all need to be the one that needs support some times, and that's ok, she normally stays up until 1 to 2ish AM, it wasn't like her at all to not answer at only around 9:50. She was having a genuine crisis, and she needed me, and I fucked up. She's still not answering me and I can't stop thinking that she killed herself and that it's all my fault. I can't stop crying, this is killing me. If she's not at school tomorrow I think I'll go insane. I'm so scared, I wasn't there for her. This is all my fault. I feel like all I ever do in life is screw up, but I never thought I'd fuck up this bad to get someone killed. She's the kind of person that doesn't like talking about her serious problems with people. She's afraid she'll bore people I guess, or that no one will care, so she holds everything inside, now imagine being someone like that and finally coming to your friend with a serious issue and they basically say "I'm so so so so so so so so sorry, I'll ttyl, bye!". And then I'm afraid in my message during the movie I said something that made it worse or something somehow, and she did it. I just can't get this off my mind. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
