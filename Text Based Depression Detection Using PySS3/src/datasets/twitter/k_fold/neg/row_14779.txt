I'm too emotionally messed up to fix myselfRecently my family have just completely ignored me, and they dont seem to care in any way, shape or form about me, I've always been an extremely sensitive and emotional person and I'm really self conscious about almost everything about myself. my  grandfather was probably the only person who listened to what i had to say and he was the only person who cared, i'm just not sure what i'm going to do now, i'm worried that i'm going to do something i'll regret
