Posting this makes me panicI've had GAD and MDD since I was a child. I feel like it's getting worse. Most days I can't do anything but stay in bed. I have no job, I can't afford therapy or medicine. I feel like I'll never amount to anything because I'm afraid of most everything. I dropped out of college because I'm a failure at everything I do. I have no practical talents. I'm not smart. I never know what to say in social situations. When I'm with people I feel like I'm having a heart attack. I feel like I don't deserve what little friends I have. I don't understand why they talk to me. I'm 25 and still live with my dad. I would be homeless without him. Every job I've had, I've broke down and quit. Now nobody will hire me. I make art, but what is the point of that in the long run. I don't want to exist anymore.

I probably only got 2 hours of sleep last night. I stay awake and worry about the people who are important to me. I made a friend online last November, we've talked every day since. They struggle with depression too. They reached out to me last night, and I don't know what to say that would help them. Because I don't know what I would say to myself. But I want to help. I feel like I'd say the wrong thing. I told them I'd be there for them if they need me. But I don't know if that's enough. I'm so worried, I don't want to lose them.

I'm so tired, I just want to sleep. But when I sleep I have nightmares. I just want to cry. I hate myself. I want to hide. I don't even know why I'm posting this.
