Everyday is the same as the last.I'm starting to feel like I'm at the end of my rope, I'm in too deep and can't see any real way to pull myself out. I've tried talking to people and literally no one understands, it's the same "just push through" "we all feel down sometimes" "it's a part of life" is it really? The people I once truly relied on or found any happiness in are gone from my life. My family is around, but I feel like at this point I'm more a disappointment to them than anything. 

Everyday I wake up and find another reason not wanting to be around, cause it's the same thing over and over. It's not that I want to die, but I just can't find the will to live.
