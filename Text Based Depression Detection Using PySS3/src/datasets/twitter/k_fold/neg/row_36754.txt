i wouldnt be here if it werent for my dogi was going to write a big story about why but i suppose it doesnt matter.

i was walking back to my house to get prepared when my dog ran and greeted me. she was with me for what felt like 20 minutes, just her and i sitting on the ground with her just happy to see me. 

i was closer than ever and im glad i didnt follow through

if my dog didnt run and see me at that moment i dont think i would be here right now

i love my dog and right now shes the only one that cares about me enough for me to prevent me from following through

when she's gone i dont know what im gonna do

idk where else to say this, i dont want to worry my parents, i dont want to talk to my friends about it, nobody gave enough of a shit to respond to my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7ncv2s/16m_i_feel_like_99_of_my_friends_dont_give_a_shit/)

one of  my friends saw the post and tried to help but i think thats about the extent of my friend group's help

ive been holding off on doing this for so long because i have no doubt all of my friends think i'm just faking for attention

:(
