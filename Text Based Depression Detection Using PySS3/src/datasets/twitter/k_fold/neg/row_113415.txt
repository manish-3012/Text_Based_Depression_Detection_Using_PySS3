Never thought I would be here...I'm not sure where I am going to go with this, but I am just going to start, so please excuse me if I start rambling.

To be honest, I'm not sure what's led me to this point. I live in a fair middle-class household, I have friends that mostly get along and more throughout that side of things. Things should be great for me, I am going away to college next year, everyone is looking to see my growth in my future, to see what great things I will achieve, so why am I here? Amidst all the love and support I receive from friends and family, I can't make it any more obvious to them that I am hurting so much deep inside. My mind has reached a point so severe, so tainted and twisted, that I think more lies under the surface. I hear another voice in my head telling me to do all sorts of fucked up shit to the people I love, including myself. I've been putting off this voice for almost 2 years now, and I've reached a breaking point. I feel like I want to scream, but no one listens to me; good thing I listen to everyone else's problems, though, yet I can't help myself. I'm too kind, and I think that's why no one will ever love me. I'm not too scared to die anymore because I've lost all hope in a god, and that in itself, is the last thing that scares me and keeps me from actually doing it. I cut myself, I drink alone, and like the rest of my classmates now, I have a nicotine addiction, thanks to the advent of vaping. These bits of relief provide nothing for me now, and all that's left of me is an empty husk, counting the days until my friends and family turn on the news and find my name across the TV screen. I don't know where to go to, my parents hear me but they don't listen, and my therapist does nothing for me either. If anyone I know is reading this, I'm sorry, I just don't know how much more time I have left.
