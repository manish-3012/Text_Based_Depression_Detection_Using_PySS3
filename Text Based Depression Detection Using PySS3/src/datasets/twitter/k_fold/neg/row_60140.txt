To live or not to live, is this even a question?I have many times been told that everything gets better but it only ever gets worse. I have tried talking to people both in here and in other places. Sometimes I feel like there might be hope, but generally I feel like killing myself.

Just has been wondering. Can you say anything except "it gets better" or other generic bs? Is there any real reason to not just kill yourself and be over with it? What is there in live that makes it worth living? Does life even have a meaning in the first place? Why do people not want others to die? Why do you even care?

Whatever, I don't really believe anybody can help me so just downvote this and help me take the next step towards death because I know that you won't help me get better. Nobody in here cares for people enough to do anything more than just leaving a comment and forgetting everything afterwards.
