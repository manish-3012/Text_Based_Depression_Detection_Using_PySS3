Recovery is a bitch.So I am currently in a hospital Partial program. (If anyone is curious it's Foundations Behavioral Health Hospital). I'm in the program for depression, anxiety, cutting, suicide attempts, and homicidal thoughts (Which are new actually). I've only attended for 3 days and I'm on the verge to a full mental breakdown. I really don't want to have to go through this. I just wish I could be happy. So Obviously it's good I stay. (I don't really wish to hear. "You can be happy, You just have to make yourself happy." NO. I can't do that, Sorry!) Now I'm not really hurting myself constant. Especially not now, If I cut myself once. I go to their In Patient Program. I don't want that.. I want to sleep in my bed dammit.  So Im forced to stick to this program until, Im magically cured. How does this happen, obviously they want progressive change to a happier me. But they can't do that. I don't just become magically happy. Sure they teach coping skills. But how far does that go before Im putting a knife through my writs. So, They want to put me on medication, sure! That is all great. But really my family can hardly afford the program. I just don't know how Im going to get better just by this program, I feel like Im just wasting money right now. I guess I should give it some time. But Its getting really hard.
I guess any talking support right now would be nice.
