I feel like unless I am genuinely about to kill myself, it's not bad enough to seek helpY'all know what I mean? I fantasize about not being born and/or killing myself every single day, but I only think about it seriously every week or so. I wouldn't say I have a plan, and I don't actually hurt myself often. 


I have just about every symptom of depression and ADHD in the book, but I feel like until I kill myself it's not bad enough to validate bothering other people. And the worst bit is? Because I think this way, if I ever do decide to kill myself or self harm, I will be convinced I'm doing it for attention, because I set it as a standard to get help.


Anyway I guess I'll just wait until I'm actually in danger.
