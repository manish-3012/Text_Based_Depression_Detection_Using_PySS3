I lied to myselfI told myself Id never get to this point again but I have failed.

The causes are as follows:
A) I failed the math part of my TSI which could cause me to not get into the college program I want. I already took remedial math and I still failed and if I cant get into this program I will literally never be happy because it its absolutely what I want to do with my life.

B) I have fucking bed bugs. And a nasty rash from their bites.

C) I watch my husbands family put his brothers and their wives on a pedestal and treat them so well and my husband and I are tossed aside because his religous belief is not theirs.

D) My in laws never gave us a wedding gift or card, and literally told us they were not happy about our wedding yet on the day of they acted like it was the greatest day of their life. I hate fake people.

E) All my friends live too far away for me to jusy drive and see them and its starting to become extremely lonely.

F) Politics.

G) Someone who I thought was my friend has just been using me.

H) My husband has this family that claims Family is everything, yet obviously theyre not. But my family is literally bat shit insane and I cant stand them so it makes me so sad that we are basically us against the world.

Im literally just so tired and exhausted and cant go on. I want to just end it right here. Im tired of trying. Im tired of failing. Im just tired. And I feel bad because if Im gone who would my husband have bur at the same time maybe I would be doing him a favor.
