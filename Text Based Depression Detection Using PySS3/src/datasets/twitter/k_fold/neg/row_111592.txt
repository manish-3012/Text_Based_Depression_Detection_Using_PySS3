Drug addiction Vs Suicide.To anyone out there really on the edge.. have you ever had a decent addiction? I've been a recovering addict my whole life. I'll go moths sober trying to better myself then I'll go even longer fucking it all up again when I relapse. And all I have to say is I enjoy my life so much more when I just accept that life is pure shit and this drug makes it bearable. So basically I'm saying to anyone who hasn't tried drugs and is thinking of suicide.. try drugs first.
