UPDATE: I have failed once more.I finally was able to talk to my girlfriend's parents, and after that conversation, I am ready to stick a knife in my chest. It feels like a thousand years have passed since her death, especially since I have only gotten a few hours of sleep since then. I finally spoke to her parents about it and they are disgusted, they don't want to see me ever again. They also tagged me as responsible, saying that I was too worthless to save her. I knew I was right. I knew I should have thrown her out of the way and died. I knew that I had failed my only chance at being a good human being in that moment. I don't even care about anything anymore. I literally have nobody to turn to, and I can't stand the sight of people anymore. I was always somewhat of a misanthrope, but now I am a perversion of what humans are supposed to be. When people smile and laugh, I feel sick. When I have self harmed, felt physical pain, or seen the strife of others, I smiled inwardly. I don't know why I am typing this at all, I am probably going to end my stain on civilization in 12 hours. Goodbye hopeful SW community, society will not miss me.
