The fact that Iâ€™m still alive amazes me! Either Iâ€™m a coward or Iâ€™m strong.Iâ€™ve had social anxiety since my first day of school. Self hatred and low self esteem hit after puberty and it bothers me that I donâ€™t feel like a man. Iâ€™ve eventually gained depression, started self harming. 

My anxiety and self hatred focused on my genitals as I got more into wanting to be with someone. Iâ€™ve never had friends or girlfriends and loneliness has set in so hard because of that. All I do is self isolate, eat like shit, donâ€™t really work out, watch porn, and play video games. Iâ€™m the lowest of the low unfortunately. I learned to hate being a man as I got older. Women donâ€™t find me attractive because Iâ€™m too feminine for them I guess. I feel like Iâ€™m being forced to be a man even though I never fit in with all that.

So one day I realized Iâ€™m bi and now working my way to be a complete femboy. I highly doubt Iâ€™ll ever find a women whoâ€™s into that and I expect Iâ€™ll be discriminated against because for some stupid reason girls can be lesbian, be more masculine, etc and still be accepted for the most part in society, while guys canâ€™t really do anything but be a manly man. 

Some reason I have this odd feeling I am lying to myself. I feel like I donâ€™t cut deep enough to be depressed, or valid. I also feel like I am trying to ultimately self harm myself by completely destroying and degrading myself as a man. It sounds so fucked when I say it, but I canâ€™t help but feel like that. 

Anyways long story short Iâ€™m surprised Iâ€™m still alive.
