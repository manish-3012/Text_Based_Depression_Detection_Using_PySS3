I hate everythingI hate everything. I hate random strangers I meet, even though I donâ€™t know them and they havenâ€™t done anything to me. I hate my friends that move on with their life when they promised they would be there for me in hard times. I hate my family for their stupid hypocrisy and disregard for my existence. Most of all I hate myself. The person looking back every time I look is the mirror is an ugly, dense coward. It hates everything, and yet it is too scared to fucking end it. So it has no right to be angry and mad at everything.
