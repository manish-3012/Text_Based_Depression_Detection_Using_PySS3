HelpI have a strange situation. I love the girl uniform of my school. I would crossdress as a school girl with a set of uniform of that and attempt to hang myself. After I wear the collar of the noose it felt so comfortable and I can imagine myself hanged as a school girl. I kick the chair slightly off and I love the feeling of the noose choking my neck. I managed to stand back on the chair afterwards. I don't want to die, this feels so strange to me. The urge keeps coming and I have to do it at least once per week to ease the urge. What's wrong with me?
