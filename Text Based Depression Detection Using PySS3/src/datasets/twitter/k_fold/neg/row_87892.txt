Prevention Advice NeededI go through cycles of feeling depressed and then feeling amazing. 

Currently I can feel myself slipping into a depression that's deeper than usual. I'm worried that I'm going to do something I will regret as death is taking up about 80% of my head space.


Does anyone have any advice on how to stop myself acting impulsively on these thoughts?


Thank you
