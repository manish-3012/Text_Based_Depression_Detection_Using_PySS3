I'm just a freakI'm bad at beginning things but anyway, I'm ugly. I'm fat. I'm lonely. No one wants me. I shouldn't eat because I don't deserve to. I really just wish that I would go to sleep and never wake up. It would be so much better. We're all going to die anyway so why am I being told not to. If I "have a voice and deserve to speak it" then why won't anyone let me? This society is just fucked up altogether and I want out. What good is there when forests are burning and people are killing eachother. It rather die now than see everything die before me
