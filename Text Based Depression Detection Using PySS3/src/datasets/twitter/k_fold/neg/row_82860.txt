Please help!!!My fiancÃ©e split up with me 2 weeks ago, she didnâ€™t explain in depth why she did it but ever since I canâ€™t get her out of my head. She spoke to me like crap but I didnâ€™t do anything wrong to her I treat her nicely as handled it in an adult manner but every day she son my mind and every night. I canâ€™t get rid of this pain and Iâ€™m starting to have suicidal thoughts thinking it will be easier to eat over it that way.
