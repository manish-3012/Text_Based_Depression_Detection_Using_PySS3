Other people are the only reason I haven't killed myself yet.I'll try to cut to the chase. I've had a very short but very hard life. I feel like the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of other people. I already feel like a burden, but all I can think about is how much worse of a burden I'd be on whatever poor person had to come looking for me, and find me. The weight of the world is heavy on my chest, and I want so badly to give in. I just don't want to hurt anyone else with my choices. I'm convinced that there is no hope for a better life. I can't afford help, because I have no job, because I'm depressed and socially anxious. I feel like I'm in a cruel cycle of not being able to get the help I need, but unwilling to end it all if it means someone else will have to find me. Life is far too cruel as it is. I don't want to end up being nothing more than something my loved ones have to clean off of a wall and try to distract themselves from when they see just the wrong shade of red. Every day the thought is in my mind. I look at things in my surroundings and think about how practical it would be if that were my weapon of choice. It's like I'm essentially shopping for the method I'm going to use to kill myself. I'm still making plans. Constantly. The only thing holding me back are two parents, a brother, and a SO. It's like I'm holding onto a cliff when I'd rather fall. Not because I want to live, but because of the horrible mess I'd make. I feel my fingers slip a little more every day. I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. I just want the pain to stop.
