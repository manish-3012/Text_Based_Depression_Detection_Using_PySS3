The feeling of nothingnessI literally have no motivation to do anything. Iâ€™ve been trying to go out more and make more plans with friends but I feel so empty inside and so irritated with myself. Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t even breathe right. Suicide crosses my mind everyday but Iâ€™ve made some close bonds to some people that would be broken if I died. I genuinely wish I wasnâ€™t so sad all the time and I wasnâ€™t so numb 24/7. All my feelings are so forced, I have to constantly crack a joke to keep people around. I feel so tired, I started getting high off of some pills but my tolerance started getting higher and I really donâ€™t want to take 10 pills just to get high. I wanna find something tHe makes me whole, it feels like something missing, itâ€™s like an itch you canâ€™t scratch. Iâ€™m really debating just ending it all at this point.
