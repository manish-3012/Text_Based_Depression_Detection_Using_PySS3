I tried. I really did. But I should've stayed dead the first time.I don't see how I can keep going. I can't. I died clinically for multiple minutes three years ago and I miss it. Simply not being. I sleep constantly because it's the closest I can get to it. 

I count down the days until I get my tax return. That gun will be the best decision I've ever made. 

Not that I care much, but it would be funny to see the look on those fuckers faces when they find all my accounts. C'est la vie.
