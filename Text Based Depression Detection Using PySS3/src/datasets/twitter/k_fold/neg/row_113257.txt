My fear went away, I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do.Iâ€™ve always been suicidal, but I would always have this fear of dying because I would think about what Iâ€™d miss out on, or things I may experience. I always dissed myself with my thoughts because I knew the courage of ending it all was something nearly impossible to overcome.

Yet, lately, it kind of... vanished? Itâ€™s like I started accepting that I really, really needed peace after being depressed for so long and how nothing seems to be coming out of it but more hurt for me. Now, I feel so at peace thinking how all my issues, problems and thoughts could just.. end.
