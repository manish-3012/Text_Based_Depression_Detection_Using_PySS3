When everything crashes.The people you love it starts to feel like you canâ€™t care anymore.
Your mind hurts your body hurts.
You donâ€™t keeps pills in the house.
All the knives are dull.
You canâ€™t stop crying and crying.
And feeling so fucking empty.
What the fuck is wrong with me and why canâ€™t I ever fucking die right.
