It's been 6 months since she broke up with me. I've tried everything. I haven't seen or talked with her since then, but every single day it brings me to the point where I just don't want to live anymore.I've been to therapy. I've been on anti-depressants. I've deleted her number, removed every picture and gotten rid of pretty much everything that is directly associated with her. I've gone out with friends and I've done everything I possibly could to try and move forward. I've been sober, and I've drunk and smoked myself into a stupor. I've met other people, I've even had sex since the breakup, but my life is an empty shell and it has been ever since it ended. Not a day goes by that I don't think about her, that I don't feel completely empty without her and that relationship. Every single day I feel like life is just hollow and pointless, that death would be preferable to the supreme misery that I live, that I try to hide from the world but that still dominates my life. I struggle with this every day. I stop myself because of what I know it would do to the other people that are close to me in my life, but the struggle is so painful I just don't know what to do. It's been so long and it hasn't changed. I don't know what to do.
