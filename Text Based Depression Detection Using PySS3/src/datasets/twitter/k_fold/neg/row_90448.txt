why is this world so cruel?good night. iâ€™m bella, a 16 yo ballerina with a really sweet family and amazing friends, but i canâ€™t do this anymore, please help me. i donâ€™t want to be here anymore, iâ€™m so scared and i donâ€™t want to die, but everything is so scary now please help

iâ€™m sorry my grammar is not the best, im not a native english speaker.

my biggest fear is death, and on top of that, i live in one of the most violent countries in the world. i was recently diagnosed with depression and iâ€™m so sorry if iâ€™m being childish but this is so scary. everything about it. i donâ€™t want to die. but i donâ€™t want to suffer anymore. i wanted my life to be cheerful and happy but this is so hard and difficult

my antidepressants donâ€™t do anything, i keep getting sad even when i think iâ€™m okay. my parents love me, and so does my puppy, my little mouse and my friends. why is this world so bad? i wish i wasnâ€™t born so i wouldnâ€™t be crying here now. i just want everything to be okay and i want to be happy too. i donâ€™t want to see people hurting, i donâ€™t want to see tragedies or dead bodies anymore. why canâ€™t everyone be okay?

i cant leave the people i love without hurting them, but how do i cope with this? iâ€™m so young and i have a lot to live but depression is so awful and hurtful and it never goes away, i just want to disappear. all this guilt is so bad, why doesnâ€™t it ever end?

please help me i donâ€™t want to die it hurts so much
