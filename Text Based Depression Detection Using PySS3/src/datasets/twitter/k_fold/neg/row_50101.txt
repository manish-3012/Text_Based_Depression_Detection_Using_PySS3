I am destroyedI've been mentally ill since I was at elementary school. It's got worse and I've had to spend time in hospital. Got 'better' because I didn't want to let anyone down but I didn't actually get 'better', just discharged from everywhere and a job.

I want to die. It's not an impulsive, emotional decision that I'll regret tomorrow. It's a decision I've made rationally. I just can't imagine ever getting past this point and anything ever becoming less difficult. I have nothing, really, to live for.

I genuinely feel that this is the end. I've overdosed twice but neither times had the guts to tell anyone and neither time has it been successful; just painful. I want to go now.
