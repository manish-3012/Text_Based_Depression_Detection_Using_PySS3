I feel like I'm at the end of the road.I feel empty. Recently my life has been shaken up a lot, and after a breakdown the other night, it feels like my emotions have just disappeared. Six years of an eating disorder and it's only gotten worse recently. It's the worst it has been in years, if not ever. I haven't cut in months and last night I broke down and did it again. And now, I don't know. I feel like I've reached the end of the road and there's nothing beyond it. I don't see a future. I see more of a downslide, more weight loss and scars, and then dying alone and disappearing for good. I've been suicidal for years but now feels like I could end it all and finally find some peace. I haven't felt this way in years. It used to scare me but now it doesn't anymore. Now it seems like an escape.
