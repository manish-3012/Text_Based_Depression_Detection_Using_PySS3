Sertraline 100mg per day and I still want to dieHello,

I take 100mg sertraline per day and I still want to die and get constant mood swings everyday. few hours I'm normal and the next I'm suicidal all over again. 

I've been recently experiencing some body pains related to my other problem,  chrons disease, and although I am also on 125mg  azathioprine per day I still sometimes get pain, so the only pain killers that work on me happen to be nurofen plus (the ones that contain 12.8mg codeine in each pill).

Is there any other kind of anti depressant that is stronger that will stop me from feeling suicidal all the time? Or do I just take higher doses of sertraline (zoloft  US brand name)?

I'm at the point where death by an overdose of some kind of pills kind of feels relaxing. Not sure... The thought of overdosing on something that will just put me to sleep and I will never wake up and just die gives me a warm and relaxing feeling. The idea of doing it no longer feels scary, it just feels right.

Problem is I am married and have a few friends that I would ruin  their lives if I did something like this. So I tend not to, or at least try not to, but I don't think my meds  are working.  I've been on them for about 4 months now and for 1st 3 months I felt they worked but now I'm back to the same shit as before.

Got a pack of 32 nurofen plus in the kitchen... just wish I could down them all. If I had no wife and no friends I would not be on here trying to get some help.

Oh well.... If anyone cares, not that you should, please help  me. The doctors are closed on Sundays I got no one to talk to.
