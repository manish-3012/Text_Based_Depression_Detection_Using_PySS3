I have this voice inside my headI have this voice inside my head, I hear it sometimes, telling me I'm not good enough, a let down. I'm not worth the hassle or bother. I've had a real crap time the last 2 year's, I had a nervous breakdown last year due to work, stress, anxieties, money issues, family issues. The voice in my head went away for a while. I'm having issues at work again, money problems which are worse than they were before, I have a boyfriend that I love to the moon and back but he doesn't understand how low I feel sometimes. Now I keep having this thought that I should just end it? I don't really have anyone to talk to, the people i csn talk to dont undwrstand. I don't want to be a burden or hassle. Just looking to see if I can talk to someone or get some guidance.
