31 M, anxiety almost always. Stressed about my relationship and job. Cant sleep well anymore.I wake up almost always drenched in sweat and anxious. Everyday man. I don't want to deal with this anymore. Idk what to do and i can't tell my family cuz they don't understand anxiety and i can't talk to them about my relationship problems. I barely get appreciated from anyone. I feel like nobody cares..
