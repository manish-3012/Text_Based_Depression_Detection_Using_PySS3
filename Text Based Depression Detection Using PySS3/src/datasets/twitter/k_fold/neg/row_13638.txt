I can't do this.Three months ago my cousin killed herself. My mom died on the 18th at just 47 years old after 20 years of struggling against her heart condition. I don't believe in an afterlife. I will never see them again. The incredible amount of love I feel is towards people that no longer exist, it is worthless. It is meaningless, they can no longer appreciate it, they no longer exist. I need help, I don't know how to live through this, and I don't know if I really want to at this point. There is so much pain that death must be better. I can distract myself momentarily while people are around, but when I'm alone the demons come and I can't fight them off. I can't sleep. I can't sleep. This is hell.
