Thinking about overdosing on clenbuterolHello all,

29F. 

I have a history of an eating disorder. I bought clenbuterol online from Thailand to lose weight. I had to send money via western union. It is because of that and the side effects (I get shaky as hell &amp; high hr and my temperature is regularly a little high, despite the fact that I'm not sick) that I know it's real.

My life is in the shitter. I've been depressed for years with little reprieve. Years and years of pain.

I was sexually abused and my head plays what happened over &amp; over in my head. I can't stop thinking that I'm bad and dirty and disgusting. Bad bad bad. I'm a slut whore and I deserved it because I was bad.

I can't date because I have flashbacks with sex so I'm destined to be alone forever.

They've tried so many meds on me that my doctor doesn't know if there are any more.

I'm having terrible suicidal thoughts. The only thing that is making me hesitate is my cat. She is orange and beautiful. And she loves me, and I don't know where she would go, as she hated the shelter.

I'm also afraid to die.

But this pain is so great I'm afraid to live 10 more years like this. It never gets better...

Any advice?
