You ever like wanna die but at the same time you canâ€™t actually do it? Thatâ€™s kind of where Iâ€™m at. Like my lifeâ€™s been so painful, and oh my gosh how wonderful it would be to just rest. At the same time I canâ€™t bring myself to put me out of my misery. Donâ€™t mind me pouring my heart out...I donâ€™t know what it is lately. Well I live in New England, weathers finally getting a bit nicer, things are coming back to life. Iâ€™ve been struggling with my health, and Iâ€™m not entirely sure what to do about it, but I figured that when it got nicer things would get better. Recently as of like three weeks ago I got out a terrible situation with my old roomie, he was very manipulative and just made me feel like a terrible person even though I was in so much pain all I did was come home and go to bed. Things got a lot better for the last couple weeks. But now I feel like Iâ€™m falling into my ways. I have this friend, and weâ€™ve been friends for probably three years now. Last summer we really became close though like we were really close before but we did everything together, I really felt not alone, I felt loved and appreciated. And then all my money started going to medical bills, and I wasnâ€™t as much of a fun person to talk to I guess. Sheâ€™s 36, Iâ€™m 23, and she ditched me to go hang out with a bunch of 21 year olds to drink with. I feel so betrayed, but whatâ€™s worse is she says she cares and everytime j overhead them making fun of me or talking about how much fun they have while denying that they hang out a little piece of me dies and then when I ask she says Iâ€™m attacking her. And like I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m ranting, I just feel broken lately. All my progress has kinda gone away, Iâ€™ve been drinking like crazy, and recently just started isolating myself to my room. I donâ€™t have any family, and she was my last friend, and now I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I just feel so empty....
