i feel so aloneevery day is the same thing. wake up, either feel nothing or if I'm lucky have a good cry then fall back asleep. parents are gone most days so the house is usually empty and I don't have any real-life friends.

the only "friends" i have are on the internet, but I can tell even they're getting bored of me. it really does feel like im in a hole that's only getting deeper and there's no way out. the scary thing is i've never used to think about suicide and loved life so much. i used to look foward to getting texts from good friends and going to various events happening around town, but now the loneliness is making just going to the kitchen to feed this shell of a body so difficult. why bother feeding something that you can't fix no matter how badly you want to.



this probably sounds desperate and pathetic and i apologize but maybe someone in the internet land can relate. peace
