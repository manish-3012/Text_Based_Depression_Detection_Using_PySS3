I'm over everything.I've been having trouble at home. My dad hasn't spoken to me for no reason in 3 months and if he does it's to scream at me, I have no idea what I have done to piss him off. My mum constantly ignores me and screams at me for no reason too. 
My friends don't care, I try to tell them how I feel but they ignore me to talk about themselves. If I want to hang out with them they say they can't be bothered doing anything and they spend all their time with their boyfriends. My mum just had a go at me over nothing and I asked my friend if she could please hang out with me because I'm upset and don't want to be here and she ignored me... but she's been on facebook so I know she has seen my message. I told my other friend that I wish I was dead and she said haha.
I can't move out because I don't have enough money, I can't find a job for whatever reason. No one will hire me, I've even been to an agency.
I feel like my course is a waste of time because I'm not smart enough to get in honours to be a psychologist.
The only person I have is my boyfriend, but he works during the day 6 days a week and I know I can't rely on him all the time because he has his own life. 
I love him lots, but I feel like I still love my abusive ex boyfriend.
This is where this all started, with the abuse. He still harasses me every now and again.
I'm over everything. I can't be bothered. I just want to delete all my social media and move to another state away from this all. I just want to get away or leave.
I don't want to kill myself and I never will, but I wish I was dead more often than not.
