i'm a fuck upi've lost everything. the love of my life, house, car, money, am failing out of college. my dad and sister both told me that i'm a useless waste of skin and that i should off myself. my mom told me to stop talking to her until i'm ready to not be "negative", which was months ago. all my friends hate me and are sick of my shit. this computer is basically the only voice i have. how fucking depressing is that?! i've tried killing myself several times, but apparently i can't even succeed at that!

it's like when god was handing out lives he thought it'd be hilarious to give me the "test experiment" life. "let's see how badly she can fuck up her life!" 

i get that not everyone has a peachy life. i'm well aware that everyone has problems or issues, but even when i talk to people in similar situations, i always feel like i'm still way worse off. Most people have at least *someone* who'll never give up on them. If there was an intervention for me, no one would show up! 

i'm a terrible person, and an even worse friend. oh and get this, i'm a mom, which makes me a horrible parent as well. and yes the kids should be enough to keep me going. but they aren't. i'm THAT much of a piece of shit. someone told me that i'm the most selfish person they've ever met, and that i don't care about anyone but myself. I corrected them and said "actually, you're wrong. I don't care about anyone, INCLUDING myself."
