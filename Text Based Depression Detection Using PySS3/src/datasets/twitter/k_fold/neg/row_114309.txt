The time goes on, I stay with the same unhappiness, I don't have a clue what to doI don't see any way to enjoy life, don't feel any kind of hype, ilusion or willing for nothing at all... I'm living to let the time go on, It has already been more than 16 years with the same feeling (I have 22), and every week I see myself more deep in the mood, less willing to wake up from bed...

I tried to search for a hobby, or interest in something like science, job, study, games, music, etc... I don't see it working, even would say that it makes me more sad to realize all the ton of things out there that I'm not able to enjoy...

Every single day, no exception, I think that ending my life is the only way out, I know that I have a boyfriend that loves me, a best friend and mother who loves me.. I would break her lifes if I'm gone, and a family that loves, I know it so I never tried to suicide and I would like to find an exit (a real exit, not a "just wait more, It will get better eventually")... 

Maybe I have something wrong or broken and I really have a "disease" where I dont feel any happyness, I swear I've tried a lot of hobbys, games and things...
I'm asking too much from life and should I just be pleased to not live worse? I know you can't just fix me up, but I would appreciate so much every bit of help. Thankies.
