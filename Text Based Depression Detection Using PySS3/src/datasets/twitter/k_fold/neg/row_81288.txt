I was about to kill myself but chickened out :( Now what...?Itâ€™s 3:26AM and I was just at the lake where I was about to drown myself. I chickened out and now Iâ€™m in an Uber back home but Iâ€™m so disappointed in myself that I didnâ€™t have the courage to do it... I already cut all my friends out and stopped talking to them, stopped turning up to work, didnâ€™t turn up to uni etc. I donâ€™t know what to do with my life now because I was so sure I wouldnâ€™t be alive. The worst part is my friends... I havenâ€™t talked to anyone for almost 2 weeks and I know theyâ€™re all worried because I get so many messages asking if Iâ€™m okay. I didnâ€™t even bring my house keys out with me because I didnâ€™t think that I would make it back home. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore...
