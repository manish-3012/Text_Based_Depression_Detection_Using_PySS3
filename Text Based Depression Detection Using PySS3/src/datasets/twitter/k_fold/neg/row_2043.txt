No hope leftI'm not even sure what to say. I can't stop cutting myself. I can't stop doing drugs. I just can't.

I asked my boyfriend to be supportive but he is not. I said, today is my first day without drugs. Please help me. I need help keeping busy so I don't get stuck in my thoughts. And please try to stay positive. So he takes me to therapy... late because he's worried how he looks. Then after therapy I feel really bad, bc of discussing problems and vulnerable... I feel the urge. I want to cut. I want to smoke. My bong and knife are at home. I ask to pet the cats at the animal shelter (nearby) so I can get through the pain. It usually will only last about a half hour if I catch it fast. I could pet the cats and go home and maybe not cut. But he refused to take me because he didn't like how he looked. He wanted to look good but merely looked normal. 

So we're home. It's been hours and I've just been getting high in my room and about to cut.

Do you ever feel like you've been battling mental problems for so long that you don't have the strength to try anymore? I've had lows and highs throughout my life and am not coming back from this low. It's no deeper than before but my energy and will to live is gone.

I just feel so empty inside I already feel dead. It won't even be a noticeable difference at this point.
