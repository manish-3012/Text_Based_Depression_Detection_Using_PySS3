Just ventingI have no idea who I am or what I am. This existence is like an incredibly intense and consistent fever dream. It started as a teenager, and I thought itâ€™d eventually stop. But it hasnâ€™t.

Suicide can be a beautiful thing. I understand why people feel the opposite. In one sense, itâ€™s absolutely horrible. Ending life, throwing oneself into the darkness forever and leaving behind anyone and everyone behind for complete silence. But this life is hard to navigate, and actually living it is like playing a game of chess where the pieces tower impossibly above you and the chessboard itself is a rough sea thatâ€™s infinitely deep. Thereâ€™s immense beauty to be found under the water but itâ€™s all too easy to drown, and to move ahead in life you canâ€™t live under the water at all. You must continue gasping for air at the surface and must keep trying to push the chess pieces that are so big they touch the sky. 

I wish we lived in a world more empathetic to those who wanted to end their lives. I wish those who actually did have no one but wanted to live could replace those who have people but donâ€™t want to live. I know that sounds absolutely nightmarish but itâ€™s a nice idea in my crazy head. â€œMrs. Smith, your son was a miserable bastard as you know and so heâ€™s been replaced. Hereâ€™s Derek! Derekâ€™s very nice and understands the world enough to want to be here. Forget about your old son. Heâ€™s gone now. Your son is Derek.â€

As Iâ€™ve grown older Iâ€™ve become more and more truly inhibited and silent in my soul to be a civil human being. Deep down inside if I acted how I felt Iâ€™d spin so madly Iâ€™d tear everything down. I just keep it inside. I keep it inside.
