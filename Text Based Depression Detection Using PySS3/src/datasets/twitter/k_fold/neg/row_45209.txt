Alcohol and Suicidal ThoughtsWhat I've noticed is alcohol causes me to be alot more suicidal than normal. It brings those thoughts to the surface and amplifies them 100x. And those thoughts linger several days after I drink. I haven't touched alcohol for over a month now and my suicidal thoughts have been few and far inbetween. I honestly feel alot better than before. Alcohol doesn't solve your problems, I hope this helps someone
