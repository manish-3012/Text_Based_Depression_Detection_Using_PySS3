I keep coming back to thisI planned my suicide for the first time when I was 8. I've tried a few times. The only thing really holding me back is that I don't want to end up permanently paralyzed or disfigured if it doesn't work. 
I am stretched to my limits and it's not enough for anyone. I am not successful. I am not worthwhile. I let people down. I've disappointed everyone I care about. The love of my life thinks I'm a terrible partner. 
I hate feeling like this. I don't enjoy anything. I'm in pain most of the time. I can't even have sex anymore. 
I'm ready to be done.
