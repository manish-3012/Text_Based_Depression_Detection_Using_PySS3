Killing myself in a few hours, just passing time...Been an outcast my whole life and have been waiting as long as I can remember for life to change...I am simply out of patience.  I have read the responses to other similar threads so don't waste your time with the same crap.  I would like suggestions on things to include in my note...I hope I have not forgotten anything.

P.S.  Posting through TOR, good luck getting my IP address...
