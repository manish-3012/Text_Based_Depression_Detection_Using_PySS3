Life is too hard to continueI feel like I'm a failure at life and there's no point in continuing. I constantly think about suicide (how im going to kill myself, peoples reactions, if people will even remember me), it gets in the way of everything. I get anxiety from just about everything outside my home (also thing in my home). I don't see an end to this. I can't talk to anyone about this I have very few friends and parents ar'nt an option. I don't know what to do, I don't want to put people through the dread of my death but at the same time life is just so painful to go on. I don't see myself living for more than a few more months.
