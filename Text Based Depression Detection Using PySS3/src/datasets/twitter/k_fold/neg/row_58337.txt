does this count as a suicide attempt?ok so iâ€™m pretty sure this is the wrong place to post this but i rarely use reddit and donâ€™t know where else to post it sooo itâ€™s goinâ€™ here lol.

i always imagined that iâ€™m like a pretty mentally healthy person and i was never depressed enough to actually try to kill myself, but i realized recently that i used to do some stuff that might maybe count as a suicide attempt? i was pretty young, around like 10-13 i think and i learned that some people can die if they fall asleep with a concussion (i donâ€™t actually know if thatâ€™s true or not lol) but after i learned that i kept hitting my head on stuff to try and give myself a concussion, and then go to sleep. i was like super half assing it though so it obviously never worked. but i had the intent of killing myself? does that count as a suicide attempt?

btw iâ€™m feeling fine atm! i donâ€™t want anyone to worry about me still doing anything like that lol
