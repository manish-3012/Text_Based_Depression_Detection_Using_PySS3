I donâ€™t see the fucking pointI see for my future a life of mediocrity. I have no friends. People call me â€œinteresting but hard to followâ€. I scheduled a psychiatry appointment so I can finally get treatment for my cyclothymja and adhd. Iâ€™m on a 3 month waiting list now. Yay me. I canâ€™t focus. My twin is on a trip across the country with my only friends and I wasnâ€™t invited. I have no life of my own. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m doomed to live life in my room and rot. Im a former athlete who canâ€™t exercise. I have nothing to put passion into. I just joined a frat because I thought that would help but I still feel so disconnected from other people. Iâ€™m the only one reaching out to others. I donâ€™t like my life. I want more from it. I have no passion for my major. I want to be better. Iâ€™ve had this thought for so long I donâ€™t know if I can be. Iâ€™ve been trying but I always feel overwhelmed. I canâ€™t keep my thoughts straight or who I am. Iâ€™m lethargic. I want to matter. I want a reason to matter. I feel like an accessory in the lives of others. 

I want to be better. And if Iâ€™m not Iâ€™d rather drive up to a bridge near here and jump. I know if I make the 40 minute drive and still do it then at least Iâ€™d have some clarity. Itâ€™s either I die now or I die later with only bitterness attached to my name. I donâ€™t want to be my father. I want to be different. I wish I did things differently. I wish I was different. I wish I wasnâ€™t such an asshole. I wish I was better. I tried to be better. But itâ€™s just me. Itâ€™s a nice day. I just want to take a drive to that bridge. I donâ€™t want to go to urgent care again just to figure out another thing thatâ€™s wrong with me.
