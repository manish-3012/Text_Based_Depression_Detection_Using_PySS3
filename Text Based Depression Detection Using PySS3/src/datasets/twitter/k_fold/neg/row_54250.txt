Every dayIâ€™m having nightmares every time I sleep, my job accused me of stealing from them and I loved my job. My sister is in the hospital because sheâ€™s doing heroin again and is pregnant. My ex lives with me and gets drunk every night and yells at me and so much more. I donâ€™t know what to do or where to go, I have no one that can help and nowhere to go. I have my kitty and Iâ€™m scared my ex is going to hurt her one day while Iâ€™m at work. This stress is more than I have ever dealt with and it makes my head hurt every day.
