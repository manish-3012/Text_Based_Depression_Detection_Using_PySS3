I can't even shower.I'm 21 in college and I really don't think I'll ever be able to be a productive person in the world we live in. I can't get out of bed, I can't fake a smile and I can't even shower. I'm exhausted by just existing and the depression keeps getting worse. I've pushed the ones who love and care about me as far away as possible... Because at the end of the day when they all say I have no reason to feel the way I do is true. I come from a house full of love and every opportunity to be happy and I can't even do that. I'm ugly and I feel like such an embarrassment to my family. I've never been in a real relationship and the closest thing I had ended up with the person getting married to their ex...(that one hit hard)... I'm just done... I don't want to destroy my family but I can't live like this and things won't get better I've been trying for so long and I keep failing. I don't know what's going to happen... Ive got the means to do it... Ive got a hospital number I'm just not sure which to choose... Because even after the hospital stay I know the "hope" I find will fade away much quicker than it came.
