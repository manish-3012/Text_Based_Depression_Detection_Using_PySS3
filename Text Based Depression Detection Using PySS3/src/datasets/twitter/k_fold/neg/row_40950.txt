Is it normal to think about killing yourself everyday?I'm only 21 and I do not see a point in continuing my life. I barely have time to enjoy my life between school and work. I do not have any friends that care about me. Plus I'm extremely socially awkward and a loser. I'm pretty sure this is going to be my last year alive.
