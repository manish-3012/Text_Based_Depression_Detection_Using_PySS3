I am a bad personI don't really think I want to die, per se. I fear non-existence too much for that. I just don't really see myself becoming less miserable or less useless in the future.

I am a bad person. A selfish, lazy, useless kind of person. The kind of person who spends his parents money on an expensive university that he doesn't bother to do the work at, and then wonders why it's so hard to fix everything he's fucked up when the year is almost over. The kind of person who knows he doesn't take good care of himself, that he smells bad, doesn't do his laundry enough, doesn't even brush his fucking teeth, and doesn't really care anymore. The kind who'd rather sit in his swivel chair, a beer and a bag of chocolate from his overly-forgiving parents within arms reach, and wait for the internet to entertain him rather than seek out new things himself, or try to improve himself. The kind that knows he's poorly organized, that he should set reminders for his responsibilities, that he could plan things out and stick to it rather than just let things happen to him and blame others afterwards, and doesn't bother to even try to fix his lifestyle. The fat kind. The unfunny kind. The kind that tells the same shitty jokes over and over because he craves attention from others that he doesn't deserve on his own merits. That guy in every friend group that everyone tolerates out of pity, but just kinda wishes never showed up in the first place because he doesn't contribute shit?

That's me. And I don't know if I still care anymore. Life is intrinsically meaningless, death is inevitable, eternal, and incomprehensible. I had a breakdown earlier in the year dealing with this revelation, and it might have broken something in me. Counseling didn't help. It only helped to just stop caring about what happens to me. And when you stop caring about that, how do you get up in the morning and decide to work hard at things?

I am a bad person, and I don't know if that's going to change. They say that life is unfair, that good things sometimes happen to bad people and that bad things happen to good people, but it seems like I'm getting what I deserve. I'm probably going to drop out of this school, move back in with my parents, maybe possibly get a job, almost certainly lose all my friends. I haven't bothered building up a resume or sharpening my skills, and I don't have an impressive transcript in the slightest. Who knows how long until I get myself fired? Or if I even get a job above a minimum-wage burger flipping hole in the mud? I certainly don't deserve any better.

Nothing matters. I'm miserable and I deserve it. The world could be a wonderful place, but I've squandered every shot I've had to live in it or make something of it. And if it doesn't really matter if I die in six months or sixty years, is there much of a point in just dragging it out?

I'm a bad person. Should I bother trying to fake it as a good one?
