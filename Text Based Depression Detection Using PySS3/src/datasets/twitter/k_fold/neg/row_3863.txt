Should I kill myself?I don't have friends. I live alone and I'm not close with my family. I get a call from them once in a while to check up on me to which I lie and say I'm ok. Aside from that I have no contact with anyone. I haven't spoken in a week. I'm losing weight so fast and I'm so skinny. I can't sleep. My mind feels foggy all the time. I don't even remember how to talk normally let alone have my own personality. I can't think much at all beyond solving problems and completing school projects. It's like I've gotten so dumb and lost  so much brain function that I think I belong in mental institution.

At this point with no help and no one to look up to , I don't know what to do. I don't see myself improving and becoming a normal human being in future. I suck and I don't have anybody, even in an off chance someone wanted to hangout with me I would just be a frickin rock and not say anything. 

Honestly this is too much. I haven't felt happy in so long. My body and my eyes are always hurting. I'm just alone in my apartment all the time. I don't even know when it's day or night. I want this suffering to end. I'm asking you guys, has anyone in my situation ever found happiness eventually? I can't do another year of this. Should I kill myself?
