I don't think it's in my head that 'nobody cares'I've just been released from the hospital for the fourth time after an attempt. This always happens. They send a psychiatrist to ask a few generic questions 'How do you feel? Why do you do this? In what way can we help?' etc. Yesterday, I begged for them to take me away, for the first time I genuinely exposed how vulnerable and desperate for help I was in words and explained I just couldn't function on my own anymore. Their response - 'We don't think that's the best course of treatment for you, it would just traumatize you'. I was given a card with a crisis number and urged to make an appointment with a psychiatrist, then sent on my way at 5am in a part of town I dont even know.

I live abroad and was attending appointments with a psychologist every week about a month ago with my boyfriend. They were just general sessions as it was explained to me that treatment is only available in the local language, which I'm not fluent in yet. The English treatment for internationals, I just couldn't afford. My boyfriend had to force me to go to these appointments and when one day we fought and I left him, I didn't turn up to the appointment and haven't since. There was no phone call asking where I was or anything.

No one cares. Not even the psychologists because I'm foreign. I don't think anyone takes me seriously because I've failed all my attempts. Yesterday, my boyfriend told me he wanted to be alone and when I cried to him for help, he completely switched his phone off. I was cheated on in my previous relationship and this sent such a sharp awful pain in my heart more than that. He hasn't attempted to contact me since. 

I genuinely have nobody anymore. It's only when people successfully commit suicide, everyone says 'oh I wish they would have just reached out for help!' What's the point when this is what you get? Tonight, I'm going to decide on another method to do it properly.
