The chronicles of a once hopeful existenceWe all imagine as very young children we will grow and do great things. Use that as inspiration against my logic if you please, but I know myself and inspiration doesnâ€™t affect me. Iâ€™m a privileged and blessed person who was raised into guaranteed success if I just got my education. I failed at that endeavor and let down only myself. I then worked for years and made what I thought was good money all whilst blowing it all on alcohol, drugs, and debt. Now Iâ€™m at a point that going under is the norm, and my choices are to go off the grid saying fuck it or leave this life saying fuck it. Iâ€™m not worried about heaven or hell, I believe we all see darkness after passing and nothing more until our souls are born into another life. I know so many live such worse existences in the world, and I canâ€™t help them. So what would it hurt to take one person from the overpopulated equation? My Mom, yes her, it would destroy her, but she has a wonderful faith in the tall tale of Jesus. He will answer her. I canâ€™t even answer my phone anymore. Anyways, carry on fellows, some just arenâ€™t meant for this. See you all another time
