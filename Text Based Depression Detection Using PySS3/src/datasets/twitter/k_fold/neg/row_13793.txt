I Want To So Bad... But I'm Afraid ToI've been through honestly the shittiest time of my life. Things just got so complicated for me. I don't want to bore Reddit of this sob story but it just seems that every time I have hope, something always pulls me down again.

Everytime I convince myself that I can make it and that things will work out for me, shit just happens again and I fall deeper in this hole. 

I know most people here are going to tell me why I shouldn't but I've heard enough of that. I want to so badly... the pain that I feel instead everyday is ripping me apart, it's ruining my friendship, my connection with family, my work. I can't take this. Everytime I convince myself I'm done..... at the last possible moment, I bail.

Why Do I feel this way? Why Can't I just commit and get it over with? I don't want those who loved me to live with the guilt, but if I try to tell them that, they just don't understand what it feels like. 

Help! How Can I just convince myself to do it?
