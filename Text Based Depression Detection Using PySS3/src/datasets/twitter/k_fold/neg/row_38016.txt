Lost myself...Iâ€™ve always had some sort of depression ever since I was a kid. I grew up in a pretty rough home my father was an alcoholic and was very abusive towards my mother and myself. I have awful memories of him trying to hurt her as I stood in between to protect her only to get hit too. He was an angry man I would deal with that everyday that we lived with him. He left me traumatized and he left her with bruises and even a broken nose. I blame him for all my actions. I feel like he turned me somewhat heartless... I began to get in trouble and put stress on my mother leaving her worried every night if Iâ€™d ever come home some nights. I started doing drugs and hanging out with the wrong crowd. Kids that weâ€™re hopeless kinda just like me so I felt like I fit in. Didnâ€™t have a job back then and what hurts me the most is that I ruined so many relationships with good friends that probably cared about me more than the bad up to no good friends. Whenever we had no drugs weâ€™d use vulnerable people, good family friends of mine. Weâ€™d use them for money, alcohol and whatever the fuck we wanted. Got in countless fights and hurt many people and when I look back at it now I feel like I was no different than my asshole Dad. I started hurting myself I guess I learned that from a couple crazy girlfriends and friends Iâ€™ve had. I pretty much left scars along my right arm that still havenâ€™t faded today. Even cut kill me in my chest back then but luckly itâ€™s harder to read nowadays. I hate myself because I made all the wrong decisions. Turns out those hopeless friends I thought had my back arenâ€™t here today to help clean up the mess we made. I also donâ€™t have the good friends that Iâ€™ve hurt and I honestly donâ€™t blame them. I turned into something Iâ€™ve always feared of. Now today Iâ€™m nothing but alone and empty. Nobody to watch over and itâ€™s my own doing. Nothing but memories now. I used to be able to control the depression but surrounding myself with people and it was easier to get over. Everyday it seems to be getting worse. I feel like dying more and more each night.  Anyways my mother eventually built up the courage to leave him and move us into a house without him. Youâ€™d think Iâ€™d be happier but I was happy knowing she was safe and no longer being hurt because my mother is the sweetest woman on this earth and if anybody would hurt her now Iâ€™d probably end up in prison. Iâ€™m 21 now we moved out when I was 16-17 and I feel like Iâ€™m at rock bottom. Although now Iâ€™ve pretty much go to work put on a fake persona and smile and come home and cry alone in my room like a coward wanting to die. I no longer get into trouble and Iâ€™ve been treating my mother like the queen she is and helping as much as I can. I put enough stress on her as it is. She knows I get sad sometimes but she has no clue how badly I just wanna die. I could keep going on but I feel like Iâ€™d be writing too much. Just gotta cry out for help because I donâ€™t know how much more I can take and I just donâ€™t have anybody else I can vent to like I could back then. I have so much anger and regret in my head it hurts. Iâ€™m a decent looking guy I never had any problems with that... but nowadays I canâ€™t even look in the mirror for more than a second. I donâ€™t know if my Dad created a monster or if Iâ€™m just foolish and I fuck everything up. I hate myself and I wish I could push a reset button. I made so many bad decisions and I canâ€™t sleep at night with these thoughts and memories I have because of it. Iâ€™m not a bad guy I love more people than I hate but Iâ€™m hated more than Iâ€™m loved. Iâ€™ve had countless friends that stabbed me in the back and those weâ€™re the same ones I sacrificed my good friends for... now Iâ€™m left with nothing but my disgusting self. Iâ€™m honestly hanging on by a thread Iâ€™m suprised Iâ€™m still kicking to be honest.
