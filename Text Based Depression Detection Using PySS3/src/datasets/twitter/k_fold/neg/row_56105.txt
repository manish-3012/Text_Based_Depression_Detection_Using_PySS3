I'm not suicidal, but I've hit a new low and I don't know what to doI'm sorry if this isn't in the right subreddit, but it's the first place I thought of and I don't know where else to turn anymore.

It's been a rough night. I'm used to it, the insomnia has been the norm for me for years now, but tonight is worse than I'm used to and I've gone and done something I'm not proud of.

I cut myself. I sat in the bathroom, with my back against the tub, and a knife from a toolkit that I own, and I cut myself. I don't know why I did it...I've thought about it before, but nothing's ever driven me to do it before. Just one cut, but one was enough, and I dropped the knife and buried my face in my hands and I just cried, harder than I have in a long time. I feel worthless, I feel hideously unattractive and nobody wants me, and I can't even be a half decent friend to the person who means most to me in this world, and one of the very few friends I ever really had.

I'm sitting here on the bathroom floor typing this out, and I don't know what to do anymore. Honestly, I don't even know what I want out of this post.

Thank you for taking the time to read, I guess.
