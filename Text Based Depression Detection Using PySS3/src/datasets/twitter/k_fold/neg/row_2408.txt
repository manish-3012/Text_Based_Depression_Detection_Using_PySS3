I'm fated to nothing but factory jobs and I'm 19. I want to just not exist. I exist to simply be below people.I've always been trying my best to be the best I can be for people. I wanted to be an animator in the future and make all the ideas I wanted a reality. From the last year my hopes for this was rapidly draining. I so desperately wanted a social job, one where I spent my time talking to and helping people in person, but all there is around this cursed village is factories. My parents force me to work in them because it's all I'll ever get.

Even with my future plans, such as studying animation in university, it all seems like such a farce, a pipe dream. Whenever I have a complaint or find something annoying, my parents always just go "Well that's life" or "Welcome to reality". And if this is all what reality and life truly is. I want out.

I already planned on how I want to go, but what's stopping me is 1 I'm too scared to do it and 2 I don't want to abandon my friends and my girlfriend especially. I care about them too much.

I hate life so much, it's so limited. I'm just an ant in a colony of lost hope. Everyone's better than me, and there's nothing that will change that. This is how it's supposed to be. This is the true reality. It's only recently I learned that dreams are called dreams because they don't actually happen in real life, and never will.
