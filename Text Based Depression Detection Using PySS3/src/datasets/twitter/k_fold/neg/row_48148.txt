I can't do anything by myselfI can't fucking shower or brush my teeth, it's been 1 week and I literally can't, I'm failing school and my mom is turning crazy because of me, my therapist is a selfish bitch, all she do is talk about herself, I have terrible intrusive toughts about disgusting topics, I'm scared to be a pathological liar, pedophile, incestuous, cannibal, murderer and other fucked up shits. I keep having those thoughts and its bothering me, I cant even sleep at night because of them
and tomorrow is my birthday, what a nice date to fucking kill myself
