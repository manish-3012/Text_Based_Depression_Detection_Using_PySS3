I don't even have the balls to attempt.I feel like nobody cares about me on a regular basis and it drives me insane. I know that people say they care about me, and I feel insanely ungrateful for feeling so badly even after they tell me they care, but I wish I could just attempt so people would have to care. 

I've never been enough of anything. Never been smart enough or pretty enough or all the normal enoughs, but I'm also not damaged enough or sad enough. I'm not depressed enough to call it depression, not anxious enough to call it an anxiety disorder, not disordered enough in my eating to call it an eating disorder, etc.

And I feel like this is even more pathetic than if I was enough of any one of those things.
