LololololI thought I had been doing â€œokâ€ for awhile but then I took a step back and looked at my life and wow has it been shit lmao. Like I thought I was doing better with SH but turns out Iâ€™m clean literally just because Iâ€™ve given up on having any motivation not because I donâ€™t want to continue SHing. And literally someone in my life recontacted me throwing my whole shit out of wack and Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ve been experiencing my first couple dissociative episodes in the last few weeks starting with when I saw that name pop up on my phone screen RIGHT before my last exam of the semester and I literally got tunnel vision and felt like I couldnâ€™t hear or feel anything around me even though I was on a study zoom with other people and I felt like nothing around me existed for awhile so I just had to get offline. And suddenly my urges to SH came back strong again when I hadnâ€™t been consciously thinking about them as much and I always felt comfortable cuz I could do it whenever I wanted in my own apartment with all my shit there but now Iâ€™m home for the holidays and me being a fucking dumbass didnâ€™t bring any of my shit with me and I had crazy urges this afternoon and had another dissociation when I realized I couldnâ€™t SH without all my shit and my routine and stuff and I was literally sitting next to my nephew and couldnâ€™t even recognize him and everything felt suffocating for awhile until it passed and now I just want nothing more than to be fucking alone and with my stuff in my own apartment in the fucking dark and have the option of CTB whenever I want if I choose without anyone around to stop me or make me feel guilty or anything. And honestly I know i have nothing to bitch about like legit my life is a dream for most people, I have people that should make me feel better in my life and I have things to do and shit but I donâ€™t give a single fuck about any of them and I know itâ€™s all in my fucking head but I canâ€™t seem to make myself do anything about it and itâ€™s so fucking stupid like I should be happy you piece of shit but now I kind of see that everything is a fucking joke and CTB is the best fucking punchline like imagine having what should be a perfect life and so many people have it so much worse and actually have a reason to feel this way and you still act/think like a piece of shit like who the fuck are you even hahahahhaahahahahhahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHHA
