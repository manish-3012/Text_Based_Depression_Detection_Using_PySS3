I wish I had the guts to do it but I even fail at that.Long story short I've been in mental health care since age 4. I am 25 now.
I've tried every fucking therapy in the book and it didn't help for shit. I've tried every possible therapy in the book have been on a ton of meds and life is still horrible.

I have over a dozen of disorders/malfunctions so if im not in mental pain my body will make sure I'm in physical pain.
The few people that are close to me are also distancing themselves. 

I just wish every night I go to sleep I will not wake up again cause im too much of a coward to kill my self.
