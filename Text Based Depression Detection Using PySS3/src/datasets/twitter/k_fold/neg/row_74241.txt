I'm going to die without having my first kissI know this may sound cliche, but it makes me sad to realize everything I have missed. I've never even had my first kiss and it will be like that until I die. In a weird way, I think of this as remaining pure and true to my one true calling: get my graduate degree and then kill myself. My parent's don't accept me and my brother doesn't either. I don't have a family anymore and I left all my friends when I moved.
