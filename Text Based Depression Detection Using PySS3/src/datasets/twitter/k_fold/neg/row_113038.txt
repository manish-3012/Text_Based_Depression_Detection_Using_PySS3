Bye world.This is it.

Iâ€™m done with being surrounded by the disappointed faces of my peers.

Iâ€™m done with dreaming of a world where I wasnâ€™t like **this**.

Iâ€™m done with the hatred towards something I cannot control.

Iâ€™m done with my â€œfriendsâ€ who only make me feel worse.

Iâ€™m done with everything.


Itâ€™s about time I go to rot in hell, considering thatâ€™s where I belong apparently.


I would say itâ€™s been fun, but I would be lying then.




*goodbye.*
