Random thoughts of suicidehello, idk if i can/should post this here, maybe IÂ´m just being attetion whoring...
IÂ´m depressed and I dont want to suicide until I least get laid, (yea I have been always alone), or my parents die cause I couldnÂ´t do that to them. I think thats the only thing stopping me, What if in the future I dont care about shit.....
like I said IÂ´m not suiciding as of this moment, but itÂ´s an urge....
I canÂ´t relate to anyone, IÂ´m  always surrounded by people (not social but not antisocial) and I still feel alone. I dont feel good enough, If youÂ´re not great why be. ... 

Mods again I apologize if this is just for more emergency situations feel free to pm me or remove this

Any helpful advice is aprecciated
