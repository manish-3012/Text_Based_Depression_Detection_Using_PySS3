I'm extremely close to suicide, and I could REALLY use some advice/help.Thanks. I am a junior in high school. I was diagnosed with depression three years ago, and it's gotten a lot worse. It's a major effort to do anything, my grades are mostly C's, I feel like I'm going to break down and start sobbing most of the day. I deeply hate myself. My parents are cold and distant, and are ashamed of me and my failing grades. They brought me into existence, I should try to strive for successes- I feel guilty all of the time. I used to think I could finish high school and move before killing myself, because it would be less traumatic for my brothers and parents, but I see no reason to live or get up in the mornings even now. Nothing is interesting, nothing matters. I hate talking about my feelings, because my parents and friends would tell other people my problems. They secretly scoff at my weaknesses. I am so vulnerable and weak. Perhaps partially from my distant parents, I do not have any desire in having close relationships. I also hate feeling happy or smiling, as the guilt of not producing my potential is awful. I have a therapist, and didn't talk about my feelings at all- she would probably tell my parents, as I have no legal say in the matter. She knows that I don't want friends or connections, and keeps asking me if I enjoy hurting animals. She thinks I am a psychopath. Im scared she'll diagnose me as one and I'll have this label that isn't true following me around. I just want people to leave me alone. I want to kill myself all of the time- nothing is worthwhile. I probably will hang myself this weekend anyways. I had enough hope to actually ask you guys this- but I know nothing can change, I am forever exhausted, weak and alone.
