RealityLife is a game. Iâ€™m tired of playing it, and even if I do the right thing, I still feel empty and alone. I have no friends besides my wonderful girlfriend. She seems to care and love me, but sometimes I feel like she doesnâ€™t care/care about what I want. She does, we live together, but she just doesnâ€™t know how to talk to me to help me. I told her I think about suicide a lot and she said I canâ€™t do this, I canâ€™t deal with the thought of you leaving me and the thought of is today the day he does it? She knows Iâ€™m miserable, but doesnâ€™t know how to help me and I donâ€™t know how to feel better. I feel so empty, alone and unhappy. I feel like Iâ€™m watching the world from behind a glass. I donâ€™t know what to do. I just want to put my thoughts out there
