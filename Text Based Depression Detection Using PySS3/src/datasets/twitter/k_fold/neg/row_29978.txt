One more failureI failed ah exam for the 4th time. Of 5th. I can't even remember. I only know that I've studied so fucking much... And once again I'm nothing more than a failure. I am so sick of it all. I hate the life I've chosen to lead, the university I'm studying at, myself. Changing what I'm studying is not an option. And I feel myself withering away every passing day. I don't want to feel like this anymore I don't want to go home and tell my father that I've failed one more time. I don't want to hear him scream, berate me. Tell me that I'm a disappointment,  that I haven't studied anything when I've spent the last months doing nothing else except for studying. I don't want to hear him scream at me, at my mum, at my sister. I'm  On meds but they can't change the world I live in. And I'm this close to ending it all utterly I don't want to hurt my mother and other people who care about me. I'm so sick of it all. I don't want to be an engineer. This is not what I am. I'd rather be nothing than this farce. Why can't I be something that makes me happy
 This life is slpwly killing me. Why can't I speed it up?
