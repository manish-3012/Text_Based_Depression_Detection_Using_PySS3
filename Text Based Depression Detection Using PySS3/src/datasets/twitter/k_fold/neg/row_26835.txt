I used to be so happyI used to enjoy the little things in life . Now I canâ€™t even enjoy the things that I love . Food has become tasteless , drugs canâ€™t get me high as they used to , even sex feels empty with no pleasure for me . Work ,friends and family feel like a responsibility now. I am only here for them .
