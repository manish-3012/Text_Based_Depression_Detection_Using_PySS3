Mentally Ill people deserve to be treated like people and not pawns or agendasPeople love to pretend they at least respect depressed and anxious people (and I say pretend because even the more â€œsocially acceptableâ€ illnesses are looked down on and mischaracterized) but if youâ€™re anything more, youâ€™re a crazy person, youâ€™re hard to understand, you need normal people to advocate for you and itâ€™s so fucking transparent!!

We get groups made up of neurotypical people to represent us, we get media made about us by people who are running entirely on stereotypes, we get pushed therapy and meditation by people who donâ€™t understand what helps, we get herded into groups and forced to talk about ourselves to people that are completely different than us, we get scrutinized and drugged up and labelled and mislabelled for the sake of it, and Iâ€™m so fucking tired!!

Most insultingly in my opinion, the idea that we can be â€œcuredâ€ is thrown around for the benefit of the people who have to DEAL with us, like somehow being completely normal is the goal for us instead of being able to cope and recover and thrive with what weâ€™ve been given. And when we canâ€™t live up to that weâ€™re failing and hurting people and then wow look at how many people kill themselves huh isnâ€™t it crazy 

We deserve our own damn agency, and things that will really help us, and the ability to represent ourselves and help people better understand us, and proper resources, and for people to care in a way that isnâ€™t just them pitying the lesser folk. Which is all modern politics lends itself to. Surface level pity and fake understanding 

I am autistic and I am traumatized and anxious and depressed and I hallucinate and. Call me crazy all you want because maybe I am. But I want whatâ€™s best for me. And for people like me. And that means really listening and caring, and nobodyâ€™s ever going to do that for people like us. We deserve to make a big deal out of that
