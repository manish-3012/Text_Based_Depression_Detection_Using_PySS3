I found out that I was manipulative and abusive recently.It sent me spiralling for days, and Iâ€™m still spiralling on it. 
I didnâ€™t mean to be, I really didnâ€™t. I donâ€™t even realise when Iâ€™m doing it and I only do it because itâ€™s the only way I can get people to see something is wrong.
I canâ€™t directly tell someone â€œIâ€™m not okayâ€ because itâ€™s terrifying. So, I instead say Iâ€™m alright and then leave subtle hints that Iâ€™m not until the person asks if Iâ€™m okay. Sometimes I genuinely donâ€™t mean to but other times itâ€™s all I feel like I can do.

Iâ€™m now so afraid of myself and I canâ€™t trust myself because my girlfriend called me abusive and manipulative, and then so did her mum. She told me to stop manipulating her and her daughter and their relationship even though I wasnâ€™t. She told me to stop messing with her daughters head, and I took that as confirmation that I really was this shitty person everyone kept telling me I was.

**Trigger warning for talk of suicide, somewhat in detail?**

I said I was going to break up with my girlfriend, and then she bought a shit ton of pills and alcohol and was going to overdose. I called a suicide hotline because I had plans to slit my wrists and hang myself. We sorted things out on level, but Iâ€™m still terrified Iâ€™m manipulating her at every turn, and Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m being abusive all the time, so Iâ€™ve resorted to bottling my feelings and just crying about it when Iâ€™m alone. 

Iâ€™ve told her my fears and she doesnâ€™t even reassure me, she just says she feels like Iâ€™m shutting her out and I told her I wasnâ€™t, I was trying to protect her and myself. My god, itâ€™s a fucking mess and the suicidal thoughts just keep fucking rolling in like massive waves.

I donâ€™t know what to do. My mind is such a miserable place.
