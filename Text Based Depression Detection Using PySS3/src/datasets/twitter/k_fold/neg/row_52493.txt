I'm tired of being a failure.I've failed too much in life and I'm tired. If I just end it all then I can have one final disappointment and get it all over with. Maybe then I can stop myself from continuing to let myself down. Somebody please give me their thoughts. I hope there's a better ending than this current reality.
