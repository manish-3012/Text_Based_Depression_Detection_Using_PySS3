I made a mistakeI didnâ€™t take enough to kill me, just enough to get my stomach pumped. Iâ€™m an idiot. It doesnâ€™t get better. It never has and it never will. All the trauma and pain that I feel, that Iâ€™ve felt...

Itâ€™s not going anywhere.

Everyone that hates me will be given power over me, and Iâ€™ll never improve my situation. 

Thereâ€™s no point to staying alive anymore. 

I just came here because I wanted to see how others were dealing with this.

And nobody is getting better.

I honestly hope I die this time. If you guys believe in a diety, please pray that I die this time.

I will too.
