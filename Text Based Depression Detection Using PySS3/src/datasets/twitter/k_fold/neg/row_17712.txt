I don't deserve thisAll my life, I have had bad luck with people. I am the one who is always being treated like a worthless piece of shit. I don't do anything to harm anyone. I mind my own business. Whenever I tell people about this, they will say that I'm exaggerating or being paranoid, but I'm not.. this is my reality.. I'm too sensitive for this world. The people who inhabit this world do nothing but bring me pain..I have had nothing but negative experiences with people throughout my life, and it all seems to be getting worse.. I do nothing to deserve it.. I don't understand.. I will never understand..I don't know why I bother anymore..I really should just give up..I'm an idiot for continuing to live..
