How do I take the step towards getting help?Alright, Iâ€™m seriously considering this. First of all Iâ€™d just like to say I wouldnâ€™t ever kill myself. Iâ€™m nowhere close to that level.

But I REALLY have to go to a therapist. Iâ€™m 19 years old, turning 20 next month. Iâ€™m originally from Egypt and moved to the U.S 2 years ago. Iâ€™m currently in Egypt with my family and going back to the U.S at the end of August. I have student health insurance thatâ€™s worth like $700 (fucking bullshit), and Iâ€™ve not used it. Itâ€™s such a waste and this would be the perfect opportunity for me to use it: talking to a therapist.

How do I actually get the balls to make that first move? I really need to do it. I just realized: Everyone comes to me for help and advice. I donâ€™t know why. Iâ€™m overall a very cheerful person, always smiling 24/7 and that could be part of the reason, but what I also realized is that Iâ€™ve NEVER actually talked to someone about anything or â€œlet it outâ€. Itâ€™s even incredibly hard for me to type it to a Reddit stranger. Thatâ€™s how hard it is for me to talk about my problems.

I started using accutane exactly 1 year ago. Iâ€™m already done with the course thankfully, but when I started using it, I knew what depression is for the goddamn first time in my life.

So Reddit, how do I get the balls to do this?
