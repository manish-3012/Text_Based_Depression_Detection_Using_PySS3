My friends won't talk to me and I've been panicking for a week straightI haven't felt this bad since I went to a crisis center and I don't know what I did cause I keep asking one and they wont respond and the other says that neither of them "feel like talkin" and I don't know what that means cause they've been talking to everyone else and they've been normal to everyone else and they're my best friends and I love them so much cause they're all I have and I don't know why they're doing this and I don't know what i did

My heart hurts
