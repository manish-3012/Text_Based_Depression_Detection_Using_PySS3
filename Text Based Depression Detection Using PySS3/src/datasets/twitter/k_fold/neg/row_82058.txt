I've come to the realization that nothing will stop my ever-growing urge to end my lifeI just......don't care anymore. Life isn't something I want, I don't care about my life, there's nothing I want with my one life that I've been given. I curse whoever granted me life in the first place, I wish that I never existed, it'd most likely be a net positive considering who I am.

People try to console me and say that it will get better and that life is beautiful but they are only living behind a facade. I'm willing to deprive this earth of my future self, It wouldn't matter much if I'm being honest.

Now this is the time where you tell me that I will hurt my family, and you're right. But the thing is, I couldn't care less, I won't see nor know anything that will happen to my family when I die, not that I'd care if I could. Familial love is fake and is not based off of anything other than the fact that you were born into this group against your will. 

So as there are no reasons for me to live, I am sitting in my closet with a rope, ready to leave this planet once and for all. I won't be found for at least 3-4 hours so I'm sure I will die.
