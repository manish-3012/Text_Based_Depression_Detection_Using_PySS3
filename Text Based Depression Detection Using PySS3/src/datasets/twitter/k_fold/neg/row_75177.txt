Unhappy and in pain. Sick of arguing with people who don't care and refuse to understand.I'm miserable.   My family was abusive and horrible.   I am estranged from them and I am alone.   

I do not want this life.   I don't want money.  I don't want sex.  I don't want to travel or drive a nice car.  Most of all, I don't want to work low paying jobs in a dysfunctional country with limited worker's rights and a failing for profit healthcare system. (US)

I want to die safely and peacefully.  To those who say suicide would hurt my parents, good.  They deserve to suffer.  To those who say their god put me on this earth with a purpose I day please tell me what that purpose is so I can devote my life to fighting it.  To those who don't think I understand fully what death means, yes, I want an end.  I want oblivion.  I want nothingness.   I want to cease in all ways forever.

Your world disgusts me.  Your culture is barbaric and shallow.  Your values are instilled through lies and propaganda.   Your world views come from shows and movies written and produced by perverts and pedophiles.  

The best your world has to offer is shit.  Give me a genie in a lamp with three wishes and I would ask to never have been born three times over.  

Above all else, I'm glad climate change is happening.  And I'm glad thar I will go to my grave knowing the human species has no future.
