I donâ€™t think I was taught how to live an adult life. And Iâ€™m hoping for an end sooner than later.Iâ€™ve tried everything. People have suggested all sorts of ways to deal with the stresses of life that cause my anxiety and depression, such as:

1.	Therapy and communication
2.	Medication through Psychiatry
3.	Diagnosis and treatment with Psychology
4.	Eating healthy, getting enough sleep, meditating, breathing exercises, etc.
5.	Exercising, 30 minute walks a day, heavy set workouts.
6.	Writing down my thoughts, feelings and working to improve myself by setting goals.

Iâ€™ve tried all of these in the last few years, but Iâ€™ve ended up taking more Xanax to deal with work, had more anxiety during every day tasks most people would shrug off, panic attackâ€™s at the most random times, and depression holding me back from everything else. I hate myself, I hate everyone around me, I canâ€™t deal with what Iâ€™m supposed to do and I have no motivation to do what I *want* to do. Nothing seems to be helping.

The only thing my mind thinks heavily on every day is how relieving it would feel to die. Iâ€™m too afraid of pain to self inflict but I wish a random car accident would quickly end my life, or a stray bullet from out of nowhere to my temple or something. I want to beg my wife to give me permission to die. I want to find a way for her to be financially stable if I do. I just want it all to end. Help me, please.
