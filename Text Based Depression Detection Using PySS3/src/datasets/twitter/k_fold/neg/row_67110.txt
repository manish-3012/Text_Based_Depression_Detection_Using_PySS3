Didn'tYay now I can say I graduated? Big fucking deal. Now when people ask me what I do I can say I wasted 4 years of my life and mom's money on out of state tuition to earn a degree that means absolutely nothing since I just sit at home all day anyways. But it's ok mom because you wanted me to go away for school so I could "grow up." Yep, because sending me away for 4 years to a place far away where I know 0 people is definitely gonna help me. Well, the plan was to die after graduation but that didnt happen because I didn't even go so I'm just living on borrowed time now anyways. Whatever, hope it was worth it.
