hello internet strangersim kinda tired of living. i keep having bad day after bad day and with winter approaching, my sad will get worse. im not on antidepressants or anything and ive never seeked mental help before and i kinda dont want to due to the stigma. my gf brokeup with me, its my shittiest year in college academically, its hard to make new friends, and no one wants to fucking hire me. ill keep trying but i dont know for how long. the only thing keeping me going is the thought that one day i will be happier but i dont know how long i am going to stay down. thanks for reading :)
