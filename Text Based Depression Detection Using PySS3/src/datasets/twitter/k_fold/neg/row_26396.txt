Why I'm dying tonight. 8/3/20I'm just so tires of life. I've tried so hard to be just loved it even cared about by the people around me that I'm giving up. My father left me, am started a whole new family as if it wouldn't hurt me. It's a constant reminder that I was never good enough to be a part of his life the way his step kids are. Whenever I do see him, his wife is abusive. She yell at me for things get daughter did, compare us by how we look, make fun of my curly hair or how I dress or how I'm tall for my family. I'm hates by most the kids at school, I'm just tired. I can't anymore.
