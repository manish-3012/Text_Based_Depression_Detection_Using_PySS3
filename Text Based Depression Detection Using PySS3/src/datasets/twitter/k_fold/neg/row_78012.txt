From more than a year clean of self harm to it not being enough in one shotAll i can think is that life will never be better and i just can't live with all this pain n worry. I have self harmed ave had suicidal thoughts since i was very young. I had mostly conquered self harm by first learning to make a sting work rather than big gaping gashes to not doing it at all while i found a new reason every day to stay on this earth. Things like i had a new grandbaby coming our who would care for my dubs, especially my heart dog who would suffer horribly without me for a while. It's been quite a while since my bf/fiance had been one of those reasons. The strain of the last few years has made him more of a cause for pain even though i love him more than almost anything. We've fought and he's been irrational and vicious and I've screamed and cried and trained and name called. I just can't do it any more.

I have been drowning in depression and tears for So long it feels like i could never be happy again. The last few days have been more than i can handle and I've sat here and small scale self harmed. 

It's not enough. It's not enough to dull the pain, mask the pain, or even just push it out of focus.

 I need more.

I have no one to turn to. I don't think i can stop.

I'm so lonely.
