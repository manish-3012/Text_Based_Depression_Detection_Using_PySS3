Why bother trying, even though I'm happy on the outside?I'm crying, wishing I could die. Wishing everything could just be over. I lost a potential job interview. I got a DUI in March and it's getting in the way of me doing anything productive. It was a DUI for being overly tired and a little groggy due to benzos. I'm crying because my ex-girlfriend is in the hospital for psych reasons and all I can do is think selfishly and wish that it were me instead. I wish that could die and just leave everything behind. I'm frightened that I can't deal with my anxiety. I might not have the willpower to kill myself, so this may not be the right place, but I do wish I were dead. I wish that I could change everything and I know that I can't. 

I'm rekindling things with my husband. I'm being supportive of my ex in the hospital. I'm going on job interviews. Why can't I just be happy with what I have?
