I stood outside todayIt was a big step for me. I had it set up perfectly, the stool, the noose properly suspended. I think I stood out there for maybe a half hour? It was the furthest I had gotten. Its weird, I felt certain before I went outside, but when I had it around me I just felt fear. I tried pounding my chest and amping myself up, but I was to scared. It was raining, it was a Willow tree. I thought I heard noises in the bushes and it spooked me. I will say one thing, standing there I had never felt so alone and sad for myself. I'm doing it because I feel unwanted and because I'm made to feel undeserving of respect. No one will know. I actually did it twice, went outside, chickened out. Sat down, tried again. There is a certain clarity with your emotions when your a misstep away, not wanting to die, but definitely still in pain. I'll see if it gets worse.
