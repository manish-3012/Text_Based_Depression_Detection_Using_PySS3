I donâ€™t want to dieIâ€™ve decided that I donâ€™t want to die. Iâ€™m tired of waking up everyday and my first thought is questioning why Iâ€™m alive and thinking about dying as an easy way out. I donâ€™t want to fight myself every day in order to survive. Parental support isnâ€™t really there, but I will try to do whatever I can thatâ€™s in my power and comfort to help myself. I donâ€™t want to feel sorry for myself I donâ€™t want to feel sad all the time. Iâ€™m not sure what it is I want to do with my life exactly but Iâ€™m going to start with very small things that give me a sense of purpose. Even if the small thing is as simple as making my bed everyday. I want to be able to use all the small things as small victories to motivate me enough to find what I really want to do.
