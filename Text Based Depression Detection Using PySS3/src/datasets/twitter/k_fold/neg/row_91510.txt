Its 2:21 AM Eastern Standard Time...I should be in bed, but NO. NO. You have to be fucked with anxiety and guilt for everytying you've done to be a horrible person. I have a loving family and hardly anything wrong with my life yet I still feel this way. It shows how ungrateful of a person I am. If something exists, that is good, then I am apparently required to mess it up. I have a noose around my neck, I can feel it slowly distort my vision. It is a very satisfying feeling, a feeling that I can truly sleep once and for all in the abyss of death.
