The fact that I'm posting to strangers on Reddit kinda just reinforces the horrible feelings I have.I have no idea what I'm doing.  I live by myself in my mums flat.   I've been really low on money recently so she hasn't been asking for rent.  I buy my own food and fuel for my car.

I got paid on Friday, and I only have Â£100 left to last me the month.
I have got fuel in my car, but not enough to last another 3 weeks.  I have food in my house but not enough to last me 3 weeks, probably only enough to last one week.

My car is the most unreliable piece of shit.  It breaks down in the rain, engine just cuts and sometimes starts again, sometimes doesn't.  I just started a new job and it's in the middle of nowhere.  It's really important I have my car so I can't take it to the garage until I have a day off.  Even then, I can't afford to fix it.

The flat is a total mess.  I've been really sick recently with what I think is flu.  I've pretty much just been in bed the whole time, getting up only to make food.  There are dirty dishes everywhere, and my clothes are everywhere too.  I need to tidy it but I just don't have the energy or motivation.  

Even though I know I need to keep money to live, and I'm really sick, I still insisted on going out to get drunk the other night.  Ended up with my best friend back and some strangers house and smoked so much weed.  I'm not really sure what else happened that night but I know at one point I was just curled up crying.  We ended up running away from that place. 

I can't even be bothered explaining myself.  All I know is that I just want someone to come and tell me it's ok.  Take my responsibilities and take care of them.  Put my life on pause and let me calm down.

No one wants to do that for me.
