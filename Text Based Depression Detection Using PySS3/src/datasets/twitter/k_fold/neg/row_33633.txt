End of the lineI'm so tired of being alive. Everything I do ends in failure. When I hang out with friends, I force myself to put a smile on my face, but then I come home and cry. 

My ex girlfriend destroyed me by threatening to post the pictures I sent her over the Internet. This pushed me to a complete mental breakdown. She told me I deserved it in one of our last conversations. She was so very important to me, but now she hates me. 

The only thing stopping me is a proper method. I'm too much of a pussy to cut, and everything else is out of my reach, or painful. I just want an easy way out, and I can't find it.
