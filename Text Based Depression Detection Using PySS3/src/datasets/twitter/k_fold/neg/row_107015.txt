I just canâ€™t take this pain any longer....ðŸ’”Iâ€™m so lonely it literally tears my heart apart and it hurts! I always try and talk to people but they wonâ€™t stick around and none of my friends are talking too me ðŸ’”

I want to just end it because this has been going on trough my whole life and no one has ever really been there for me. Not even my own family. 


The things Iâ€™m currently deal with:
* an tremendous amount of trauma
* a whole lot of mental disorders
* an abusive family (that I reported and nothing happened) [heres the [Story ](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9tgkw8/im_being_abused_by_my_family_and_theres_nothing_i/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) on that]
* a recent brake up 
* having no one to turn too (no friends, no one thatâ€™s their for me)
* my best friend, doesnâ€™t talk too me anymore because she found other people 
* a crap ton of stress and worry 
* the earth shattering amount of loneliness 
* oh canâ€™t forget also the enormous amount of pain that I just want to stop ðŸ’”

All of that I canâ€™t take it! I canâ€™t take it! All I want is just someone to call and I have no one! So sorry if I end my life today, I love you all â¤ï¸ and I wish you the best..
