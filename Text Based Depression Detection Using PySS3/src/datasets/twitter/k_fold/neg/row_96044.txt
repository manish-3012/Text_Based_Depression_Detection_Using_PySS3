Probably going to do it soonI don't know how, but I think if there was any time I could spontaneously do it it would be right now. I'm constantly thinking of ways to do it, and have multiple potential plans. I guess we'll see what happens. I don't think I care if it gets better and going to the hospital won't help if I already know everything that they can teach me to feel better. I'll be grabbing deaths hand soon enough.
