I need adviceapologies in advance for how long this is

&amp;#x200B;

So. I think I need advice. Urgently.

&amp;#x200B;

I was planning on commiting suicide today. I had almost everything set and ready to go, but when I was supposed to do the final (and most important) thing I needed to do before I attempted, I became violently ill and unable to do it due to severe lack of sleep and food. And once it had passed, it seemed my window of opportunity has closed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in really bad shape. Mentally and I guess at this point physically. I suffer from PTSD/CPTSD, and it's utterly consumed my life, almost every waking moment is a spiraling nightmare of paranoia and terror. I hate even saying that. I feel like a liar. I feel vile and pathetic. I shouldn't be this way. But I am. And it's bad. And I can't keep going like this.

&amp;#x200B;

What's stopped me from killing myself before was the fact that i didn't have all my affairs in order, not even close. But now I do, so even if I'm unable to die now, the next spiral I'll have only one last thing to take care of in my way. But I can't even imagine getting there, can't imagine getting up and walking out of this room and interacting with my roommates as if nothing is different, go to work with an excuse for why I missed today and act as if nothing has changed.

&amp;#x200B;

And another thing is that I'm in a fight with my roommates, so to speak. We're not speaking. And we're fighting over something I can't, can't explain, can't open up about until I'm no longer here to see them react. I terrified of literally any reaction they could possibly have; I don't want them to be horrified or sad, I don't want them to be angry with me, but more than anything I'm terrified that my past will repeat itself and they'll treat me with contempt, with scorn, that they'll tell me I'm not suffering, that none of this is real, that I'm just a pathetic baby who needs to just get over it. I'm terrified they'll be angry if I tell them I felt that way. I don't want to tell them. I don't want to be here when they find out.

&amp;#x200B;

But where does that leave me? Can't leave to go settle my final obstacle and then finally die. Can't get up the next morning and go to work and interact as if nothing is wrong (don't know if my current physical state would allow that, even). Can't bear to tell my roommates to their faces what's happening to me. If I call emergency services it'll (obviously) leave my roommates shocked and confused and without answers, and it'll saddle me with a hospital bill I cannot pay (poor, uninsured, fuck my state and it's lack of medicaid expansion), And going to a hospital might only make it so, so much worse, as I've been traumatized by hospitals/nurses/doctors in the past, and the last time I was hospitalized I was offered no support and kicked out as soon as possible because I was homeless and had no money.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know if there's any good advice for me. Am I just going to sit here utterly paralyzed until...... until??? I don't even know. Any thoughts? Anything? I'm sorry this was so long.
