Stupid high schooler, who no longer wants to do with my stupid high school problemsWhere to start? Is it normal to consider suicide multiple times a day, even if you are not being serious? Well I mean I think about it, and say "nah I wouldn't do that, right?" I always have to reassure myself.I have so much stress to deal with and I just want it to end. I keep pushing myself, because I was always a little bit hopeful. But now I am hopeless. I hate saying this because i know it sounds dumb but, I had been friends with this girl for a while now. We are really close, and I was planning on finally asking her out today. I ended up not because she ended up driving home instead of taking the bus because she had to stay after school. I was gunna do it tomorrow. But today at her internship she was asked out by some guy. She said yes because I know she is a too nice person to say no. And they will go out and it might work fir them. I am happy for her, but I feel like I lost that spark of hope. That nothing matters anymore. Everyday I feel like I am inching my way closer to that final option. God I know I sound so stupid and overdramatic but I just feel like I can't handle it anymore. I know I sounded like a neck beard with that last statement about the girl but I promise I am not. Me and her are very close, I know she doesn't like anyone now. She is still getting over her last breakup which is why I assumed nothing like this could happen. I do know she is too nice a person. And that sshe will say yes. And if it works out for them than it works out. I just dont feel like I have anything anymore. I just wanna die right now, never have to go to school tomorrow. I know this all sounds dumb and rambly and stupid. But I have never felt more alone and crushed than I do right now.
