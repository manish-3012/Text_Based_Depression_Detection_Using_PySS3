I feel like the world doesn't want meThe health center at my university wouldn't help me so they recommended me to other psychologists and psychiatrists in the area. I called all of those guys to make an initial appointment but the psychiatrists told me I needed a psychiatric evaluation to make an appointment and all of the psychologists (counselors) i called either told me they'd call back to speak with a client intake advisor or to call them back next week.

I've been running around trying to get help for weeks now, I'm starting to think it would be easier to just end it all now idk how though. I just know while I'm in bed (when I'm not suffering insomnia) that the moment right before I drift off to sleep is the greatest feeling of tranquility I have in the day, but when I wake up all the anxiety just overwhelms me. I just don't ever want to wake up honestly.
