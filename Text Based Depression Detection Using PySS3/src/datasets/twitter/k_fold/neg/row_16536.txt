Anyone here that can help me talk through some shit? I don't want someone in a foreign country on the phone, and my "mental health benefit" through work is a joke.Before even going into details, I just want to know if this sub is even worth it. If anyone is here. 

I don't need supervised or documented visits somewhere, I've tried to get that shit and it doesn't work out. Everyone wants a bunch of money that I don't have. My work offers an 800 number I can call through my insurance, but I've been led to believe it's a bunch of people in India manning a call center. 

I'm more articulate in written text, anyway. I have speech problems that prevent me from really explaining myself verbally -not bad, but enough that it makes me embarrassed. 

I'm also on a throwaway, so there's that. 

I'm gonna refresh every few minutes.
