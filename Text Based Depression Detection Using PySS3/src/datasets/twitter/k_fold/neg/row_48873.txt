Which would kill me faster?I'm not asking for help or pity I just want an honest, researched answer.

Which would kill me faster/ which would have a higher chance of killing me?
A train, medication overdose (aspirin and paracetamol) or drinking lighter fluid?

I've considered chugging about 10 cans of Monster Energy before but that'll most likely just land me in hospital...
