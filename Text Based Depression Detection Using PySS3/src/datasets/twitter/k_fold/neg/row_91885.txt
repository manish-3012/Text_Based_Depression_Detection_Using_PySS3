does anyone feel like life is a force down your throat?i feel like everything in life is a FORCE upon me

im forced to act this way or that way
im forced to go to school
im forced to work the job i have no passion in
im forced to smile
im forced to cry
im forced to get married and have kids
im forced on mostly everything...

if you ask me to be honest i dont want to do any of these at all....maybe eating is not forced upon me
maybe my hobbies are not forced upon 
me...nothing is good nothing is enjoyable
life is not enjoyable to me , when i wake up morning ...i feel like im so damn forced to wake up and go to work&amp;school any place...
i hate it ...i just want to sleep forever!
thats something i desire the most yet i still need to feel so depressed for more 40 years Wow
