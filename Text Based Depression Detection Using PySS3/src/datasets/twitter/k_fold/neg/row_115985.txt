The surprising part is the staggering depth of pain a person can experience.Welp, I did it again. Once again I've managed to place myself squarely in a position or true, honest, complete solitude. Actual aloneness. It's something I've experienced before. I was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, I don't have it any more but at the time my doctors told me I was going to die soon. I was only 17 and not emotionally ready for the diagnosis or the prognosis. In response I shut out the world and didn't speak to another human for over a year. It was horrific and traumatizing, I'd told myself I'd never let my self isolating tendencies get so bad again. That I'd never allow myself to be alone again. Turns out it's a bit unavoidable when you're a disgusting inept leech like me. I spent a year or so recently, holed up in my room working from home and doing some odd home repair type jobs for ends meet. the majority of my friends were online. I made a mistake then, because I met someone incredibly special and I learned what it's actually like to have someone close to you. I didn't grow up with a good family you can draw your own conclusions as to how bad it was and despite the fact that I was fully in my mid twenties by the time I met this person I'd really never experienced actual real closeness. Well I ruined that, and whatever other internet friends I had because, plainly, it was the internet and I'd found some prospects in real life.so I packed my bags and moved cross country with someone new only to find myself in an extremely emotionally abusive relationship that has now deadened into me not leaving because I've got nowhere to go and them not telling me to leave because I have no idea.  At first I was surprised but pretty resilient to them telling me they hated me, and to kill myself, and whatever other horrible thing they could think of. But it's worn me down and honestly they're not really wrong. They don't mean it fully I think, at least most of the time. I think it's a facade, something they think is mildly humorous that they use defensively to avoid ever having a genuine conversation."edgy humor" Which I suppose makes things simpler considering how self deluded they are about who I am and the things I do. Not to put too much emphasis on them, understand that they are only a tiny piece to a large picture. The reality is, I'm 26 now, I'm old, Ive got no friends or family, I've got no one and nothing, and I think I deserve it. I think considering this has been most of what I've experienced in my life, this solitude and lonesomeness coupled with the fact that I can't find regular work due to a huge collaiope of beurocratic bullshit that would make you suspect a government conspiracy against me makes me think that the only thing that's left to do is just kill myself. Even in the event I do manage to get work so I can afford to leave this place it's not like it would be better, I'd just be grinding my skin off bit by bit at the slave mills so I can afford to get into debt. It's hard to articulate how much it hurts and how little I can do about it. I just sit here as the days whiz by occasionally crying or punching a wall until.my knuckles bleed. For years I knew it would come to this but I can feel now that it's unavoidable. I really just have to kill myself so I can stop fucking up and stop hurting people and stop leeching and stop feeling this unimaginable void of pain drowning me every second of every day. I used to think I'd be a writer, I can conceive of great beauty and even when I was very young I enjoyed the process. That's gone now, I hope whoever finds the short stories and poetry I've written has heart enough to destroy them instead of parading them around as one last testament to the fact of my failure as a human. I'm sorry this is so rambling I'm just exhausted, I hate to complain about my life as though I have things any worse than anyone else. I don't want to feel sorry for myself and to a large extent I don't, but if I were to list all the things that fuck me up and detract from my ability to interact with other people properly it would be a long one. If my life is half way over, or nearly so, there's not enough time left to undo the damage I've done. It's over. I really just have to do this.
