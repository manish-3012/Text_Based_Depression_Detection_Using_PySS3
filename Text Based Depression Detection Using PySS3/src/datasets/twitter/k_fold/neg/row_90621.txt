A follow upAfter downing more than 120 pills last, I spent most of the night asleep like a normal person would just what felt deeper. No ability left in my hands to use the gun laying at my feet, I was a plank of wood flat on the ground, that was until the the vomiting on to myself happened. I spent what felt like hours like that, the pain worsening, I felt at peace. It stopped all at once, I woke up to beeping and buzzing, my stomach had been pumped. 
So if youâ€™re wondering if Iâ€™m still here yes, yes I am Iâ€™m just really fucking bad at killing myself. Next time, when I get out of here Iâ€™ll just go straight for the gun. Iâ€™ll apologize about the mess on a post-it. I always wasnâ€™t one to make someone clean up for me but if I go out, thatâ€™s all I really care about. 
Iâ€™ll be in the ICU, until they know all my whatever the fucks are stable, I guess downing a bunch of anti psychotics isnâ€™t safe, at least thatâ€™s what they told me. 
The worst part about this, is I just feel everyone on here will be happy to hear I failed, like this isnâ€™t a throw away and these will probably be my only two posts, and that I will succeed one day. Maybe Iâ€™ll come back here for that rant, or maybe this was just bad luck. 
Anyways Iâ€™m tired from this all, Iâ€™m a fucking failure for a fourth time in a row. I hate this more than I think youâ€™ll ever know. Iâ€™ll talk to you guys later.
