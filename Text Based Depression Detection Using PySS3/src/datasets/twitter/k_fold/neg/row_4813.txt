It's 2:30 PM and I haven't left my bedWanna hear a joke?

Q: What do you get when you cross a mentally destroyed 17-year-old dropout with an upcoming 18th birthday.

A: A suicidal, mentally destroyed 17-year-old dropout 

I can't even handle life as it is. I've been stuck in my house for 3 years, I have severe C-PTSD and DP/DR with no help and nowhere to get it. Please, don't give me any advice. Believe me, I've tried and considered every possible avenue. I'm fucked no matter what I do.

I guess that's the real punchline.
