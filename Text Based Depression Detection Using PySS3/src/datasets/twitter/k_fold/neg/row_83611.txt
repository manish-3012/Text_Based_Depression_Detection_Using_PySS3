Can someone talk to me and calm me down?I really need to talk to someone right now. Everyone I can talk to is either busy or don't reply, i assume because they're fed up with me talking to them about how miserable and stressed out i feel.

I'm so anxious and antsy and worried and I feel like I'm about to implode. Would someone please talk to me and help me calm down? :(
