I just don't know what to sayI (24m) have a supportive friend (22m) and all sorts of support structures around me, but I just don't think I want to live anymore. At the same time I know that my fri be could do easily help me but I just don't know what to say. I've moved away from my friends since uni ended 6 months ago for me but nothing feels normal and I just hate living on through each day. I'm looking for advice as to what I should say to even start that conversation?
