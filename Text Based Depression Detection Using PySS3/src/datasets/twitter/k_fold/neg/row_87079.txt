9 month planSo I'm a 41yo male, my wife left me 4 years ago but we still haven't divorced.  We have a 8yo daughter together that lives with her, and a 20yo daughter that is hers from a previous marriage that lives with me (I consider my kid too).  I have been unable to find any real companionship since my ex left, meanwhile I know she has a lot of new friends and had recently started dating a new guy, I am not jealous of this, in fact I'm happy for her, I do wish she wanted to be with me still, but I know that's never going to happen.  I have decided to end everything in 9 months, I have a plan in place that should take care of my kids financially when I'm gone, I'm wondering should I start distancing myself from them emotionally so that when I do go it won't be such a blow to them?  I love them so much but I'm so tired of being alone and feeling used.  I know it's very selfish to do this, but I don't want to go on if life is going to be all work and no play and this level of isolation.
