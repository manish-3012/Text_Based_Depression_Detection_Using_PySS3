No help for meSo my insurance through my job doesnâ€™t cover treatment for BPD and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for weeks. Iâ€™ve been cutting for weeks and the system just isnâ€™t set up for people like me. Itâ€™s like they want me to die and right now I want to just give in and do that. Iâ€™m tired of pretending like everything is going to be okay. 

Iâ€™m just done.
