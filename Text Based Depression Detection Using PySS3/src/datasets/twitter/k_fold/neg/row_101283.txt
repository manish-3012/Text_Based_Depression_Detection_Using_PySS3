I hate being gay and want to die.There's no reason to live in a world where I'm not accepted and my own parents will think less of me for being homo. What's the point of living if there's nothing to live for except my parents and everyone never accepting me? Or living in a world where people berate me constantly? I guess I've learned enough is enough, and I've had more than enough. I hate living on this planet. I want to disappear and never come back because I wasnâ€™t meant to be here. I fantasize about suicide often, and recently have had an urge to begin planning. Iâ€™m homosexual. Iâ€™ve realized thatâ€™s never going to change. Iâ€™ve known since I was 7. So here I am, 17 years old and realize now that Iâ€™ll have to spend the rest of my life hiding and lying to the people I love about who I am, and never be accepted or feel like I belong in this world because of my sexuality. Either that, or I could lie and be unhappyâ€¦no. I just want to kill myself. Thatâ€™s it. I think about it everyday, how nice it will be when Iâ€™m gone. No more worries my deep, dark secret will ever jeopardize my security or sense of belonging. And seriously, who wants to spend time around someone as morbid and depressed as me? I have no friends. No one to talk to about my death wish. To feel hated by so many people for something as visceral as my sexuality is the worst feeling Iâ€™ve ever had. I read somewhere nearly a third of all suicides happen among homosexuals and I canâ€™t help but think Iâ€™d just be another gay suicide freak statistic. At the same time, no one even knows about me, so the only way people would find out is if I wrote it in a suicide note. Itâ€™s like trying to fight against something you know youâ€™ll never conquer or worse yet, wanting something you know youâ€™ll never have. Something Iâ€™m constantly reminded of and itâ€™s driving me insane. Hence why Iâ€™m here talking about how I want to kill myself. Who does that? Anyway, my problem is insidious as I find myself lying more and moreâ€¦even though Iâ€™m supported financially by my parents, I feel so unsupported because because Iâ€™ll never be accepted by them or the world and Iâ€™ll always have this terrible, debilitating internal strife and conflict, like a thousand voices yelling at me even though Iâ€™m alone in a room. So I've thought about what I could write in a final note for my parents or anyone who cares to read it.
