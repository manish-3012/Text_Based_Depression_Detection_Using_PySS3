I'll probably buy rope tomorrowIf the weather's good I'll run downtown and pick some up. I've been telling myself the same thing every night this past week, but this time I think I'll actually do it.  
I'm just not getting better, and in fact, I don't even want to get better. I'm just done. with everything.  


Although I know this is all just gonna end with me backing out at the last second for the umpteenth time.  
But I hope this time is different.
