I've been feeling hopelessEvery day is torture. I've been dealing with gender dysphoria for most of my life and it's gotten to the point where it feels like nothing will ever get better. I'll never be able to live my life to the fullest. I just want to die so I don't have to suffer anymore. Whenever I try to talk to my family or school counselor about this they just call me selfish and never offer any help. I can't even kill myself because I'm under 18 and can't buy any drugs or weapons. I'm going to be stuck in this miserable spiral forever.
