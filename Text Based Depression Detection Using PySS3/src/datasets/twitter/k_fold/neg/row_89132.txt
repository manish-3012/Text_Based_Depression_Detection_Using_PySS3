Something positiveIdk if this is appropriate to post on this sub since Iâ€™m not on here often, but I just wanted to say that I planned to end my life a week ago on my birthday and I obviously didnâ€™t; I think I blanked out for most of the day because I donâ€™t remember anything. Nothingâ€™s changed but Iâ€™m still here so I guess itâ€™s a small win for me.
