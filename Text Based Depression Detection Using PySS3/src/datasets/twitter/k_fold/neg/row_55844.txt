I am ending my 29 years of life this weekendI am going to end my life this weekend. I cannot take the pain anymore. I am a complete fuck-up. My life is completely pointless. I have no friends, and I'm a really ugly virgin. I cannot finish my stupid under-grad degree, because I am too mentally unhealthy to do so. Everyone in my family hates me, at this point. I am going missing tomorrow, and nobody will notice. Goodbye screwed up world, and all of the selfish people in it.
