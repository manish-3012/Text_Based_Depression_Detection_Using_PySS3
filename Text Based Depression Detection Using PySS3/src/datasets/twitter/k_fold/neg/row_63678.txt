I got a new family memberMy brother and sister-in-law have a beautiful baby girl and it just makes my heart melt to see her. Like, a whole new life has entered the family, OMG right?! I should totally be happy and not crying myself to sleep telling myself Iâ€™ll never graduate college, Iâ€™ll never be in a loving relationship like my brother and sister-in-law are, iâ€™ll never have a well-paying job to support a family, Iâ€™ll never raise my own children, Iâ€™ll never be the cool progressive aunt, Iâ€™ll never give my newborn niece and future nieces and nephews christmas presents, Iâ€™ll never even be able to hold her again for one last time and say goodbye. Because I already wrote my suicide note.
