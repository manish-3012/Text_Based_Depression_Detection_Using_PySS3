anyone out there?i'm just really lonely. i want to kill myself, but then- i always want to kill myself. i'm at no real risk here but i'm still having very strong urges. been dealing with self harm bipolar depression anxiety for seven years and it's never gonna leave me... god i'm so fucking worthless, you should probably go attend to someone higher priority...
