Guy threatens to kill himself on stream right now! What to do?Hey Suicidewatch. I usually don't browse this sub but it's the first place that came to my mind. 

There is a guy who claims that he wants to kill himself live on stream under certain circumstances.

I just stumbled upon his announcement and have no idea how to react to this. 

I wont provide a link here or tell you where I found the link, but a mods help would be greatly appreciated.

I don't know if some people will say I'm overreacting but I prefer being wrong on this anyways. If somebody who knows about such things can tell me that this is just a hoax I'd be glad..

Any helping suggestions?

Edit: To make this clear, this his happening right now.

Edit: He just veryfied by showing a timestamp. Pistol and ammunition were also shown.
