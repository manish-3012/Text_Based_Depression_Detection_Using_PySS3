Online LearningMy schools about to start our online learning program, and for reasons I don't want to delve into, it will be miserable. I can even stand thinking about it because I know it will be a shitty trainwreck, so I thought typing about it would help. I have a bad feeling that this new online learning might throw me back into old self harm habits. I hope it won' t be as shitty as I am imagining it
