I want to die, but nobody takes me seriously.I'm ill. Like, I can't eat, I've lost maybe 30-40kg over the past few months type ill. It's been a long time since I actually wanted to be alive, but it's getting so much worse lately. With my illness and depression, it's all I can do to get out of bed some days because I'm in pain, I feel ill, iim dizzy or I just can't deal with the thought of seeing people on that day. I've lost the joy of doing anything at all in life and I've had to all but abandon a degree halfway through it.

I have no hope. I'm too scared of any of the tests the doctors could do to actually get them done (by scared I mean petrified, panic attacks scared, I really can't do them) which means all that can be done is vague management of a condition that they can't diagnose properly. I have no friends. My friends are maybe like 4 people who took pity on me because I spent too much time in the coffee shop they work at, but even they kind of annoys me now. I don't really know what to do. I just want to die but nobody takes that seriously because I'm too afraid of actually going through with it. If euthanasia was legal in my country I would go right now.
