Tried to kill myself on Thursday, now I don't know what to do.Thursday night I attempted to drown myself in my bath. My wife and brother caught me and forced me out later that evening I grabbed a knife and cut myself rather badly. I don't really know what to do now. Everyone is very upset at me, validating my feelings and urge to commit suicide. I feel very confused.
