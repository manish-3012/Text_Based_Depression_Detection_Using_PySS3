My LDR boyfriend is going to commit suicideHe lives in India, and I live in the U.S. 

Just yesterday when we were having a tough conversation, he suddenly said heâ€™ll write me an email. Once I received the email, it included him thanking me, that he wouldnâ€™t stay much longer on this planet, and that he would spend a few more days reflecting over his life before ending it. He also said he would delete all the ways I could contact him. 

I freaked out, and begged him not to do it. But he deleted skype and discord, two of the ways I could contact him. He left WhatsApp, which is now the only way I could contact him. After spending 20 minutes sobbing and begging him to stay, he said he wanted me to say goodbye to him on the 29th of this month and that heâ€™d talk to me again the next day (today). Knowing him, he wouldnâ€™t do this for attention and he wouldnâ€™t lie about this. He wouldnâ€™t tell anyone else about it. 

I decided to email one of his friends (he had given me his friendâ€™s email just in case something happened to him) asking for them to alert his family/the authorities and for them to do something about it.

I talked to him again today, trying to convince him to live. I donâ€™t think I made a difference, and he only let me talk to him for 45 minutes before saying heâ€™d talk to me tomorrow.

I proceeded to search up suicide hotlines and emails in India, and emailed every single one I could. 

I donâ€™t know what else to do.
