Feeling stuck, and I know I wont do it, but I want to end it all.I keep re-realizing that sex and drugs are only temporary fixes, and I dont know if this makes sense, but if theyre just temporary the fuck am I suppose to do to feel better? and It makes me wanna just die. I want someone to kill me. Im to much of pussy to do it myself, and it feels like theres nothing I can do to make my life better.
