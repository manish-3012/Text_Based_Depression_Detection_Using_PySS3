Suicide is badass.DAE feel like people who commit suicide are basically strong and brave?
 I mean i wanted to commit suicide for a long time   but i never really could cause i am a freakin coward who doesn't have control over his life.
I am such a coward who can't even kill myself to end the suffering because i am scared of the pain and death so the people who really do it are basically brave atleast for me.
