What should I doI was at work today, and I realized I'm having suicidal ideations, pushing towards planning. I thought I was gonna be better but more and more I just feel like I'm losing hope, I reached out for help to see a psychiatrist and left some voice mails for appointments to see a therapist. I'm trying I really am, but more and more I just have this thought in the back of my mind asking why am I trying you know? I dont think theres a purpose to my life anymore.
