I'm scared.I think this is it. I'm making a plan for tomorrow. I've called the hot lines. I've talked to some friends. But I don't think I can do it anymore. I just hope it works and I hope it's painless. I'm so tired. 

Reading everyone's thoughts here makes me so sad. I'm sorry everyone. I'm sorry there's so much sadness and pain and loneliness in this world.
