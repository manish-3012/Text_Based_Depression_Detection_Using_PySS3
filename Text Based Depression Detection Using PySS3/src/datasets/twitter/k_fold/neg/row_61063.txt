I have no one left... I can't take much more.Everything is collapsing before my eyes... I'm in a severe risk of not having enough credits to graduate this year from HS... My (3) friends have all found love/significant others, and they don't have time for me anymore. I have cried every night for the past two weeks... And there's so much rejection from guys....


I feel so ugly and stupid. I just wish it would all end...
