Is this a possible way to solve things?So basicly, after being afraid to kill myself for the most time and being depressed for as long as i have i decided to make an end to officially.


I always thought of choking/hanging wouldn't be the way to go, i'd always thought of it as some horrible way to end it but to be honest i recently while bored made a noose and "hung" myself for a little while to get a feeling of what it's like and it was really pleasant, i could feel my conscience slipping away and it was not nearly as bad as i thought it would be, so i finally found a way to go.

My father is a doctor and as so we have a lot of medicine at home that isn't used, but i wouldn't want to die of an OD unless it's heroin since i know the effects of drugs/medicine and i dont want to mess around and force myself in a position where i can't do anything anymore, but we do have some heavy sleep inducing medicine at home.


So the question is, if i would get high one last time, take a few "sleepy pills" and choke myself, would that end it? 
i somehow i still couldn't end it if i was sober enough, but also think that if i'm too high of the medicine i'd might "Slip up" and end up not killing myself, is my plan failproof or does it have too many loose ends?
