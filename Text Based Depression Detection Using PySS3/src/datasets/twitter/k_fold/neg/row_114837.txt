Told to hang myself by someone in the reddit community.Hi Iâ€™m here to say that as I ranted earlier in my previous post here, I was sent a message to stop looking for attention. I told accuser that they donâ€™t know my life and to not fucking judge me. He then proceeded to say â€œhang yourselfâ€. That is what happened. Username was â€œpaintdragonztâ€. The conversation dissapeared in my message tab, however, this is unacceptable, and just trash. I asked why he said all that. Never told me why...
