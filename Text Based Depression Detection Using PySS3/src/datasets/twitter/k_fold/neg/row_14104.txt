Can it be ethical to be pro choice when it comes to suicide?I understand how this isn't a good stance when an individual lacks capacity, but in cases where someone is suicidal and has capacity, isn't it within their rights to have self determination?

Although one may argue there is a right to life, rights do not need to be claimed. Doesn't preventing a competent person who desires suicide from commiting suicide go against their autonomy? Even if the individual lacks capacity, shouldn't a substitute decision maker be able to decide his fate to keep with the principle of equality and justice?

Why is the pro choice position not allowed here?
