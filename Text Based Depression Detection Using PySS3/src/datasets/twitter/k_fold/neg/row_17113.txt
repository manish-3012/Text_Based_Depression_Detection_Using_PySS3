Fuck lifeI hate everything. My life is fucking miserable and has only consistently gotten worse as I've aged. I gave up on my life a long time ago, and I'm just fed up with being alive and having to turn up at this miserable fucking humiliating job. I can't even get anything better because I'm a lazy, unqualified, useless cunt with no motivation.
