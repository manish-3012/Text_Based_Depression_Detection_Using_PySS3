I did not always feel like this.Hi,
 I am a 21 year old male. I am six foot. I have friends. Even friends online I talk to everyday. I smile and I joke. I work two jobs. I live at home with my parents. I am in a bad place in my mind and I know it. It started about a year ago. I started wonder what things would be like with out me around. I started thinking it was normal and most people thought like this. It slowly started to happen week by week, day by day, hour by hour. Now everything is better with out me in the picture. Every time my mom looks at me I can see the disappointment in her eyes. I can see the stress in my dads eyes every time I ask him to take me to work. I started joking around by saying " I just wanna fly *cough* die *cough* " then it turned in to I just wanna die. But like i was singing it happly... Tonight I told my mom I want to die. I was told to go to my room... she doesnt know I wasnt joking. I have convinced myself for a long time now that I was joking. But the truth is I just make peoples lifes harder... it  ould be my mom or my manger at work... I am A FUCK UP. For a long time I was okay with it tonight.... I called the suicide hot line and was put on hold for 25 mins before i hung up. I need help I am scaring myself.
