I have come up with a way of dyingFirst I'm going to close any way of air entering my house, then I'm going to close the doors of my bedroom, after this it should be enough not to let enough air in my room, then after taking the sleeping pills, I'm gonna cover myself with sheets and pillows when I start feeling sleepy, then I will die because of lack of air, what do you guys think about it?
