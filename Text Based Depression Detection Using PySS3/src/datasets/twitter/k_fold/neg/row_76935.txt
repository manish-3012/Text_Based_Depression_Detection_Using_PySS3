dumb question ?If youâ€™re involuntary taken to a mental health hospital for being suicidal but youâ€™re poor as shit and have no insurance, will that fuck you over financially?? like you didnâ€™t ask to go and I donâ€™t think you can leave on your own ? 

Because I honestly wouldnâ€™t mind going Too bad but fuck. being poor is whatâ€™s gonna kill me before I do at this point. :(((
