I donâ€™t care if it wins anymorePeople keep telling me that if I kill myself, then the depression will win the fight. Hereâ€™s the catch, they think I fucking care if it wins. I donâ€™t give a shit anymore. Iâ€™m not even using a throwaway account because I donâ€™t care about keeping it a secret. Why would I care if the depression wins? All I want is peace, and if it takes the depression winning over me to achieve that, then why should I care at all? I donâ€™t. 

Idk why Iâ€™m even posting here. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m subconsciously looking for help, or just attention. Who knows. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family, but at the same time Iâ€™m hurting them when I even tell them about my thoughts. I canâ€™t fucking win anything anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m so goddamn pathetic itâ€™s unbelievable. Sometimes I wish I was killed by a robber or shooter just so I didnâ€™t have to worry about my family wondering what they did wrong.
