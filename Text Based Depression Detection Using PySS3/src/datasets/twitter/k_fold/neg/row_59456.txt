I am a fucking selfish piece of shit and have no empathyI have autism, I started talking before the age of 2, using complete sentences and I can talk now.  However, I only have 2 GCSE's, I can't drive, have explosive meltdowns in public, I am illiterate, I can't work, I can't live on my own and I have joined multiple clubs as a child that reject people with an IQ past 70.  I also very rarely get sick.  When I was at school I only had 8 days off in total due to having a cold.  All I felt was a mild cough and a runny nose.

Due to this, I have a 0% chance of survival if I was to get coronavirus.  I still have the narcissistic opinion of wanting to survive instead of a 50 year old office worker with an average IQ who 99.999999999999% of the time wouldn't even NEED a ventilator.  They would just be told to stay home for a couple of weeks as their symptoms are barely noticeable.

There are no people with my condition that have survived.  Meanwhile most other disabilities give you an 85-99.999999% survival rate based on your age.

Sorry for the DISGUSTING, SELF CENTERED, NARCISSISTIC rant.  I am sick of shielding and I want to kill myself because I am a selfish FREAK and because of the uncertainty of shielding.
