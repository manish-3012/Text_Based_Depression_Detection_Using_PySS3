I'm like Chester Bennington"I don't know if anybody out there can relate, but I have a hard time with lifeâ€¦ sometimes," explained Bennington.

"Sometimes it's great, but a lot of times for me, it's really hard. And no matter how I'm feeling, I always find myself struggling with certain patterns of behaviorâ€¦ I find myself stuck in the same thing that keeps repeating over and over again, and I'm just, like, 'How did I end upâ€¦? How am I in this?' And it's that moment where you're in it and then you can just separate yourself from that situation and you look at it and you see it for what it is and you're able to then do something about it; you've now broken out of that circle, that cycle."

This is exactly what I struggle with too. Last year I quit smoking. I then became stuck in a circle regretting it so heavily. After that I contact my ex about this and she insults the shit out of me so that keeps repeating for 4 months. And now I'm done with that and just feeling like 'fuck this, I just want to enjoy my life and not worry about bullshit'..

Why can't this just happen straightaway instead of me worrying all the time? Fuck my brain. I think my obsessive thinking will kill me someday.
