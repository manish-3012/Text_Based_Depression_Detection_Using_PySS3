I'm alone and I don't know what to do.My kid and my wife are my anchor, my rock, my lifeline. I've been able to power through it all with them.

They just left me today. They said they were going to be at my in-laws for a while until I get myself fixed. She said it's been hard living with me the last few weeks. I can't and won't blame her. This is my fault.


Now I don't have my rock. I feel so sad. I'm here thinking which would be a better way to go, drinking all my pills at the same time or jumping from the top of the building I work at.


This isnt the person I expected to be when I graduated from college and received all those awards. Help me understand what happened, please. Give me a way to ppwer through. Or not.
