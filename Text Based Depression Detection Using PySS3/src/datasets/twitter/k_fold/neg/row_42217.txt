I hate me Iâ€™m a spoiled brat, I was a single child til I was 6 years old because my father had to work abroad. Everything I want, I get. Now I am a 17 year old Senior High school student and I feel like nothing goes my way anymore unlike when I was 6. I kinda hate myself, everything that goes wrong with my life I blame me. I hate being alone because when Iâ€™m alone I want to kill myself. I convince myself that I am a useless ungrateful child and that I should just die so everyone would be happy.
