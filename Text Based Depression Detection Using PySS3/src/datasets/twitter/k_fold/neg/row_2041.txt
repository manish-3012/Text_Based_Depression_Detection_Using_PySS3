It's like he's holding me hostage :(
My ex partner of 6years has recently been struggling with depression, i've kept my promise of being here for him to talk to when he needs me but recently he's been saying things go make me believe he feels like he wants to give up! He says if i tell anyone he will make it out to be my fault!! I have tried my damned hardest to get him help but his doctor wont talk to me about anything and says he cant do anything unless my ex goes to him personaly. i feel like i'm at a dead end with him.. whats my next step, who do i turn to, i dont want to give up on him... i promised i wouldn't. please help me help him
