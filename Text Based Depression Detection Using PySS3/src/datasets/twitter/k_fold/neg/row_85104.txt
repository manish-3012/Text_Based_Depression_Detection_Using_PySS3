I feel like I'm going to do it soonToday has been a rough day. My suicidal thoughts have been ringing loudly in my ears for hours, which has been a theme for the last three years, but lately, about six months ago, these thoughts have gotten extremely intense, and I feel like I'm going to do it soon. I'm going to be alone for pretty much the entire summer, and also, I can't enjoy things anymore, which means I don't have anything to distract myself from my suicidal thoughts. I don't think I want to kill myself, but sometimes, the thoughts get so intense that, on a whim, I attempt suicide, especially when I'm alone because I tend to get really paranoid.
