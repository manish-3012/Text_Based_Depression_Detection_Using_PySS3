Never would I think I'd be posting here.I joined this subreddit on my main to help people get through things. I never thought I'd be sitting in my room with a two bottles of pills and the thoughts to take them. I'm truly upset that if I do take them I would hurt people, but I know they'd get over it soon enough.

I would normally never tell anyone my age but I think that it's upsetting that if I were to take these pills I would of only been alive for 11 years. People tell me I'm to young to care about this shit and that I'm stupid for thinking of it, I know they're right. I'm being overly dramatic and plane stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not asking for someone to tell me  that my life's fine, I know it's not, but I just need to know that someone, *anyone* cares.  So here I am, in my bed, ready to kill myself and telling the world about it.

I can't tell if this is a cry for help, or something else. I'm sorry I had to take up your time.
