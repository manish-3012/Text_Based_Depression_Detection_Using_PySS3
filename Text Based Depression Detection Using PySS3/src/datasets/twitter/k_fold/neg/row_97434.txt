This time tomorrowThis time tomorrow hopefully I'll be dead. This will be my first  suicide attempt. I'm ready for real. I'll go to work tomorrow and work my regular shift. I'll go home and draft my notes.i will call out of work the next day. I will feed my pets one last time. I shower and clean up. I will not eat for the next 24 hours. I have fasted for a few weeks and I think I have weakened myself enough. I'm almost 100 pounds. I don't think I can wait to get down to that. Its harder to complete a shift. Its harder to move and rest comfortably. I think my body knows whats about to happen. Its known for a long time. Suicide is the only way I was ever going to go. Methodology doesn't matter much. I just wanted to say goodbye I've lurked here so long on various accounts. I didnt want to post until I was ready
