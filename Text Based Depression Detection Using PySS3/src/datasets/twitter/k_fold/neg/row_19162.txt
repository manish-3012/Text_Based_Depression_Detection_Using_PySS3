I can't Do this AnymoreI'm so tired of feeling this way and no one believing me, 

My family doesn't believe me. Therapy isn't freaking working, neither is medication , everyone in my family thinks I just go there to talk shit about them (but I don't)

I just can't pretend to be okay anymore, it's so tiring pretending that I don't want to die anymore. 

All I do is wish that I was dead but can never go through it with it because I'm a freakin' failure and probably won't even be able to get that right.

Why can't I just end it all, I'm not even worth it; I'm a complete failure
