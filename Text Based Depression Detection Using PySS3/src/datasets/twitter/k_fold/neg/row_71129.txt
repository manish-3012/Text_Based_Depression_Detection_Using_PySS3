Any day now.For the past two months, every day of every week at about seven o'clock I go to the top of the parking structure near my apartment and stand close to the edge, working up the courage to take a run and jump. I have always pictured that suicide by gravity to be the most amazing sensation in the world. The air rushing past you, your heart giving out if it was high enough and the nature of it would ensure your body was found by a stranger and not a loved one. My only real regret is the fact that I don't have access to a higher building. 

I have felt for a while now a deep emptiness, that has only now been further amplified by school work and finals. I don't have any real friends, just people who use me. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere and when I try to tell my parents about my pain and desperation they threaten me, they tell me they will take me out of school if my mood does not improve by the end of the semester. They refuse to get me a therapist and they repeatedly tell me that depression and bipolar disorder (both of which I was diagnosed with two years ago) are invented diseases. 

I have no one to turn to, no one to talk to, everything seems too uncertain and I just can not cope with that. Death is the only certainty, everything else doesn't matter, so what is the point of denying that certainty another couple years? 

All I need now is that little last bit of courage or perhaps drunken desperation.
