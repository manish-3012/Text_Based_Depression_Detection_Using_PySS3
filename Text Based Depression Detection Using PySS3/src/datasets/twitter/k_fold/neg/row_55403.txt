Feeling suicidal after losing a sibling to suicideI lost my sister about a year ago to suicide (she was 23, incredibly young) and lately I've been feeling like my life has lost it's spark. 

I am a college graduate, in grad school, have a loving mother, so I am a bit ashamed with how depressed I have been feeling. It's not that I feel like no one loves me or that I am a burden, I just feel worthless and like I have no point in life. I am exhausted with living and feel so pissed off at the world. I did not ask to be born so I could spend the rest of my life grieving my sister's death. 

Two days ago I seriously considered taking my life. The only thing holding me back is the fear of what actually happens after you die. Although, I am sure whatever is on the other side is better than here. My sister believed in that at least. I'm not looking for any sympathy, just wanted to finally admit to myself and a bunch of strangers that I am considering suicide. I just want to feel like how I am feeling is normal.
