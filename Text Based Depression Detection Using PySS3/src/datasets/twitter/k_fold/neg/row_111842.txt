How do you get helpIâ€™m only 19.  I donâ€™t have insurance.  I donâ€™t have a good relationship with my parents.  Canâ€™t get counseling at college because it shut down.

I canâ€™t ask for help.  I feel like I donâ€™t deserve it and Iâ€™m just being whiney because all I have to do is just stop feeling like this but for some reason I canâ€™t.

I cut off every single person I loved and cared about in my life in January because I thought I was finally going to do it and I wanted to distance them from it and I wanted them to hate me so that they wouldnâ€™t care when I did it.  Then I felt horrible for cutting everyone off for no reason and making them feel bad that I hated myself and didnâ€™t want anyone to get close to me again.  Now itâ€™s May and I have nobody.

I still think I want to do it, but there are occasional times that I donâ€™t and now I donâ€™t know what to do.  I want to be brave enough to go through with it but I just canâ€™t.  What am I supposed to do?
