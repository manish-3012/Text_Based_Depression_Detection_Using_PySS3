I will hang myself if I cannot get a good grade in a highschool exam.I am 12 years old, I live in Turkey and will become an 8th grader after the summer break. I know that I need to be 13 to use reddit but teachers and fake friends are no help so this was my last resort. Basically in the end of the eighth year there is a highschool exam. If you get a good grade you can go to a great highschool and be whatever you want, however, if you get a bad grade you will become a wageslave for the rest of your life. Given the fact that I am an idiot in school I probably either never participate (aka kms before the exam) or kms after the exam. Because you almost always need a perfect 500 score on the exam to actually go to a good highschool, since so many students get good grades

To summarize, I probably won't get a good grade in a national exam next year, thus kill myself
