I just keep talking myself out of itI've probably been depressed since I was twelve. Every year, I tell myself "if it's this bad next year, I'll kill myself." It seems like it always is, but I still don't. The only reason I don't is because of my family. I wish there was something else that made me happy, something else that made me not want to kill myself. But I'm not good enough at anything I do. I have so many interests that all discourage me because I'm not good enough at any of them. I thought having a good job would make me happy; that's what I've ostensibly been working toward all my life. But it doesn't.

I bury my problems under my girlfriends, when I have them. When I have a girlfriend, I can ignore them. When I have a girlfriend, there's someone who chooses to spend time with me, who I respect and care for, who cares about me too. When we break up, I wonder what's wrong with me. I keep telling myself that the most recent one wasn't the love of my life, that I didn't just fuck things up, and that someday I'll be that happy again, regardless of whether or not I have a girlfriend. It's not working.

I don't know what's going to make me happy. I have had so many struggles in my life between gender identity, phobia of public speaking, and social anxiety, and when I hit a roadblock I just find it hard to believe that I can really get past all this and be normal or happy. Most often I just wish I didn't have to deal with any of it; I just wish that I was dead. I wish I didn't feel such a lightness in my chest when I think about killing myself. It makes me feel even worse.
