I don't know what to do anymore. I'm very afraid.I'm scared of what I'll do and whether or not I'll take it too far. I can see no path forward in my life. All of my friends are walking out of my life. I'm tortured by horrible memories every day. I feel almost no emotions, and when I do, I'm so miserable that I can't bear it. I will never be loved. The universe is out to get me. And any time I try opening up to someone, they realize that I'm too far gone and beyond help. The only thing that keeps me going is the guilt that I'll inflict on my mom and my brother. But I can't see a future past this hurt.
