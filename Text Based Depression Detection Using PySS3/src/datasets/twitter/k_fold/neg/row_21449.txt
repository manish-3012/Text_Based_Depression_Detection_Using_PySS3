Any Original Advice Out There?I'm just so tired of all this shit. It's the same advice every time; try new counselors, hit the gym, join new support groups and especially try new medications, and eventually you'll get to a better place. I've been receiving "treatment" for 12 years now, and literally nothing seems to help. I think about suicide every single day, every morning there is a sense that today just might be the day. I don't even know how to express myself and I've scrapped this post three times before finally deciding to just put it out there; nothing seems to work. Is it possible that, simply by nature of their physiology, some people will never experience happiness? Personally, I just feel as though I oscillate between depressed and VERY depressed; the doctors call it dysthymia comorbid with depression, BUT NAMING THE FUCKING THING DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP THE PROBLEM, NOR DOES ANY OF THE FUCKING CLICHES THAT SEEM TO BE EVERYONE'S GO-TO WHEN THEY HEAR THE WORDS SUICIDAL IDEATION 

Sorry for the rant, this is just a waste of both of our time. Sometimes it helps just to type the fucking thing up, but sometimes it just makes you feel even more hopeless
