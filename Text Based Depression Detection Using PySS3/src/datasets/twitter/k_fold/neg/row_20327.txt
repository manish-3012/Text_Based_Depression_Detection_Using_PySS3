How do I tell my therapist I have a plan to commit suicide?I have a plan to commit suicide and know I need help so I wonâ€™t do it. I am seeing a fairly new therapist and donâ€™t feel very comfortable being blunt with her, but Iâ€™m scared for my life. I donâ€™t want her to freak out but I need help. What do I do?
