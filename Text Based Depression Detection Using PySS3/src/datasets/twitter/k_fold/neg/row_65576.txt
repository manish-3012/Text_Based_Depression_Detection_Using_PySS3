HelpHaving a very hard time tonight. I live in a small-ish city and my longest relationship ex (weâ€™re over 30 and Iâ€™m very successful professionally) is quite possibly the most popular person in town. Everyone I know is trying to be his best friend and go see his (talented) band play every venue within 50 miles.  Iâ€™m struggling a great deal with my depression and his reemergence into my life is adding to my rock bottom self esteem. Iâ€™ve avoided these forums because I was raised with the WASP-y values of... well I donâ€™t know the word, but â€œno one should ever know about your problems. theyâ€™re trivialâ€. So I made a throw away and came here. And I really need help. Even a kind worsbnbwould be wonderful.
