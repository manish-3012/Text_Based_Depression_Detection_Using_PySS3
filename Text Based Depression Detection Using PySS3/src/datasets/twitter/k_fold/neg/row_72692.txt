im scared... I think i might.....I just talked to the counselor. She said something is defiantly not right and she has to call my parents about it which is what i was afraid of... Somebody may come into my school tomorrow and talk to me a little more deeply about this and shes gonna suggest things to do to help and they might have a Diogenes..... thats what im scared of... what if i really am clinically crazy? what will my family think? what will my boyfriend think? what will the voices do in return for me not listening to them and keeping them a secret...? How tf are they gonna help me without sticking me on meds which is the last thing i wanna do... I dont know what to do and im scared... I just wanna get better without loosing who i am and what ive worked towards... someone please help me...
