Gave up on medication and therapy. Should I go back?I quit it all because it was making it worse. Iâ€™m so paranoid. Even after the medication I still am. 

I havenâ€™t been to the doctor in months and I havenâ€™t taken any medication for months. Is there a point in going back? I feel like Iâ€™m going to feel like this forever.

If I fail so badly and donâ€™t become a doctor that I want to be, I am going to put a shotgun to my head and blow it. I feel like my life is ticking down to that acceptance letter moment. I canâ€™t live like this, but any other way of life is foreign and scary.

Tonight just feels like a scary night. All I can think about is ways to kill myself without my parents being sad. How I can cover it up.
