I finally lost the last reason to continue living, I'm planning my suicide soon.I'm committing suicide. One might think it would be selfish of me, but I beg to differ. If anything, I'm completely selfless.

My mom pretends to give a shit about me, truth is she's more interested in her financial stability than my health. I suffer from MDD, GAD, SAD, an eating disorder, and I show symptoms of PTSD. I'm also deaf and I require occasional check ups to make sure everything is a-OK. While I do have doctors, my mother always brushes me off when I ask her to make a follow-up appointment for me. My physical and mental health is getting worse every day and I'm a minor and have no control over making appointments for myself. 

My father is a registered sex offender, he was charged with sex abuse of a minor. He's really abusive and manipulative and will always end up making you feel like shit. I don't even think this needs explanation, it's pretty clear. 

My grandparents (on my mother's side) are not bad people, but they have some of the dumbest logic and are extremely religious and are against me as a transgender individual.

I do have other family but they are either also extremely abusive and manipulative or I never even met them.

I have no friends. I'm not over-exaggerating at all. All the friends I had took advantage of my kindness and ended up using me. I even had a friend that raped me over the coarse of several months. An ex boyfriend of mine even cheated on me with my rapist and continues to say I'm lying.

Tonight I finally realized the last friend I had is a piece of shit. I thought he was my best friend, someone I could trust, and it hurts to know he wasn't.

I no longer have a reason to keep fighting. I'm done. Clearly my purpose in life is to be treated like shit.

Goodbye.
