No one wants to talk to me because they know I am suicidal and they are fucking rude when they do talk to me.Most don't answer my calls or texts and when they talk to me they don't know what to say or say "that's your problem", "be thankful for the people in my family when I don't like any of then at all", or "don't do it". They still ask me for money knowing I am suicidal. I feel like I need to actually kill myself to prove them I will and because I can't solve my problems because it's too late.
