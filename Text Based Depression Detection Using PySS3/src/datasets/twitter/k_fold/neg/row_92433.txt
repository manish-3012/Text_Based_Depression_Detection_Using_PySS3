There's so little point to life.Everything in my life has gone to shit. My Nana is about to die. My dad's been arrested for a crime I don't think he committed. I haven't had a girlfriend for as long as I can remember. I feel like nothing is worth fighting for, cause most of my life comes from things I can't affect.

I thought home was a safe escape from university problems but now it's even worse than there.

I've lost my motivation to live, what's the point in waking up? We all die, so why not now?
