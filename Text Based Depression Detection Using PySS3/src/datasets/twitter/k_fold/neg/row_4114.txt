can someone please fucking help meI'm tired. I'm so so tired, of this same routine over and over and over again. I'm tired of the meds. I'm tired of the therapies. I know I'm not using my coping skills right now, and I don't want to. 

I'm isolated. I'm pushing my boyfriend out because I can't separate this numbness from anything else. I've been getting my medication and therapy in secret, because my family doesn't believe in treating mental illness, or that what I have is an illness. 

I've tried writing this out four times now and I'm so ashamed of myself. It feels good to write but after I look at how pathetic it all sounds. I'm out of the abusive homes. I'm fed everyday. I have hot, clean water and a pair of shoes. 

I just need someone who understands.
