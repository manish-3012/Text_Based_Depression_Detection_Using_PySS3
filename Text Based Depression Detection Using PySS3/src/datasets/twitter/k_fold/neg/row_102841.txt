Death by verapamil injection(any doctor here)First of all i want to say iâ€™m not going to kill myself right away. I simply want some information. I donâ€™t know if this is the right thread. if i did inject it it would be with the intention to end my life.

I have enough reasons to not do it right away. 


Iâ€™m not looking for mental support! 


just some technical advice.

I have 480mg of verapamil extended release pills. I wanted to know if i crush them and inject them IV would that be lethal. I weight around 60kg male(iâ€™m skinny as hell i know)
Iâ€™m also aware that 480mg of powder would be hard to inject, it would most likely take several syringes or getting a very big one.

i popped (chewed it for instant release) the same amount the other day which did not do anything much but make me sleepy and not feel my legs (and barely feel heatbeat)

I know itâ€™s a dangerous drug and a higher dose + alcohol(and why not other drugs)  could be lethal but i donâ€™t have any more unfortunately 

Thank you. I hope nobody gets offended by this post

I simply want to make sure i have an easy (painless) way out just in case.
