How do people keep goingI dont understand how people can be okay with working 40-60 hour weeks every week for 60 years just to afford the bare essentials of food, water and shelter. Most people will work these long weeks in a job they hate, being used and treated like crap buy their boss just to survive and have maybe $100 at the end of the week (if even that) to spend on themselves.

I understand many people have girlfriends/boyfriends but for those that don't have that and don't have family what is the point? I'm working myself physically to death, let alone my mental state just to survive. Every week im on the knife-edge of not being able to pay my rent so forget about any joys of life (being able to travel, a fancy meal, a hobby, a new tech product etc) 

People say that life gets better but if the best life within the budget i have is watching youtube on my time off, what is the point? Watching youtube is not worth the stress of everything else life entails, not even close.

Anyone else that works a low wage job and has no loved ones, what keeps you here?
