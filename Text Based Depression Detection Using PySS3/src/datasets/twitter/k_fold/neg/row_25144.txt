Guys I'm going to rest nowMy life is over. For too long have I battled with depression, anxiety, loneliness and ptsd. I took 10 xanaxes just now. I might throw up, hopefully it will be peaceful.

Nobody will miss me, I have no friends, maybe putting something on the internet will make this public I guess.
