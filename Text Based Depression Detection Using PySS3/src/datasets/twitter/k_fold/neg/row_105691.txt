I am not worthy of life.I don't have a busy life ever since I was fired from 7/11. I go to one college course 4 days a week, and stay at home the rest of the time. I am at my lowest in every way and it is a shame and a net drag on the world around me that I continue to live. I talk to my mom and it only upsets her. I struggle to take care of my dog. I don't talk to any of my friends in fear of revealing that I am severely depressed over complete failure in life. I have lost friends this way and I'm afraid of pushing away the remaining ones. 


I have known my mind at its peak, and it has been on a decline for 6 years. I was smarter at 14 than I am now. I was faster, smarter, quicker to pick up and get good at hobbies and classes. I used to barely pay attention in school, yet excel well enough to where I've been accused of cheating by my own teachers. Now I take one class I passed in 8th grade in community college, and I struggle. It takes my entire mental capacity to recollect and apply formulas and rules. It's upsetting. I used to write poetry without being aware of any literary rules and I would win contests and impress people. I have not written anything in years without wanting to burn it. People say I'm hard on myself. I'm not even close to hard enough on myself, knowing what I was capable of. 


I have not gotten a good night of sleep in what feels like forever. I don't dream. I find it amazing that I am able to leave the house and mask internal pain enough to where I am not asked if I'm okay, because it feels like it's always about to burst over the surface. 


Being fired from 7/11 is among one of the many things in 2016 that has made me feel like I am not worthy to continue on with my life. There are certain checkpoints that indicate you have failed past the point of no return and that is surely one of them. I think it's time to quit my life before it gets worse, for the sake of not embarrassing myself any further and to save other people from attempting to coach me or clean up after my mistakes. 


Suicide seems like the natural course of action to take. I am not happy. I have found no direction or purpose to my life, and I am blindly grasping in what seems like endless darkness. No one has ever loved me, let alone held my hand. I have no social, intellectual, or creative value to the world at large. The world itself is losing all its beauty and wonder and continues to hemmorage the people and things that gave it that. 


The only thing keeping me alive is not upsetting my mom or my dog. Perhaps my death will benefit their lives in the long run over the emotional damage it will cause in the short term. I only wish to know the most painless, least damaging way to end my life.
