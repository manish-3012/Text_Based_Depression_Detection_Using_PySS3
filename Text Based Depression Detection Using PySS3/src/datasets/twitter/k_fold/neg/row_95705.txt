I don't feel safe with myself anymoreI've had depression for almost ten years. However, lately, now more than ever before, I've wanted to die. I've been thinking about it all day, and not just thinking about it but really heavily considering it. Ive locked myself in my room all day so i wouldn't overdose and the thought and relief of dying has overcome every thought i have. Never has it been this consuming and seemed so close to me.
