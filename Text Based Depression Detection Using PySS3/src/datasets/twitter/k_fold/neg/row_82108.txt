Are teens like me, meant to feel abused and depressed ?I want to kill myself. Iâ€™m turning 16 in September. Iâ€™ve lived a very fortunate life, and I'm grateful for all that Iâ€™ve been blessed with. Since my early childhood, Iâ€™ve been bullied by numerous people. Then, at 12 years old, my dad and mom started to physically and emotionally abuse me. Now, at 15 years old, Iâ€™m going to start school very soon again. This year, 5th/junior year, I donâ€™t want to wear a hijab. Iâ€™ve been bullied and outcasted for so long that I just want to fit in. I donâ€™t have any friends, no one likes me and rightfully so. I just want to be able to not cover my hair, just for the last, two school years of my life before uni. I know itâ€™ll boost my confidence and make me feel like myself if I didnâ€™t wear it. Truth be told, Iâ€™m secretly not religious and an atheist, but I really do respect Islam a lot. I told my parents that I donâ€™t want to wear the headscarf, but they lashed out. My mom screamed at me for hours and then my dad beat me up when I tried to logically reason with him. I dress extremely modestly and never show my body, nor do I have the intentions to. I just want to be able to let my hair be free, since Iâ€™ll be wearing a school uniform. I feel so alone and that no one ever understands me. I have a â€˜bad-guyâ€™ reputation, where everyone in my life blames me for everything. I feel so empty. I tried to call childline three times over the year, but each time, I got so scared and hung up before I spoke. I have no one, Iâ€™ve only ever comforted myself. I donâ€™t want to self-diagnose or seem like an â€˜attention-whoreâ€™ either, but Iâ€™ve felt depressed for three years now. Nothing in my life is worth living for, not even music. Music was the only reason I didnâ€™t kill myself years ago, itâ€™s the only thing that ever helped me, the only hope I ever had. Now, everything feels so numb to me; I can hardly feel anything but irritability/anger or an emptying sadness. Iâ€™m tired of crying myself to sleep constantly. Iâ€™m so foolish to think that I could have a good future, all Iâ€™ve ever dreamed of is happiness. This is my last resort and then Iâ€™ll kill myself by ODâ€™ing on over-the-counter painkillers; can someone give me advice ?
