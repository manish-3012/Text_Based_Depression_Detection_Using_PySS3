I'm afraid, please help meI don't understand..I have a loving family, great friends, a very supportive girlfriend, but I still feel so lonely. I don't feel like I'm the worst person to ever exist, I just feel like I'm not worth anything. I'm not smart. I'm not good looking. I can't draw, play music, I just cannot do anything special. Everyone on this planet is more interesting than me, everyone has at least one good side. I don't. 

Since the past few years, I've started to feel bad. I had to stop going to classes for a few months, I've started hitting myself, I have paranoid thoughts on how everyone secretely just pity me, I'm just feeling..worthless. 

Since a few weeks, I have obsessive thoughts about ending my life.. I don't want to die, I'm afraid of killing myself, and at the same time I'm really good at telling myself it's the answer when it obviously isn't. I feel like I'm becoming mad, I feel like I'm losing control over myself.. 

Please, don't let me hurt myself
