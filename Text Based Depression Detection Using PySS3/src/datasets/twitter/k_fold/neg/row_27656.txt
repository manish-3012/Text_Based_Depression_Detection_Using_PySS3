I've been crying most of the dayMy siblings went to Florida without telling me, and tried to cover it up.
My dad's house has family pictures without me in them. They give me a dirty couch to sleep on if I stay the night.
Everyone I care about has deeply hurt me at some point. Most of my family keeps at it, still to this day. Talking shit about the girl I still care for, making me out to be the ass if I defend her. 
I feel alone, isolated. Without a place to belong.
Had a girl that I used to talk. I could talk to her about this stuff, but not anymore. Guess I'm too broken.
Im honestly soo tired of this. I've got no one to vent to. I've got no one, that actually seems to give a flying fuck about me. Worst of all, my best friend won't talk to me. I'm seriously lost, and been thinking of suicide a lot lately. Not that I'd do it, but it seems to be the better alternative. If only I was brave enough.
