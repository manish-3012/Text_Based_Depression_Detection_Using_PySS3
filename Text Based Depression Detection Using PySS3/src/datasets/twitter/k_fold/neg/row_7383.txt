I am accepting my upcoming deathDear Reddit,

I had a lot of blast and good times being here. But I guess my time is finally coming. I feel empty inside as I never was before, after calling my so beloved now ex-girlfriend for the last time. I really love her, and this is why my life is coming to an end.

Redditors, who are reading this probably last message, try to be happy. Despite how life lets you down, remember all the good times and move on towards a better future. Move on for me, as I can't move anywhere. Move for me, as I am bleeding out from cuts.

Love you all,

Juodvarnis
