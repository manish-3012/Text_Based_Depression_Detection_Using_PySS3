I will never have a "dream" life.I will never have a child. I will never have a home. I don't have the building blocks to have a basic life in the USA and it's heartbreaking. No need to ask me why.. I'm just fucking poor. I'm married but I don't have a job because of Autism/anxiety. He struggles to support us becuse you litterlaly can't be married and have one partner not work. We might get me disability but the goverment will pass judgement in their favor i'm sure.

what purpose does someone like me have? I can't work? I can't reproduce? I just eat food and take up space.
