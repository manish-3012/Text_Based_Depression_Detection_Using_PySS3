Starting to think saying I survived isn't accurateMy response to how I'm feeling is always that I'm alive. Now I'm beginning to think that's not true. Honestly if I was strong enough, I'd already be dead. I have nothing, no one. This pain keeps resonating through my body. Mentally and physically. I can't run from it. I had a plan of leaving everyone and starting over but it'll be a long while before I can put that plan into action. Can I even survive that long? Should I just give up now and finally put an end to the voices in my head?
