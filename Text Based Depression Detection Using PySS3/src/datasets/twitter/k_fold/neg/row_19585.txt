I can't take this anymore. But I can't kill myself because of my family. Please helpI am 18 and I have attempted grade 11 twice even though I was pretty good at all subjects. Guess why? Because I bailed on my final exams due to severe anxiety. Now, I've gone and done the same thing again! Surprise, surprise. 

I lost my dad under mysterious circumstances so me dying would be the last straw for my family, which is my mom and my younger brother. I can't live. But I can't die either. 

I'm going to dropout. I'll be a bigger disappointment. I'll lose all my friends and education. I'll probably live as a bum into drugs before I kill myself. Please help me. I don't know what to do. I can't take any of this anymore.
