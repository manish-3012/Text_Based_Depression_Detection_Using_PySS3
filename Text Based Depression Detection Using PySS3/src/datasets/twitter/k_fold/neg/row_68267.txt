A life changing eventWell I've been suicidal for the past 4 or so years. I've been going to therapy, was hospitalized this year, and going back to therapy again. I was as fine as I could be living with mental illness, until I found out I'm pregnant. I have my boyfriend in my ear telling me to get an abortion while in the other ear is my entire family saying "don't kill my niece/nephew/grandchild".

I'm in no place to have a child. I have lots of supports that would help me if I chose to keep the baby, but I just graduated with my bachelor's and have yet to find a job (I do have a promising interview next week though). 

With the stress of everything I've felt literally mentally insane. I've been hearing voices and seeing things which I attribute to my very high stress levels and lack of sleep. I need help because obviously I cannot die right now, it isnt just me anymore. But I've been feeling like a danger to myself. I have access to perscriptions (240 benzos and ambien). This news has just made me go spiraling and I dont know what to do. 

If you've read this far, thank you. Someone to talk to would just be nice.
