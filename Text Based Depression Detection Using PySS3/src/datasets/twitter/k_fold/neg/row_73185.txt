This is not workingSometimes it feels like maybe, perhaps, I can make it out of this alive; that Iâ€™m too young to die, and that thereâ€™s this will all get better soon. I donâ€™t feel that way right now, needless to say. Everything is perfect. Objectively that is. I donâ€™t feel good though. I never do. No matter how good my life is I can still not shake this awful feeling. I just want out.

I recently turned 18 and I was planning to go on my birthday, but that didnâ€™t work out. I keep faking myself out, and thinking that this illness is just temporary. I think Iâ€™m going to have to live with it my whole life. I think I might just cut it short.
I really hope I can muster up the goddamn balls this time.
