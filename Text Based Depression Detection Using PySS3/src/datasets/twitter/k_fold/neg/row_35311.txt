Feels like my entire world is collapsingI used to cut my thigh to avoid accidentally cutting too deep somewhere fatal. Not anymore. I cut my forearms today and itâ€™s only a matter of time before I reach my wrists and the arteries. I donâ€™t want to die but itâ€™s too much, I canâ€™t handle it. Every time I place my trust in someone and open up I end up betrayed and cast aside like dirt. I feel like a broken toy. I really donâ€™t want to do this, I really donâ€™t. Someone please help.
