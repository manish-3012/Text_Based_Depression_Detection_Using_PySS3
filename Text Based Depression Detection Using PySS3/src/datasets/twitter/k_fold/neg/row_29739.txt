Ending it on vdayEvery single valentines day I have been alone and lonely and suffering. I'm approaching 30 and still feel like I've never been loved. Valentines day is a big FUCK YOU in my face over how lonely I am. I would love to kill myself in front of a bunch of happy couples as a big FUCK YOU back.
