I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreI have always been an introvert not ever going anywhere or liking to go out with â€œfriendsâ€ never wanting to go party just always keeping to myself I finally got into a serious relationship thatâ€™s lasted 2 years and itâ€™s made me the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been but the last couple of months Iâ€™ve messed up and now Iâ€™ve lost her completely I have had these terrible thoughts almost as if itâ€™s not me just telling me to kill myself giving me all kinds of different ways I could do it I feel like thereâ€™s nobody left that I can talk to nobody that I can confide in not like I did with her I told her everything all of the worst things that have happened to me things I havenâ€™t told anybody ever and now itâ€™s just all gone Iâ€™m never going to find that kind of comfort with anybody else ever I have nothing left to live for
