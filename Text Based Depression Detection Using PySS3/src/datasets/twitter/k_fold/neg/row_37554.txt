how do you cope with losing a parent to suicide?My dad committed suicide a week ago. He was an alcoholic along with having many other mental demons. He put me through a lot of shit throughout the years and so for the past couple of years I mostly avoided his phone calls and making trips to visit him. I never doubted that my dad loved me, I just didn't want to deal with him. I guess now I just feel guilty that I didn't care more or try to help him more. He really needed me, but I guess I've realized that too late. I'm having trouble coping and don't know where to go from here or how to feel better. Can anyone help me?
