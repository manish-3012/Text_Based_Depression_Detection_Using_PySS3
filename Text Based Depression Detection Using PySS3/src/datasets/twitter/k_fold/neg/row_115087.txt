Trying to help my friendI found out yesterday, that my best friend was cutting, she's very depressed, and she smokes cigarettes,&amp; she's anorexic. I didn't find this out all at one time, but piece by piece. 

Anyone that know's my friend who I am going to call Peyton, knows that she is very quiet and shy, but when it's just you and her, she's very depressed. She hates herself, and her body image. She cuts her arm's and legs and on occasion her wrist. She really feels helpless, and I fell even more helpless. 
I feel like I caught in one of those scenes in a movie where one person is about to do something really bad, and the other person doesn't know, therefore they will not do anything about it.  
Except, I know her secret, it's a lot for someone to watch their best friend suffer like that, she thinks she is only harming herself, and she's wrong, she hurts me, her parents, her sisters &amp; everyone around her.

She isn't bullied, she isn't from a broken home, her parent's seem to give her anything if she want/needs it. 

She's a extremely nice girl and deserves so much more than what she thinks of herself. 

I'm not sure what to do.
