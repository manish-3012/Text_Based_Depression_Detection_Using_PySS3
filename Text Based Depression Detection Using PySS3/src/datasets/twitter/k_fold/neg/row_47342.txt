WhyI feel like Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for my entire life well at least most of it. Iâ€™m currently at a state where I just donâ€™t want to live anymore. I hate everything about my life and feel so alone. I donâ€™t have family thatâ€™s present in my life, donâ€™t have any friends that are really friends. Iâ€™m not important to anyone. I just donâ€™t understand why God is punishing me and making me stay here on this earth.
