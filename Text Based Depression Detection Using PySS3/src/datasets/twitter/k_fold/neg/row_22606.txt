How to help my friend who is severely depressed and has talked about suicide?He's been depressed for years, I've talked to him about it loads but he insists that after 5+ years of seeing countless therapists he can't be fucked anymore. I've got no idea what to do, I feel completely lost. he says he genuinely doesn't see himself getting better and no longer wants to. He has cut himself off from family, is 21yo, is a genuinely great person but I don't know how to make him realise that. 

Thank you to anyone who can offer help.
