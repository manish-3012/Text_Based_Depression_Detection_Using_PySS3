Iâ€™m so tired of thisI think I need to give up.

I work two jobs and I love what I do, I have excellent health insurance. I canâ€™t afford my life. Right now Iâ€™m crashing with family and theyâ€™ve made it clear theyâ€™re not impressed with my financial situation they think my lack of money is unacceptable because I could just suck it up and work harder. I work so fucking  hard! My job loves me. I just donâ€™t make very much. After my car payment, car insurance, gas, health insurance, phone and food (I try not to eat very much. A coffee in the morning and maybe something for lunch. If Iâ€™m really hungry Iâ€™ll have breakfast too but I try not to.)... I just donâ€™t have enough for rent and utilities. I canâ€™t spent 60% of my monthly income (or more) on a place to live and risk losing my car because then Iâ€™d lose my job. Iâ€™ve looked at renting a spare bedroom in someoneâ€™s house but even that is more than I can afford running 700-800 a month and that doesnâ€™t always include parking or many utilities (if any at all) at my full time job I make $14 and my part time job is $11. The places I can afford are 2-4 hours away from my job and Iâ€™d have to start over but thereâ€™s no guarantee that Iâ€™d find jobs in these towns and no guarantee that by the time I found new jobs the place I was looking at would still be available. Sometimes I take a day off because I just canâ€™t spread myself so thin and then I feel sick because I could be making money to get myself out of this situation!

Iâ€™m so stressed as it is, if I was brave Iâ€™d start over somewhere else but I have no doubts Iâ€™d end up exactly where I am in a different setting. Iâ€™m not happy. I donâ€™t have a healthy family, we arenâ€™t close, they want me to leave and they donâ€™t care if I need to sleep in my car. I have a younger sibling who is frequently unemployed and is frequently 100% financially dependent on my parents and theyâ€™re okay with that but theyâ€™re not going to help me and I canâ€™t ask. Nothing happened to make them not like me itâ€™s just always been like that. Iâ€™m single. I donâ€™t have friends I can crash with theyâ€™re all married/have kids and living their own life they donâ€™t need me invading their space. I have friends but I donâ€™t have the money to go out to eat or anything like that because that seems like a waste of money so we donâ€™t hang out. Iâ€™ve looked for better paying jobs and Iâ€™m just not qualified for much which is my own fault. Iâ€™ve been telling myself since I was 18 that the struggle is temporary and Iâ€™ll get through it. I told myself that Iâ€™d find my person and weâ€™d get married and have a family and Iâ€™d be glad I didnâ€™t give up. Iâ€™m almost 30 and I canâ€™t do this anymore. My life isnâ€™t valuable. Iâ€™m not happy and Iâ€™m so far from where I thought Iâ€™d be. My relatives and friends would be sad if I died but this wouldnâ€™t ruin their life theyâ€™d be fine without me. I feel like Iâ€™m wasting my life and longer it goes the more I realize Itâ€™s going to be like this forever. The only person Iâ€™m living my life for is me and I canâ€™t afford it and I donâ€™t have the work ethic to work more hours than I already do, so why am I still here?
