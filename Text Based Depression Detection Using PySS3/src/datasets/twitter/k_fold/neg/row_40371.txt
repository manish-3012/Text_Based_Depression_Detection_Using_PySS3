So I suck at thisThrowaway.

First time I discovered this community, I dove in immediately(Tips? Guides? Oh pfft.) I was posting this and that and the other thing to every post I could get my hands on, convinced I was doing some good.

Looking back on it, I commented on 20-40 posts, and only heard positive messages/replies back from three. 3/20 is 15%. 3/40 is 7.5%. 100%-15%=85%. 100%-7.5%=92.5%. That means I have a failure rate between 85% and 92.5%.

After my 85% fail rate (not to mention blatant violations of rule 1a), I realized that I wasn't actually that good at helping people in a time of crisis. So I closed the account and made a new one, forgetting all of the history between me and this subreddit.

Unfortunately, I never forgot about the lives I have touched, for better or worse. I still come here sometimes, but I never post, reminding myself that lives are at stake here. These aren't just text walls that should be consoled. They have people who love them and need them in their lives, even if they forget that sometimes.

Anyway, I have been debating whether or not to actually post this, and, as you could probably tell, I decided to. Don't know why I feel it necessary to explain this. I just suddenly feel like I should.

Anyway, see ya guys whenever.
