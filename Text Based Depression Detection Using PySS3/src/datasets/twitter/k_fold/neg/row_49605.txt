I feel so fucking alone.I don't even know what to type, I just feel so fucking empty right now. I only have one person worth living for and he probably wouldn't care much if I died anyways. He knows I want to die but hasn't done much to sway me besides get angry at me for wanting to leave early. I just want a hug. I feel literally deprived of physical contact. It literally feels like torture at this point. Living like this isn't humane. No human should go so long without being loved that they would rather kill themselves than go another day living in pain.
