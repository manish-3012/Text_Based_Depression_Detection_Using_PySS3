Have you ever felt completely worthless.. well today I feel like thatI just posted why in r/offmychest, but I don't feel like it's out of my chest yet, and this sucks.
My ex boyfriend made me feel like a pice of garbage, like I'm worth nothing, like I'm just disposable and I can't bare it,I know I have to be strong and not care about him... but it's so fucking hard no to feel what I feel.
And I'm crying in my bed thinking is it really worth it to be alive, I just want the pain to stop, I don't want to feel anymore, I want to be numb
