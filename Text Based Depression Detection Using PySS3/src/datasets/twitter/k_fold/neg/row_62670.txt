Remember that depression is a diseaseHey friends,

Like any disease, depression can get better or worse. The feeling of hopelessness, sadness, panic, that's not you. It's what's suffocating you. 

My depression peaked this summer. I attempted suicide and was hospitalized for a week, and in an inpatient program for another week. When I woke up, I told the doctor I wished I was successful.

Today, I didnt have a single suicidal thought, and I almost didnt have any suicidal thoughts this week. It's still not great or normal, but it is better, and it looks like it can keep getting better. I have hope.

I credit this almost entirely to the medicine I'm taking now. I finally found something that works for me, even though it took a long time.

Check with your insurance if you have it. I still have student insurance, and the 50$ copays a month is worth not feeling terrible all the time. 

If you don't have insurance, theres probably a good chance you qualify for a state program or Medicaid. Give them google and a phone call, they can figure out if you're eligible. It's probably better than nothing. 

If you had a persistent cold, you'd eventually visit a doctor. Remember that this is no different.
