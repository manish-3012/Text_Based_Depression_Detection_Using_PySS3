I donâ€™t want to do it anymoreThe world is such a selfish bad place. The longer I stay in it the more I resent humanity. I miss being able to believe in a god because now thereâ€™s no one to turn to. Thereâ€™s no purpose for this suffering. 

The only thing holding me back from dying is I know it would hurt people. Iâ€™m trying not to be another selfish person in this world but it hurts so much. 

I just want to be dead already.
