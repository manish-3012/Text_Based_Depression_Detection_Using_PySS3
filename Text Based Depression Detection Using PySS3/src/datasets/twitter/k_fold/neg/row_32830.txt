I feel like dyingI fought with my boyfriend. I tried to talk to him about a manipulative behavior of his. I stayed calm the whole time and he completely freaked out. I tried to talk to him in a normal way but he just continued freaking out. My suicide thoughts feel like they're going to kill me instead of me killing myself. I'm drinking rn and I'm about to have a panic attack and I hope I will be able to control myself enough to not do shit. I really "want" to cut right now but I know that it would upset him and make him angry at himself and I don't want that. I don't want him to blame himself for that.
