"Getting help" hasn't done me any good. Don't know what to do anymore.I was going to try to focus this post on one thing, but I'm sitting here and realizing there's not one reason I'm tired of life. Obviously my brain is pretty broken - I've been struggling with depression for more than ten years now. 

More than that, my life actually does suck, probably because my mental health is shit. I'm unemployed, likely unemployable, and don't really have any friends. I'm just kind of existing. Professional help has yet to be of any help to me, and yet it seems like "get help" is the only advice I've ever gotten. 

I don't know what to do with any of this. I'm incredibly tired. I don't know how to expect things to get better when they consistently don't.
