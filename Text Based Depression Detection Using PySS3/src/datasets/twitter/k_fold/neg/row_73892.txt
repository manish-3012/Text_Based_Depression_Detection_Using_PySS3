No one staysHalf of this experience is trying to find relationships that stick.
Natural life progression is that things change.

I dont want to be needy.
I am judged if I am.

I don't understand the rules.
I'm tired of being alone.
I can weather a lot, but late nights are brutal.

So much is good.
Why doesnt the feeling end?
