I've touched my sibling when i was little and now i regret it.When i was around the age of 11, im 14 now, i touched my sibling, she was the age of 12. I don't know if she was actually sleeping or not. I didnt think much of it until now. I don't know if its considered abuse or not, as i did it 3 times. I don't know what to do now, because i realised what i have done, and i cant forgive the tought of that. The people i know have also been ignoring me recently, same with friends and i need support, What should i do? Thoughts of suicide have came trough my mind since the last month.
