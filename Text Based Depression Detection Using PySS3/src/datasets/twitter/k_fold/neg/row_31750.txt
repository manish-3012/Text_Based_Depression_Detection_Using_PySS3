I'm hurting so much and I've done everything I canI've called the suicide hotline. Multiple times. Around 5 over a few weeks. I went through their assessment to get recommendations for psychiatry/therapy. But the best place they recommended literally never answered when I called.

I called more places. 1 needed me to establish primary care there to access their therapists. The one I'm trying currently is taking over a month between visits because of how busy they are and I haven't even finished the fucking assessment stage which started in January. My next visit is March 18.

And I find out today I no longer have health insurance, and with no way to pay out of pocket, no point in continuing. 

Meanwhile everyday is so fucking exhausting and draining that I can't concentrate at work or any task because of these thoughts that preoccupy my head. Every night is so hard and I can only fall asleep if I'm completely exhausted. I have suicidal thoughts often and no one I talk to helps. 

I actually think I can't do anything anymore. What the fuck else am I supposed to do lol. I can't wait months for this shit or afford it out of pocket. And meanwhile everyday is hurting more and more. It feels hopeless
