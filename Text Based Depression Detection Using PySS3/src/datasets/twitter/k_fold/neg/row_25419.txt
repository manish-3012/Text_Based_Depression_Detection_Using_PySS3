How im gonna end it
I think i decided that im definitly going to do it, so this is how, soon i will get a license and get myself a gun, then im going to go in a camping trip, waaaayyy deep in a forest then boom, that way i can end it in a way that doesnt make me suffer and theres a good chance that no one will see my body for a very long time.

im just gonna give it to you straight, when i was 10 years old i was raped unfortunatly for me, it wasnt a 1 time thing, anyways, now im feeling preety deppresed, self steem all the way down, feel worthless, like i got no value, all that caused me to be preety anti social, and while im always pretending im fine and im happy, in reality i just cannot wait im dead honestly the only thing that was keeping me from doing it was that i believed in god, but answer me this, if god is real why would he allow for that thing to happen to me knowing it would lead to me ending my life isnt he all loving? So i guess now i believe theres no hell so whatever, and if there is oh well, whatever

Im 17 right now and im planning on doing it some time after im 18, some say that drinking helps ease pain, so why not give that a try, and who know maybe after i get a job and live a little more i'll change my mind
