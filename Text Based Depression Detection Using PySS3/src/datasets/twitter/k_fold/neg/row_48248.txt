I am dropping out of collegeThis is it. After 3 years I am failing college without degree. I have 3 weeks till the end of the semester, but it is not enough time to finish all my projects. If I fail just one class they will drop me out. In other words they will drop me out for sure.

3 years of life wasted. I will have to move back to my parents to shitty redneck town, take some shitty job at gas pump. I have no friends because of social anxiety and if I will have zero chance for any social life.

IDK why I am writing here, maybe just need place to vent. I have been thinking about suicide, but haven't decided how I will do it. I want it to be painless and I don't want to cause lot of mess (like jumping under train or out of building).

EDIT: Great, now I am crying in my room like a little bitch.

Little more info about me. I come from poor family. However my parents wanted that me and my brother focus on studying. I didn't need to have job. Every time I wanted to take some job, my parents told me they will give me money and that I should invest this time into studying. This way I didn't gain any work experience.

Anyway, I went to study theoretical computer science. My parents are funding everything. I can't just come back and tell them that how much money I have wasted and still I have no degree and no experience for decent job. Also when I was at elem school / high school I was the smart kid. I can't meet my old friends now and tell them I am dropout. I just can't bare the shame.
