Iâ€™m just a cowardI wish I had the courage to end it. Itâ€™s so easy to die. I could be dead in a matter of minutes.
Itâ€™s the obvious solution. In an instant, Iâ€™m no longer a burden. No one has to worry about me or pay for my therapy or spend time with me out of pity. Everyone wins. But I canâ€™t bring myself to do what I know is right.
