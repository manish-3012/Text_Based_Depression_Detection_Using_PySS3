I'm scared my girlfriend will harm herself if I break up with her.Context is available here:  [I'm \[22M\] in a relationship \[23F\] I don't want to lose, but it's costing everything around me. : relationships (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kdulfr/im_22m_in_a_relationship_23f_i_dont_want_to_lose/) 

I'm afraid that if I were to break up with my girlfriend, she has shown reason for me to be concerned she will seriously harm herself. Because her family is unaware I exist, I feel calling the police to prevent this outcome would be not ideal, especially considering her family would particularly dislike the idea of her dating a white guy. 

Are there particular things I can do to minimise this risk of her harming herself?
