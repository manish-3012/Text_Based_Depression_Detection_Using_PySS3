Feeling so broken right nowHi,
Iâ€™m in my room crying right now about my circumstances, and trying to think of the positive things coming my way soon, but itâ€™s so hard to think on that knowing the problems Iâ€™m dealing with right now.

I was injured in late February where I sustained an ankle fractures that required surgery to add a metal plate and 2 screws in it. I also fractured my pelvis in three places as well. My bf of one year broke up with me because I stopped being the girl he fell in love with. Shortly after a guy I used to get to know but I stopped and politely rejected him (waited 3 months for him but he asked for even more time which I said into) reached out again. 

Well the guy told me that after things didnâ€™t work out for us he he spent a year and some months literally praying to God for my ill health, and that I would fracture a few bones, and that God would leave me barren (his words). Well I blocked him after he told me that. Itâ€™s July now, and his words still leave me shocked.


Iâ€™m really broken right now from my pain from my injuries, the quality of my life sucks, being hated so much that someone could wish me ill, and Iâ€™m alone in this world with no friends. My ex was my best friend but what we had is over now.

I donâ€™t really have someone in my life that I can even take to.
