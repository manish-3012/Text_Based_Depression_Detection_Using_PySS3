That's it, she just killed me.[ESL] I'm 30+ year old, and I was already a depressive all along from my teenage years or something. 
Fell in love with someone very long distance, went to see her, everything was great, I'm sure she was honest too, then suddenly some time after going back home things went downhill and it ended.
Could have ended peacefully as it started but some kind of misunderstanding made it end on her hating the shit out of me. Like, "stop breathing my air" and blocking me.

Losing my first and only love, and the fact that I've never been openly hated by anyone (how do I even deal with no being able to coming to terms with someone you had such strong feelings for and the fact that you have no way to even talk to her anymore to solve it at least), is a nail in the coffin.
Add this to my night job from 10 years which allows me to pay bills but is hell in a way cause it's only nights and weekends and made me miss most of my social life. And I'm too old and unskilled to find anything new.
This love was a miracle, I'm not desirable at all (was a virgin up until one year ago) and I somehow turned it into hate not even understanding how.

I don't have any strength anymore, this hurts me so much, even my thoughts about not suiciding or disappearing entirely because it would hurt my family and friends are starting to fade. And this scares me. I've always been extremely depressive on a regular basis and thought about suicide but thinking about it so calmly like "I can't bear this anymore, this might actually be the only way"...this is fucking scary.
