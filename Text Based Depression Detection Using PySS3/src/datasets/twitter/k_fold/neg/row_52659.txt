I never thought I would come hereI never thought I would come here, because I really, really tried my best. I don't want to go. I really don't. But I'm tired of hurting myself. I'm tired of hurting the people I care. I'm tired of the dark. I'm tired of not being able to make sense to myself and putting in efforts into life without getting any result. It's too much to handle. It's beyond too much to handle. I really don't want to go but that's all my mind talks about when i wake up or go to sleep. My mind can't think of anything but leaving. I can't hurt my friends by leaving, but I've hurt them enough. I can't stop thinking about death. I wish I could slip away in my sleep, peacefully and painlessly. Atleast people won't blame themselves, and it might be a little easier to move on. At this point I don't know what I'm saying, but I can't control myself. I don't want to go. I need help.
