Break downWorking from home made  sandwich started thinking.. fell on the floor begging someone to just end my life. I cant do this anymore. I do not want to live. I am am done. Their is nothing for me in life. I cant anymore.  I will pay someone at this point to do it.  I thought about hiring a hitman. Maybe should look more into it. I just know I am done. DONE. I am not sad about it. I am just done.
