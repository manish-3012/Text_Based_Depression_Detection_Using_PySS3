I am really strugglingI know people always say stuff like "It's temporary, it will pass" etc etc and they are usually right but I am finding it so hard today.  
I am nearly 30, been single for years now, never had a serious relationship as I keep being cheated on. 

On Saturday night I was walking away from a club to catch a taxi home when some random dude in a group walked round a corner, saw me and just went "You're ugly you are".  I have mastered living alone, running a house, being independent, enjoying my space. Now I would be OK with someone being part of that and sharing adventures but maybe Saturday night was a sign I just won't have the looks.

I feel like an outsider amongst my closest friends as they are all either married or in relationships. I have been told I don't get invited to stuff sometimes because it's not fair to make me an extra wheel.

One of my best friends says she doesn't really like people in her house as its her space so I haven't been in over 2 yrs but some friends of our in a group have been over 2 or 3 times recently including last night. Then I get told off for feeling left out or like an outsider.

I am just so angry and frustrated at the world all the time. It would be better if I was not around but I can't do that to my mum so what on earth do I do!   
I am in so much pain. I just want to hurt myself as punishment but I am sat at work. Ugh
