The car I live in is up for repossession. Got a job and lost it after a week due to debt.I live in my car, because of car payments and being unemployed. Today is the 3rd time debt collectors have contacted my employer since I've been there. Today they told me they no longer need someone for my position. I have worked 4 days so far. Monday-Wednesday last week and today.  They were calling last week and I asked them not to, and I got 2 letters from them at work. 

I normally just keep trying to work through everything and try to make it better. Everything is only a temporary setback. I can turn around and make things even better than it was before. I don't think it's possible anymore. I kept telling myself I will turn this around, after moving to a smaller apartment in a shittier neighborhood. Someone got shot against my front door. I had to get rid of everything except electric, but no worries, I'll though I would eventually turn this around. Well had to move out and nowhere else except my car. Spent all my money to fix the car, because I got a new job. Thought I would be fine. Thought I was working my way up now. Nope nope nope. 

Can I turn this around from a homeless shelter? There is one, I'm just too embarrassed to go over there right now. I just thought homeless were really just crazy people before. Will I land another job again? What's the lowest you guys have been? I'm not normally a depressed person. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore. 

Note: If things seem out of order I'm sorry. I've been staring at this a while add and removing lines while working up the courage to hit submit.
