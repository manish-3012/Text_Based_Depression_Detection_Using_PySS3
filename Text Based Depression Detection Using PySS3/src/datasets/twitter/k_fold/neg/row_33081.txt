I walked in such a trap at my lowest point and now I'm permanently damagedI was feeling fucking suicidal and impulsively wrote suicidal texts to my ex. She gets angry. Then I try to save it by making new accounts, but she keeps engaging and blocking me. After a while she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards' while I became extremely disciplined the last 2 years, quit smoking, gained a lot of healthy weight so I make another new account to tell her I did change and she then DESTROYS me in an extremely harsh message. Turns out she was talking about irrational behavior because once I was arguing with random people at a concert and she completely cursed me out. That hurt me sooooooooo fucking much that for 9 months all I could think about were those words repeating in my head. Out of intense frustration and anger for luring me into a trap by constantly provoking me and then blocking me, I curse her out (in the beginning) and then keep spamming her with explanations for like 4 months. At some point I even wrote a way too personal e-mail where I fully take the blame to her workmail to end it. However, that one gets forwarded to her co-workers because she isn't working there anymore. GREAT! Completely humiliated!

So now I'm permanently damaged because my mental health is ruined by having horrible insults repeat in my head for the rest of my life combined with arguing at that concert and I'm also extremely worried she'll expose me someday because I was extremely mentally ill this year and couldn't stop spamming her trying to make the pain stop. FUUUUUCK.
