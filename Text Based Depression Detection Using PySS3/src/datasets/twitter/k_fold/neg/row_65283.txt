I tried to freeze to death todayAs the title suggests I tried to kill myself by hypothermia today. I just wanted to vent about my experience and another failed attempt. 

I grabbed a couple of my favourite beers, I drove out to my favourite spot, and I waited for the end in a t-shirt and jeans. 

turns out it's not quite cold enough yet at about 1 degree Celsius. I got to the point of numbness in my  extremities and uncontrollable shivering but after two hours of being at that point I decided that if I hadn't already reached the point of starting to feel warm again I wouldn't be able to at that temperature. 

I intend to try again when it gets to the lower negatives, maybe -10 or -15.
