I can't really see much of a way out of thisMy dad is abusive, my mom has no money no friends and her parents probably have no money either.
With the skill-set she has she could never get a job to pay for all of us.
I have no job experience, I don't even have a HS diploma. 
He even turned off the phones, so we can't even contact anybody.
I'm kind of losing hope. I have no idea what to do. If anyone has any advice I could really use it right now. Its getting dark.
