I'm worried about my girlfriendEvery now and then (as people do) my gilfriend of 8 months will just be sad. Bad day, bad week, however long. She does have a bad home life. Divorced parents, willingly telling her she was an a cident, she will never amount to anything, etc. They always leave her on big holidays and go to the casinos and get drunk. They'll hire her ubers because "I can't be bothered to haul your lazy ass around"  that among other things will upset her. Saying I'm the only thing that's worth living for. She does every now and again will say she's depressed. Whether that, bouts of depression, really sad or what, she sometimes will say things like "sitting at the gun safe right now"  which I don't think she is that close, but I'd rather not take a chance. I want to know what else I can do to help. She says I make her the happiest she's ever been, and if course I talk to her to get her mind off things. Take her out as much as I can afford. If she's sad I'll surprise her and drive out (30ish minutes) to her house and spend the day with her. The biggest thing for me is get her away from her parents. Try to bring her to my family. When my parents and I go car shopping or something, she likes to come along. I try to give her an alternate family almost to let her know she's loved. 

Basically, what can I do or say when she gets sad or suicidal? She is super against me reaching out to anyone for help, but if it's as serious as I worry about I want to. But in the meantime, anything? I really don't want to lose her. I really just want someone to talk to about this
