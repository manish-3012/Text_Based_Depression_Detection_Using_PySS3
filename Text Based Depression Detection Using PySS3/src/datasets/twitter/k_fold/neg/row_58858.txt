iâ€™m constantly thinking about what it would be like if i wasnâ€™t here anymorei donâ€™t really have anyone to talk about this to anymore so iâ€™m posting here because hopefully someone can help me to vent 
i donâ€™t really know what iâ€™m doing right now 
all my life iâ€™ve had these dark thoughts and mental issues and depression 
iâ€™ve always had shitty family situation and no family to really confide in 
friends always come and go, and it always feels like my fault, but i can never figure out what is wrong with me 
iâ€™m constantly questioning whatâ€™s wrong with me 
why am i so different from everyone else 
why is everyone else okay and im not what is wrong with me 
i havenâ€™t tried to kill myself since i was 17. then was when i was formally diagnosed with mental illness, and one of my psychs thought I may have an autism spectrum disorder but it was never really looked into. it would make a lot of sense though and explain why social situations and cues are so hard for me and my empathy. 
iâ€™m 21 now. 
i take medication and it helps somewhat but no medication makes everything just go away. i donâ€™t have a job anymore so i canâ€™t afford to go therapy or anything like that. 
iâ€™ve got coping mechanisms that usually help me stay afloat and arenâ€™t self destructive. 
I make art, but Iâ€™m constantly doubting myself and feeling it isnâ€™t good enough. 
this year has probably been the worst year for me. i lost my best friend, who was like a brother to me, to cancer back in april. i havenâ€™t been able to cope very well since then, havenâ€™t hurt myself yet, but I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. i lost a good job, lost a girl that i had really strong feelings for, almost died in a bad car crash. and now, i donâ€™t have anyone who really acts like a true friend to me anymore. everyone else does drugs and stuff and Iâ€™m straight edge so it just makes me feel isolated and alienated. i havenâ€™t even been out of the house except to get a refill on my medicine a few weeks ago. i feel so alone. i made a plan for how i wanted to do it a while back and i canâ€™t stop thinking about it. iâ€™m afraid to leave my little sister behind, and for my best friends mom, i donâ€™t want to disappoint them. but how am I supposed to live like this? how am i supposed to make this go away? all i can think of is how much i want to disappear. i feel like iâ€™m going absolutely nowhere, even though i have a great opportunity ahead of me. my brain just defaults to â€œoh, youâ€™re not gonna make itâ€ or â€œyouâ€™ll just fuck it up anyway like you always doâ€. iâ€™m really just rambling but iâ€™m just so lost. i want so bad to love myself but i canâ€™t. i canâ€™t have confidence or self esteem, itâ€™s been destroyed by years of bullying and broken friendships, and domestic abuse. i donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™m so afraid that one day i wonâ€™t be able to keep the bad thoughts at bay and iâ€™ll just do it. i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m doing anymore.
