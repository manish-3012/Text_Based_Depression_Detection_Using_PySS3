I need someone's adviceFor the past few weeks I've been contemplating suicide every single day... as a bit of background I have struggled with mental health, depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts for many years.. I'm 20. 

It all went to the back of my mind for a few years, and now it's all come back. I recently have moved back home and am transferring to a new college. I was excited at first to be back home around friends and family and my boyfriend. A few weeks before I moved home my boyfriend broke up with me.

We had discussed our future in great depth and we were so in love and now it seems so shattered just like how I feel shattered. We still talk, and he's been my best friend for so long now and he still is. Being around him is hard in ways but I need him and his friendship none the less. I have lost all connection with all the friends I had before, and genuinely feel like he is the only person I have outside of my parents.

He knows I'm hurting and says he wants to be there for me... but last night I told him after much crying about my feelings that I want to kill myself. He was visibly upset but now today he is telling me that he will not continue a friendship with someone who will drain him emotionally with their "drama".. aka me talking about suicide. 

I feel so alone and I cry during almost every part of the day. I'm not sure what to do.
