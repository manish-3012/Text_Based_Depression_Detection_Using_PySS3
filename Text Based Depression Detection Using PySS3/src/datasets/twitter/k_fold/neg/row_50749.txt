I need someone to tell me if I'm ok or notI've been having suicidal thoughts. Not as in "I need to kill myself" but more like just thinking about killing myself. I wouldn't even call it considering; there's almost no emotional response to it. I'll just see a rafter and think to myself if I can hang myself from it, or what it would feel like to bleed out in a bathtub.

I have a long history of depression, but I've always thought it might just be mild. I'm wondering if it's worse than I thought.
