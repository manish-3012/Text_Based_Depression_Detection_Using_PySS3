So my mom said she would be happy to see me fail so I'll have to study all summer. And it's the lightest part of it, She made me feel like Im not his son anymoreI'm probably gonna fail this years's maths exam, which I took today.I had an A on English final exam, even on next years', sam on IT. A on my native language, literature and succeded on theory and practise at first time to get my driving license. We've got to the national championship with my school's basketball team which we've been trying to do for 5 years. I failed once and she hates me now. Even broke up with my girlfriend a week ago.
I wanna die. Literally. Noone gave any credit for any good I did. I don't know whether I should find a job and move from my mother's or should go as far away as I can, to never be seen anymore. 18yo male highschool student. My mother is not disappointed in me. I feel like she gave up on me like forever. Please help my I don't wanna live on Earth anymore
