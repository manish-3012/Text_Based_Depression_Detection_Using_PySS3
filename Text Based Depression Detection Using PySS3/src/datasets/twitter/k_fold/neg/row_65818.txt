I'm 20 years old, $12000 in debt, with no job and no degree.My parents told me to "give college a try" when I told them in high school I didn't want to go.  I blame them for making me waste two years of my life, but I signed the loans, and it's my debt no matter what.  They want me to go back and "finish up" but I can't.  I can't go back to school.

Anyway I've never had a job in my life.  I don't know how to go about getting a good one.  I hear that now isn't the best time to look.  Even if it was, I'm not convinced I'll be any more able to work a job I hate than I was able to get a degree I didn't want.  And my loans are going to start being due in like four months.

Anyway I feel like a lazy, useless asshole.  I feel like the world doesn't really need me in it, and I can't convince myself that my future is worth living.  I like day to day life but that's because I spend every day in my underwear at my parents' house playing League of Legends.  I'm pretty much everything that's wrong with my generation.

Logistically speaking, why shouldn't my goals at this point include eventually convincing myself to kill myself?
