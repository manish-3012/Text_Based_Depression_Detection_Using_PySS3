How do i live without getting highIve been smoking weed since i was 10, taking painkillers since 14, xanax at 15(off now), meth, fent. When i was a young teen i told my self my reason for living was to get high. I was going to get a job so i cluld he high everyday of my life untill i die. About 2 years ago i stabbed my self in my thigh with a steak knife and for the first time i realized i wanted to live. This was pretty short lived honestly because when i got out of the behaveral institute i realized that i i would have hit my femeral atery and died no one would have cared, but anyways. I started doing good, anxiety was there, but panic attacks slowed, depression started to fade and about a year after(?) I decided to get sober and i did for about 7 months and it was good. Then everything started coming back, ive been high every second of every day since then. Im tired of being high though, i have no motivation, i never leave the house unless i work and im never going to get better living how i do now. But everytime i try to get sober i want to kill myself, i dont want to because i love my mom and ive hurt her to much already, i just want to make her happy now i want her to think that i was a good thing to happen to her shes my reason for living now not drugs but i cant be sober. I cant be happy no matter how i try, i hate that im such a pussy and cant be happy, im pissed off that  i ruined the best years of my life by being alone high and idk what to do, i doubt ill be back here, this is a really old account and i think I'll probably log out after this but idk i wanted to tell someone im sorry
