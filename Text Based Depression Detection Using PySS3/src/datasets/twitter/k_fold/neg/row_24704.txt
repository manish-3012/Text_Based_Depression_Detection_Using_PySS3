I want to dieI don't have it in me to do this anymore. I went to my new OB yesterday for a follow up after an STI back in November with my close friend turned FWB. 
Things happened. I wasn't mad. 
Anyway, new OB asks me questions about my relationship with him. Asks if I plan to get pregnant in the next year or two. I say no. 
He tells me, "Well, you're 30. You need to start thinking about it. Maybe it's time to think about being a single mom via sperm donation because you're getting up there." 

This fucked me up worse than I already felt this week because I developed feelings for my friend and he slept with someone else that is known for not just sleeping around but actually bragged about having Chlamydia 5 times. Now, he dropped on me tonight that he's dating her.

I am beyond devastated. I feel like my life is a failure. No one ever chooses me. I can't seem to be enough and I just give up. This is just too much.

The only thing stopping me is feeling like I need to make sure my family doesn't find me after.
