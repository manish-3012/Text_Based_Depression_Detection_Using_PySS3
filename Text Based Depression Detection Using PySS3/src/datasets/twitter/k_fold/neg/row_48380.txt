The rock bottom opens to a deeper pitThis isn't my first rodeo. Been depressed and having suicidal thoughts for a decade, but these past few months have got me seriously considering it. Ever since this whole pandemic started I've been on a long downward spiral. All I've done for the past few months is work and sleep. I feel like a mindless machine that just keeps on breaking. I go months between seeing my significant other and endure emotional abuse from my family. The holiday season is hard enough for me but to make matters worse I tested positive for covid yesterday. I've already felt so alone but now I'm really alone and the guilt of possibly exposing my family hurts me so much. Everyone says that it's not my fault but it feels like it is. No matter how many times they say it isn't I can't believe them. I barely go without crying myself to sleep at night and my student loan payments start up in less than a week. I'm so tired... so fucking tired I just want it all to stop. Sleep isn't enough for me anymore please just kill me.
