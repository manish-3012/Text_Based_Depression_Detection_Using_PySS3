My soul is emptyI don't think I'll actually do something but I need someone to talk to.

My soul is crushed.

My 8 year old girlfriend and I are splitting up. I am going to move on December 1.

I feel like suffocating. I drank heavily today. Also smoked my first cigarette in 2 months.

I don't want my life to end. I'd like the whole world to burn. I would smile while whole life dies. The ultimate war to embrace us all.
