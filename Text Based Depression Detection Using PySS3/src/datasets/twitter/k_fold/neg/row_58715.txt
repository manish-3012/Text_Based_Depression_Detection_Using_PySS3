Telling someone I know more about the abuse in case I kill myself soon. Every day it gets harder to hold off.Idk if she'll believe. I told her some things about two of my family members who abused me, but I didn't tell her how they would all abuse me or that the abuse I experienced was also sexual. I'm worried she'll tell them I told, or she'll think I'm a liar (and still tell them I told) or she'll judge me or so many things, especially concerning are all the potential outcomes I haven't thought of. There's also this voice in my head that 's going "you're a liar, you're lying to her" because I have a history of compulsive lying in the past and for years my abusers have exploited it to gaslight me about every little thing. 

They insist that things didn't happen, or they didn't happen the way I said it happened, or that I deserved it and am pretending I didn't, or that truly I was the awful one for defending myself and so on. Its all really screwed with my head and tbh the abuse, and all the maladaptive coping mechanisms I developed, leave me feeling too ashamed to go out and form meaningful relationships or maintain the ones I have which means I'm falling back on a lady I haven't seen or spoken to for perhaps a year. 

But I need to tell her, in particular because I can't think of a solution for my cats or the other animals my family owns. I can at least ask her to take care of my cats for me if I kill myself, or to speak for me at the mandatory coroner's inquest into my death idk. Still can't help but worry that she'll choose them over me the way everyone has in the past.
