I feel so worn outI asked another guy out, and like normally I only got blocked.  Do you know what itâ€™s like to be blocked on a dating app because of your face?All I want is a boyfriend, sometimes I think if I kill myself Iâ€™ll be born again only lovable. How do you guys deal with rejection, I feel like ending my life tonight, I canâ€™t keep asking out guys and dealing with this. How do you deal with it?
