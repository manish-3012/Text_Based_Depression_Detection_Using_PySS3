I think it's time for me to go.I've been fighting major depressive disorder for over 10 years now. It's not a fight I'm winning. People are distancing themselves from me, in part due to the virus, other's simply because they've moved on. 

When I look into the future, I see this massive void of nothingness. Of just going to work, to go home and lie in bed. I used to daydream, things might get better. But even those dreams have gone away. I don't think of anything. I just stare. 

I've never done anything special with my life, god knows I'm a failure with relationships. So much so to the point I don't even want one anymore. How can I trust someone else when I don't even understand what's wrong with me anymore? 

Even when things got bad with family and I stepped up to help in a massive way, worked my hardest to help someone who ended up in hospital and spent almost $1k on parking over 5 months on visits to try to help them. I still ended up failing. That person, although mentally deficient now, even saying they hated me.

I can't escape this constantly feeling of worthlessness. It's not even that I "Think" I'm not going to amount to anything, I know it. It's there. Persistent. A constant daily reminder that my entire existence is a waste of literally EVERYONE'S time, including my own. 

I don't know how I'll do it. When I'll do it. I don't think it works like that anyway. It's just I know it's coming soon. I have to go. This isn't the right time for me to "Be". Clearly my entire life is a mistake.
