If it's not suicide, what is the solution?Okay so another opportunity was slammed shut. I attempted to enlist in the air force but due primarily to a back injury in the past I couldn't get in. Yay for me.
I wasn't actually all that saddened because I've pretty much come to expect this sort of thing. If I want something that would make me feel like life is worth sticking around for it will collapse. Pretty much destined for absolute mediocrity.
I guess that's fine, but there's gotta be more to life than just...this. If this is all life is why do people even have kids? I'd never have a kid unless I was damn certain he or she would be able to do great things rather than just be a retail worker. 
So I've accepted the fact that I hate what I am. I'm half black and nothing will be able to change the fact that I hate being half black. I'm stuck this way, so if I have to be something I loath why shouldn't i be able to do things that I love to counteract that? If I could be a successful person, someone who actually means something, then it wouldn't be so bad that I'm half black. But as it stands now I am going nowhere fast. At what point can I love just one aspect of being me? 
Suicide seems reasonable for someone who really doesn't get why people feel that simply existing is so important. But I'm told that it isn't a good solution. So what is? What's the solution to this dilemma? I'm really asking here. 
I can't love what I am, so what do I do to love who I am?
