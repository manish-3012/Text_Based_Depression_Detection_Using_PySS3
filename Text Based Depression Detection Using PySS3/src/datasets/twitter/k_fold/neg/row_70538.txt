A Friend Lost His Baby To SIDS So He Committed Suicide. A Few Days Later His Brother Did Too.This family has had it hard for a long time. They have lost three babies total to sids. The first brother stayed strong and was able to even laugh at the reception that I attended. When it happened to the second brother, he was unable to cope and committed suicide a few days ago. I'm not even sure if his body had been identified before finding out that the first brother had committed suicide last night. Instead of being there for him, I was sitting around watching, 'A Long Way Down' on Netflix. I feel so fucking sad and guilty for not reaching out when I knew that he would be suffering. Would that even change anything? I mean, I watched a movie about helping desperate people who needed someone by myself while he was suffering alone and chose to end it. I made it to work only to sit around and cry periodically. I'm trying very hard to stay away from thoughts of self-destruction. I want to visit family after work to be there for everyone and for them to be there for me and make sure the brothers' mom and sister are okay. But with so many people I know losing babies, committing suicide and having a baby on the way myself, I am fucking mortified. I'm confused why so much bad shit is happening around me. Since I was young and beaten daily and told lies by people just to fuck with me, it has been tragedy after tragedy and violent as fuck. I've isolated myself so much lately that friends don't even call anymore because I don't answer. The door is open. I feel like I'm on the edge staring into a black hole and there is no one to talk me down.
