I fucked my exams upI messed up so bad. I fucked up. My gpa is fucked. I am fucked. I can't fucking even. Because of my stupidity. I promised myself I wouldn't mess up again, but I did it again. Here I am, sitting in the bathroom and I'm hurting myself, so that it'll hurt when I take my exams and then I won't make any dumb mistakes anymore. But that won't be enough.

It's fine to fail? Accept your failure? Move on? Do better? It's not okay. I can't.  

I don't know. It hurts but this way I can stop thinking about my failure and how much i want to dig my brain out to stop thinking. I keep laughing and making jokes and I don't feel sadness or anger, just disappointment and the itching need to hurt myself. 

It's very painful. But I'm focusing on the pain and suddenly that's all I can think about, nothing else. It feels liberating, almost.

I want to die. At the same time I don't want to die. My mother will grieve. I have things to live for. I'm still a child and there are things I want to see and do before I go. But I don't know how long I can keep going until the feelings in me throw me off a building.
