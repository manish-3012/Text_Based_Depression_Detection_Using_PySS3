Help me not to kill myselfi dont see anything good in my life. I had 6 different diagnosis, from eating disorder, various anxiety and depression diagnoses and psyhosis. I dont see anything good in life worth of fighting for. The only thing thats stopping me at the moment is my dad, even though he was a shitty father, id kill him with my suicide too. Sometimes i think he deserves it for ruining my life. Meds, doctors, psychotherapy, nothing works anymore.
