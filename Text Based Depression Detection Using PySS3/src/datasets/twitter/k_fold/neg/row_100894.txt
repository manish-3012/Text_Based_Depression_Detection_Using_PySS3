Just lost my job, unable to provide for my family now and I have cancer. Why shouldn't I check out?I can't afford any healthcare and I don't want my girls to watch me slowly die in pain over the next few years.. I am going to die soon enough and my family will suffer either way. We all die and I would rather it be quick then to wither away in pain while our few resources are wasted on me instead of going to my children. I have no access to any assistance where I am nor any family that can help. Why wouldn't my suicide be rational?
