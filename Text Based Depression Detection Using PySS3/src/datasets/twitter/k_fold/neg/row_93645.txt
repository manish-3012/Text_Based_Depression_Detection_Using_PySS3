Sometimes I hate that there are people who love meThere are days I hate the fact that a number of people care about and love me. It makes leaving harder.

I've been hanging out with friends a lot lately just to try and combat the suicidal, as well as homicidal, thoughts and urges I have. It makes me realise that there are people who value me for some reason, but I can't manage to see that value in myself anymore.

Maybe if everyone just abandoned me, which I feel they should, it would make giving into the urges that much easier.

I feel like I'm staying alive for them, and not for myself, because I don't want to live anymore. I feel like a bad, evil, worthless individual who deserves to die. I don't know why they think otherwise...
