Never ending thoughts of suicideIâ€™ve been experiencing suicidal thoughts for years now, but the last year has seen an increase in these thoughts.

For two weeks straight now I havenâ€™t been able to think of anything else, any subject I think of gets in a downwards spiral to suicide. I listen to music to keep the voices in my head silent and Iâ€™m starting to get a buzz in my ear because of constantly playing loud music.

Iâ€™m trying to find something to stop the infinite loop of thoughts because to be honest I canâ€™t cope with it for much longer anymore.
