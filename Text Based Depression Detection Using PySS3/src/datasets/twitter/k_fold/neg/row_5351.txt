My friend commited suicide this week and made me want to do the same.I'll make this short, because I'm so exhausted of thinking tonight, perhaps I'll elaborate tomorrow.

I've been suicidal for two years, made two half-assed attempts with pills and alcohol, and been hospitalised a few times. Before this, I was a happy, quite resourceful and hard working girl. 

A few days ago, a friend of mine ended her life. I wasn't close to her but we are a very big group of friends now mourning and of course the big talking topic is suicide. Huge. Trigger. They are saying extremely offensive things which of course is because they don't understand what it it like to be suicidal.

I was doing quite well before this happened, I've stayed out of hospitals since November. Got a puppy, changed my job. 

and here I am, reading and obsessing over suicide methods and survival stories. I feel trapped, because I can't do this right after our other friend. Which they also remind be of every day.

I feel trapped, extremely alone and very triggered.
