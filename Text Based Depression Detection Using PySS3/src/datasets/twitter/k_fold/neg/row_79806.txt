Please can i have help?This is a new account by the way.

Hi please can i have help? I have been really suicidle lately and tried to kill myself 30 mins ago and the voices have been telling me to for ages.

I have cut my arms and my legs really badly and taken lots of my meds for a suicide attempt and idk what to do. I have been in the shower to try and stop the bleeding but it hurt too much. I cut my arms and legs 30 mins ago and took the meds after the shower 10 mins ago. Iâ€™m shaking really bad and iâ€™m scared badly and the voices in my head wonâ€™t stop and they are being really mean to me and telling me to keep hurting myself and take more meds and jump off a building that is near my house. I have autism, add and Schizophrenia. Iâ€™m 14f and 4ft 11in if that effects me overdosing idk but apparently it does. 
I am really scared but iâ€™m kinda happy idk. Iâ€™m crying alot though. 

The voices have been telling me to do it for days (i took a bunch of concerta and clozapine and prozac i think i took like 80 of my meds in total and yeah. My tummy hurts bad and it feels like really bad cramps but i canâ€™t move alot without my stomach hurting.

I am wearing my hoodie to try and stop my arms and legs (itâ€™s a super large hoodie) from getting blood everywhere. Itâ€™s working i think. 

I am really really sorry for doing it. Iâ€™m sorry i really regret posting this. Shit. Iâ€™m sorry. I really am iâ€™m sorry.
