Hi thereWhats good? ive been having a manic breakdown for 6? days now (came to a front last Wednesday) and have been having a time. Constantly my mind is racing everywhere, i cant stop bouncing.

Im thinking nonlinearly, and getting delusions

Not hallucinations though? Hopefully not. Not me. No sir

Im not really sleeping and ive just been forcing caffeine into myself. I dont want to die, but I dont know how to live more

I want to though, and my s/o has been great at helping me get through this. I wouldnt be alive without them

And then theres me now, typing this. Trying to do anything to get my mind off the thought of death. I'll be around people soon, but they'll be gone in an hour. And then I'll be alone. With my thoughts. And i dont know what to do then, so im opening up and asking you. Should I go see someone? How do I cope with this? Any other advice? Thanks.
