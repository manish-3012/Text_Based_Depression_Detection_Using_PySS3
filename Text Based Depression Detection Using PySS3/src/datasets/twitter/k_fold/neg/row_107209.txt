Feeling like suicide is my only option againI had a really rough summer, but then I went to visit my family and it was great. I saw how much they love me and I thought about how my suicide would devastate them and I thought there's no way I could do that to them.

But here I am again thinking about it. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with my brain. I am separated, heading towards a likely divorce because I was self-centered asshole. I don't have a job and I am not even motivated to look for one because my marriage is devastating me. I'm living off my retirement savings but I know I can't keep this up forever. I own a house which I don't even want any more but the thought of going through the process of packing and getting rid of shit and going through the sale overwhelms me even though it's something other people can do with no problem. Every little fucking thing is such a big deal to me and seems so impossible for me to do. I don't know why but I'm sick of it. I'm tired of waking up every day, which I do in the afternoon because I can't face the fucking day, and I feel anxious and unsure and sad and I cry at everything. Medication isn't helping. I can't handle life, everything seems so much. I'm drowning. I am researching suicide methods again. I can't even tell anyone other than here and I have to go day by day and want to scream. I want to lash out. I've had violent fantasies towards myself or others because spending life in jail even seems better to me right now than what I'm doing. I'm crying as I write this. I'm so fucking sick and tired of this.

When I hear about suicides, like recently poor Amanda Todd (who I cried over when I watched her video) I wonder how they did it and I'm envious that they were able to go through with it.

I can't take this any more. I'm heading towards financial ruin, loneliness (because who the fuck would want to even date me if I don't have a job?) and I hate my life so much.

I even feel guilty posting here because I feel like I'm a burden.
