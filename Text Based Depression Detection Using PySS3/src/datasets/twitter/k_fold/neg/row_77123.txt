Is this normal? Or and I not ok?I have had issues with depression before and the last time someone I knew died, which was my brother, I went down a dark hole of self harm and suicidal ideation and planning out how I was going to end it by overdose. I ended up doing outpatient therapy at a mental hospital. That was almost 3 years ago. I keep going back and forth to remembering my brothers death and the fact that my friend is dead. Iâ€™m at work right now and I am going from crying to being totally numb back and forth. Am I ok? Keep in mind I donâ€™t want to kill myself I just want to hurt myself right now. I donâ€™t think I could go to a hospital right now because of my job and my stepdad who is getting a kidney transplant soon. Thanks in advance.
