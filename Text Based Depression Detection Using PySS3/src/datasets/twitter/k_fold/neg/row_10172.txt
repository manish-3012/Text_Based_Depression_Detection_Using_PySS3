Any advice? Iâ€™m overwhelmed with lifeIâ€™m currently in college right now studying Speech therapy (which I really donâ€™t give a fuck about but doing it bc it â€œmightâ€ lead me to a stable life)and thereâ€™s so much pressure on me to finish college and to successed...esp from my dad (heâ€™s Jamaican, Caribbean parents can be so tough some time) and heâ€™s pressuring me to go to grad school for this shit and Iâ€™m not really motivated to go through with it because IM INTERESTED in the fucking shit. 

Tbh I dint feel like Iâ€™m smart to be in speech therapy, then thereâ€™s the lack of interest....which btw is a â€œGREAT COMBOðŸ™„â€

I mean thrgh out college I changed my major only fucking twice...like give me a fucking break. 

Now I have fucking online classes to do which are stressful as fuck and these asshole professor are throwing so much shit at me. 

Just thinking about all this makes me want to slit my fucking throat. Like I keep thinking about going to the kitchen picking up a knife and just stab myself to death. 

The whole point is I feel like Iâ€™m trapped and I feel like thereâ€™s no hope for me or like I have no future because I donâ€™t k what to do.... I just feel like a fucking failure because Iâ€™m not doing speech therapy.

Plus Iâ€™m also scared about adulthood like getting my own place, a job, insurance, paying bills.... tbh I dint know most of this shit anyways. Just thinking about this makes me want to hang myself. Iâ€™m just not excited to live life anymore....
