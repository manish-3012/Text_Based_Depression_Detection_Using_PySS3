I guess it really doesn't matter.Hi. Thanks for clicking. I feel so numb. On September 21 2014 I was raped. I was at a party high and wasted and someone who I trusted took advantage. I won't go into detail because I know no one really gives a shit. He lied and I was bullied into telling the cops I didn't want any further investigation. I lost most of my "friends" and confidence. People called me horrible names, made jokes, told my boyfriend to leave me, and one chick lied to cover this cowardly piece of shits ass. I tried killing myself a few weeks after the rape. I called the cops because I didn't want my dad to find me. I didn't succeed. He moved. After another failed attempt at hanging myself and spending a few weeks in the hospital I decided to get my shit together. He came back today. My "friend" is with him partying it up. I don't know. I feel too numb to even cry. I want to puke. I might kill myself, I'm not sure yet. It doesn't really matter if I do though. I'll just be another dead teenager and he gets to go on with his life. I have nightmares almost everynight. I don't want to do this anymore. It doesn't matter.
