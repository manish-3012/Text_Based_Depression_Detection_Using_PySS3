Honestly I hope this gets lost. 24(m) feel worthless beyond belief.I feel so horrible in my chest and stomach. My mind is flying at a million miles an hour. I have everything you could want in life (except the one thing I really want). A good job, good friends, I never have to worry about money. But I feel so worthless all the time. Like anyone thats around me is worse off. I'm a 25 year old viegin. I've never had a girlfriend, I've never had a first kiss, I've been used for my money. I feel like if I died it would be the best thing I ever did.
