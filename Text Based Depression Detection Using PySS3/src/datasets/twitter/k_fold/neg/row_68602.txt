Suicidal thoughts..I keep having suicidal thoughts. Some days im â€˜happyâ€™ or lets call it â€˜being normalâ€™ and mostly everyday I just want to kill myself, straight away. My mind is broken, i have no real meaningful purpose, i have the feeling that my life decisions are decided by others,  I pushed all my friends away,  i feel alone even if im around people. I feel stuck. I just want to die. I just want to leave this earth. The only thing keeping me from doing this is my family (my dad, mom and brother). But even then its hard. If I would die tomorrow I would be happy knowing that some people wonâ€™t. Im 26 im living with this feeling already more than 10years and its becoming worse each day. More days, weeks and years past by more depressed I become.
