Whatâ€™s the point of all this shit???No! I mean seriously!! Whatâ€™s the point of life? I never ever asked to be here and if I had choice I damn sure wouldnâ€™t choose life! This is insane! Itâ€™s almost as if happiness doesnâ€™t exist and even if it did idk If itâ€™ll be enough when in reality weâ€™re all gonna die anyway. I just want to die already, I want to feel the feeling of dark empty nothingness. No matter how hard I try to make life worth living it doesnâ€™t work. I have a descent job but because of the state I live in, living expenses are super fucking high, I have an narcissistic boss, and I can barely afford to live. I have 2 kids that I love with all my heart and I wish I didnâ€™t have to feel like this but I canâ€™t do it anymore all they do is drive me up the wall. I have a boyfriend and the relationship is pretty much toxic on both ends but he only sees the toxicity on my end and we basically argue EVERY SINGLE DAY!! From arguments that he initiate And recently Iâ€™ve come to find out that I may be Bipolar and I havenâ€™t told anyone because Iâ€™m scared their just gonna think Iâ€™m crazy or looking for attention or trying to use it as an excuse for past actions. Lately everything has been so fucking overwhelming and most of my life it has been and Iâ€™ve dealt with depression but this time is different this time itâ€™s a completely different feeling this time I feel like I do have the courage to do it and I really want too and Iâ€™m sorry for that
