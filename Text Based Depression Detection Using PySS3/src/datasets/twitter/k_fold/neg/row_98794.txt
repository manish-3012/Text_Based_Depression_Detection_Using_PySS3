Does thisconstitute neglect? What can I do to get help?My mother does not clean up after herself, and leaves rotting food on the counters and in the sink. The environment is very depressing, and she refuses to clean anything. Granted, she is working most of the time, but still leaves dirty dishes and food, dirty laundry, and random things she purchases around the house to where the house, except for my room and my bathroom, look almost hoarder-ish. She has said in response to my complaints that she's rarely home and so does not care what condition she leaves the house in.

I really struggle with depression and anxiety. It was only diagnosed after an attempted suicide by drug overdose, because prior to that, despite my requests to get help or go to therapy, I was denied any kind of mental help by my mother after losing my brother to suicide a few years ago. She literally laughed hysterically when I finally got the courage to ask for help after realizing that I was battling suicidal thoughts every hour of every day and didn't trust myself alone anymore. Still, my suicidal feelings are worsened by my mother's constant, irrational accusations that I'm a liar, a drug addict, and a theif. She also tells me that my life is worthless, that she regrets having children, and that having children ruined her life.

When my previously mentioned drug overdose (one of my mother's old prescription drugs) took place and things went wrong to where I thought I might not die and instead would be left alive with permanent brain damage, I went to my mother crying and very obviously overdosing on drugs, about to ask her if she would take me to the hospital, when she started screaming at me and calling me a drug addict, and, having anxiety and suffering from EXTREME anxiety as a side effect of the drugs, started to deny that I had taken anything because I was afraid she was going to hit me. I went back to my room and waited until she left for work to call my dad and ask him to take me to the emergency room. If I hadn't thrown up the medication sometime during the overdose, I would have died.

I very recently turned 17 and will be starting my Junior year of high school in a couple of days. However, I still feel extremely suicidal most days and have more drugs stockpiled just in case things get too hard for me to bear, so that I'll have some way to get away.

Is there any way I can get relief from my situation without resorting to that? Does it count as neglect, or is there any way I can get help from emergency services? I just feel like I'm a danger to myself, and I can't seem to get any help, even if I really want it.
