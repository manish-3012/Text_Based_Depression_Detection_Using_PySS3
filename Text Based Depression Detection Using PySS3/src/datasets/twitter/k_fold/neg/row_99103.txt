I feel hated.I honestly feel like people would be happy if I died. I'm treated like shit by my parents and they *know* I'm depressed. It always feels like they're working against me and trying to make it worse. They prevent me from doing anything that makes me remotely feel better. Blocking reddit doesn't help me feel any less alone. Not letting me do *anything* with friends ever just makes me feel like an outcast and leaves me lonely and suicidal in the house on weekends. Preventing me from communicating with *anyone* doesn't do anything other than make me lie in bed and punch myself until the pain makes me forget. 

I've been feeling this way for too long and it's time to end the pain soon. The only people I care about are my friends who I'm losing because I can't even fucking *talk* to them outside of school. It's hurting so much to have them slip away from me... I don't love my family but I love my friends. I know I should let them go but it's just so painful. I don't want to find new friends. I love them. It's not that easy when you're depressed and sometimes there's times I just *need* to be alone. 

I've completely lost any motivation to do well in school. I can't take it when my parents yell at me to look at colleges or think about my future. I don't have a future. I'm going to kill myself and not have to deal with this shit. Nobody will care. I know my friends might be sad for a little but honestly I don't mean much to them anymore... it won't make any difference. And I don't care about that. I don't want them to be sad about me dying. When I die, I just want to be remembered for who I am - someone who nobody really liked. I know that I'm a jerk and I don't want my death to change that. 

When I die I'm going to leave this account name in my suicide note to my friends. And when you read this, I just want to say I'm sorry, and thanks for trying to help me. Please don't hate me for this. And thank you for being my friend.
