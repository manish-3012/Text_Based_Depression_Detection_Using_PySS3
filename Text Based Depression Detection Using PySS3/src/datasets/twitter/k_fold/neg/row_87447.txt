I feel helplessSometime soon I feel like wasting all my money on alcohol and jumping off a parking tower. I'm never okay anymore, I'm with a guy who treats me amazing but he has a kid, and everytime I see his kid it reminds me that I will never be able to have one. I'll never be able to be a mom, not only that but Christmas is coming up and I have no family that wants me around. 
    They all hate me and as much as I want to hate them, as much as I want to be happy that they dont talk to me I just cant. I want to be dead, I want to be fucking gone, but I'm terrified of death. I dont believe in a god due to past trauma but if there is one, I know I'm a terrible person, I'm hateful and disgusting and I dont want to face the judgement of that. I also just dont want to be gone, it's scary to think of just not existing anymore no matter how much I do want to die. I cant stand myself anymore though. I dont know what I'm doing, I dont know what to do
