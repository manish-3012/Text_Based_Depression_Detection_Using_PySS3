Am I just stupid or why is it so fucking hard to tie a nooseGonna go with I'm just stupid. I swear I've watched or read every tutorial on the internet and all of them say it's easy but I can't. I bought a 25' long, 1" diameter manila rope because that's more than enough to work. Doing a drop hanging rather than suspension because I want it to be quick, effective, and at least less painful than it could be. I know the height for my weight, know where to do it etc. I thought I had it all worked out. Just assumed tying it would probably be the easy part but I guess not.



I was all set to go the day either before yesterday or yesterday I seriously don't remember. I've been going through patches of staying up for 30+ hours then sleeping for 16+ and I've mostly only been inside in my basement bedroom with no windows so my concept of time is really fucked up right now. I had to check a minute ago if it was 6am or pm.


Anyway I was ready to go. I'm not leaving a note because I just can't write it. I guess people are gonna have to figure it out, I might leave this and another reddit account I have as the closest thing. Was on two illegal drugs and went to tie the rope thinking here we go boys, couldn't fucking get it. It just kept going like a slip knot and any time I pulled the loop it would just expand. Obviously not good.



Tried again the next day which I guess could technically be today - - sober - - still can't get it. I can't remember the last time I tried this hard at anything. Feels like I'm trying to put together the hardest piece of IKEA furniture ever which again is probably because I'm just stupid.



Tried again now and still nothing!! This is literally only like a 4 step process why am I so dumb
