Survived attempted suicideI just got transferred to a hospital room after ER.
I thought I had it all. The world in my hand, a fine job, a future, a gorgeous and intelligent woman.. only for the world to flip you the finger.. It's been yesterday 19th of June when I did it. And I'm still in agony from all the mental pain.

I've lived with my ex together for nearly 2 years, dated her for over 7 years. Until I had to move back to my home country. Upon arrival I get a message from her saying she doesn't want to continue the relationship. We discussed it and she said she just wants to focus on herself. And it seemed like she just wanted space. So I let her go. We talked occasionally and all seemed fine.. until I saw her flirt with someone else. Upon questioning her she admitted to having someone like her and ever since he admitted to her she began to get to know him better... I was at my shift, operating a train. And when I found it all out, I called a coworker, said I didn't feel well, packed my things at the next station and left. The last thing I said was just farewell, deleted all my contacts, wiped my Facebook clean and jumped into an oncoming train.. I'm blind on my left eye, lost two fingers and both my legs and my ribs are broken.
But that's just physical pain. The pain I feel, of a broken heart, hearing her say she likes him too, after I've given her everything she could've wished for..
I'm at the end of my rope and it's uncertainty if I'm going to do it again once I leave the hospital.
I'd rather not feel anything at all than feel the deep, burning pain of betrayal from the only person I thought I could trust..
I don't want to die of course but it's just so tempting.. silence for eternity.. not feeling anything, no emotions, no pain.. I know that people say there are plenty of fish in the sea and so on.. but she was perfect.. I can't believe she stabbed me in the back like that...
