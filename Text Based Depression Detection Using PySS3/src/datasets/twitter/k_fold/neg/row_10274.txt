Suicidal thoughtsWell, Iâ€™m not depressed. I lead a pretty happy life but Iâ€™ve been recently hit with some disturbing suicidal thoughts. I live in a high rise apartment. I spend quite a lot of time in my balcony and some of that time goes in thinking â€˜what if I just jumped.â€™ 

It seems so easy to think about. Life ending right there in 4 seconds. Its truly horrible. Could anyone advise me on what Iâ€™m supposed to do when I have these thoughts? Do i just go back to my room and ignore it? Or should I be doing something else?
