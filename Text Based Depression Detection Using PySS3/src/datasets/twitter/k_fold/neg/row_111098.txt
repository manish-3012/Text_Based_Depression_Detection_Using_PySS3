I'm unsubscribing.I've decided not to do it. I'm nowhere near being OK, but I'll try to be strong. I need to be. My heart is still broken, but I don't want the same for my daughter. I am a mother, and I can't just leave her behind.             

I hope you guys find your peace. If anybody would like to talk, I'm here. We're all hurting but it doesn't mean that it's over. For most people like me, the ones that are alone, please be strong. We don't know what the future holds, so let's keep hoping for the best. â¤
