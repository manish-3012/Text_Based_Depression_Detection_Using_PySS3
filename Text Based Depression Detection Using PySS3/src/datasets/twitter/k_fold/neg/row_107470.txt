Second post this month. I don't know if I have the guts to, but the desire to is still strong.I get into these really dark moods where I hurt myself and push everyone away. Then I get these lucid moments, like now, where it feels like I've regained control of my emotions and actions, but I'm scared and tired; I just want to forget how awful I feel most of the time. Earlier tonight I bought sleeping pills. I could throw them out, but I'll probably just go buy them again the moment my "dark side" takes over. I'm going to be by myself at home tomorrow. I'm worried, but at the same time I don't want to worry anyone else about it since I probably am too much of a coward to do any serious damage. Nothing I do/think makes sense anymore.
