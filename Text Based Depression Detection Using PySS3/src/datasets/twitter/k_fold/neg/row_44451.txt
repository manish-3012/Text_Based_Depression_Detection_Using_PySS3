How to survive funeral?My grandma died yesterday and we have a funeral coming up in a few days. I have this horrible cousin who's going to be there. He treats me and my family like garbage. He is a textbook golden child narcissist. He calls my dad (his uncle) lame when he's been nothing but good to him. He calls me everything in the book, mainly focusing on my appearance. I am truly afraid I will hit him is he says something to me. But I don't want to miss out because of him. I love all my other family. How do you get through something like this? :( Please respond.
