Signs telling me to kill myselfEverywhere I look I see repeating motives, everywhere I read too. See nooses when walking down the street (cords, laces, etc - the way they're lying), keep stumbling on articles about suicide, my interests always coming back to suicide (for example became interested in Marcus Aurelius recently, stumbled on the stoic's approval of suicide, etc). Wanted to kill myself for a long time. Two suicide attempts in past. Every day wake up wanting to kill myself. See no way out...
