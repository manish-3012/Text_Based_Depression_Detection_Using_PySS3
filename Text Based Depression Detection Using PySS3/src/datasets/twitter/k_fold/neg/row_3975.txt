I don't feel like living because my girlfriend left me.We've been dating for 3 years and it came to an end . I deserve it to be honest. 

 5 months into our relationship I didn't get ''sexy time'' over cam so I started talking to a female friend and started flirting. I went on cam and tried to masturbate on cam, she ended the call and I didn't tell my girlfriend anything. I thought that if she didn't know she wouldn't be hurt.

 School ended and she slept over at one of her friends houses. She was then told via text by a bunch of her friend that they didn't want to be her friend anymore. It devastated her. To add to that she found out about me and what I did. She lost a lot of trust in me but after begging for forgiveness she gave me another chance. 

I fucked up a lot in the 2 years after but the one that crossed the line was when I dumped her. She was begging me not to. I wasn't thinking. I decided to try and message the other person again. My (ex) girlfriend said she wanted me back. But the day after I told her what I did she said that was it. I managed to get another chance. But two weeks later she said it hurt to much.  

Now I just feel like standing in front of traffic.

This is my first girlfriend. But I love her more then anything. Maybe I'm just over reacting. Maybe I just need someone to talk to.
