I don't know what to do. I love you, please don't give up.One of the people I care the most for in life is depressed and suicidal and I'm so scared I'm not saying the right things. I'm fighting every fiber of my being to not be around that person, as they clearly want to be left alone, but it's so hard when I'm so sick with worry. My head tells me the right thing to do is let them come around in their own time and not pressure them, but my heart wants me to run to them. God, what am I supposed to do.
