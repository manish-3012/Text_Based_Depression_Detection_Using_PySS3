No goods. not okay. I've been on the bench for a while, waiting to jump off...Yes, not okay. just, not okay. It's been years &amp; I'm just ready to go into the woods &amp; slit my wrists. fuckit. Therapy &amp; antidepressants haven't helped. Before, I was worried about my pets, but now, I know they'll be okay. I'm not. I can go now. need help. Have a lot to offer, but no one wants it._x000D_

Edit: I'm still here, and thank you all. I will be able to talk to friends soon. I swear my animals are keeping me alive. Not alone... (Always Alone) I hate that face.
