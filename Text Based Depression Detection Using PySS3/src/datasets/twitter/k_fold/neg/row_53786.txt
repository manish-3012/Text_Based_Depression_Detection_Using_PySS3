Hey, all you beautiful people. I'm going...see ya!I'm going in a few days. Don't weep for me. I'll go out peacefully. Hopefully something is on the other side. I reached the end of the road. I'm sorry. Maybe something will happen to prevent this, idk. All I know is I'm so fucking tired. Everyone on this sub is stronger than me. You can beat this! I believe in you. Goodbye.
