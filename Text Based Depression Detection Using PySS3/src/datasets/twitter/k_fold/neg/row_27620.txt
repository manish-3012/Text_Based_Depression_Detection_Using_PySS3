I don't want to carry on.My boyfriend of 6 and a half years was hit by a bus a week ago. He died on Saturday. His organs saved 4 people and I'm trying to focus on that positive but I can't.

Life without him seems impossible. I want to die but don't want to hurt my family and friends even more. I feel trapped in a life I don't want and I have no idea where to go from here.
