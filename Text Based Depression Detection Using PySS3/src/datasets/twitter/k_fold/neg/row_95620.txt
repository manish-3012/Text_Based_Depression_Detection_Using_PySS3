I'm done.Perhaps someone will find this post in the coming few days. 

2016 is the year I finally gave up.

Years 7-10 I was passed around a pedophile ring and still have ptsd.

At high school I was bullied and raped and have pstd

2014 I had a son and these sexual abuse experiences led to ptsd. Perhaps brought on by his arrival. I began eating and eating to mask the pains, now I'm a massive fat fucken cunt.

2 weeks ago my partner moved out as we do not get along and argued to much, my son has gone with her.

I now have a scar where the doctors removed glands to test for cancer.

I'm weak, a failure and done. I just want to rest

Sorry everyone
