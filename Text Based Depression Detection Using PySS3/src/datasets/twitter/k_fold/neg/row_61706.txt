I'm planning to die on graduation day if I fail my classesThis was supposed to be my last semester of college. It's looking increasingly unlikely that I'll pass my classes, particularly my senior capstone project. I've vowed that I'll kill myself with the most deadly method available on graduation day (May 5) if I don't make it through the semester. I've started giving away most of my money, I've been trying to think of who would want what of my stuff, I've been cleaning my room so they don't have to look through a bunch of mess to sort out my stuff... 

It's so selfish of me to even think of doing this, let alone make a fairly concrete plan... but my entire life up to this point has been to prepare me for college; I can't imagine what I would do, how I would cope, if I can't make it through school. I've been trying really hard to work on my school for my family and partner, so they don't have to deal with losing me, but I'm sinking deeper and deeper into despair. I don't know what to do...
