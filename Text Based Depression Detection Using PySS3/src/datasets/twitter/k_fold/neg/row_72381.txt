I Am 16 And Have Contemplated Suicide Since I Was 12It started when my mom got into an abusive relationship. She moved us 2,000 miles away from any family and moved in with an abusive man . Growing up I always had a feeling I wouldnâ€™t be here for a long time . Since young Iâ€™ve realized this life isnâ€™t worth living . I am a broken mentally ill little boy . With no one to go to . I fell deeply in love with the girl I thought would be around till the end . She left and started talking to someone I thought was a close friend. Not too long after she told me she wasnâ€™t in love with me thru the whole relationship which was over a year . I was so broken and confused. Just like I was when my mom left me . At 13 and 14 Iâ€™d lay in bed and think about ending it all while I heard my mom and her boyfriend fighting and arguing . I didnâ€™t have  a gun to do it quickly so Iâ€™d lay with the biggest knife , pressed against my throat . Crying , telling myself to do it . That there was no need for me to be here anymore . My mom broke me before anyone else could . Iâ€™d do everything to protect her . And all I got in return was abandonment . She degraded me before any man or woman could . Made me feel worthless . If your own mother couldnâ€™t bother to love you and take care of you , who would ? And now . In the present. These thoughts have manifested into self hate . I am depressed. I am broken. I am angry. Why canâ€™t it be painless ? Why canâ€™t it be quick ? Why canâ€™t I make the final choice ? Iâ€™m not scared . Iâ€™m not scared of whatâ€™s on the other side if anything . Iâ€™m not afraid that everyone will be angry at a shell that once held a severely depressed boy . I am afraid it wonâ€™t hold anything. I am afraid that after it happens no one will bat an eye . No one will cry over my lifeless body . No one will regret hurting me . No one will think of our memories. Thatâ€™s what scares me . That maybe Iâ€™ve been right all along .
