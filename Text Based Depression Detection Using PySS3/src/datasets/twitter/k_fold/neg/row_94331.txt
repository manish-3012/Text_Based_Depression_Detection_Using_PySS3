I don't know what to do anymore.I've been depressed for a long time. I've attempted suicide. I don't really know what to do anymore.

I've wanted to die for a while now, and I've been trying. A couple months ago, I ate a Cliff bar and had an allergic reaction to the peanuts. That gave me an idea. I've tried Reeses, and more recently, another Cliff Bar.

I ate some of it last night, and I had some kind of a reaction..but it didn't kill me. I don't know why. I've tried and tried, but there hasn't been a reaction. 

I just broke down last night. I'm so tired of these failed suicide attempts. I think I'm losing my mind, a bit.

Should I go and get help? I know if I tell anyone about this they'll send me back to Vista(mental health hospital). I'm scared. I don't know what to do.
