I don't know what to do anymoreI don't know what to do. Everything I do is manipulative or guilt tripping and even posting here is a bad thing and I should be punished for that.

Someone said I manipulated and abused them for six years and I have no memory of ever harming them. I tried to never talk about myself, I tried to always help them, I tried so hard to always follow their rules. But it's not good enough and when I tried to leave them again they said I wanted to rape and kill them. What else can't I remember? I'm so scared, I'm so scared. 

I'm going around in circles. I need to die to atone for my sins. If I punish myself enough for this, then I won't be punished. I don't want to be tortured or raped ever again. 

I'm so scared. I don't know what to do.
