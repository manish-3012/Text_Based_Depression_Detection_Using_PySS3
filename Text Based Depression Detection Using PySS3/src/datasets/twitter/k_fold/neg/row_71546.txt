i feel so alone I'm using a throwaway account to be anonymous for several reasons but I won't discuss that. Anyway, I've suffered with multiple mental health issues since I can remember maybe like 8 years old if that's even possible. Throughout my life I've been ignored, isolated, rejected, mocked, bullied, etc. up until maybe seventh grade, but it didn't fully go away, it just subsided. I've been rejected by multiple love interests and that makes me feel unattractive and alone because since *elementary school* everyone around me is always happy with someone and I've always been alone until a while ago. But that's done, and it's making me feel horrible. I miss my person so much, they made me feel everything I never thought I could feel, and they just left. I understand why sort of they have their own problems but idk I just feel like they pushed me away when they really needed someone, and I'm still willing to be here for them. I was already feeling shit lately but the breakup just made things worse. I want them back and I know in my heart this'll hopefully be temporary but idk it just hurts a lot. I feel more alone than ever, broken, depressed, anxious for the future, etc. Idk why I'm choosing to go on, I really don't see myself living past maybe 25. I didn't even see myself live past the age of 13 or 16, idk how I got this far. I'm really considering....
