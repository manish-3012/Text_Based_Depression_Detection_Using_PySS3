I can't do it anymoreI am a habitual liar. I always have been and no matter how much counselling I get, I always will be. I hate who I am because of it. I used to be a drunk and a drug abuser. When I went to college, I made the poorest drunken decision thst I have ever made, I cheated on my girlfriend. And I lied to her about it. She knows now, and shes known for 2 months. She still gets mad about it all of the time and lets me know how shitty of a person I am every time she brings it up. Whenever we dont fight everythings fine. But thats not the only reason shy I am turning to this. I have hurt and lied to almost all of my friends and I cant take being this person anymore. Ive been trying to change and Ive been receiving counselling, and I still feel worthless. Ive lied to my family, and my three best friends on numerous occasions and I cant stand to see anyone upset anymore because of my actions. My parents have told me they dont care if im gone. If i try to talk to my girlfriend about it, she eother just says "K" and trlls me to fuck off, or she tells me only how she feels, knowing that it hurts me.. Ive been dealing with depression since I was 6 years old and I have had a lying habit since I was 5. Im 20. And I cant grow up. So why even bother trying anymore. No one will care if Im gone because it means thst I dont have anyone to hurt anymore.
