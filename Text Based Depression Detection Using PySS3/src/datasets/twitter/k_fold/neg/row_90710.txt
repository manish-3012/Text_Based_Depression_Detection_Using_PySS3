Everything is goodI'm 22. For the first time in my entire existence, I am safe and in a good spot. I have never once had a life like I have now, but I still want to die and that is what is scaring me so bad. Everything is so so good now, I have a loving friends an amazing soul mate, getting along with my family I'm in college I'm getting good grades. But every single moment all I can think about is harming myself and ending it. Im scared because things are good now, and yet I still want to die. I always was able to blame my unfortunate circumstances on the suicidal thoughts but now all of it is over and I still want to die. I dont even know why I'm writing this. I guess its because everyone in my life is so proud of me and they think I'm doing great and they count on me so much. I cant do this anymore. Im so sad.
