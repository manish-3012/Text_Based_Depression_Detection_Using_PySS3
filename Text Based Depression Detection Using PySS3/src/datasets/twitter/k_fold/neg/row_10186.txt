Im just so exhausted and cant deal with myself anymoreIm a student and have to give in my bachelor's thesis on tuesday. So far, its almost finished, but the thing is I never registered it with my student's office, so I wont really can get it marked. I  feel so ashamed of myself that I cant take care of the simplest responsibilities and I cant bring myself over to tell anyone. The last few weeks I just continued as nothing was wrong, I lied to the people around me and myself. Ive already failed the first attempt on my thesis and am so afraid to admit that ive failed another time because of the stupidest reason imaginable. I struggle with depression for some time now and this situation is just making me so suicidal again. I started cutting again and I just dont wanna deal with my stupid self anymore. I dont really wanna tell anyone because noone will understand why I did what I did, I dont really know myself. Im dreading Tuesday because I have to tell people the reason I failed again and Id rather just die before that day. It sounds so stupid when im typing it out but I just cant take it anymore how Im manipulating myself the whole time and cant get anything done in order to advance in life. Im too much a coward to deal with this situation and I just wanna fall asleep and never wake up again
