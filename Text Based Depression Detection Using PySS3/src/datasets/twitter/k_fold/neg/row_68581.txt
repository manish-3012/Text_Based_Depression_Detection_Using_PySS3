still suicidal but..although I spent my night wanted to die or wanting to hurt myself, Iâ€™m showered and on my way to my routine therapy appointment. I still have those lingering thoughts in the back of my head but itâ€™s okay. I canâ€™t believe I actually got ready and hoped in the car. Usually when this happens I cancel everything and lay in bed for 2 days. baby steps....
