What happened. ( continued from last post ).So as you may know, or not, if not who gives a fuck, I recently told my mom about how I was feeling suicidal, and the ongoing list of reasons why. 

I started off writing a letter, as said in last post, explaining that I was feeling suicidal. ( Note that my memory is that of a metaphorical goldfish since goldfishes actually have good memory ) 

Then my mom spoke to me about it. Iâ€™m not going to bore you with the details, but letâ€™s just say I cried a lot. 

Then we went inside, we were previously in the garage, and talked a little more about it, eating my favorite food and just having a good time. 

Also, I didnâ€™t go to school because I wanted to end it this morning, before I talked to mom. 

She also told me how she was and kind of still is suicidal, she does have both depression and ADHD after all. I probably do too. 

Then I talked to my dad. Well, more like my mom talked about it to him. Iâ€™d already taken all that time and tears. 

Thatâ€™s basically what it was for today, but I cried more than I have in forever. Please, please open up to somebody about your feelings of suicide, please. It may feel like the worst thing in the world, but trust me, itâ€™s feels so much fucking better after. Though I still am having thoughts of suicide even after talking out of it, canâ€™t really stop that. 

I was reluctant at first to tell her. Itâ€™s so hard, and I bet most of you know that. But after, it was so fucking worth it. She helped me before I had planned a date, which I was really feeling this morning. 

Please, please get some help. Use these posts as an example of how you can get help. Hell, I was going as far to tell random strangers my problems before telling my mom. Even that helped. If you canâ€™t afford therapy and your family and friends donâ€™t give a fuck about you ( which fuck them, bitches for basically killing people ), know that this is a safe place. Random strangers tend to care more about you then you would think, and I know that. The number of times people have posted right before they killed themselves, is horrendous, and every time I felt like I had lost somebody I knew dearly. If your loved ones donâ€™t give a fuck, random strangers can and will.
