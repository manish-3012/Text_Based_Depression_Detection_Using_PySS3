Iâ€™m at the end of my ropeF17 - Iâ€™m at the point where I just want to wave my white flag. Give up. Nothing in the future feels like itâ€™s worth dealing with this hurt in perpetuity. I have less energy every day, but more responsibilities pile on. I canâ€™t stop thinking about cutting, but I know if I did it or even talked about it, Iâ€™d end up in a psych facility. I canâ€™t eat properly â€” I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s an ED or if itâ€™s just the depression. Iâ€™ve been somehow maintaining weight while eating no more than 1500cal every day for months, with few exceptions. I canâ€™t seem to find joy in anything anymore, or at least when I do it doesnâ€™t last. 

I know how Iâ€™d do it. â€” I have at least 250mg of Adderall I can take all at once. Plus there are knives or bridges or trains. Maybe Iâ€™ll take the pills then do another so thereâ€™s no way I fail. Iâ€™m not sure. Itâ€™s scary, and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m brave enough to do it yet, but Iâ€™m also not sure if Iâ€™m brave enough not to. 

Iâ€™ve called the hotlines enough that I know the scripts by heart. I know what theyâ€™re gonna say. I know how itâ€™s gonna go. I know Iâ€™ll leave with a tiny glimmer of hope that will lead to an even deeper low than before once itâ€™s quelled. I might start drafting a note. It might be time to say goodbye.
