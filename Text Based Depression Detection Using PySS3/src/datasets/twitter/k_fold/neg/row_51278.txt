I shouldn't be here right nowI planned to end my life on this date about a year ago, if I couldn't make my life better. I was supposed to go the forrest and hang myself thus morning. In the end, I decided I couldn't do it. I was too scared, like I always am. Now, I don't know what to do. Enduring more endless suffering, with almost no one to help me. The pathetic thing is, the only one who really listens to me is my online friend who lives halfway across the world. She really is an awesome person, but I really would like some people back here at home. But I struggle to do much due to anxiety. I'm scared of the future. I'm scared I'll just end up alone for the rest of my life. This was my plan, now I don't know what I'm going to do.
