Don't see a point anymore.5 and a half years ago the love of my life took her own life, today I lay in bed and have but two thoughts; That being alone here even on a hot day like today feels like soaking in an ice bath and that I could finally achieve a state of fucking peace if I either kill myself or let the sweet allure of the total complete apathy finally have its way. I  don't wanna fight anymore.
