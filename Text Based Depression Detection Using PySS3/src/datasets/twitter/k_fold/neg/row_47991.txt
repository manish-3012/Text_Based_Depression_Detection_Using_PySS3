I Just Want To Say ThanksI just thought I stop by to say thanks to everyone that was out there for someone like me and also I'd like to let you know that I'm in a much better place. I never would have thought that two months ago would seem like a different lifetime, but that's exactly how it is: I've got a decent job now, I'm living with  two of my friends, and I'm going to be able to keep attending college. Everything's not perfect but compared to how it was its the best thing ever. So I guess I'll end by saying thanks from the bottom of my heart
