Goodnight folks!Well, I have taken 16 ibuprofen and 16 panadol, not sure if it's going to kill me but I suppose it's an experiment of sorts. My extremities are already going numb, so I suppose it's working! I must seem like the happiest suicidal person here. The truth is, I have had this problem for such a long time I think it's time to finally do something about it. And I'm just glad that this world of suffering can finally go screw itself.
