This is goodbyeMy name is Ben, I am 21 years of age and from the UK. It is currently 03:21 am and I am here to say goodbye to the only place I have felt that I somewhat fit in.

I have a way to go, and I won't mess it up this time.

The thing about me that I find hard to admit to others is something that I think anyone would find hard to admit.

I am an ephebophile. I don't like it, but I can't change it. I am sorry to everyone I ever hurt, and anyone I will by doing this.

I keep making mistakes and one of these days they're going to catch up to me.

I don't want anyone to try and talk me out of it, or to try and convince me theres things worth living for, because for me there isn't.

I don't want to die but I don't want to live either.
