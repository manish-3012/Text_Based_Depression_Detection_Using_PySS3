Whats the point?I want get a job to save up for the ring and house I want to get with my long term girlfriend and sell my electric guitar to get a piano keyboard and baby Taylor to learn how to play her favorite songs by mayday parade. Then a few minutes later I think what's the point in wasting the time? I think of how her and my dogs will be if I was gone. How they would be able to deal with it? Why work and waste the money on stuff that won't have the same value when I'm gone. I play Xbox all the time to stop thinking and blast music when I'm playing. I planned on making a pc and being a streamer /YouTuber for my favorite games and a photographer. I already have a nice camera but I don't have a good lense so I never use it.
I feel like I'm annoying the people reading this and it's poorly written but im going to post it and most likely delete it.
