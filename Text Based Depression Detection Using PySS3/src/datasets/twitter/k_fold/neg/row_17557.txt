Is there ever really a right time?I have always found one reason to stay. Lately, I havenâ€™t found any. My self harm has increased. My meds arenâ€™t helping. My panic attacks are becoming so frequent. I hate my job. I have no friends. I know I am a disappointment to my family. So like, why not? I canâ€™t seem to focus on anything positive. I am trying so hard to not hate my life and crash my car every time I drive to/from work. I just canâ€™t seem to cope anymore. I am literally burning myself with a lighter in the bathroom at this point when I  get too stressed or anxious at work. I know this post is a mess, but so am I. So.
