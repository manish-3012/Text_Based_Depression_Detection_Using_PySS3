deathplease oh god let it all be over. strike me dead and let me forever be with the friends you never gave me and let me finally be happy and at peace. this world you have made for me may be fine for most other people but i feel like maybe you made some sort of error bringing me to life. i know you cant make mistakes, but somehow you must have made one with me, when you pulled my spirit from the ether and gave it a body. all i want is to go back to that place. so please god, end my tortured existence and let me be at peace.
