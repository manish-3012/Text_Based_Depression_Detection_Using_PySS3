Iâ€™m thinking of ending it allIâ€™m so tired of living this life. I just want the suffering to end. I feel like Iâ€™m running out of options. 
I suffer from extreme depression (which I used to smoke weed to help ease the pain until I had a manic episode in March so now Iâ€™m diagnosed bipolar). I have a mysterious IBS/gut issue (tried everything to resolve it) and chronic fatigue which is also mysterious and seemingly untreatable. Iâ€™m basically stuck in bed all day every day. 

I live with a narcissistic parent and life at home is really unstable/toxic. 

Iâ€™m at my wits end, I donâ€™t know what to do, I feel like Iâ€™m just wasting away, my life just doesnâ€™t feel worth living anymore. I miss smoking weed and laughing and enjoying the little things. Things feel completely hopeless now. Iâ€™m thinking of just ending things because I have like nothing to live for. :( 

the thing thatâ€™s stopping me is fear of Hell or some sort of worse suffering in the afterlife/ nothingness after death.
