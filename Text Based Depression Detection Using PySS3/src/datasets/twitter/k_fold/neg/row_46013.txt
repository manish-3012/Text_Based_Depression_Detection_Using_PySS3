I don't enjoy life.Never did. I simply see no point in going out with people. They all bore me. And the social activities (shopping, eating outside, having a walk, going to a bar a club, into the city, travel) bore the hell out of me. I simply see no point in it. It feels all like a waste of time. I have to force myself to go anywhere with someone. Everything seems like a load, also college.
I suck at college, bc I feel not motivated to learn. I hate it. It bores me too much. 
I am so depressed, I can barely push myself to do anything.
And the people are so fucking boring, I see no point in hanging out with them.
Something wrong with me that I cannot even enjoy traveling? Traveled with my boyfriend once to another place. God was that boring, just looking around, going to cafe's. I see no meaning in just staring at things, or eating. 
Anyways, there is no other solution than suicide for me. If u don't enjoy life then what's the point?
And alone I don't want to live either.
