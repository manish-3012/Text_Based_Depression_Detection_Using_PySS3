Yeah I'm fucking doneSo I'm fucking done. My family fucking hates me, I fucked up my semester and I probably won't graduate on time. Jesus Christ what is wrong with me. It's never really going to get better is it? I definitely peaked already. 

Well I'm on vacation now. When I get home I'm going to tie a belt around my neck and choke myself out on the treadmill in my basement. Everyone will be bummed out for maybe a year but they'll get over it. I'm doing more damage alive than I ever will dead.
