18 years old, and I really don't want to live the rest of my life in sadness.I hate my family.
I have very few friends, and the reason for it is that everyone I meet is an asshole.
Just got out of a year and a half long relationship a couple months ago and I am alone.
I will never find love, because I have set such high standards, and the only people who meet them end up hating me.
I hate the person I am becoming. I feel so uninteresting. 
It's like... in life, everyone fears death and searches so long and hard for the path to eternal happiness. No one has found it yet. I feel like every time I am happy, soon after this happiness is completely shattered and leaves me feeling like I have nowhere to go, like now. 
I am sick and tired of playing mind-games with myself like this. I'll never be truly happy, so why should I deal with this anymore?
