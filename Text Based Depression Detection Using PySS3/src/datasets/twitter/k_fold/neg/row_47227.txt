I'm never gonna have a good future, and I've accepted itI was harshly bullied at secondary school. Mostly verbally, but sometimes physically attacked. Was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 12, someone found out and took advantage of it by telling pretty much the whole year group about it. I was laughed at, called weak, told I should just kill myself, told I was worth nothing. I refused to go back, and would do anything, whether it'd be pretending to be ill, or just arguing with my mum, I'd do anything to not go back. I'm now 16. I've not been in school for 3 years. None of the local schools want me there, or just cannot accept me because they're 'full'. My dad doesn't talk to me, and my mum says I'm the reason I ruined the family. I nearly commit suicide 2 months ago, after my mother told me to jump out of a window and bleed to death, but I didn't want to take the pain. What happened if I would survive from it? I don't want that. I want an instant death.

My dad is embarrassed that I'm his child, as is my mum. My brother wants me dead, and he said he would vandalize my grave. My sister has given up trying to care for me. I have no GCSEs, no job, no future. I'm ruined. What's the point of living when you have no job? Or will never even be able to get one? I'm going to be homeless in 2 years time, living on the streets, and I'm scared. I want to leave, I'd do ANYTHING to just fucking leave this god awful planet. I'd be set free.
