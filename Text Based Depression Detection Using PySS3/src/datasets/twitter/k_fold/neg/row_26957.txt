I lost my bestfriendI lost my bestfriend 1 hour after talking to him. Itâ€™s 5 years later, his family and I are still a wreck after his passing.

Please know, you matter. You are someoneâ€™s light, you are going to be someoneâ€™s light. You are someoneâ€™s reason to live, you will be someoneâ€™s reason to live. Life is scary, nerving and tough. 
Your parents, brother, sister, step parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents or best friends want you to talk to them. 

Iâ€™ve seen so many posts about wanting death, wanting it all to be over. You are worth more than that. You deserve more, you can make it.
