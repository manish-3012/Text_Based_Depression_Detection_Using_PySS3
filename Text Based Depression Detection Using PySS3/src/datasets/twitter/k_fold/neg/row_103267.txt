This pandemic has been my biggest fear for a long timeNot specifically a pandemic necessarily, just a global calamity of any sort.  The rich are obviously letting it happen to thin the herd and it makes me sick and resentful to even be alive.  I truly feel like certain people in my life want me to die from it too, almost like they've been telling me for years that this was going to kill me and I'm just vermin to them. So be it.
