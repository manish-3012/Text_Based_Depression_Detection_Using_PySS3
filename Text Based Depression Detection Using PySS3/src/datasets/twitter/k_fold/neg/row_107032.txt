I fucked up and now I just want to die.Can someone just please talk to me? I'm crying and I have so much to look forward to, I think, but nothing *now*. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I've fucked up my life and everyone knows it and there's no way to turn back time or anything and unfuck up my life so I'm trapped with it as it is. Can I just have someone to talk to for a few hours to keep me company?
