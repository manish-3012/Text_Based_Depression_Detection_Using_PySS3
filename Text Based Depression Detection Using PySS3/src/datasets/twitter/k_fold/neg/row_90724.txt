Wanted to kill myself yesterdayI've been planning a meeting with my parents about how bad my depression has gotten and that hiding myself away from people is impacting me heavily. Did something like this last year but it backfired. 

Mom got an email from my therapist about the meeting and instantly confronted me about it. She said if I was going to be blindsiding her like last time that my father would hate me. She stated that behind my back, he doesn't believe in any "of that stuff" even though he's been supporting me more than she ever has. 

Her reasoning for not accepting me is because I "used to be a bubbly, happy kid in 9th grade and now a moping 12th". I went to my bedroom sobbing. I cancelled the meeting, it's not worth it. I though about ending it then and there knowing that no matter what I do I can never get her to see that I hate myself. That I can't wake up in the morning without hating who I am and how people know me. 

I've timed how long it takes for my parents to check in on me. 2 hours. I had enough pills to end it, I keep thinking about it, I wanted to, it would have been so easy and they probably wouldn't even noticed I was gone. A part of me knows they love me as their child but is it worth it to continue living like this? I can't wait I can't keep living this gross double life anymore and I don't know what to do anymore
I am lost
