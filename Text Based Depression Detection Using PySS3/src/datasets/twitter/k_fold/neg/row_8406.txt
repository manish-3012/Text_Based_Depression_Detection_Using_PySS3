I wish I was goneI keep thinking about swallowing a bottle of painkillers and hoping that does the job.

Ever since I was 14, Iâ€™ve had major depression. It comes in waves, and it usually starts with numbness, then an urge to self harm, then isolation and regret, and then pleadng for attention before a small stretch of normalcy. Itâ€™s an awful cycle and itâ€™s extremely painful. I go to therapy for free because of my school, but I donâ€™t go enough for it to help. Iâ€™m always in a worse state than I was the last visit. Iâ€™ve never actually self harmed until last week, and now itâ€™s become one of the only things that plagues my mind.

I feel fucking awful, because I want support from my friends, but they all deal with depression just like I do, and have worse situations than I do. I want to ask for support from my boyfriend, but he wants to be alone after he fucked up one of his friendships and he feels guilty about it. I want him to hug me, or kiss me, or do anything to show that he cares... but I canâ€™t bring myself to place my own needs over his. Heâ€™s in the other room drinking his sorrows away as we speak. 

I made a blog to vent out everything for myself that my friends can read if they like, but with how often I post that Iâ€™m sad and I want to die I just feel guilty. I feel like everyone is just thinking â€œgod, will she stop begging for attentionâ€ or â€œwhen is she just going to kill herself alreadyâ€- and I feel guilty when my friends do kind things for me but itâ€™s not enough to make me feel okay. They try so hard. They make as much effort as they can to make me feel wanted and I just hate myself so much. I just feel so lonely. I feel so empty. I feel so disgusting, and obnoxious and needy and annoying and I just want it all to end.
