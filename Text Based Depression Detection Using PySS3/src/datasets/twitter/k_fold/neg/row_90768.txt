Anyone else attempt a long time ago and still not had their "i'm happy i failed" moment?I hear these stories every time i get desperate and start googling for chat lines or suicide centers; the constant supposed-to-be-inspiring story of "I survived a suicide attempt and am thankful cos now im around to get married and have children!" or something else along those lines. Not a day goes since i wish that the first night i tried to kill myself almost 2 years ago i had been successful. I'm in an even worse place now than i was then.

If they quoted people like me for those anti suicide posters it'd sound more like "oo boy, i sure am glad to be alive and hating every second of life i'm even lonelier than before and am in so much pain and I vomited this morning because that's just how stressed i am! Thank god I didn't take a high enough dose of pills those years ago! I sure am lucky to have survived :)"
