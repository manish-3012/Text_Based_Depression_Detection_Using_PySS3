I had physical human reaction for the first time the other day, and I know it's wrong that I felt pleasure from it. (Not sexual)It's hard to explain, but I haven't had any physical human interactions, and the other night my friend picked me up and took me to a haunted house with him and his gf. I almost didn't want to go because I hate 3rd wheeling and always feel like shit, but when we got to the haunted house, there was this girl who was probably around my age portraying this starved clown that ate human flesh, and she was in a fenced off area and she grabbed my arm and pulled me to the fence, and for whatever reason I just felt happiness. I liked the interaction. I did not like it in a sexual way or anything like that. It was just really the first time anyone has touched me in a very long time. It made me happy for a few minutes before I lost myself again.
