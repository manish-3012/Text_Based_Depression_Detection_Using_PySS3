Tonight I Held a Gun To My HeadI have one of those jobs where nothing can be traced back to me, and one where talking to someone would just as easily end it. I was abused as a child, I drink to suppress the pain of being abused as a child. I smile and hold friendly conversations with my peers, but really at the end of the day, I think day in and day put about ending my life. Tonight I held a loaded gun to my head to see how it felt, with the cold steel against my head. 

I'm honestly not even sure why I'm here, I want to seek help but I can't without it impacting what I do. I don't want to end what little fragile life I have, but I don't know how much longer I can deal with the pain and suffering.
