I want to be done with this worldIâ€™m clearly having a rough time, Iâ€™ve dealt with my issues for 10 years and always managed to come around but this time feels hopeless. 

Iâ€™ve had 3 close individuals die by suicide since the start of 2018, and many others are in the midst of dying due to medical issues. I am everybodyâ€™s rock when these things happen, they come to me in their time of sadness and need and I feel like I have failed everybody. 

I am empty and cold and my house seems as if a tornado has blown through, I havenâ€™t brushed my hair in a week and I can see the worry in my partners eyes that Make me know he knows I am not well. 

I canâ€™t leave my house, every time I drive I see ways that I could just let go of my life and end the suffering. 

Long story short, I need some advice. I have access to all the therapy and everything I know people will say, but I want basic stuff, how can I find a reason and the motivation to shower again, do some self care, clean my house, how do I start living again? 

I want to leave this life, I donâ€™t know why I should stay anymore
