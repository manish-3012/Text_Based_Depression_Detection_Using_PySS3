depressionif i am so useless and worthless and im just a burden to everybody then why am i still here.


well the answer is because im too scared to do it. dyk that people used to kill themselves with gas leaks a few decades ago. but they changed it to natural gas and it has a smell now, and is much less lethal than it used to be. suicide rates lowered significantly after they made the change because it was much more difficult and scary to kill yourself.

it just means that a lot of people think about suicide. but they dont go through with it because there isn't an easily accessible way. sure, people can hang themselves or od on pills or shoot their head off. but its hard to get a gun, a lot of the time pills are unreliable and lead to a painful death, and hanging yourself isnt really easy to do since you dont die immediately and failure can result in permanent brain damage. its not like sitting down and smelling odorless gas until you cant breath very well and then die.

they told me to stop self harming by putting it off for 10 minutes. then after those 10 minutes i should put it off for another 10 minutes. and eventually the urge will go away.

but the urge always comes back, whether its for self harm or suicide, whenever i am reminded of my failures and inability to do anything properly. im a failure to human society, born by a mentally ill mother and pressured to be something useful. its nice to know that people care but i just dont know if i can get better. and if i do get to that respite, i know i can get back to where i am now again very easily and honestly, wouldnt the world be better without my genes in the pool.
