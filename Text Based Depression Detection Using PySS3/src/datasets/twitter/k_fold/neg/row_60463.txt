How to cut yourselfDISCLAIMER:Iâ€™m not condoning cutting of anytime, seek help

So if you are a cutter (like me) hereâ€™s some tips on how to do it safely and without a lot of pain

Take some pain killers

Numb the area with ice for2 to 3 mins depending on the size and debt of the cut

Use a clean blade, clean it with alcohol and a cotton ball

Use something sharp, the sharper it is the painless it is

Quick short swipes

Again please donâ€™t do it, Iâ€™m telling this for the people who already do it
