Could you please help me?I'm having a hard time now.I know everyone has a hard time in their lives but I had many hard time in my life. I'm 17-year-old girl.My first thought of suiciding was at the age of 10.  Second time is at 12, then 14,15,16.My parents always snap at meï¼Œeven when I didn't do anything wrong. I don't have many friends.  I used to confide pain to my best friends whom I thought are my best friends.  But they ignored and left me.  I was sad that no one understands and comforts me. As a result, I don't tell my pain to other people any more. I didn't have a boyfriend or girlfriend cuz I'm afraid that the one I love will leave me. I have had a crush on a boy. He is good at me. Unfortunately,he has gone to America and I haven't seen him for 3 years. I also have had a crush on a girl.She is the best girl I have ever met.However,she already has a girlfriend.So what I want to say is that NO ONE LOVES ME IN THE WOULD. After entering high school, my classmates isolated me because I was an introverted and quiet person. I always feel lonely. A few days ago, someone said he likes me so we talked a lot,which made me happy.What surprised and hurt me was that he also left me without saying goodbye, for no reason. It seemed that people in the world cheated on me, hated me,hurt me.Now I just feel that they are killing me.I have no mental illness(Although I hope I have). I AM JUST AN NORMAL PERSON ALWAYS TRAMPLED BY OTHERS
