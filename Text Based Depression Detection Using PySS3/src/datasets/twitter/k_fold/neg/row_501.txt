I need to talk to someone right now.I drove for 3 hours with no destination in mind because I was trying to clear my mind from suicidal thoughts. Prior that I sobbed for an hour in front of a church and I feel like I couldn't take it anymore. I even thought of crashing the car intentionally. I am not at my best state at the moment and everyone I know is busy.
