Tonight is the nightI'm drunk, kolonopin too many already. My gay bestie of 14 years told me I'm going to hell for being attracted to girls. My male fiance is mad that I'm drunk although he bought me wine. I hate every aspect of my fucking life and I'm fucking so done. I have a fresh script and it's time. I kissed my son and did the best I could to set him up for after my death. I'm sick of hating being alive. I'm sick of being miserable 95% of the time. I'm sick of being an impatient mother. I'm sick of not being a good enough employee. I'm sick of climbing  to get pushed down every time, I'm fucking done. I'm sick of being done. Thanks for my hopeless rant readings, this is the last, I wish you happiness I could never feel.
