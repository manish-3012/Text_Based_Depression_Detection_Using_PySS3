The idea of killing myself fills me with excitement. It's the only chance I have to make this pain go away...Don't fucking tell me this is temporary, I've been waiting all my life for it to get better and it hasn't, it only gets worse.  I'm now 32 and everyone who I ever loved is dead, one of them very recently.  My sister is gone, my parents are gone, and anyone else that's around only wants to talk to me to borrow money from me.  I'm all alone and miserable, my brain isn't functioning correctly anymore, it hasn't for a long while, I think it's all the fucking stress.  I'm still being abused at work for being a fucking loser.  I'm beginning to stutter, can barely finish a complete sentence for some reason.  Life has taken everything good out of my life, even the fucking crumbs.  All I asked for was some normalcy.  To be around people I love and live a decent fucking life.  Everyone around me has this, why can't I???? I've never had a relationship with a girl.  Not only that, they fucking refuse to be near me.. I don't get it, do I look like a rapist or something?? I feel suffocated by everything that's going wrong in my life, it's fucking enough.  People are cheating and lying and fucking others over and getting away with it with applause and I'm getting shit on over and over while I mind my own business.  If there's a god, I want to meet him just to crush his fucking face for doing this to me.
