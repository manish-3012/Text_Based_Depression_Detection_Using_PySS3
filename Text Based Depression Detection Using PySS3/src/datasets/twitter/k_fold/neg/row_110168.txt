Just need a break from lifeI'm taking a summer class and today was the midterm. The midterm is about 120 questions, 2 and half hours and open note. It's all on actual laws so the fact that it's open note doesn't make it easier. 

Anyway I was talking to my friend and my mom comes in angry that I'm talking instead of studying. I told her that I was just talking about some things before taking the exam. She went off on me for trying to cheat. If you've seen my other post, I've been off of antidepressants for a week and just taking klonopin for anxiety. I get triggered really easily. I took a pill but I just ended up crying in the middle of the exam. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for the past 3 months. I have about 21 pills of klonopin and I highly doubt it's enough to kill me. I promised my friend I wouldn't do anything stupid but it's just so hard keeping my head level right now. I'm just going to go take a walk outside, nowhere in particular. Maybe just go sit at a bench at my school.
