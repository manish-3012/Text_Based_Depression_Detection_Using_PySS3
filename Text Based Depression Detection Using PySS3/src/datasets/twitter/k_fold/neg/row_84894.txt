A Note.Hey there everyone. You donâ€™t know me, but you can call me V. I think I want to die soon, but since I dont have anyone in real life that truly cares about me anymore, nobody would read my suicide note, so Iâ€™m here writing it to you guys on reddit. Iâ€™d first like to say that Iâ€™m sorry. Although I donâ€™t matter, nobody here wants to see that somebody is suffering or dying. I know its selfish, and I wish I could offer more than an apology, but an apology is all I have right now. Iâ€™m not gonna sit here and blame society or anything like that for my sadness and problems, itâ€™s nobodyâ€™s fault, just simply bad luck. It was bad luck that my parents didnâ€™t love me so I was doomed from the start. Bad luck that I was the only colored kid in a racist school system from a young age and was doomed from the start. All of this just set off a chain reaction that would eventually lead to the mess that I am right now. This is probably where I should thank people that did make my life a little bit better, but at this point I really donâ€™t have many of those either. Still, I want to thank whoever is reading this. Although it isnâ€™t much, although youâ€™ll probably forget about this tommorow, for a moment you took the time out of your day to read what I wrote. Even if it was just for a couple of seconds, even if it was just a tiny bit, for a moment somebody is thinking about me. For another moment I exist to you, and that is a note I am happy to go out on. Iâ€™ll probably chicken out like I usually do again tonight, but I still thank you for reading this, and if I truly do build up the courage to do what needs to be done, then goodbye to everyone here, I hope things donâ€™t end for you the way they end for me.
