I'm so very, very tired.I've been told to keep fighting.

Part of me thinks, I've spent a good half of my life pushing a boulder uphill, and now I'm tired. There isn't very much fight left at all.
But I've been told to just try a little harder. Wondrous things have a chance of existing a small ways higher up the hill. Amazing, fantastic experiences lie just ahead, they say. Even though that's what they told me the last time the boulder slipped, I haven't seen the wondors they speak of.

In truth, I am trapped in this human skin. intellectually, I know what is expected of me, appropriate responses, smiles, reactions. But on a base, instinctual level, I am lost. I don't understand how to do any of this. Friendship. Relationships. Planning ahead. Responsibilities. Being satisfied. Being happy.

If I asked you to describe how a particular image looked to your elbow, you would have no way of responding because your elbow not only lacks the functionality to see, but could not even attempt to approximate an answer as it never has known sight. Sight is foreign. Sight is both an abstract and conceptual term, to your elbow.
This life is the same. It is foreign. As if I was born missing some vital data chip. As if I was only reincarnated 75% completely before the connection was lost.

And I'm getting so very, very tired.
