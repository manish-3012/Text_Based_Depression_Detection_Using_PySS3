hey guysI dont know when it started I just want it to end. I dont know what i feel, it feels like im living just to be alive. I can't remember last time i went to sleep not feeling like complete shit, same goes with waking up and it follows me around the day. Future seems so distant it's hard to grasp, i just want to end my life now. The only reason im alive and havent killed myself already is cause i know how much pain i would inflict upon my parents. Im afraid sometime soon im not gonna last through another night..
