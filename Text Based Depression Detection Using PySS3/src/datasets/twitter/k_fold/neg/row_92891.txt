My friends are celebrating their graduation todayI was supposed to graduate with them, but I got held up. With the way lifeâ€™s going right now, getting left behind feels like the straw that broke the camels back. I feel trapped, in a place I donâ€™t want to be, surrounded by people I canâ€™t stand, with no end in sight... I just feel so helpless right now and I canâ€™t even vent to anyone cause my shrink died 3 months ago and Iâ€™ve been stuck on a waiting list since
