Why would it be wrong to kill myself?I don't really get it. I mean I could be run over by a drunk driver, fall on a ditch, be murdered by my neighbor, get cancer. Anything could happen and I would just die, there'd be no warning; my family would still suffer and I'd still be gone. 
Why then would it be wrong if I've made the decision that I don't want to live anymore, if I'm just so tired of being here, shouldn't I have the right to decide when to leave? If the world can just throw me into a freak accident, why can't I just shoot myself in the head?
If I don't want to be surrounded by cruelty, if I've lived what I wanted to live and have no interest in anything else? 
It doesn't seem fair. I could say goodbye to everyone, get some closure and then just end it. 
Why is that bad?
