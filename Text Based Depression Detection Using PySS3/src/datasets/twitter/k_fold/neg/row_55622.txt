Feeling an overwhelming compulsion to kill myself, need a distraction.Donâ€™t ask why, Iâ€™m just like this. As of lately I find my mental health is either 0 or 100 with no inbetween. Iâ€™m either perfectly, totally, 100% fine or Iâ€™m suicidal. And 90% of the days Iâ€™m fine so I donâ€™t really fully handle this.


I just get these thoughts in my head telling me to kill myself sometimes. Not just thoughts. Memories. About how I was worthless and better off dead. Attitudes. My Mom has always implied people like me donâ€™t fit into society and itâ€™s hard not to think with that sort of slant.


And it gives me this overwhelming, all-encompassing compulsion to kill myself.


I know itâ€™s not rational but it FEELS rational! It just seems like what I should do!


The thoughts are just so convincing, as though Iâ€™m a very horrible person and something bad will happen if I donâ€™t end my life soon.


I canâ€™t think rationally or positively with it. When I do the bad memories come back of my Mom telling me Iâ€™m a failure, Iâ€™m worthless, that Iâ€™ve manipulated everyone who loves me and that they have wool pulled over their eyes.


I feel like the idea that Iâ€™m a terrible person and that I should end my life IS reality and that by not doing it Iâ€™m in denial and putting everyone around me through further torture.


I even get this sinking horrible feeling in my chest every time I try and pull myself away from this line of thinking.


Anyways. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll be fine. Again. Tomorrow. Totally fine, laughing and cringing at everything Iâ€™m typing right now.


But for now, Iâ€™m searching my room for cords that could effectively strangle me so could I get a distraction maybe please?


I know beggars canâ€™t be choosers but itâ€™s going to have to be a digital distraction I could access from this phone. Hobby-type stuff makes me feel lazy and worthless and only makes the thoughts worse.
