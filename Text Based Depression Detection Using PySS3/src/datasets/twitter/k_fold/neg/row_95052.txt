I've had chronic depression for 8 years. I feel like the very hurtful things that I've experienced have started to pile up only since a couple months. The next person to hurt me is probably going to make me lose it.I used to get by everyday just being cowardly enough to never attempt suicide for real. I lived through pretty rough things, rape, physical violence, bullying, manipulation, alcoholism. It used to hurt for some days, then fade, and occasionally come back. Now, it just never fades. The weight of everything's crushing me, I can't eat, sleep, have sex (which is usually pretty important in my life), and the people I thought I could call my friends have turned their back on me. I don't want to make my family and my best friend sad, but right now, nothing could alleviate the overbearing anguish, loneliness and sadness I'm feeling. Everyday, it seems less and less scary, less painful that I thought death would be. I almost died by leaping into traffic, and I felt so relieved by the idea. I can't resist it, but I'll try to not guilt an innocent person over it this time....
