mind numbing bullshit (rant)i'm starting to think i might be addicted to being numb. not physically, though. i can still very much feel *everything.* trust me on that. i like the sensation of taking just enough *[im not going to tell you what ive taken, because i don't want you to do the same]* to leave me right on the edge of consciousness for awhile. just... really let the hallucinations seep in and stay with me until its time for my next "dosage". the gentle ache of my already risky heart pounding at my chest is irritating, though.

this is how i tried to commit the last time, but alas, my body burns through medication like a match in hay. now its just become a temporary "out". im fine at the moment. don't pity me, please. it makes me feel pathetic. i just wanted to ramble while my brain is electrified. i'll probably delete this in the morning, unless it gets removed by the mods, which is also perfectly fine. my vision is getting a little hazy, and the physical hallucinations are starting up, so i guess i'll end this here.

...
well, at least im not so alone anymore.
