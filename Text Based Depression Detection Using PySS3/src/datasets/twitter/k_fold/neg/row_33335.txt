I can't stop crying, almost 8 hours straight.I am so close to taking all my insulin and just going to sit in my favorite spot. I lost the only person who was in my life that cares about me. I can't console in anyone, and I don't have a single person that I can just hug. I'm all alone and my life is worth nothing anymore. Nobody is going to miss me. Nobody even knows me. I wish I had never been born to be all alone and in pain my whole life.
