How to save my friend and her baby's life.I have a friend who I have known for about 16 years. I really care about her a lot and I really care about her 3 year old daughter. 
My friend has been going insane for the past two years, caused by I do not know what. She literally believes that the government has installed microchips in her body that stimulate her brain and her ovaries and that by night they remotely rape her while during the day they tell her to kill herself with her daughter. 

I don't think I have to explain any further the direness of this situation. 

What is the best, most effective way I can go about calling the authorities to have her placed in a mental hospital so that she can get the help she needs while her daughter stays with the father or grandparents?

I love this woman so much and I do not want anything to happen to her, but for goodness sake she  is potentially a threat to her daughter and herself, not to mention she is so depressed, lonely, and terrified constantly and she needs serious help to bring her back to normalcy. I've always admired her, but it has literally only started happening in the last couple of years that she has been this way. She is 29.

I mean she actually tried to hang herself with an extension cord a month ago.
