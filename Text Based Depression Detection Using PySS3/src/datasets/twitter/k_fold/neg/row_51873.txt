byeWhat's the point anymore. Can't do it anymore. Can't live anymore. Too many things have been broken. Too much of my life has been ruined. Never will I get better. I keep getting hurt by the same people. What have I ever done wrong to deserve this? Why can't I ever lose weight? Why is humanity so cruel? Why does depression exist, or autism? Why does everyone leave me???? 

It's all pointless. Fuck this mental hospital. I'm too soft for this world... I'm sorry. dont pm
