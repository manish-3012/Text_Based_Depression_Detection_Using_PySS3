Why is life just shit? Sure it has its ups and downs but in general it's a pile of hot steaming garbage.

I could go on a big rant about how shitty my life is until I realize that my life isn't shittier than the average person's life.

Is jumping from a cliff effective or nah? I considered jumping while I was at a very steep cliff but I didn't since I was unsure if I'd die or turn into a vegetable.
