No reason to be hereIâ€™ve known a few friends from highschool who commit suicide, and I recently â€œdatedâ€ a guy (quotations because I didnâ€™t even like him, I just settled for someone so I wouldnâ€™t be alone) whoâ€™s 15 year old sister commit suicide as well. Iâ€™m beginning to think itâ€™s the way I should leave as well. 

My life is so empty. Iâ€™m â€œonlyâ€ 21 but my future is bleak. Iâ€™m too depressed to ever leave my room, let alone my house. I just barely have enough energy to take care of my hygiene and grocery shop. 

Iâ€™m unemployed, making absolutely no money living with my grandparents. I dropped out of college after they went on strike for 2 months and basically screwed every student over (I decided I didnâ€™t wanna be in that course anyways.), and now the government loans Centre is harassing me calling me every day for me to repay them. They donâ€™t give a ratâ€™s ass that Iâ€™m unemployed. I owe thousands of dollars for absolutely nothing and it makes me beyond depressed. 

On top of that, my family life is hell (which is why I live with my grandparents and not my parents &amp; my brother). I wonâ€™t get into it too much, but my brother is a raging drug addict / alcoholic, always comes home high or drunk and wants to physically fight my father (who has anger issues, so they always do), and my brother often tries to kill himself. I got away from that, but it still lingers and I feel depressed knowing I canâ€™t go home because itâ€™s not a healthy place to be. 

I also donâ€™t have any friends. And when I say that I mean it. Not a single friend. I have social anxiety and BDD (both diagnosed) and no amount of therapy or medication has been able to help me. My biggest fear is ending up alone for life. I once stayed here at home alone for a week and I remember how empty and sad it felt, especially knowing â€œshit, this is what my future is going to be like ?â€ 

Iâ€™m not ugly, Iâ€™m half decent looking, but because of my trauma and my chronic depression / social anxiety / BDD no guy would ever want anything to do with me. Iâ€™m not surprised no one pursues me. I try and talk to guys but they act totally turned off, so I gave up trying. 

I know my life isnâ€™t as bad as others, but it isnâ€™t a good life. Itâ€™s a sad, hollow, meaningless existence void of any happiness. Iâ€™m looking for a reason to keep living, but I have absolutely no energy to try and do anything with my life. Iâ€™m afraid to take another step because Iâ€™m scared of what bad thing is going to happen next. 

(Also - depression runs in my family, so itâ€™s not just situational but chemical. My dad also has very bad depression and was hospitalized for it twice. I was also hospitalized twice for two different suicide attempts, and it was hell. The nurses in the mental health unit donâ€™t give a ratâ€™s ass about the patients and treated us like parasites. Never going back there.)
