finding comfort in suicidal thoughts and ideas...though i know i will never go through with it, the only idea that brings me comfort about my future is the one that i could end it all if i truly wanted to. i genuinely wish i could be hospitalised in a mental home just to live a life alone and with no worries. not asking for any advice, rather, wondering if anyone else has similar ideas?
