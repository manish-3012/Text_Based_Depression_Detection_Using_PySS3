Running out of people I can turn to for helpHey guys, created a throwaway cause I'm kind of desperate tonight. I'm 28, I've been suffering from various levels of anxiety and depression since I was a preteen. It's been a long journey. Im really proud to say I only have one attempt, thanks to awesome people in my life that have always been there for me on the bad days. But no one is there for me tonight. Everyone has had rough weeks at work, everyone I've asked for some time from tonight has told me they're too busy/tired. And I don't want to kill myself, but I've entirely run out of energy to keep moving forward. I've been sitting on the couch for two hours cause everytime I try to stand up, the thought of summoning the energy to stand seems entirely overwhelming and I just start sobbing again.

I just need to feel like someone cares without me having to beg someone to care.

I've been working with my therapist on my self hatred lately, but it seems like the harder I work on it the more I realize my hatred of myself goes to the very core of me.

Sorry for the rambling. I'm just trying to get a grip tonight but it's unbelievably hard.
