I'm alive, and yet suicide is still on my mind.I know I should have replied to my previous post, but I hated that I didn't commit. I hate that I'm still alive. I don't know why, but I really wanted people to just believe I was dead. I'm alive, that much is obvious, but I still can't stop thinking about killing myself. I just want someone to love me. Somebody I can hold and know that I have a reason to be here.  It kills me to know that isn't possible. I want to hang myself so bad, but I'm still terrified. It's why I couldn't do it last time. I feel weak
