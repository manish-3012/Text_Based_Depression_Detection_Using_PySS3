People of Reddit saved me last night, and I promise to continue what they did.Last night, around 2 am, I was planning on killing myself. But as one last cry for help, I got on reddit. 

I just want to say thank you to every single person on here. You saved my life. I will try to pay it forward by trying to help others. 

I will be going back on my depression medication and going to see a counselor. Again, thank you so so much for saving my life.
