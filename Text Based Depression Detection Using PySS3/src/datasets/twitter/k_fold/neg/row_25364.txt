i can't believe i let myself get hurt again. i'm so fucking stupid.so i pretty much just found out that the guy i was interested in is still with his girlfriend that he told me was his ex. i thought he liked me but he obviously doesn't give a shit about me. i feel so fucking stupid for thinking that he liked me and even stupider for being upset that he doesn't. i'm 21 fucking years old, i can't believe i'm crying over a boy.  
i've already decided that i'm going to kill myself if i'm still single by 22. i hate that i put so much worth on my relationship status but i feel so lonely. i've never dated anyone, nor has anyone ever been interested in me because i'm fucking ugly and obese and have a horrible personality. i just wish someone could love me but i'm obviously unlovable and fucking pathetic.  
i hate myself so fucking much. i'm so disgusting and worthless and everyone fucking hates me. like people take it as an exaggeration when i say that i have no friends but i LITERALLY have no friends. there isn't a single person in my life that would be hurt or affected in any way if i killed myself. if anything it would make it better for them. i'm nothing but a burden on everyone. i have cancer and i wish it would have fucking killed me a long time ago so that i at least wouldnt be blamed for my own death.  
fuck everything. everyone already hates me and wishes i was dead. people pretend to be nice to me but i know they immediately turn around and make fun of me and talk about me behind my back. i know people show my texts and snapchats and stuff to their friends to make fun of me. i haven't had a friend in so long and i feel so fucking numb.  
this is stupid. i dont know what i hope to gain by writing this. i'm so fucking pathetic and worthless. every fucking second of my life i feel like i'm about to have a mental breakdown. even my psychiatrist fucking hates me. i'm looking for a single reason not to kill myself and haven't  found anything. i wish i was fucking dead.
