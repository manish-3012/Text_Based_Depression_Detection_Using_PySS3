My whole life ive been set up for success, yet i always feel like im fucking up.21 M living in the US. 3rd year in college. Had my first suicide attempt 5 months ago. Been on lexapro for the past 14 months or so to treat depression and now suicide. lashed out at a girl i used to date (she was partly the reason i tried to take my life) tonight because she mentioned me in a mutal messinging group were in. (were both on a sports team in college) pretty much told her to fuck off and now everyones pissed at me. I feel like shit. I pretty much am shit tbh. all i want in life is to help people and here i go just fucking everything up. Idk why i even said what i said, i should have just stayed quiet like eveyone told me too. idk man i just dont know what to do anymore. all i want in life is to make other people happy and i feel like im fucking up every single day. whats the point if im just gonna keep fucking up, wasting my parents money and bawling my eyes out every other night.
