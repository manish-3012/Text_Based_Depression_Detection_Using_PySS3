Worst I've been in a whileI'm just so depressed I don't know what to do with myself. I want to disappear from the face of the Earth. I don't wanna be remembered. I feel like I'm being selfish though. My mom recently attempted suicide, and I couldn't do anything to harm my dad or my siblings. I care too much to hurt them. I almost relapsed back into self harm, and my eating patterns have become more disordered like they used to be. I feel as unstable as I was when I was a teenager. I'm supposed to be a husband, father, and brother. I need to be here for all these people that I care about, but I can't even be here for myself. You don't have to respond to this if you don't want to. I'm stable enough that I won't do anything
