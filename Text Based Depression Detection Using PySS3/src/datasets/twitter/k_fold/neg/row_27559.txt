I will never be able to let go of my awful past shame.This is obviously a throwaway account but I just wanted to know what everyone thinks. I honestly don't want to die, but I also don't want to continue living this way. I'm not the kind of person who goes around telling everyone I'm suicidal or depressed or express it on social media because if I was to kill myself I wouldn't tell anyone about it.

I have done some awful and shameful things in my past, I'm almost 30 and it took me until I was 27 to start thinking clearly. It feels like there are two people inside of me, the old me and the new me who are constantly in battle. I can't forgive my past actions and I feel like I'm putting up a big front and suffering for my past actions which I deserve.

Everyone I know thinks I'm this great/kind guy because of how I've been for the past two years and how I've actually learned to take responsibility for my actions and not blame people for my problems or talk negatively about people when their not around. I'm truly blessed that I have learned to not judge anyone but myself.

But at the same time along with the guilt, I'm so worried people will find out my deep shame and it terrified me and I'm constantly in a circle of shame/fear/paranoia. I want to end my life, but I know that would be the selfish move and it would mess up a lot of people. Im not trying to puff my chest or speak about how great of a guy I am. I'm in such a dilemma because I've been trying to learn to accept that everyone has shame, but I just can't fully believe that anymore.
