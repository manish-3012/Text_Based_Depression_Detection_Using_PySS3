Thinking of SuicideAt this point I hope I get covid and die from it and I canâ€™t stop wishing this pretty much everyday. Yet Iâ€™m still really healthy- my luck Iâ€™m probably asymptomatic. 

I ruin every relationship I try to have. Itâ€™s always my fault because I start to feel insecure and push them away, then they think Iâ€™m playing games and get super angry with me and usually never talk to me again. Then I find someone else to take my mind of the person I liked. And most times I just stay numb to my feelings and go through the motions of sex, then I feel guilty. 
This relationship crazy nonsense happens with regular friends too. Itâ€™s really weird. But I am the queen of pushing people away. It seems as soon as someone gets close to me I get scared and destroy it. I am a saboteur. 

I think it stems from my fucked up abusive past and Iâ€™m so guarded that itâ€™s a natural response to love. 

I know how to kill myself - Iâ€™ve come up with different plans... I just have this urge to hurt myself for hurting everyone around me. 

Iâ€™m alone and canâ€™t handle it anymore. I want to have someone to love but Iâ€™m incapable so whatâ€™s the point of living.

thanks for reading, I know it was probs boring and not as intense as some stories. I just needed a release. 

goodnight
