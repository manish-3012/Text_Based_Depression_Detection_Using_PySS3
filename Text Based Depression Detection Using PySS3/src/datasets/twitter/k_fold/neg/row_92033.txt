Why the hell shouldn't I kill myself?What do I have to do to get a break in life? Seriously, I spent the whole year trying to build up a failing business and I have nothing to show for it. Nobody even wants to buy the businesses assets for what they're worth.

I can't get a decent and decent paying job because I'm a young white male and to top it off I don't have a qualification outside of high school, which means jack anyway.

I know I'm being a pussy for complaining, but I'm done with this shit. 

Sure, I have people who love me and are big parts of my life like my mom, cousin, grandfather and a few close friends, but why should I stick around and suffer just for them, when I will never realize my own dreams and ambitions, when I will clearly never have the life I want?

Fuck this shit. I'm poor and I always have been, but how can I become rich when I keep working my arse off only to never get anywhere while so many other people have awesome lives handed to them on a silver plate?

Nope, I call bullshit. Please don't give me the "there are so many people worse off than you" speech, I've heard it before. I know there are and I feel bad for them and it makes me appreciate what I have more, but my envy for those that have it better trumps my feelings towards those that have it worse.

So, why the hell shouldn't I kill myself? I mean I REALLY, REALLY fucking want to.
