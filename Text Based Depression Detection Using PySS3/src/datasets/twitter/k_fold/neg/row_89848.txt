I know that the only way I will ever die is by my own handsSince middle school Iâ€™ve felt always dealt with the thought of suicide, it just seemed the perfect way out. I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about my future I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about anything, all the problems in the world all the feelings and emotions wouldnâ€™t matter because everything can finally end in a second. In highschool I tried to suppress my feelings with drugs, drinking and partying and in college I just carried on partying and masking my emotions with drugs. I went out to do everything Iâ€™ve wanted; Iâ€™ve gone out to state parks, Iâ€™ve skydived, I joined a fraternity, I vacationed out of the country multiple times, but all those events just felt like temporary happiness. My brain cannot stay in a state of joy and I know someone else in my shoes would have an amazing life. I have great friends and family but I donâ€™t think they truly understand how I feel and what I go through every night. I know sometimes I completely fail my parents but in my household, and the background my parents come from, mental health is never discussed itâ€™s more of a taboo. I have no one else to talk to about my mental health, my ex girlfriend understands a little bit but ever since I have broken up with her it has gotten worse. She was the only and last person that truly knew how I felt and since we been broken up there is no one to talk to. My best friends will say they are there for me and have my back but I do not think they truly understand the scope of my depression. Itâ€™s a shadow that wonâ€™t leave me itâ€™s a shadow thatâ€™s always there and nagging me. Every high I have in this life is eventually followed by a deep and darker low. I know the only way out is by putting a gun to my head. I sometimes have pleasant dreams where I end my life but then at that instant I wake up. I always think that if there is a pistol or shotgun in front of me, and because where I live most households have one, I should grab it and just end my stupid fucking misery. I tried loving someone as a cure but my dumb fucking emotions screwed that up, Iâ€™ve been using all sorts of drugs as a cure, psychedelics, thc, stimulants, etc. and those are only temporary. The only thing that helps me sometimes is music, but those feelings of joy only last for so long. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do anymore. I know I will eventually die by my own hands, itâ€™s only a matter of time. Iâ€™ll just be another infinitely worthless speck in the timeline of human history. My existence does not matter, and because of that thought it almost brings me joy. I think my greatest joy will be the seconds before i off myself. I have no one else to tell this. No person with a degree in psychology or therapy can help me. I felt on this night something out there or someone out there can read my thoughts. I donâ€™t know when it will happen, but it will happen soon
