I have a friend who is going through hard times and keeps talking about wanting to commit suicide. What can I do?I have a friend and co-worker who is going though very tough financial and marriage issues at the moment, and she keeps talking about her desire to commit suicide.  Long story short, Her husband lost his job and company car back in July.  She is now the sole earner in her family and is trying to support her Husband and 2 children on her salary, which is not that good.  In addition to working her regular 8-5pm job, to make ends meet, she also works as call operator for our company every evening and night.  So she has essentially been working around the clock since July.  Her husband has not been proactive about getting a new job and he has sort of "checked out" in helping around the house.  She says he refuses  to help clean, or cook, or do much of the "home-maker" duties while she is at work during the day and waits for her to come home and cook and do the laundry etc.  She says she feels, trapped and suffocating and is not sure how much longer she can last.  Her son also needs special ADHD treatment and behavioural counsuling which she cannot afford since her Husabnd lost his job.  So yeah, she is having some hard times.  She has attempted suicide in the past and her Brother committed slow suicide from Alcohol abuse.  I want to be able to help her, but honestly, I have no idea what to do.  I help her out by driving her back and forth from work since we live near each other so her husband can use the car to look for work or run errands, but I think she needs to talk to someone, a professional.  I don't think my advice is helping, or even qualifies as help.  I am honestly worried.
