Feeling like nothing will changeI feel like Iâ€™m going to feel as miserable as I do now, forever. I have some good things going for me, and yet Iâ€™m always unhappy. I have great friends, and yet I feel soul-crushingly lonely. I have literally no real responsibilities right now, and yet Iâ€™m constantly stressed. 

Iâ€™ve had thoughts of suicide since I was a child, but right now the things I have going for me are better than theyâ€™ve ever been. And yet Iâ€™m still miserable. I feel like nothing will ever change. The events in my life keep changing, but the misery is ever present. 

My therapist took a leave of absence before the whole pandemic started and was supposed to return in April, but I havenâ€™t heard anything from her and I have no way to contact her. Iâ€™m not sure if she can come back, what with everything going on. Of course I 100% want her to prioritize her safety, but itâ€™s been 5 months now and Iâ€™m becoming increasingly desperate. 

Iâ€™ve been tried on so many meds over the past 6 years and none of them have ever helped- including the ones Iâ€™m currently on. Iâ€™m tempted to just stop taking them. 

Iâ€™m tempted to just give up.
