Feeling life hitting hard.This month is the anniversary of the death of a friend of mine..where I actually witnessed the event; first-hand. I miss him. Which brings this up. My parents are kicking me out when I'm 18.. I'm saving up my money...but I'm feeling depressed to the point where I no longer carry a knife with me because I can't look at it, afraid I'll do something I would regret instantly. I'm going through this rough environment I can't really escape as I don't have really any friends. Or the fact my parents are mentally and physically abusive. CPS is handling my case right now. And I'm talking to a counselor but I'm just hurt. My family is the people who hurt me. And to top it off I'm homeschooled so she controls my future whether I like it or not. I can only escape at work. Which is 5-6 days a week. And as a person who feels like this. I wish I didn't. I wish my life was happy and full of joy. Buts it is not. it's shit. And honestly feels like it is not worthit. It doesn't help with the fact I still remember my friend. It was only three years ago.. this sucks.. I hate this. Life it too shitty and toxic.
