Sitting in the library and I stumbled on this. I've never emotionally cried in public before.http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1aytcm/image_at_your_funeral/c922wm5

I fear that my life will never amount to something, that Ill never find a perfect medium. Insatiable desire to be the best and just resulting with so much failure. Fearing the future of uncertainty. How i'll never be able to do everything that i will ever want to achieve. That theres not enough time and persistence to ever really achieve. 

I'm not good at anyone thing and it hurts. Why should i try if im never going to be the best? Thats what kind of stupid ideas float around my head. This person in frission has helped me continue on.
