I forgot how to cry. I don't have the strength to get up and kill myself.It's almost 7 in the morning, another sleepless night. Some hours ago I found out that, after a lot of interview with this HR person, I've not got the job. Again. It was just a clerk position, but I'm not worth even it. So I'm restlessly lying on the bed, trying to find a solution, a reason to go on, to feel, if not happy, at least not so desperate and worthless. I'm broke. Probably I'll lose my house. I'm transsexual. Probably I'll have to interrupt my transition, head back to my parents who kicked me out. I'm gay. Heading back I'll probably have to interrupt my secret relationship with my closeted boyfriend, closeted exactly like me, thanks to our homophobic country. Be back to my parents, in my hometown, when I was brutally raped for years by some guys. Well, my PTSD would be happy to meet then again, freely around the city. What a nice situation for a borderline person. I'm just a burden for everyone, that's why I've no friends. Or maybe it is because I'm ugly. I'm not even able to study for my college exams. How could I if I've not even the money to buy groceries? Let alone college books. I should find the missing documents that my pro-bono lawyer needs, to let me have surgery and legal change of name. I should check the hospital office to understand why they haven't called me back for my new testosterone prescription.


 I should go back to search for a job but I'm so, so, so tired. Last time I attempted suicide was in August. Before that, it was last May. May 11th. I keep thinking about the closet. How ironic it would be to have a rope hanging in there? Now I'm just killing time, to delay the time when I'll be killing myself. If I'll do it. 

I don't want to. 

I want to. 

I don't want to.

 But I want to.
