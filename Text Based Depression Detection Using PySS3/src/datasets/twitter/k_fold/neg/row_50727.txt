What happens if I get caught?Okay so as the headline suggests, Iâ€™m kind of hitting that point of desperation where I just donâ€™t care and want it all to stop. Mind you, Iâ€™m 26 and donâ€™t have health insurance. So my question is if I were to hypothetically go somewhere and try to finally end it, but get caught and sent to the hospital, what happens if I refuse to cooperate peacefully and donâ€™t talk at all? Ik theyâ€™ll still hold me or whatever but like if Iâ€™m admitted to the hospital and will not take meds, eat, talk, stay in my room, etc what will happen? Iâ€™ve pretty much hit that point with my depression and social anxiety where I just want out and thereâ€™s no going back or fixing me. Iâ€™ll just not cooperate and then try to kill myself every time I get out until I finally succeed.
