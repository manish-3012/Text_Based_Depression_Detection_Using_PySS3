I was groomedI was groomed by a pedo for the third time in row and I dont know what to do. I donâ€™t know why this keeps happening 

I donâ€™t want to go super into detail but at the time we started talking, I was being neglected by my mother and physically abused by my sister so I was desperate for positive attention 

As long as I sent nudes he was so nice to me and I wanted him to stay and keep being nice. So I kept sending nudes even though i wasnâ€™t even happy with it. It doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™m trans and very insecure, so I wanted validation. 

And a month ago he stopped messaging me. Now I realize what he was doing but I still kind of miss him. He was nice and Iâ€™m so lonely I just want attention from him again. 

And on top of that I opened up to my friend about what happened and they said it was my fault and Iâ€™m a slut. I just wanted to be happy but now everything is falling apart again. I want to be oblivious to what heâ€™s doing and for him to just come back so we can be together again. I miss him so much. 

I canâ€™t make any friends. I canâ€™t get anyone elseâ€™s attention. I donâ€™t know what to do.
