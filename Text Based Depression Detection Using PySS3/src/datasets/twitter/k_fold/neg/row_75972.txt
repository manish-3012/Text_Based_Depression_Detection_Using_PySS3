I had a brush with death today.I got into a car accident today. If I had hit the pole anywheres else it might have killed me. Iâ€™m still trying to wrap my head around it but for some reason Iâ€™m happy to be okay. The reason Iâ€™m posting here is because this brush with death Iâ€™ve had made me realize how much i mean to people. Nobody cared about anything but me. And not to make a shitty pun out of what happened to myself, but Iâ€™m your lifeâ€™s, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Cause if you guys go and try and realize you made a mistake or your plan fails, youâ€™ll hurt everyone around you.
