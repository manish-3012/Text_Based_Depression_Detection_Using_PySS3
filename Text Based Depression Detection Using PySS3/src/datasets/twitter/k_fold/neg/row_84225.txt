For my children to find.thisI dont know reddit well but I know you boys do. I love you both. You kids were the best sons any dad could wish for. Im sorry I failed you both. I dont want to.blame anyone especially your mother but she sure made.it hard.for me to live. Your not old enough to ubderstand but she didnt love me. Weve been together for 20 years and the romance does fizzle. But I loved her very much and you kids know that. I drove 150 miles each way to.work everyday so.you and your mother can enjoy life. You both have everything now and your dad needs to move on. Your dad has been really lonely for over 3 years and mommy hasnt even given daddy a kiss. Thats my fault because of my job being so far away. Your daddy loves God and he knows God loves him. You both know what you need to do and what to be when you grow up. Be good to.your mom.no matter what she does or how she acts. She needs you and its your job to protect her. I love you both.
