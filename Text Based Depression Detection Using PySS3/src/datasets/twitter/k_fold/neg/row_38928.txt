I think I'm done with lifeI can't describe how I feel anymore, I've had social issues since I was 11 I struggled making new friends and eventually I lost my old ones. I don't go to school (homeschool) and I dropped out of a youth Church group two years ago since I was constantly getting picked on. I'm 14 now (15 in a month) and I'm sitting on my bed in the dark realising that no one is going to be at my birthday next month I thought I was numb by now but I wasn't... it actually hurts me knowing that for the past three years I've been mainly by myself, I did have a girlfriend a year ago who I slowly opened up to but then she betrayed my trust by using me for her own sick purposes. Since then I've been spiraling into depression without being able to do anything about it.  I can't talk to my parents (They're not the kind to understand things like this) I've tried talking to my sister who moved out but that didn't work either. Since I had no one to talk to and being the stubborn asshole that I am and refusing to vent on my online friends I've resorted to cutting and drinking painkillers every day of my life. I got so sick of crying myself to sleep I resorted to drinking painkillers to help me sleep. I don't have any motivation for life anymore I'm in so much pain I'm beyond the point of thinking what others will think if I end my life...
