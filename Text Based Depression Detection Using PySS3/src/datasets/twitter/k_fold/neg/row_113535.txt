I'm standing here alone.. With no one to listen. I hate this life! I'm a 30 year old female. I've been a good persons whole life but can't seem to get out of the way of pain aan hurt and disappointment.  It takes me back a step every time. It's lurking around every corner of my world.  I'm sitting here with my choice....and there seems to be only one. How much can one person take alone.....
