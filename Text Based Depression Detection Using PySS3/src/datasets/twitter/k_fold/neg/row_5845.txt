I tried to end it all on the 1st.I feel so guilty. Even more so for not going through with it. I am so tired and so lonely. I still have my note that i cant seem to throw out. I keep thinking i will need it some day soon. Im too scared to live, too scared to die and i hate myself for it. Ive lost everything time and time again, but not like this.
