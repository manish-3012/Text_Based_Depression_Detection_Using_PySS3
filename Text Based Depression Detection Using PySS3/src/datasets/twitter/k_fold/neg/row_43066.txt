When your grandparents donâ€™t know how close you were to death this year...I just realized... they donâ€™t know how badly Iâ€™d cut myself. 

I havenâ€™t talked to them since the summer. 


I donâ€™t think her poor heart could take it.


The cut was an accident. It was just gonna be one more. One good one.


One cut.


One centimeter away from the artery that would have killed me. On my thigh.

I didnâ€™t want to die.
