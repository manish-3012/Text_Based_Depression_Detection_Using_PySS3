I don't know if I'm gonna make it.I don't think anyone will care but I just want to have a place to talk because I have nobody anymore. In October I almost ended it, I had the plan and all the stuff but I couldn't pull the trigger. Later at the beginning of 2020 I thanked myself for not doing it. I went to a new school, made friends, got a girlfriend, started working out and trying to better myself. I kept going, improving to keep myself in the happy place I was. Corona takes it all from me. I haven't seen anyone of my friends or anybody outside of my shitty immediate family for weeks. I have grown more and more paranoid which im pretty sure makes my friends not like me. I have tried to explain that I'm just in a mood because of this situation but I keep going too far. Finally today I had had enough of feeling left out so explained that the way they were treating me made me feel horrible. My girlfriend tried to help but it seems that she doesn't even care about me because she didn't respond when I told her I loved her and miss her even though she was responding to other people (which makes me believe that she doesn't actually care anymore and that she wants to end things but doesn't know how). At this point I'm just sitting in the dark in the middle of the night worrying about how I have lost everything I just got. The only reasons I have for not ending it all rn is that one I want to try to fix my relationship or atleast not hurt her with my death(even though she probably doesn't care), two maybe it will get better like last time and three I don't want to have a fucking zoom funeral no way in fucking hell I'm gonna have a shitty end because of some stupid virus. Alright sorry if you read through all this I just want someone to help me I can't tell anyone this because they will call the police and have me locked up in a facility when all I really need is someone to support me and love me.
