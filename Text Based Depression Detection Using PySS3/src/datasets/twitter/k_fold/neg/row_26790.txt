I have no reason to wake up to anymoreIve been suicidal for the longest time and then i met my boyfriend. Talking to him was a bliss its the only thing that comfort me and makes me forget i want to die. Everyday he said so many i love you to me he always assured me he only loved me. Then today i found out he cheated on me, out of all people, with a teenager. I broke it off with him instantly. I feel empty now i have no reason and something to look forward to anymore. I rather die than having to feel this.
