I went to the beach and sat on the sand to think about what it would be like to drown myselfThings were pretty good, I haven't had a bad life. But then the one thing that couldn't happen, did happen. And slowly my mind has come undone. 

Now I just want to die. I am an angry, bitter shell of a human being. I am a burden to everyone who cares about me because I refuse to help myself. I see no point, because I can't change the past, and I can't change the fact that I am me. I can't live with it either.

I have been having suicidal thoughts for a few weeks now. The gap that separates thoughts from action is big and scary, but step by step I feel like I am beginning to narrow it. It feels like just a matter of time before I finally decide to swim out as far as I can, and then it can all be over.
