I just want to die all the timeI already posted a similar topic on the confessions but I thought I might get a little help here, so Iâ€™ll post another one here and see where it will take me. 

So 8 months ago I attempted suicide. I tried to OD on medications I was required to take. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I think Iâ€™m just really good at lying to myself and everyone around me. I lied to myself when I was taken to the psychiatric hospital that I was normal and I was pretty darn convinced I was, which when I got released I was so happy to live. I went to therapy a few times which I lasted maybe 3 months and then I quit because I didnâ€™t have time and it became a stressful thing rather a helping thing. 
Fast forward to now, I started to get bad anxiety and depression again from this relationship Iâ€™m in. My boyfriend and I are on and off with our relationship but currently on a break due to my anxiety getting bad again. Some days I canâ€™t breathe and I feel like my lungs are collapsing. And those are the times when I really wish Iâ€™d stop breathing right now. Thereâ€™s always an suicidal thought in my head. Like thereâ€™s a way out of this misery but after my first attempt, I couldnâ€™t handle how my mom and my dad would be if I did die, so now Iâ€™m here living but with no real reason and direction. Everyday is hard. But then not only hard and was difficult to deal with, at the kitchen I work at, this 50 year old man is harassing me by trying to flirt with me and stuff. I donâ€™t know what to do with it but everyone around me is helping me take action on it which is powering me. And making me stronger. 

Iâ€™m sorry I really donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m talking about. Iâ€™m a 19F and Iâ€™m lost in life. I wish I never woke up that day. I have social anxiety and I hate people. I detach myself from everyone who cares about me but I need someone by me constantly. I always have a thought in my head that wants to die. I have really no reason to live. Maybe itâ€™s too much for me.
