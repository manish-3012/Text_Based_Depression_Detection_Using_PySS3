TW: descriptions of suicidal behavior
I have been struggling with minor depression for the past 7 or 8 months. I have never been suicidal nor have I ever contemplated actually doing any physical harm to myself. I do engage in destructive behavior but itâ€™s mostly things that affect me mentally rather than physically (ex. undereating, rigorous workout routines, fasting cycles that can sometimes lead to binging episodes). However, for a while now Iâ€™ve been having flashes of images where I am hurting/killing myself. It does not even happen when I am in a bad mood, I can be walking home and suddenly imagine myself continuously bashing my head against the wall etc. I try not to give much thought to it but the more it started happening the more disturbed I got. Can this progress into something serious or are these just â€œintrusive thoughtsâ€ ?
