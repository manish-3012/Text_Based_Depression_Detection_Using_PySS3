Feeling so suicidal I'm starting to feel in danger, what may I doI have had suicidal thoughts like my whole life but now I'm becoming obsessive  about it and I'm feeling like doing it over the next months. But I don't really want to die -- not yet at least. Should I call the hospital or what do you do in this situation?
