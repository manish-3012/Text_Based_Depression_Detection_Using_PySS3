Will the feeling ever go away?I will be 30 next month and never thought I would still be alive.  My mother abandoned her 3 kids when we were very young.  I grew up with my two brothers and my grandma who had already raised 8 children of her own  and should have been enjoying her old age.  Instead she took care of us.  But, it's not easy growing up without a mother or even a sister.  The one person who was supposed to love me didn't.  My dad is an alcoholic but at least he was sort of around.  When I was 18 my older brother got drunk one night and tried to hang himself with a belt, he was found.  I've never talked to anyone about this before.  It was covered up and I carried on high school with this huge secret that none of my friends knew I was dealing with.  Before that I remember standing in the kitchen with a bottle of pills.  Going back and forth to my computer to see if it was enough to kill me.  I never followed through.  I still want to die but I am too coward to do it.  I haven't had any healthy relationships because any time someone gets too close I cut them out.  I hate my parents and wish I was never born.  Will it ever get easier?
