Not sure what to doIâ€™ve been depressed pretty much my entire life, I am now 17 and canâ€™t take it much more. Iâ€™ve been getting help for years and telling them nothing works cause it doesnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been in and out of the hospital a lot but it never helps. Iâ€™m just not really in a safe place right now. The guns are locked up and I donâ€™t know the code, do have a bunch of pills I could take but I donâ€™t want to fail and end up being a vegetable. The amount of suffering I have been through is terrible and crazy. I remember my first suicide attempt when I was 7.  I really donâ€™t know what to do and I am just getting so tired of trying to survive. Ever since I came back to school after being in the mental facility, my friends havenâ€™t talked to me or even really acknowledge me. Everyone leaves me out of groups at school when the teacher says to do assignments in groups. I feel like a huge failure 24/7. I just really wish I could give someone my life without the depression and fucked up genetic aspect because I donâ€™t want my life. I canâ€™t remember what itâ€™s like to be happy. I have heard so many people give me reasons to live and they are all super cliche and overused. I just wish my meds and therapy would fucking work, same with all the other methods like meditation. I just wish I was dead when I was born and my parents hadnâ€™t gotten that brain operation to save my life when I was 4. I regret everything I have done in my life. I remember being confident and healthy well over a year ago. I remember having fun with all of my friends. I really miss being happy and healthy. I gained so much weight from my medication in a month. I canâ€™t seem to get it off and it makes me disgusted to look at my body, I used to not feel that way. I just really want to die but I am too much of a pussy and hate myself for it. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Nothing makes me happy. Iâ€™m about to go to bed and cry myself to sleep again. I just need some hope in my life.
