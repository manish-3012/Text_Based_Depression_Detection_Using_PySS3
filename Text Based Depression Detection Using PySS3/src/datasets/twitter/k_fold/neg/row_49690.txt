Letâ€™s make it snappyMy suicide will be quick. I think Iâ€™m going insane. Iâ€™m freezing cold but the sun is above me. Iâ€™m physically dying but Iâ€™m mentally numb. Itâ€™s so cold out here. Thereâ€™s this noise that the swing keeps making. Itâ€™s like a metronome. But itâ€™s more menacing. Like it knows that the person on it is going to die. Perhaps all furniture is alive. Kind of like Beauty and The Beast. Thatâ€™s a really good movie. I watched it four, no five times last night. The beast is so angry but itâ€™s because heâ€™s sad. Iâ€™m not angry but Iâ€™m sad. How do you know if youâ€™re just sad? Maybe Iâ€™m just sad. I donâ€™t like the word depression. Just sad. Itâ€™s freezing out here. My fingers hurt and I canâ€™t feel my toes. I think my ADHD is kicking in. Haha never mind. Itâ€™s always been here. 
I wish I was warm again. I hope death isnâ€™t so cold. I hope Hell is warm.
