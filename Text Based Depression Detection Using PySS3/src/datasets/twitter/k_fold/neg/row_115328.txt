Back at it AgainTL;DR: I had a great life with great prospects. When the prospects went south, I started messing up my great life. Now I vacillate between wanting to fix it and wanting to start a new life. As a result, I am suicidal.


Hey,

I'm a 26-year-old man who is married to a beautiful wife, has a 21-month-old daughter, and another child on the way. I was the top of my class in a large HS and graduated college in 3.5 years with 2 degrees. After college, I got married immediately (we had been dating since Freshmen in high school). I had a terrible job. Then it progressively got less and less terrible and the pay got better and better. All the while I was working toward becoming an actuary. I studied hard and passed exams (2). I tried to get employed for a solid year with no luck. My wife got pregnant and when the baby came, we didn't want to use daycare so one of us had to stay home. She is a public school teacher and made more money than I did at my job. As I was unable to get my actuarial job, I decided to be a stay-at-home dad and also a grad student to become a teacher myself.

After all of this, I started to drink (never done before in my whole life) at night when everyone else was asleep. Then I started abusing Robitussin. Then I started smoking weed. I've been going to counseling now for almost half a year. In addition, I have been diagnosed with depression and am on medication.

In addition to all of the substance use, I've also been sexting other men, having realized I'm attracted to both men and women. I've almost met up before but never have.

As a result of all of these crazy things, I've had suicidal thoughts ramp up and up and up. I was hospitalized about a month ago for all of them as it was daily that I wondered why I was still alive and didn't want to be anymore. I had gotten reckless with substances and was hoping something bad would happen.

My mood improved after that, but the substance abuse and longing for sex continued (my wife and I haven't in months).

Well, now I'm back to my bad mood. I have had heart palpitations almost constantly for the past 3 weeks or so. My mind bounces all over the place: I want a boyfriend to cuddle me. I wish my wife and I had intimacy. I wish I had never started the drugs. I wish I could live by myself. I wish I could just curl up in a ball forever. I wish I could get a break from all the stresses of school. I wish I could just be high all day. I wish I could OD. I wish I had a gun. I wish I could stop feeling pain. I wish everything could just go back to the way it was for the past 24 years. I wish I could just get my life back in order.

All of this is terribly confusing, terribly frustrating, and terribly tiring. Constantly bouncing back and forth. Repressing urges. Giving in. Feeling guilt. Distancing my family. Wanting to fix my family. Repeating the cycle. Driving the wedge.

Yesterday, I broke one of my last unbroken rules. I researched suicide. I looked at a variety of ways. My current idea is to keep it mess-less and pain-less.

I don't want to leave my family, but I don't want to continue hurting my family. In a way, I've already left and am just dragging out the grieving process. I'm so tired of living and going through the daily motions. I've tired of feeling trapped inside of a million expectations and things to do. Tired of walking from a room where I have to watch my daughter into one where I have to do all the chores then into another where my homework awaits. I just need to stop.

Help me. Help me help myself. Or help me end it all. I don't care anymore. I don't care about anything.
