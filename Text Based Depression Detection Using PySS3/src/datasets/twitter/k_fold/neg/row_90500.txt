I need helpBut Iâ€™m not strong enough to seek it. I feel like a bitch. I feel like itâ€™s in my head and I just gotta be a man about it. I donâ€™t look at people with mental illness as weak. But I look at my mind as weak. I know I should see a doctor or therapist. But I feel like they wonâ€™t take me seriously. I donâ€™t want a mental illness label following me the rest of my life. If I have what I think I may. It requires lifelong treatment. Which Iâ€™m also not a fan of. I donâ€™t know how to go about this.
