I'm 99 percent certain my first suicide attempt was supposed to succeed.My luck is limitlessly bad; I've been abandoned by all my family; I'm barely holding on to my job by the skin of my teeth; I got hit in the head by broken wood planks 7 times yesterday, one time hard enough to knock me out for 10 minutes;, and now I'm being kicked out of my apartment because my landlord is "sick of looking at [me]".            
        
At this point, I'm convinced I was supposed to die that first time, and when I managed to fuck even That up, God decided to see what it would take for me to finally throw in the towel for good.
