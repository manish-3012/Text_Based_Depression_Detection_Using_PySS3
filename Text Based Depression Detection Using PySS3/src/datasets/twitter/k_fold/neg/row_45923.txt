I've been holding on for so long, it'd be nice if someone could talk to meHello guys,

I've been on and off with my depression and I suspect it to be some psychiatric disorder. I've been to multiple psychiatrists, therapists, counselors and what not. I even got in touch with my spiritual advisor. The basic meditation and other techniques aren't working much these days. I have done many bad things in past and I have forgiven myself for it. But I try hard not to fall into a mire of depression and it sucks me in. My family doesn't seem to understand my condition, because they don't understand my mental agony. I don't have good friends either. To be honest I couldn't get along with people much. It'd be nice if I could talk to someone from anywhere. I'm supposed to be studying right now and I do really enjoy but this inner turmoil is what I'm supposed to embrace I guess. :) I also want to live a good life and want to be loved and to love. But I guess time has come.. So before I do anything retarded I'd just want to have a heartful conversation.

Thank you in advance.
