Torn between suicide and hair dyeIm a late 30s woman. Have raised a son to almost 18. Have loved a difficult man for 10 years until cancer took him 4 years back. Have been cheated on, lied to, abused, misused, and unappreciated.  I have had pcos since a teen and have always felt like an outcast, like a freak. I dont make friends because im afraid to look at people... too many I see staring at my flaws that I cant fucking change. Fuck society. Fuck beauty standards. Fuck the insecurity.  Im am so over this shit. I feel like everyone in my life is going to leave me. Its just a matter of time. And I make that happen.. I push away. Or they stop trying when depression keeps me from being social.. whatever. No one really gives a damn. My bf just took my son to town so I could have alone time... so here I sit. Torn between suicide or hair dye. Fml
