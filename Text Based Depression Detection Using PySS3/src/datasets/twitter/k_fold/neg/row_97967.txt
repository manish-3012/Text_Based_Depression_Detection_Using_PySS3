Suicide Mission. Hello there fellow Reddit Suicide Watch community, I just came to get a few things off my chest. Well, I am currently a 17 year old male high school student that is residing in the United States. I have many self doubts about myself such as low intelligence, unattractive physical appearance, constant pessimistic thoughts, cynical view of things, unhappy facial structure and thoughts. I don't like the world we live in because of how the system works and how certain individuals take advantage of it for their own benefit.

It's like natural selection, the weak die and the strong survive. Very smart and corrupt hierarchal people are the true winners in this life because they obtain money, respect, and power. The common population, unfortunately, must become insolent slaves that work for these people and just scrape by to survive. The common population are repressed from their full potential because of political, religious, economic or social factors. We, as humans, have turned this world for the worse. 

I have horrible personal incidences that have led me to this decision as well. I will never amount to anything because of who I am and how insignificant and moronic I am. I have devised a plan to guarantee a successful suicide, but it is indeed a mission. I'd say it has a 90% success rate.
