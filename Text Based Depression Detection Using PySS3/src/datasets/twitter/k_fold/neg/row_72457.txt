whatâ€™s the reason for telling someone youâ€™re suicidal? should I tell my friend?my friend is my ex whoâ€™s basically still my boyfriend (i donâ€™t want the label). and the only person whoâ€™s been in my life like the last 3 years, even though Iâ€™ve only know him for over a year. I was alone the rest of the time. I only have 3 family members besides him, who iâ€™d never tell. 

so anyways, Iâ€™ve come on here suggesting to people to tell someone close to them when theyâ€™re feeling suicidal. and idk why I even say that. Iâ€™ve never once told anyone anything I struggle with . I donâ€™t wanna show weakness, I donâ€™t want anyone worrying about me, I donâ€™t want any extra attention for some negative shit, I feel itâ€™d just make me uncomfortable. 

I also donâ€™t want to tell anyone because i feel theyâ€™d just try to stop me. if no one knows Iâ€™m suicidal then i can really do it in peace. 

but I was thinking of telling my â€˜boyfriendâ€™. mostly because heâ€™s been catching on there stuff wrong with me health wise because my physical health has gotten worse and I canâ€™t really hide it anymore. and heâ€™s found doctors cards in my room and seen all my medications. and I guess Iâ€™ve said some things recently thatâ€™s worried him and heâ€™s just said he canâ€™t ignore that shit anymore and wants me to tell him everything thatâ€™s going on with me. 

specifically, with telling him Iâ€™m planning to kill myself, i worry heâ€™ll try to tell my parents or something. and that will make me more likely to kill myself instantly, as fast as I can. I also donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™d say. I need to apologize because I flipped out on him kinda yesterday and told him i was done with him basically and then I took a bunch of pills and passed out. I only flipped out because i was irritated with him and then i was suicidal af because of something that happened. and i was really ready to kill myself then. but I just took the pills instead. so i thought i could tell him and just say thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve been like different and stuff. but idk if thereâ€™s really any benefit to it. 

so i thought maybe if anyone has experience with telling people, if they could give me advice and stuff then thatâ€™d be cool
