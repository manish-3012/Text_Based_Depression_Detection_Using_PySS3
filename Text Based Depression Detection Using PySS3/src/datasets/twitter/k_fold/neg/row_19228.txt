not applying for my dream job and its making me suicidal.I'm 18. my dream job has just become available. but im not in a position to take it right now.

I'm still at college (which i want to finish, and im taking an online course soon on top of that).

i have wanted this job for a long time. but im mentally screwy right now, i can barely keep on top of myself and college. its part times Fridays and Saturdays, so I wouldn't be in college but I'm so goddamn tired all the time. I wasn't expecting it to come up so its shaken me bit. also, Saturday is the only day I get to see my boyfriend and have some form of a social life.

I just feel like by not taking it, I'm being lazy and letting the opportunity slide. fuck, this whole situation is making me feel like shit and I cant deal with it.

if not now then when? i know another like it will pop up again, but what if i let it slide and i spend forever wishing i had. 

im scared. because im feeling like how i did before my last attempt. i dont feel anything, im numb and all because of a stupid job. its so frustrating. no one understands and everyone thinks its easy, but i just cant deal with it. 

not going for it makes me feel so lazy and useless.
fuck.
