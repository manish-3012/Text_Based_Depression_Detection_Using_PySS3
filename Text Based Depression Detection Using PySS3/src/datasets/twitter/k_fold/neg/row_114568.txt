I'm Trying to Leave But Without Others CryingI've attempted suicide twice in the past two weeks. Two weeks ago, I tried walking into traffic but as I did, it gave me the light the cross. I crossed, but didn't try it again. I tried to hang myself yesterday. I tried on the noose to test the durability of the rope, then tried it as an actual attempt, but I picked myself up because I thought of my castmates (I'm in a show at the moment for my school).  I don't know if my suicide would have the show canceled (we open on the 15th) or if everyone would be forced to do it under extreme sadness. And as a second thought, I wonder if people would even miss me, that if I killed myself, my castmates would have no problem continuing the show. I'm just tired of being around everybody while they're happy, and I'm not. I can't find my happiness. I can't find my will to live. I keep trying to leave, but then something positive happens with someone that makes me feel like "now I can't leave because they'll be another person to leave behind," or if something negative happens with someone, I feel like they'd think I did it because of them. After a string of days of no one talking to me, I feel free enough to leave, but then something stops me. It's too bad whatever stops me can't be permanent. I'm trying to leave, but I don't want others to cry or feel guilty. I still have the noose set up. And I've been to the hospital already- voluntarily. I can't keep going back because apparently it's for people who have worse mental problems than me.
