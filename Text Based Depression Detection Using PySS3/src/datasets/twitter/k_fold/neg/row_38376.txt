Iï¸â€™m at a loss in life and Iâ€™m done.Iâ€™m a piece of shit. I wanted that to preface the next things I have done. Iâ€™ve cheated on the love of my life, the girl Iâ€™ve been with for almost four years, almost a year ago.

Iâ€™ve hit her more times that I can remember in mostly drug induced or under the influence of alcohol.

She is still with me to this day. I have reminded loyal and havenâ€™t hurt her since that day.

I donâ€™t want to be labeled as a cheater or a woman beater.

The past that I lived in was a different me, but now that Iâ€™ve changed I canâ€™t seem to stop thinking about how much of a prick I am and I want to end it now
