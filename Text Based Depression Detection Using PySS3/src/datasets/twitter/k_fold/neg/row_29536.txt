no pointIâ€™ve already decided thereâ€™s no point to living anymore. Everything Iâ€™ve ever loved is gone. I have no friends, no family, the girl I love hates me, my life is literally ruined. Do I even bother leaving a note? Should I try to hang myself again? Or do I just grab my revolver and hold my breath.
