I'm so tired.This is the worst I've ever felt in my life. 

A week ago, I went to the emergency room because I was so close to killing myself. I feel worthless. Subhuman. I'm ugly as shit, everyone else looks like a god compared to me. 

They switched my medication. I feel so awful. I just wanna die. I wanna die so bad. I feel like nothing will ever get better. I feel like I can't tell anyone I know about how I really feel because they'll think I'm just fishing for compliments. My roommate has established he doesn't care. Any time I tell him I want to die, he just shrugs me off.

I'm not worth anything. I sometimes feel like I shouldn't kill myself, because people would miss me. But I'm starting not to give a shit anymore. I feel so heavy, so weak. I'm so tired of fighting this. I just want to end it. I'm so sick of it.
