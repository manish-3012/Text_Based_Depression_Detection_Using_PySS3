How can I die peacefully and painlessly ?So my girlfriend passed away a few days ago, I donâ€™t wanna hear that oh you shouldnâ€™t do it for this or that reason ok, you think I havnt thought of that? I simply want to be reunited with my soul mate. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m depressed or I feel like I have nothing to live for, itâ€™s just that what I have to live for I donâ€™t want anymore, I was perfectly happy being with my soul mate and nothing else. Iâ€™m actually very happy with the thought of dying to be with her forever. I am going to make myself happy and be with my soul mate again and I canâ€™t wait. I donâ€™t have any access to medications. I tried cutting into the arteries in my wrist but I canâ€™t push past that mental block and cut deep enough so that wonâ€™t work, any suggestions? I just wanna see her and go be with already! She is the love of my life. I thought I was suicidal before but never in my life have I actually smiled at the thought of me dying. So whatâ€™s the easiest way?
