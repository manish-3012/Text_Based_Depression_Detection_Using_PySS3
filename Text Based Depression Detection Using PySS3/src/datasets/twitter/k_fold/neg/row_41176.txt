It's so dark, and cold.I just dont want to exist. I keep seeing all this hate in the world. Hate that makes me question if I am inherently evil. Am I? All this hate that I cant stop. All these people that get hurt, and people turn a blind eye to them. All these political things. Afraid of people using me and abusing me in relationships, since I've been in 3, all had me being controlled like a marionette, and all of them ended in me being dumped.

That's why I begun to realize that Love isnt real. It's a chemical reaction that makes us want to reproduce and nothing more.

Everything feels hollow, and yet at the same time heavy.

My emotions feel numbed and not present.
But at the same time, my body feels sluggish and heavy.

I dont want to live in a world where I suffer.

I dont want to live in a world where people suffer.

I don't want to live in a world where I'm not useful.


Even though I'm scared of relationships,

My only point in life is to Entertain, Amuse and Satisfy people around me.

I haven't done anything for myself in a long time. Only things that others want.

Because I want to be accepted.

I want to be loved and at the same time give love.


Right now, I'm just giving love.


I mean I guess that makes sense.


Why should sub-human scum like me be loved or even liked.


I'm expendable to everyone.


I know I'm going to die soon.


Either I'm going to commit suicide before I graduate highschool.

Or I'm going to die alone in an apartment building, completely cut off from my family, my friends. Not being a burden to anyone.


Either a gun or sometime painless, doesn't matter.


I'd like to bleed out, so I can fully repent for how much of a burden I was on everyone in my life.

And to pay for being born.




I'm not supposed to exist.




I'm destined to die alone and hollow.




Fuck my life, and dont help me.

This is what I deserve.
