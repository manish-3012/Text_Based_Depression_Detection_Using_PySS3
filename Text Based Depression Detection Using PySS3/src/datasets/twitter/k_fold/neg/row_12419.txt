Suicide hotlines are garbageFor the first time in my life I used a crisis center and what a fucking joke it is. All they do is parrot your emotions back to you like a your talking to a robot. "You seem frustrated" "i'm sensing a lot of anger" "so you feel you're a burden". Never using that shit again. I'm better off just doing the deed. Too bad I'm already drunk at home alone or I would go for a drive down to the train tracks. But I don't wanna kill anyone else driving.
