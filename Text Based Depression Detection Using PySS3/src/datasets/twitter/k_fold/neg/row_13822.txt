Why am I even writing this..I have an okay life. going to university.. my parents love me. I have a lot of things most people would wish for. yet I don't see the point in being here. The only reason I'm here is my family. I wouldn't want to ruin their lives. I also have a clinically depressed girlfriend with hallucinations and paranoias of me cheating. she's convinced I'm cheating on her because she hallucinated of a package with a golden heart I never gave her. it's supposed to be for my affair, yet i have none. I love her more than anything..

This world is sick and full of pain and disgust.

What's the point in being alive? I don't see it.. I haven't been able to see it for years. I just turned 20.. and the older I get, the more I realise that nothing of this matters. there's no point in life.
