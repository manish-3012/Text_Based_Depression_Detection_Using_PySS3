I'm depressed and I am thinking of killing myself.I am writing this to help me feel better and get a burden off my chest.
So when I was born my mom and dad already broke up, fortunately my dad still loved me and is still keeping in contact with me and I sometimes visit him, but sometimes I am scared of him, he is still a good dad though. When I was about 8 my mom got an abusive boyfriend who was also a drunkard, fortunately he wasn't abusive to me, after a year my mom finally got rid of him. 
when I was about 12 my mom got another boyfriend who seems okay but I still don't like him.
So about 6 months ago my mother and my stepfather had another argument with my grandmother (mothers mother) but this time they called the police and I went to the child protection agency, after that my mother had to leave the house with my stepdad and I lived with my older brother (he's 21), and with my grandmother, that didn't make me as depressed as it should have.
The biggest cause for my depression was definitely my school (I'm 14 and in 8th grade), as I was am getting slightly bullied, don't have that many friends, and get below average grades and I don't have the willpower to do anything about it.
So I am thinking of hanging myself, the only problem is I don't know where is a good place (don't want to do it in my house)
