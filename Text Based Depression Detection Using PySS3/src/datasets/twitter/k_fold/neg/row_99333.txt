I said it out loud to another person for the first timeToday was the start of my second attempt at therapy. And for the first time I said it out loud. Suicidal thoughts. I answered her questions. Have you thought about methods? When was the last time? On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being you walk out of my office and kill you self, how are you feeling? Answering those questions was the calmest I felt during the whole hour. I was 95% honest too. I didnâ€™t tell her about the google doc I created a month ago where I kept notes about methods and written a draft of my suicide note.  I was worried sheâ€™d report me. But I also felt like that one night of darkness doesnâ€™t represent my depression and journey as a whole. Anyway, after 6 months of pretty constant suicidal thoughts, l finally said it out loud. I donâ€™t know what I feel right now but I donâ€™t feel more broken or any worse. I almost feel hopeful. I didnâ€™t expect that.
