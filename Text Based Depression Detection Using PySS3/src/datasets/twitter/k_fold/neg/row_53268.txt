Suicide is bad? I donâ€™t get why people say that.I never understood the concept of why suicide is bad? If I am suffering everyday why canâ€™t I have the right to die on my own terms and yes there is a possibility that Iâ€™ll get better if I get help but I am too tired and honestly too uncomfortable with positive feelings. I donâ€™t understand why people think suicide is a bad idea? Itâ€™s the best idea for me, I have wanted to die since I was 5 years old. Maybe bcz I just wanted to die from such an early age thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t understand why people think staying alive is worth it.
