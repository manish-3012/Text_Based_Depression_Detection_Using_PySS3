LolLast month I took 40 paracetamol, went to bed and woke up like nothing happened, eventually my family found the packets and took me to the hospital where no one took me seriously and I was put on a ward with babies who had colds and had a hour chat with a mental health worker who basically told me to go home and Iâ€™d be missed if I ended myself. Shows how much ppl care right ?
