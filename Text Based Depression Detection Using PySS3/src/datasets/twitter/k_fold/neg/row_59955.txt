Freshman in college. Need help.Sorry if I've got too many paragraphs. I'm formatting on mobile.

I had to withdraw from all but one of my classes due to my inability to be responsible for my work. I don't know if I like my major at all. It's graphic design. I like art, but I feel that my classes are awful for me.

I have a boyfriend, and he loves me, but he's got a very low sex drive. I'm not upset with him for it, but sometimes I feel like I'm not worth being intimate with or something. I don't feel negative with him in any way, just self conscious. It's not his fault.

I'm barely keeping up with the work for the only class that I'm in, leaving things for the hour or two before they're due, sometimes forgetting about assignments.

My family moved with me to this college, despite me picking this one to get away from them. They'd be very upset with me if I dropped out of college. I don't know what I would do if I dropped out. 

I just ran out of money. I'm not allowed to have a job in my first semester, I'll be lucky to be allowed in my second one. I can't go against my parents, they're helping me with some college expenses.

I really want to die so I don't have to deal with life anymore. I know I don't have it as bad as many. It doesn't matter to my brain. 

I don't like my mother or step dad, but I don't want them to be upset regardless. If I died, my boyfriend would probably follow suit. He's casually suicidal. Never threatened to, but he admitted he would do it with me if I did. But he doesn't know how bad of a place in in mentally right now. I might try to talk to him tonight when he gets off work. 

Didn't think I would type this much. I just need help.
