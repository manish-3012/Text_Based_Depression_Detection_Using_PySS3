I hanged myself while listening to music a few weeks ago and had an interesting experience.I got my earbuds and played some music and tied a rope to a doorknob and threw it over a door then dangled over a chair for a few seconds (maybe 10-20) with my music playin. I got that unpleasant tingly feeling all over my body that probably anyone who has hanged themselves is all too familiar with. But what was interesting was that the music slowed down to like 1/2 the speed of the original song. It also sounded very disturbing, like someone was messing with the song in some way. I couldnâ€™t believe I was listening to one song the whole time because I swear after a few seconds of hanging myself the music slowed down significantly. Note: this was not a suicide attempt but more of a testing out sort of thing. I didnâ€™t intend to die
