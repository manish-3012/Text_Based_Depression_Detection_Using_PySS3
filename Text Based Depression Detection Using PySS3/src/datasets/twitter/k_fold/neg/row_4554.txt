I really dont want to live and I am starting to not want to existThere's no point unless I make one. What if my point to make was that life is a frivolous struggle to reach an unattainable ideal? What if my point was to try and fail? 

And to ultimately die.

I've never felt love and never will. Every attempt has burnt me to the core. Everytime I burn, I leave some ashes behind.

There's not much left to leave.

The therapy is lies. The meds don't work. I have to go to a paid professional whose entire career is dedicated to telling people they matter. He has to be paid to say nice things and "change the narrative".

There's nothing to change. The world is cruel, empty, and uncaring.

I'll just be another suicidal veteran.

Find your own reason, if you can, and fight for it.

Because mine is gone.
