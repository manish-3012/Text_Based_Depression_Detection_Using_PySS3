I am giving up but i dont want to destroy my son's life tooI dont know what to do. Ive been trying to get better mentally but im failing. I cant function. I let everyone down. 

My dad just arrived unannounced at ny place and destroyed me all over again. In between the awful horrible things he kept saying/asking why dont i let them help me?

They dont help. They hurt. Everytime. If you even bother talking back then they destroy you. My best friends dont live anywhere near me. I am behind on rent. I had to cut off my hair that i used to love so much in the shower because i cant even brush it. It was matted and just a big symbol of my inability to do even the slightest thing right. 

I love my son very much. I dont want to hurt him by dying but it feels selfish to burden him too with my failures. The courts will give him to my family and they will let my mother and father ruin his life just like mine. He deserves so much better. He is lovely and kind and funny and i would fall even further if they take him from me. 

I cant go home.  It doesn't feel safe anymore. He didnt hit me hard enough to prove it to the police. He just made it clear how worthless i am as a parent and daughter and sister. 

Ive stopped crying but now im dead inside. I have 3.5 hrs until i can pick up my son. Is there somewhere you can go and be watched so you dont kill yourself, but they dont keep you there? 

My choices are killing myself or packing up and throwing away everything and hoping one if my friends will take my son and love him while i go into hospital. Is it possible to go into hospital if you are crazy? My brain isnt even my own anymore and none of the medications i have been trying for over a year have worked. 

I just dont see how i cant ever be better or have a functioning life.
