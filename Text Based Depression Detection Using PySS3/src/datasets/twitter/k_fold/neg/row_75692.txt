Just a reminder. No one here cares about you.They only care about trying to make themselves feel better by telling someone else that they shouldn't kill themselves because they "matter" or that "things will be better for you." But in reality those people don't even know who you really are so how can you trust someone on the internet you don't really know. If you really need help then just fucking go get some help then and stop making up excuses.
