I have tried to kill myself twice, I'm recovering slowly, but I think this time everything it's going to be okI have a fuck up life, I have been abused, I tried to take professional help and my parents never let me (they don't know I have been abused, I don't want to tell them, also they don't know about my attempt of killing myself) I been bullied since I have memory, about my weight, my face, my hair, the fact that I have good grades, to the point I try to remove all of them, I was almost anorexic, i cut my hair off thousand times, I always look down, that way people won't look my face, and have bad grades; my first attempt was when my best friend kill himself, my second was when I just want to stop everything, I hate myself in so many ways, but I also love myself sometimes; I just want a quite life, that's all
