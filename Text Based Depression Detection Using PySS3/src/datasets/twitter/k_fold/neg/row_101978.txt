Legal question (UK) regarding leaving money behindIf someone commited suicide and left an informal note saying something like - "i want my brother to have all of the money in my bank account", would it stand up? 

I imagine if you do nothing then the money would just go nowhere until the account is deactivated at some point. But if you left a note (i.e. not a formal will) then does it actually count for something?
