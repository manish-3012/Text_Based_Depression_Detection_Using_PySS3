Waiting for either the right moment, or a reason to live that I can't refuteI've made preparations for my next attempt, I have a place in mind, and a time. All there is in my life is bad people, bad places, bad memories, and one thing after another going wrong. I'm not going into specifics, I just want to know if life is worth it, and why, you don't have to be persistent in trying to convince me, if you can't, just move on, I'm just another person among billions.
