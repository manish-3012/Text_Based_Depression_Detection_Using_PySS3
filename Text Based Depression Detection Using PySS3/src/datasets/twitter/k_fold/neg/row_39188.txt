There's something about me that repels peopleI haven't made a real life friend for over 8 years.. not for lacking of trying

The only good thing I had was an online girlfriend, and it was serious but I fucked that up.

I've been rejected by a girl who's my friend. People don't really like talking to me, they get uncomfortable.

When I was in college, I tried to seek help for my anxiety and depression. I saw a counselor, and she was nice, and she said I could open up to her, but when I tried to open up she didn't seem to wanna listen. 

Then I saw a uni psychologist for a bit. I had a couple meetings with him. I tried to set up another meeting, but he kept ignoring me, and just didn't hear me, and didn't meet with me again.

I posted on a suicide forum a long time ago, and a person reached out to me and we became friends. We were both suicidal, and she really seemed to care for me. I depended on this person to get through hard days. I dunno what really happened, but now she won't even talk to me.

I'm like an unwanted critter...
