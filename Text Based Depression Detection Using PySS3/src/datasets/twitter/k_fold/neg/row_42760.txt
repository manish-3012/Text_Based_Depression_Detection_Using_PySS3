Iâ€™m out of hope, and if nothing changes Iâ€™ll probably be gone within the week(18) My parents have been abusive as long as I can remember. Everything from grabbing me by the throat and threatening to kill me, to standing outside of my locked room screaming at the top of their lungs about how they were gonna skin the dog alive and itâ€™s my fault. They pull their shit still happens too, like 3 times a week at least. (Minus physical stuff. They know Iâ€™d call the cops now.)

I deal with PTSD, severe depression, and a medley of other shit nonstop. Every day is worse than the last. All of my (already few and distant) friends have stopped talking to me. Not even my new therapist is returning my calls. Iâ€™ve been searching for an escape for so long and have found nothing. Iâ€™ve reached out to every resource I can think of and thereâ€™s nothing. 

Iâ€™m falling behind in school. I canâ€™t take proper care of myself. I can barely even get out of bed.

I canâ€™t take the constant pain and fear anymore. I canâ€™t think about anything else. Iâ€™m so confused and barely even know whatâ€™s real anymore. I just want to die.
