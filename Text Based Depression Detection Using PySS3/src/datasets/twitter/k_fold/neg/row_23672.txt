The realization that you will never be happy in life.I will never be happy in life. 

I don't think I will ever have the things out of life I want. 

I know I'm putting myself down so early I'm less than 20. I have my whole life ahead of me. I'm set for HS. I've been accepted to college, where I'll be majoring in something I enjoy. I have a decent family. I have a few friends. I have no major life issues or problems or diseases. 

Except for loneliness. 

It really makes me want to commit suicide. 

I really plan on it someday. I can't imagine decades more of this. 

Constant disappointment and failure because I'm so ugly and lack the social skills to be able to find someone. 

I just want to die. I wish someone would shoot me. I don't have the guts to do it to myself.
