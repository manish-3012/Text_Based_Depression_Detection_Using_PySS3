I find myself stockpiling sleeping pills.So, yeah. I guess Iâ€™m not actively suicidal (it has been worse) to the point that I might do it right now, but itâ€™s still on my mind. It hasnâ€™t not been all year (it used to be more passive and less... around). 

The last time I had a stockpile of 140+ pills, I ended up giving them to my therapist after I shot her a desperate email (which led to an earlier psychiatrist appt too, the day after). I still find myself regretting it now, because since I did that, all thatâ€™s happened is my mind concocting more ways to die. Iâ€™ve been thinking of hanging myself at a nearby parking garage, or maybe jumping. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll have the strength to push through the initial resistance though â€” a care coordinator told me (after Iâ€™d given the pills away previously) that perhaps I had a little bit of hope still fighting to want to live, if I had managed to hold on long enough to pass the pills off to someone else even in a state of crisis. I just feel like pills take less effort? Iâ€™ve been pretty low-functioning anyway, probably why the thought of more â€œphysicalâ€ methods still seem too tiring to actually do them.  

Now I donâ€™t have much of a stockpile of pills anymore, at least not anything useful. The only ones I have now that are remotely harmful (even if itâ€™s not like 100+ pills, but maybe 40 or so) are Zopiclone 7.5mgâ€™s. I take them as needed as per instruction, but they do still prescribe me a full monthâ€™s script whenever I go back for a follow-up, so I have more of them than I need? I suppose I didnâ€™t intend to stockpile them for suicide (the tons of discontinued meds were my go-toâ€™s previously), but itâ€™s just kind of sitting right there. 

I feel like Iâ€™m supposed to feel happy, or at least happier, with everything thatâ€™s going on for me. I got into university for a psych degree â€” something that I wanted to go into since I was schooling. I just got a new, great tattoo for free? And another one planned, something from The Kite Runner. My family is finally moving from my childhood home. I have family and friends that love me. Iâ€™m losing weight for once in my life (though through an ED). I have a great care team behind me â€” a psychiatrist that troubles herself to sort me out, a therapist thatâ€™s willing to give me hugs when I ask for them. I just finished reading a book, literally about cherishing life in the face of imminent mortality. My birthday just passed this month, and I received a lovely surprise from best friends. Iâ€™ve been trying to do nice things for people more often. I feel like a good person doing these nice things. 

But Iâ€™m just so profoundly empty with no answers as to why, or how to help it. It doesnâ€™t go away. And I tend to get frustrated these days (about social issues, and then I hate myself for feeling that frustration), and also often sad. I donâ€™t feel like I have a traumatic stress disorder, but Iâ€™ve been getting very triggered again this past month with news reports of sexual harassment assault, and my local communityâ€™s response to it (they make a lot of jokes and victim blame, typical asian culture) â€” after being victim to assault in the past, seeing the response to it locally makes me feel really unsafe. 

So dying is always on my mind? I am just painfully devoid of the ability to feel genuinely happy. It all feels so hollow and flat. I donâ€™t even really feel like a real person anymore. Nothing is worth it but I donâ€™t know why. Itâ€™s all just so heavy and there arenâ€™t any clear answers to make it make sense. 

But yeah. I guess Iâ€™m keeping my zopiclone now. Wondering how many it takes to fatally overdose has always been on my mind â€” does anyone know?
