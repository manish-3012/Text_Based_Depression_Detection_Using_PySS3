I give upI hate this. I hate living. I just canâ€™t do this anymore. Youâ€™re life and everyone else life is better without me in it. And I know you want me to stay I just canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m not strong enough. It hurts too much. And I know that other people feel like this and they get over it and that this is just a phase but I canâ€™t do it anymore. Even if I do get through this itâ€™s too hard right now, I will never be happy ever again. I canâ€™t remember that last time I was actually happy, I canâ€™t remember the last time that Iâ€™d rather be alive. I just hate this. Everyone says that you will get through this and be stronger, but if Iâ€™m meant to get through this then why did they make it so hard. Iâ€™m not worth it. Nothing can fix me. Iâ€™m just a lost cause that everyone wants out of their life. When I kill myself everyone will realize that Iâ€™m not just tired all the time and that Iâ€™m some weirdo that is really sensitive, they will realize that everything they have done to me in the past has affected me, I didnâ€™t just ignore it. And just that fact that no one could ever make fun of me ever again makes me so happy. I know this will hurt you but you want me to do what is best for me and that is killing myself. I know you hate seeing me like this that is why Iâ€™m Going to kill my self, so we both wonâ€™t need to suffer. My life is  a mess . I donâ€™t have a purpose. I have a family that loves me but I donâ€™t love myself and Iâ€™ve lived like that for my whole life. Why me? Why couldnâ€™t it be someone else? Why do I have to kill myself and not my friends, itâ€™s not fair that I have to deal with this all day every day and nothing good comes out of it and that my friends donâ€™t have to fight for anything but they are already perfect. Iâ€™m going to a counselor but itâ€™s not working, Iâ€™m meant to turn my life around but I canâ€™t itâ€™s just too hard. I know if I was telling you this right now you would say that it will get better, but I know myself better than you do, Iâ€™m not going to get through this. I know other people have but Iâ€™m not like them . How am I supposed to know if they had something to live for. I have nothing to live for, I will gain nothing if I stay alive. Iâ€™m sorry but itâ€™s for the best. I quit.
