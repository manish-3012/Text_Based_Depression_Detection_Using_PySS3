Stuck in life.Hello guys,

So over 1 month ago I've said that I wanna try suicide. I tried but it's not that easy and it hurts and my rope wasn't that good. My life is really fucked up. I have really bad grades at school and I'm 3 weeks home because of my depression. I made a letter for my teacher and I've said that I've a feeling of being stuck in life because I can't commite suicide. I haven't seen my father in 3 years and he left me and he went to the other side of my land. He's a junk and he lies about everything. He's now a wanderer and 2 days ago he messaged me on Instagram that he loves me and he want to meet me again. I was really mad at him because he left me and flees and made a lot of debs with his house and other stuff and my mom has to pay that. My mom said that the debt was over 110Â 596.32 U.S. dollars. He has a really bad personality and I don't have a reason to live anymore. I've 2 years depression and I'm always feeling tired. My father has bullied me and I've been bullied at my playground back in the days. Somebody has give me a broken nose and bullied me. If you want to know more, message me.
