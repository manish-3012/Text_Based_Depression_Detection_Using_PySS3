they keep saying itâ€™s gets better ?this is my first time on reddit, seems to be the only social media with a real community. i tried tumbler but the apps pretty much dead. ironic. anyways i started reading this subreddit because i was looking for a painless way to kill myself, not exactly to do it but i needed to have the power to, need be. my life came crashing down 6 months ago. nothing has been okay since . i donâ€™t want to tell my story cause i know it doesnâ€™t matter. i feel so hopeless everyday and i feel like iâ€™m in a hole and iâ€™m clawing at the dry dirt walls and all the dirt keeps falling on my head and iâ€™m choking and iâ€™m crying and every time i thought i made progress i look up and iâ€™m in the hole deeper and everything hurts and the weight of the failed effort is pushing me down and i keep praying i will finally suffocate but death is barely out of reach. i know this analogy may have made sense to know one but if you understand iâ€™m so sorry- six months it never got better, in just deeper in the hole, but iâ€™m getting kinda use to it
