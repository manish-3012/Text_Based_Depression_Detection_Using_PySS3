Iâ€™m drowning amIâ€™m drowning and everyday just feels so pointless and empty Iâ€™d be lying if i was saying that there wasnâ€™t some point in the day that brought a smile or two out of me. Iâ€™d also be lying if i said I donâ€™t spend countless hours wishing i could just off myself without leaving my family behind. I just want this pain to stop and I donâ€™t know how to stop it. What do i do?
