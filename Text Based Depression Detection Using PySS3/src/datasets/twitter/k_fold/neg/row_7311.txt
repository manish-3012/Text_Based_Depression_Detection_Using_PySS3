I just can't handle it anymoreI have my belt ready to go I just don't know where to do it. I feel so lost and like I have nothing or nobody to live for. I cried myself to sleep last night thinking about doing it and now I'm laying here thinking about where. If I actually do manage to do it I wanna say thank to anyone who tried to help me even though it wasn't worth it. I'm just a burden to everyone and nobody wants me around. I'm probably doing everyone a favor. Goodbye
