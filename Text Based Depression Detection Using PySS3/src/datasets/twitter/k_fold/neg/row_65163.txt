Iâ€™m thinking about admitting myself to mental hospitalI have been pretty depressed and suicidal because a lot of things that happened this year. I tried to do things that I enjoy to try to forget it but itâ€™s getting too hard now. Iâ€™m not happy anymore. How can I admit myself before I do something stupid.
