It's just existence at this point.I'm alive but I'm not living, if that makes sense. It's the same thing every day. Wake up. Feed my cat. See my boyfriend off to work. Work out. Shower. Lay in bed for the rest of the day. Repeat. I love my cat to death. I think she's the only thing keeping me here. I'm not living, I'm just existing day to day. I'm not actively trying to die but if a car killed me while I was crossing the road I'd be okay with it.

Everything is just so... mundane. It sucks. I used to have so many dreams. I wanted to be a soldier, a doctor, a historian, I wanted to travel the world, learn new languages, make a difference. Somewhere along the way I became cynical. I don't find beauty in the things I used to. The world isn't full of possibilities, it's full of ugly people with ugly intentions. 

I miss being hopeful.
