Nothing has helpedAfter I thought my depression finally went away from a bit, after Iâ€™ve exercised, after Iâ€™ve talked to people, after Iâ€™ve made friends, after Iâ€™ve stayed positive for more than a month. It hurts a lot, the only thing that stops me now is my conscious telling me itâ€™s wrong to take my life but it dipped up today. Bad. I wish I would stop caring about everything for a second, so it would stop hurting inside. Iâ€™ve met so many people that make my day positive. But it doesnâ€™t help. I wish my friends would kill me instead of me doing it so at least I donâ€™t have to worry about the pain Iâ€™ll cause my parents. Holding on sucks so much ass, I wish my nose would stop being so full so I can cry normally. I thought life was turning up. But I simply fell off a cliff and back at rock bottom. ðŸ˜
