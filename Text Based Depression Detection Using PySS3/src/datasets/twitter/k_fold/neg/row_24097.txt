Midlife crisis at 28  

28 and what do I have to show for it? A shitty low paying office job where my employers treat me like some barely educated bum, never traveled outside the US, only had 2 short term relationships that quickly went sour, zero hookups/FWB situations, seldom been to parties, a useless engineering degree because it wasnâ€™t the right kind of engineering, no where near buying a house or relationship. A family who treats me like a kid and shames me for wanting any kind of relationship because I should â€œfocus on my workâ€ and I need to make more money to pursue a relationship. 

Yeah I just want to die and beg for a do-over, because I know what mistakes I made and want nothing more than to go back in time to my 18th birthday and see this is just one long nightmare. 

Its too late. Your 20s are for building your life up so that way you can live the life you want in your 30s. Travel the world, date a ton of women, fuck a lot of women, get into good/bad relationships, get into a great job, make a ton of friends, have a lot of fun, and create lasting memories. Its too late for that, the 30s are not the new 20s, there are complications like having toddlers at 40, a dwindling dating pool, realizing the +30 women who are single or divorced are so for a good reason, the difficulty of making frineds, social stigma of â€œacting immature for your ageâ€, women expecting more from you since you are older, etc.
