What do you do when you can't do something that's the most important thing to you?Like if you can't live life the way you want, why keep living? 

Background: on January 1 this year, I was 342 pounds. Now, I'm 299. At this point, I'm very confident I can get down to my goal, 180 pounds, and then build a nice physique. I'm confident I can maintain my good diet and maintain my workouts. But I'm going to have loose skin.

What this means is that I'll never have the body I want, and therefore never be as attractive as I want. I've always been made fun of for my weight and my looks and I want to have an attractive body more than anything in the world. 

Realizing that, no matter what, I'll probably never have it, makes me soberly consider suicide. Because why live a life I'm not enjoying? This was brought on even more intensely by my sister.

Today we were talking and laughing and I ended up going through her tinder looking at her matches and at the guys she was liking. Those guys are all incredibly attractive. They all have amazing bodies.

So then I sat there and I thought about how much work I've got to do to build my body...then I thought about other guys I've seen who have lost a lot of weight. And I realize that I may well have a body builder's body one day and it will all be concealed underneath my loose skin.

It feels like the work will be for nothing. 

It's very difficult to deal with. This is the thing I want most out of life. This is the thing I need in order for me to be happy and gain confidence.

I'm very tempted to kill myself. I don't think it's fair that I'm 20 years old and even when I'm 40 I'll be carrying around loose skin from mistakes I made as a kid.
