I wish I were deadI am dead on the inside. No matter how hard I try to make things right and feel alive. Even though I have been in a mental hospital, I still think that suicide is an answer, and at some point I'm gonna give in. That's the truth. Maybe I'm gonna say goodbye soon. Life is too hard to handle these days. When I think I can actually be happy, people throw their problems at me like I'm their saviour. I am a simple human being with problems too! Why can't I choose how to die and be left alone for once and forever? I wish I were dead right now.
