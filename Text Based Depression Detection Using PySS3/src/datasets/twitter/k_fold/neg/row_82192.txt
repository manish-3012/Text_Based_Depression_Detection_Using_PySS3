I guess this is my life now! Fuck it, I'm done!My life has been complete shit and I don't deserve to be on this earth with people who are clearly superior to me. I'm an inferior being who was a mistake, my parents call me a miracle, but I know that I'm a mistake. I'm a failure to everyone I know and they have moved on and lived lives that they love and I'm stuck in an unending cycle of hopelessness. 

All my dreams, all my ambitions, all my hopes have been for nothing. I dream of one day backpacking to travelling the world.  I have dreamt of going on holiday and meeting a wonderful woman who I would spent the rest of my life with. But life kicks you down and does not stop. Everyone I see in this world is superior to me and I'm inferior. I scream to myself that I'm inferior, my parents say I'm not, but am I and they are afraid to admit it as well. 

Sometimes, I dream of going to another country, mainly Australia, but also Canada, New Zealand and even the US (I'm from the UK)     My life here is depressing and I've been so close to killing myself for a long time. I've even sent myself to hospital a few times because of my attempts, I'm going to keep trying until I'm done! 

But this is my life now, no more dreams, no more drive, no more passion, no more hope.
