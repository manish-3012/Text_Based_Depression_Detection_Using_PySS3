I'm seriously on the brink.You guys get these messages every day on this reddit, i've only just found it on searching for help, so this message will probably be just one of the many but here goes.

2020 has been bad for a lot of us, but for me its been my worst year ever, the love of my life broke up with me because the long distance thing was too much during this pandemic. Yes i know what you're thinking, "oh another boohoo break up post" or "if she dumped you because of that then shes not worth it", its just a lot more complicated than that, more than i can go into. 

It has been 5 months since it happened and i've just not been able to recover, i've tried new outlets, tried making new friends, tried counselling, tried meds etc...nothing works, the pain is just too much. 

We were to be engaged this year too, i had the ring all ready for her but then this fucking virus ruined everything.

I have moments of distraction, but its brief and does nothing but pause the pain and its really too much to handle. People keep telling me it will get better but at 34, having only 1 relationship, etc, it really doesnt fill me with any hope.

I want to end it, but i'm scared to die, i'm caught in this limbo state of pain and one day the former is going to win. She made me promise not to do anything too, and i pride myself on not breaking promises, but i feel like this is one promise i may not be able to keep.

I need help, but help isnt working.
