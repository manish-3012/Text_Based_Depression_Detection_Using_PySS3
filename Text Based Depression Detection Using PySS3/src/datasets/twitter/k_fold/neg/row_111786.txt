I dont know anymoreFirst of all something about me. I am 17 years old from germany. I am doing quite good in school and already achieved to get accepted at a university and a company I'd like to work at. Additionally, I am going to take my A-Levels next year. I do have a couple of friends and 1-2 I'd put my life in their hands. 
So far so good, but there are some downsides. About 7 years ago I had some bad friends which usually managed to ruin my whole day by making fun of me as I never really protected myself - obviously an easy victim. It continued several years and it did become better (they stopped someday and by now we dont have any contact anymore). But because of this I developed something like a anxiety. It is quite hard for me to talk to other people, I feel attacked even if it is not ment to insult me and I struggled to get new friends. I really had to rely on those few friends I had back then. 
Beeing a huge perfectionist I **hate** not beeing good/perfect at things -  having gross sensory motor skills is a real struggle sometimes. Last but not least, I hate getting ignored. It is not like I need attention but I start question everything when getting ignored. 

Now lets start with what I want to tell you. Back in 2015 my first relationship started. She was a cute girl but is shizophrenic. I had strong feelings but it ended after about 2 month as she told me she never really loved me and I was something like a substitute for her (mostly because of her illness). She liked me and my personality and said I am one of her best friends, but she does not love me. I was not able to handle my emotions at this time and we decided it would be better to cut off the contact after shet old me she had feelings for an old friend of mine. I was unhappy every single day (I still loved her), began smoking sometimes and with hindsight I most likely delevoped a "small" depression. 
About 7 month later my second relationship started which lasted for about 17 month. It ended last month in november. At the start we fell in love fast but I did not want to admit my feelings to her because I was still marked of my former relationship. Anyways, this relationship was awesome and I regret nothing. We had our controversies like everyone does. But the last couple month were hard. We both thought about ending the relatinship secretly sometimes and finally she ended it. I was okay with it. Of course I was unhappy, you cant just forget one and a half year. I really would have loved to return to a point we both were happy. I still do even tho my feelings did decrease. I should tell you she suffers from depression and borderline-personality-disorder. She was in a clinic at the time we ended it. But we actually decided we could stay friends a texted a bit.

But only 3 days later she told me she found someone new she knew from the clinic. I was dead for a moment. Later she posted pictures on facebook revealing they got together only 1 day after our break-up.
The new one is 8 years older then her (he is 26), did not achieve much in life and everyone who has seen him dislikes him. And my friends (also friends of her and even her best friend) dont believe this relationship will last long. I dont know whether it is selfish or something like this but I hate their relationship. I got replaced another time. Plus she gave me the fault for everyone thinking bad about her and her new boyfriend even tho I tried to tell everyone it is okay if she is happier with him. I still do like her and dont want anyone to think bad about her (believe me or not. It is hard, but i try to act like a nice person at least once).
Anyways. Since the day I knew she "replaced" me I hate myself. I regret every mistake I made in the relationship and so on. I try not to text her often because I dont want to annoy her, but when I do she mostly ignores me or answers about 4 hours later with only 1 word. It kills me innerly. I thought about ending contact, but I dont actually want to.

I do know there a many positive sides in my life. But I dont feel like they matter. There is not a single day I dont think about it and I started to think about how to end my life without hurting family and friends. At the moment a carbon monoxide poisoning seems interesting. Sport seems to be a good temporary stress relieve for me but it does not help long. I dont like hurting myself, I dont want every person to know about my situation. I use the knive game as an excuse for at least a little bit pain. 
I reached a mental situation in which nothing really matters to me. My parents (which I dont really like either) could die and I would not mind too much. My sense for pain decreased. I eat much less (which is not particullary bad as it supports loosing unneccessary weight) but force myself not to fall in an eating disorder. I sleep much worse. Overall: I dont want to end my life because it is sooo bad. I want to end it because I dont know why to continue. I could have reason. But I dont feel like they are important. At the moment I write letters to every important person in my life and think about what to give them when I do decide to end my life.
I dont know if even person person reads this much but if you have done so - thank you very, very much. I appreciate it a lot.
