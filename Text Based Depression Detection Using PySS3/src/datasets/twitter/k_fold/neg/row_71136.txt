No suicidal thoughts for a straight weekHi guys, I had no real thought of killing myself for now a week.

Maybe no one cares but i need to tell it to someone, because i just realised it and im really happy.

I am M20 and for the last 2 years, nearly everyday i thought about ending it, most of the time when i went to work or got home from work, i wanted to jump infront of the train, one time i lied on the rails but got up from them before the train arrived because of my family.

I cant really tell the reasons, I have a good life, but im never really happy and if i meet with a friend i believe they want me gone.

But last week i felt so weird, i felt that nothing matters, not if i life or die and not what people think about me, so i send text massages with my real thoughts to everyone.

I told people i love that i love them, people i hate that i hate them and asked my crush out for a date.
Afterwards she blocked me on whattsapp, so that didnt work out.

But that doesnt matter, i dont have this silent pain in the back of my head anymore, I think im finally making sense.

But lets wait another week, life always finds a way to hit back hard.

If you read till here i want to thank you and wish you a great quite day.
