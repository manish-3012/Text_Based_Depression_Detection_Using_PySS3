suicide thoughts in my headI work for a US based Non profit. they are currently paying me 36k a year but working me over 100 hours a week. I dont get to spend time with my family and feel like a burdon to my family as I never can help around the house. I am not productive at work anymore and feel like it would be better to just die and not have to deal with the mess. I can not get a new job because 1. I dont have the experience in the field I want and 2. can not pass a piss test anymore. I consume medical marijuana daily when home just to relax me enough to get a little sleep and feel ok. I am struggleing with bills as it is and have stoped eating lunches and most breakfasts. I am just a drain on the planet and am ready to go. then the EMS personel in me says no you cant do that its the cheap way out you got a family to suport and a kid that calls you dad and dogs that love me. I am so lost I dont even know if suicide is the right answer. I dont know anything. I do know I need a new job and a better job that treats me with repect. I can not quit because I own a home and car. what do I do how do I find a better job.
