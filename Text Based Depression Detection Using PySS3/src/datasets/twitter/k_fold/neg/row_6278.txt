Struggling Tonight.I haven't felt suicidal in months. Depressed, maybe, but it's been a long time since I've genuinely wanted to end my own life. I just found out a few hours ago that I'm not EVER able to do the job I want to, the only thing I've wanted to do since I was five years old (For context, it's joining the Army.)

I have a medical condition that permanently refuses me entry. It's something I've had since birth but it's never stopped me being as active as I want to be in the past, but I can't do that. I'm devastated.. 

Never once have I been unable to do something else because of it, I go to the gym regularly and consider myself fairly healthy so it shouldn't be an issue!

Around a year ago I was about to jump in front of a train. At the time, I was unable to, my legs just wouldn't move. Now, I wish that I had done it. My depression was the worst around August last year, since then I've felt a lot better, which I mostly attribute to the puppy I got in December, but now I'm immediately feeling like there's no point living any more. 

Since I can't do the only thing I've ever wanted to, why keep going through life? I'll only end up feeling worse about it.
