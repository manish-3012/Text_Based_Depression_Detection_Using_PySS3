first post on reddit, and I'm sorry to confront you... I just need to get it out.fact is, I have a loving family. I'm a 19 y/o female, living on Dorms. I have the cutest boyfriend who tries to understand me and does the best he can to help me. 

But I feel so alone. Today, I went home from school. I don't feel alive. I am, but I feel like... living a dream. This morning I got up with tears in my eyes. I have cried for half an hour, while my boyfriend was under the shower. I just don't get it. 

School is going really bad. I have skipped more hours then is appropriate and I may have to double this year. ( or get the hell out of this school) 

I just want to get away. leave... I want to have rest in my head. peace. My head is kindda like Iraq. my own Iraq. 

I am seeing a psychiatrist, but once a week... once a week isn't enough. and I just want to know what the fuck is wrong with me. 


I'm done. done. I want to give my lovely boyfriend PEACE. and all you as well. One person less doesn't matter. 
I dont wnat to hurt anyone but myself. 
I need to go. 

I have made a will. I have a plan. I just need to find the right time. 
chaos.
