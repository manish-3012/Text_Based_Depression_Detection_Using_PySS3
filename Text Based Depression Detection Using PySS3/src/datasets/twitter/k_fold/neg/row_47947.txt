save me.why do I have to feel this way? Iâ€™m so sad every single day. I canâ€™t do anything at all. I am useless and a disappointment. Iâ€™m going to fail out of university and I donâ€™t have the capacity to get a job. I canâ€™t even get out of bed most days. I havenâ€™t done laundry in almost 2 months. I havenâ€™t brushed my teeth or showered for days on end. I am crumbling apart. I am terrified of dying but I have to kill myself soon or Iâ€™m going to have to watch everything fall apart around me. Iâ€™m going to end up homeless, jobless, and a failure. I wish I was dead. Why is it so hard to be alive? I know my condition is getting worse because I am doing less and less with every week that passes. Iâ€™m giving up. Iâ€™m tired and I canâ€™t go on anymore.

Iâ€™m so scared of dying. Iâ€™m afraid of it hurting, or going wrong. I want to jump off the bridge, but last time I went to do it, I couldnâ€™t even do that right. I felt sick the whole way there, and once I got on the bridge I felt dizzy and weak, even though Iâ€™m not afraid of heights. I stood there for hours unable to just do it. Iâ€™m a fuck up and I donâ€™t even have the courage to kill myself. Why am I like this? Its torturous being alive with my thoughts. I donâ€™t truly want to die, I want to be alive and happyâ€” but its never going to happen. Why do I feel so much pain from simply trying to live? What is the point of continuing to suffer?  


I wish that someone would save me. Swoop in and patch me up so I could actually look forward to waking up in the morning. I know its impossible though. I was in the hospital recently and they didn't do anything for me. If professionals aren't even able to help me, what the fuck am I hoping for? What do I do? At this point suicide is logical but I'm so scared of actually committing. I'm just going to lay here in bed feeling like shit all night because thats all I can do now. I pray I'll have the courage to jump and escape this hell soon.
