My sister is 14 and suicidal what should I do?The title pretty much explains it all. Iâ€™ll keep this brief but She keeps saying how she wants to experience death and that everything is just so boring. She doesnâ€™t even care if anyone finds her body or not. She keeps looking for ways to die slowly. This pandemic is only making things worse and I want to get her help. Iâ€™ve tried talking to her about it but I chickened out and couldnâ€™t even speak. Iâ€™ve even tried being nicer than usual. Please just give me ways to help her.
