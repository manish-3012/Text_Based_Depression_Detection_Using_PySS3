Whenever I spiral I consciously push people and starve myself?Does anyone else do this?

I feel perfectly sane, but I want to push myself closer to the edge of despair, so is that sanity? 

I have just been sent off on a depressive spiral by not getting a job that would improve my life by a huge amount and I've spent the weekend in bed crying, deleting social messaging apps, staying in my room, and actively not wanting to eat or drink.

I know that doesnt help but it feels comforting in my head to do this??? Like maybe I can drive myself towards suicide?

Maybe I'm comforted that it wont last forever anyway, ill eventually eat, download the apps, leave my room, as well, but i just want to punish myself maybe? 

Im not sure?
