I posted here two weeks agoAnd clearly I made it through that "hurdle" I suppose. I went back to therapy because I should. I told my fiance because I should. I told my sister because I should. But then I self-harmed because it felt good. I went back on a promise I made nearly 5 years ago to never ever self-harm again. I hurt myself and I enjoyed it. I am crying right now. Or rather there are tears streaming down my face and I'm not sure when they started or when they'll stop. I'm definitely not getting past this alone this time. I've been clinically depressed for the past 8 years. I've only ever gone to therapy as treatment. I think taking medicine for this makes me weaker of proves that I'm not enough. I don't have a specific plan for how I'm going to end it which every professional says is good because that means I'm less likely to act on the impulse without a plan. But I didn't need a plan the last time I attempted. I didn't plan on it. I just got too weak to handle it all and snapped. I'm not sure why I'm rambling so much. And I know I can go back and delete all this or at least reformulate it to look better or sound better. But what's the point? Everything is pointless. Well. Except for my knife. But my skin already knew that from earlier. I'm not sure what I want out of this. It's a cry for help I guess but I don't know how others could help. Sorry for the long text vomit. Go help someone else. I don't deserve it anyway.
