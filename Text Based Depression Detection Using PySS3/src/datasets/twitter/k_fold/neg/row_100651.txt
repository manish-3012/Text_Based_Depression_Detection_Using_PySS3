Not knowing where to go from hereI have reached a point in my life where I feel it would be better off if I wasn't around. In the grand scheme of things I don't matter, there seems to be no difference between dying now or dying later. I feel like a screw-up in all aspects of life. I feel guilty that I am wanting to kill myself, since many have it much, much worse. I feel guilty how my death would upset my family and friends. I wish I could talk about it with the people who care about me, but I feel disconnected from everyone. I don't want to upset anyone about talking about my feelings, and I don't want to sound like I'm over complaining, which is why no one thinks anything is wrong. I don't know what I feel anymore, I am just so empty inside. I don't want to go to the hospital or be on medication, because I think that may be even more traumatizing, and I just want to feel connection to other people again. I feel like my existence just bothers other people, and when I ask for help I feel like more of a burden. I just want to feel emotion again and not being so numb.
