Last night I almost killed myself...So if you saw my previous post from the other day Iâ€™ve been planning on killing myself for quite a while. Last night I went to a local national park which backs onto a cliff face. I sat there for a while and was adamant I was going to do it. I told my partner goodbye and a sat on the cliff waiting for the right moment. I was listening to â€œdancing in the moonlightâ€ (one on my trigger songs) and told myself I was going to do it after the song ends. I pulled myself the the edge and looked up at the stars. My partner was freaking out but I knew what I wanted. At this point my phone died and I just kept laying there. After about 5 mins a calmed down and decided that it wasnâ€™t my time. I stayed there for another hour until I decided to drive home. This is when shit hit the fan. I was 5 minutes from home when I phone finally had enough charge to turn on and I had 30+ missed called from my parents and partner. I called my dad and he was crying, asking if I was okay and that the police were looking for me. My partner had called the police and there was police and ambulance en-route to the location I was planning on jumping. I got home and there was police waiting for me. They talked to me and asked if I was okay before taking me to emergency at the local hospital which I was admitted for the night. 
Even though this is an absolutely shit situation, atleast now Iâ€™ll get the help I need.
