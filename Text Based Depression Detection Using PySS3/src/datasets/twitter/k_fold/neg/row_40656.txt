I feel like thereâ€™s a bad ghost inside meIâ€™m 29 and have been living in a realm of my own torment for over 18 years. I was beaten like a man by my father when I was a child, raped by my fatherâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s son when I was 11 and when I tried to leave, nobody listened. All I could do is move away with my mom and go no contact. He stalked me to and from school until I finished. After I forgave him he married a meth smoking barfly that pretty much made him replace me with her new family and pushed me out because I was undeserving of them. I had a music career and let my depression pull me out after working with my dream engineer and shooting a music video at one of my dream locations. I work at a dispensary and somehow got on international news which was edited and I and was mocked on international TV. I have never felt comfortable in life and have always been on the verge of tears and used â€œIâ€™m going to kill myself tonightâ€ as a mantra but canâ€™t bring myself to do it. I feel haunted. I have nightmares. I have no confidence. I have nothing. I feel dead inside. My uncle wants to get me a therapist and pay for it but I feel so scared and like I wonâ€™t make it to see it through. I want to die. I donâ€™t know how to live. I want to die but I donâ€™t want to die. Iâ€™m so confused. I hurt so much.
