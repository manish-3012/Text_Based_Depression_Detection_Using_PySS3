I quit drugs and my life has gotten worse.I was spending 200 to 300 a month on drugs i was getting behind on my bills so i quit buying drugs about a month ago and on shows when they show people quiting drugs they only show the positive effects but thats not it since i have quit drugs i honestly have been more depressed and i don't see anything getting better its actually getting worse i have struggled with depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts for years since i was about 8 or 9 started using drugs at age 12 am 21 now and i just am losing my will to fight any longer 
In the past 24 hours i have lost electricity and my insurance pharmacy couldn't take my coupon and i got shorted on my check and the more bad things that happen the more i just give up and fall deeper into depression i wanna die
