Im broke and exhausted from tryingUnemployment is gone and I have no money anymore. I have applied to almost 1,000 jobs and have heard nothing. I have no money for bills, food, or rent. Iâ€™m living in a nightmare. I want to end my life. How can I possibly get out of this horrible situation with no money? I literally cannot. Our government makes so much fucking money and weâ€™re just left to fucking die. 
Im planning my suicide soon... I just cannot fathom how horrible my life is about to be as a homeless woman at 23 years old. I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™ll have after Im evicted. Fuck this horrible world and this horrible country
Iâ€™ve been on my own struggling and working two jobs since 17 to meet the bare minimum 
Im so exhausted 
Itâ€™s been a never ending game of playing catch up and I donâ€™t want to think about money and struggling anymore. I want to die and not hurt anymore. Iâ€™ve worked so fucking hard and after I lost my first job that paid the most Iâ€™ve ever made (13 an hour) I canâ€™t find anything close to that, or anyone thatâ€™ll even call me. I will work. Iâ€™m so willing to work and work hard but there are no jobs. I will be evicted come January 1st with no place to go, no parents, no family, just homeless with no plans other than suicide. Fuck.
