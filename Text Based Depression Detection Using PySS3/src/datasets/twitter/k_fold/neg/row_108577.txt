This life isn't worth of livingI'm studying my dream job to be. The one and only thing that I've ever felt good doing and that I've ever felt being good at. I love that job and I love doing that. I know that I'm great at that job. Like, *really* good. And I've loved every second of doing that. 

But this anxiety is killing me. I can't go to bed because I can't sleep. I can't get out of bed because of then I would have to do something. Most of the days I just lay on bed, just thinking nothing. I want to get up and do what I love, but I can't get out of my bed. And there I just lay, thinking about how I'm supposed to be at school. Feeling anxious for that. And then just completely giving up and doing nothing. Thinking everything and nothing at the same time.

I've finally found what I want to do, but I can't do it. I can't be at working scene and doing my thing. Also I can't be at home. But that's all I want to do. I wanna sleep when I cannot and I wanna be awake when I'm sleeping 18-20 hours at a day. 

I really don't want to live this kind of life. This is not worth it. 

I've been struggling with this kind of shit for the half of my life. I just wanna go to sleep without feeling anxiety and depression about of waking up. I just wanna go sleep, calmly and peacefully. Knowing that this is going to end.
