80% sure i'll be dead before next year..Where do i even start? Im 22 years old, lived with depression for about 5-6 Years. Lost all my friends due to working over 200+H every month. I know people say you're never alone.. But i am. Recently i celebrated my dad turning 50, and on the party i had a mental breakdown telling him i don't havet the urge to live anymore. He hugged me and said he will help me. That was 4 days ago, still havent heard from him. I've been planning on ways to take my life and found the best way for me. I live in a country that get -10 to -20 degrees in the winter, so im going out with some weed and alcohol to freeze myself.. Cant stand to be alone anymore
