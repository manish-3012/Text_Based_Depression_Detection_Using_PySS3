I feel cheated. I feel fucking cheated, like a fucking joke. There are 3 tall buidings near rwhere I live. It was my chance, no more shit to deal with anymore. I get to each and one of them, and all of them were private residential buildings. I couldnt get it withuot knowing someone from that building. Im beyond fucking pissed. Fuck. I was hopeful i wouldnt have to endure a single fucking day longer, but fuck me I guess
