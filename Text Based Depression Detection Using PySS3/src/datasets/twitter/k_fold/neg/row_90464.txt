Iâ€™m afraid of myselfIâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m passively suicidal. Like I wouldnâ€™t kill myself but if I was drowning I wouldnâ€™t struggle very much. I just want to go to sleep forever and hope things sort themselves out.

And that terrifies me. Why do I feel this way? My life is pretty good at the moment, and I have great supportive parents. Why do I feel like I donâ€™t want to be here?
