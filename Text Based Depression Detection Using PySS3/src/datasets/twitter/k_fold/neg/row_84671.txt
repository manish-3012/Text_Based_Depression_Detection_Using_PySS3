I've been depressed for years and I'm finally reaching a point where I don't know if family can stop me.On Monday night, after my ex-girlfriend told me she'd started dating someone 5 days after we broke up, I made a weak suicide attempt. I climbed on top of the bridge near me that hangs over a train track and sat there for 10 minutes trying to give myself the courage to throw myself over, but two friends drove past before anything happened and talked me down. Since then I've been numb a lot of the time and crying on and off, kinda wishing I just didn't have to exist anymore. I'd hate to leave my Mum on her own because I know it'd devastate her, but I find myself slowly reaching a point where that might not hold me back anymore. I know that things will "get better", I've been through a breakup in the past and while it *sucked* for a long time, I did eventually move on and manage to pull myself together. While I might be getting help by a change in medication and some serious therapy, I just don't know if I feel any desire to actually get better, only for things to get worse again at some point. Sure, life can be alright *sometimes*, but why is the trade off for that intense periods of sadness where I just feel like killing myself? I've barely worked at my job the last year because of my depression and anxiety and I have no desire to work 40 hours a week for 2 days off for years on end until I die or just give up. What's the point in all this? Why bother?? I just feel more and more like walking to that bridge and trying again, but I doubt i have the guts to do it.
