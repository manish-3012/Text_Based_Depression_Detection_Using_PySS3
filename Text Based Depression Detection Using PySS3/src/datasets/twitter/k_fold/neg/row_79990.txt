I'm seriously thinking of killing myselfI'm 15 and of course, I'm in high school. After failing a class my freshman year, I promised my mom I would not get a class that has a grade lower than a B. A month into school, my mom sees a C+ on my grade and a total of 7 missing assignments. Then she starts hurling hurtful words at me. pls help
