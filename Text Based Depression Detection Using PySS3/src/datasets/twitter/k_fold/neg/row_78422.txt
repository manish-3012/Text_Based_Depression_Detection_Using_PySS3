I donâ€™t deserve to live but my child deserves a good father and my wife deserves a good husbandAll I think about is killing myself but I combat it and go to work and try to support my family. My wife will never love me again but we both want our son to have better parents than we had. Do I suffer my whole life until I am pushed over the edge and end it then or do I end it now so he never has to remember me and my wife has time to find a good husband? I genuinely want to die, I canâ€™t make it go away. I can never take back what Iâ€™ve done and my wife will never be able to move on from it. Whatâ€™s the answer here thatâ€™s the best for my son and wife? They donâ€™t deserve to be unhappy or in pain which my death would bring, but my life will bring pain and suffering too and the longer Iâ€™m alive the more pain and suffering I will bring. If I die eventually they will be happy right? Whereas if Iâ€™m alive I donâ€™t think my wife could ever be happy. To me the most logic solution is suicide. What do I do? I canâ€™t talk about what Iâ€™ve done but I can say itâ€™s unforgivable, I will never forgive myself and neither will she.
