(i'm trying to hold on and not do it.) since i get nothing but horrible flashbacks of abuse and how i was left to fend on my own till i'm broken on all aspects.So my parents still deemed everything that they did to me 
overworking me till i'm broken then subjecting me to different levels pain of dealing with their problems an eye opener for me 
when my brothers aren't subjected to such

then there is the 
-"YOU STUDY TOO HARD" 
-"YOU MUST BE HIDING SOMETHING" 
-"YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SEEING A WOMAN" 

clearly the 1st one is true and the 2nd and 3rd aren't 

rather than helping me get back up on my feet,they just left me here slowly rotting away and putting their resources in helping my brothers while using my notes in trying to help them instead.    

they primarily listen to people that secretly dislike me and creates rumors with regards to my behaviors which made things worst 

even though i'm socially awkward and rarely talk to people unless they are real close friends of mine.
