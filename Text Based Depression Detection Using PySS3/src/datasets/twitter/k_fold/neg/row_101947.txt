Figured I'd share my story. (overcoming anorexia/loss/hopelessness)This will be fairly long but it shows what troubles I've had in 16 years of living, and how I eventually made it through, not exactly untarnished. It probably does not contain all of what happened to me, dues to me not remembering it all. But some of the things mentioned inside invoked strong emotions and memories I had not realized I had remembered, not all joyous I must admit. Perhaps my-not-so little story will only entertain you, but be assured all of this did happen, and non of it is sensationalised.

The uttermost basic start of my troubles began in Primary School (I'm British) when I was around 9 years old, I had friends and of course I got teased a bit, long blond hair, blue eyes, supposedly looked quite feminine for a boy. No problem at all really, just name-calling and the like. At this time My parents had problems, split up, I continued to live with my sister and mother, dad moved away, remained in contact with him though.  

Around age 11/12 in England you have to move into another school known as "secondary school". The secondary school I got into overwhelmed me, at least 10x students all bigger than me. I did well with my grades and everything, but I was separated from my old mates and continued to be the recipient of name-calling, only this time I felt threatened cause all the people saying it were bigger and liked to gang-up and surround me, not very pleasant at all.


Eventually it all made me depressed and hate the very thought of attending school, just months into being there. My mother knew something was wrong, cue us going to the staff at school and being asked to point out the bullies, I didn't know who they were so nothing much could be done. I was still really depressed and literally afraid of entering the school gates, so I just gave up and dropped out of it just a few months in, having made few friends. My mother thought she'd try her hand at tutoring me herself at home.


Cue months of her simply trying her hand at bringing me out of my shell and my sister saying I'm ruining my life by dropping out and doing fuck all.  What tended to happen each day at this time was that I'd wake up at 10am, mum would try teaching me Geography or something like that, and I would do it, quite easily, but I had no motivation at all. Eventually due to all this time I spend not bothering to do work and not bothering to go out and see my old mates because I felt like they abandoned me at school so I developed an undeserving hatred towards them, all ended up with me becoming *afraid* to go out, even to the corner shop.


Only good thing that happened was that I started reading **a lot**, I would go through numerous books in a day, sleep for 18 hours then repeat. My mother was chuffed that I had started so she bought me books about subjects for example Geography, hoping I could retain what knowledge I read inside them. If only she knew that I was reading because it took me outside of my pathetic life, putting me into a fantasy world, living imaginary lives. I had **zero** friends at this point, was still afraid of any human contact, seeing my dad less and less - this carried on for about two years filled with utter loneliness and self-loathing.


I should mention that my mother was ill, both mentally (schizophrenic) and physically she was very weak, having to take tablets daily to avoid hospitalisation. Sometimes my mother would "switch off" and I would stay up all night talking to her whilst she talked about herself in the third person, very strange experience. Eventually she would come out of it and thank me for listening. This sort of stuff is kind of where I realized that 'grown-ups' are as human as you or I, and have their own problems to deal with.


Also, I used to think that I was mad, I knew not how I was different - I just felt it, I used to think of scenarios where I would hurt me, my mother/sister :(  I don't know why, I was simply detached from reality (too much reading fiction?) I mentioned this to my mother, I broke down in a bus station of all places telling her I thought often that I was the piece that doesn't fit in the jigsaw of the world, though not in those particular words. We got home, we talk more about it and she says all the bad things that have happened in her life and I realize that my mother, whatever her faults and failings in life, and she'd had a tough one, was the greatest and bravest person I'd ever known, and understood me better than anyone else.


Unfortunately this didn't stop me from having a shit life, I didn't miraculously take a turn for the better, rather for the worse. I don't know when I first started thinking this shit life could come to an end if I just cut my legs, arms, throat - or perhaps wrapped cord around my neck (was into self-asphyxiation for a while) though I believe I always knew it was an option.


Eventually I reached the point of no return, I wanted to kill myself, but I felt obligated to care for my mother, so I for some reason thought that she my **own mother** was an obstacle between myself and peace (death), so I got a knife, went downstairs at around 4am, my mother was asleep on the couch, I just stood there thinking about what I was going to do. Then stopped myself literally seconds before killing the person who brought me into this world and who I then understood cared and sacrificed so much for me, I would not kill my mother, I decided, sickened by the very thought of it in the first place, much less nearly gone through with it.


I went back to bed, thought some more, then decided that I didn't want to kill myself, though I came close on many occasions, holding a knife to my throat and pressing just to find out what level of resistance my skin gave :/ I knew killing myself would utterly destroy my mother, as she had lost a son before me. I decided to run away.


I got all the things I thought I would need, including knives and some extra clothes, I put the knife in my pocket and then subconsciously reached my hand in later, cue me slicing open my hand then having to hold the skin together, I for some reason though about making a note on my wall in my blood so I just wrote "Sorry mum, it's not you it's me" or as close as I could as the wound wasn't bleeding so much anymore. Then whilst walking quietly downstairs so as to wake my mum I wipe my bloody hand all over the walls to make her think that I was badly injured (there was a lot of blood), got the first aid kit and put a few plasters on, didn't work so I gaffa taped the wound shut instead. I then "borrowed" my mothers debit card, got my stuff and looked at my mother for what I thought would be the last time. I jumped out of my window onto the top of the carport we have, then jumped from there to the ground, I injured myself -.- (you fall much quicker than you think you do) limping, I carried on walking. I figured I'd walk to the coast and try and get a job as a 14yr old fisherman working on the ocean, how childish.


I walked aimlessly from around 12 til 3am and had taken out Â£250 from my mothers account. On a fairly quiet road I stopped and sat in a shaded spot, I noticed a cyclist moving slowly towards me and got out my knife, figured I'd cut him, take his bike and his money, then  cycle to the coast. I approached the cyclist and he just looked in my position and nodded, I figured he's a good bloke so I should let him live.


Basically, I forget what happened after that,  I saw few other people, I walked back home. I got back at around 6am, thinking that there would be police at the house, with my distraught mother describing what I looked like or something. There was no Police there - she hadn't woken up yet, and I had left my window open, which could be reached from the ground. I managed to get back into my room and I put the money back into my mothers purse, washed up all the bloody walls, and went to bed, not 15 minutes later I heard my mother get up, I went down and said I couldn't sleep, she made me beans on toast I seem to remember, I loved her all the more for that small act at that moment.


I'm not sure about the events that followed, but my sister brought me back into the world. She got me to join a cadet organisation that allowed me to interact with people my age for the first time in years. I was a very quiet and awkward person of course at the start, but I eventually became more confident. I made friends and had things to get up for in the morning, rather than waking up whenever and just looking forward to sniping on Modern Warfare 2 or something like that.

This was not the end of my depression but it just gave me direction in life, I still had no qualifications at a time when all of my old friends were leaving the school I so hated. I did well in the organisation and my life revolved around it, it made me a very disciplined, organised person, which made me notice how disorganized my house all was, it disgusted me but I did nothing as my mother preferred it. This was all not really the end of my problem as new ones arose. 


About 18 months ago my grandfather died, followed shortly by my grandmother, I was close to both but it didn't affect me strongly, I just took it on the chin. My mother was devastated, she started smoking, stopped eating and got very, very weak. I was pretty much a carer for her, she was a shadow of what she once was, she was very thin, and weighed nothing.

So, after a few months of this she starts getting better, but is not the same at all, still a bit of a daft character. Around 8 months ago, I went on holiday with my sister (been a few times together already by this point) we were both worried about our mother though, she was still weak but we took precautions, buying her food she could easily cook. On holiday we had a fab time, spoke to mum on the phone a couple days before we got the plane home.


So, departure day, we fly home, separate when we get back to my home town, I go back to my house where I lived alone with mother, go inside the house and hear no response. She'd died, alone, behind the kitchen door, I was the one to find her. Had to phone my sister and tell her, the worst phone call I've ever had to make. *Remember this was the first time I'd seen my mother in a couple weeks, I was looking forward to telling her all about the holiday, which made it all the worse :(

I can't really describe what I felt, if you've read this much already you'll know that she was more than a mother to me, she was a tutor, best friend, and therapist, we helped each other through our lives. It *destroyed* me. I am not the same person that went into the house before I found her. I pretty much died with her. It was an unknown cause of death, from what I know of it. On that day I broke down three separate times, but not once in front of another person, I had to be a rock for my family, and have been since.


Fast forward past the funeral where I wore my organisations uniform, my dad moved back into the house, my dad got me into college even though I had no prior education for 4 - 5 years, I just impressed in the interviews. I'm seen somewhat as an oddity in college, though they think I'm intelligent due to the way I speak and my maturity, though I'm guessing my experiences have matured me.


Here and now I'm glad I'm in college, I had no true direction in life until I joined it, but it came at quite a price :(

So if you've stuck with the story so far, I thank you. Hopefully I made those that consider suicide, consider the devastating effects they can have on those around you.

Granted not all of the people who are considering suicide can relate to my experience, but overcoming things like this is the greatest feeling ever. One thing I forgot to put into the main text was my minor fight with anorexia, I plummeted in weight when I started reading a lot, due to me not eating. Eventually I got over the fact that having a six-pack and no stomach fat is not the be all and end all of looking good. About 3 months before my mother died I had started going to a gym, the results now after 11 months are quite astounding, I'm still skinny as hell, but you can't count each rib coming out of my sternum anymore, I feel *good* about myself and how I look, which is enough to be content with I think, I suppose I'm slightly muscular now, in a couple years time I think I'll look like what I think to be ideal.

I didn't completely escape harm, I've got some sort of trauma-induced sociopath tendencies, of course that's a self-diagnosis but I still feel detached from reality, though less so than before.

And all of this from a 16 year old male supposedly just entering the real world :/

That was longer than I intended, I will go to sleep now, writing this brought back too many memories, most of which I had repressed for good reason.
