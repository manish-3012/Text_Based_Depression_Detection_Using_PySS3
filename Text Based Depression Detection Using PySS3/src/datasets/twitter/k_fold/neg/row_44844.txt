Can anybody help me?Its 2AM while im writing this, been contemplating suicide every night now. BTW im 14. Don't fucking judge me. I would either do it by hanging, or put my neck on some traintracks (decapitation). I have attempted before but they were pitiful head in a bag attempts. I dont have access to guns. I have friends and family, but I feel extremely isolated. I also found out i might be bi or gay, in the middle of my depression. The fact that I feel this way during summer, isnt a good sign for when school is back. I got high last night. Ive been drinking more often. I don't wanna die, but, I dont know if I can live. I wanna feel better, but I dont wanna go back to school EVER again. Being around people phisically drains me, especially family. Im fucked.
