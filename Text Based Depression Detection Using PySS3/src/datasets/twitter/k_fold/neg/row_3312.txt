I just donâ€™t have anyone else to say this to.Iâ€™m not going to kill myself. I wonâ€™t. Iâ€™m a proud cat mom of 5, and as stupid as that is they are the best thing I got going on in my life. My fur babes are the best at (slightly) unconditional love, I believe Iâ€™m ranked slightly below Friskies meaty bits but Iâ€™ll take that. 

My entire life Iâ€™ve struggled. I donâ€™t even know why. Itâ€™s just difficult to exist. Iâ€™m 33 years old and spent a majority of my life looking forward to the next â€œthingâ€ which was usually some sort of job advancement or travel. But Iâ€™ve done that. Both. And now Iâ€™m at home, unemployed, and desperately trying to fill my days.

I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. Literally. Iâ€™ve been drinking, just to pass the time. Iâ€™ve tried cleaning. Elder Scrolls. I have no motivation. There is nothing I want to do. I donâ€™t have any hobbies. I donâ€™t have any goals. I am wasting space.

Is this depression? I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™ve always felt this way deep down and somehow managed to go on living. I just feel there isnâ€™t a place for me. I just donâ€™t belong here. I just wanna go away.

But, you know, cats.
