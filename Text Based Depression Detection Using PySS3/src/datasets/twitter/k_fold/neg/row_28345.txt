I can't cope anymoreEverythings getting out of control, my anti depressants are doing Jack shit, the people i love and care aren't their when i need them, my nans alzheimer's is getting worse and i'm tortured by the sight of people living their perfectly happy fucking lives. why am i still breathing, i want to die, i want this pain to fucking stop. The more i live the worse this pain gets. I need help and fast!!! my country's health system has gone to the fucking dogs. all this fucking waiting just to see someone for an hour, when i could have taken a blade to my skin and bled to death quicker. Please i need someone, Anyone.
