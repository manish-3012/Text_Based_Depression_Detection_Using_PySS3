The only person who can make me better is myself and I canâ€™t do thatTLDR: only I can make myself happy again and I know for a fact Iâ€™ll never do that, Iâ€™m hopeless

â€”â€”â€”

Iâ€™m only making myself feel worse because I have so many things to do and Iâ€™m not doing any of them because Iâ€™m lazy and want to lie in bed all day. Then the stress of it all just builds up and the stress paralyzes me into inaction even more and then more stress piles up and so on

Iâ€™m digging myself a hole, Iâ€™m making myself worse off and ruining my own life

And at the end of the day itâ€™s up to me to fix myself. Itâ€™s up to me to get things done and to get my life in order, to make myself happy again

But I know for a fact I canâ€™t do that. Iâ€™m too lazy, too tired, canâ€™t focus on anything or anyone other than myself. Iâ€™m pathetic 

Iâ€™ll never be able to find the will to fix myself so why am I even still here? Just to stay miserable until I inevitably kill myself down the road because Iâ€™m incapable of helping myself

Nothing will ever be able to fix me. Itâ€™s all up to me. Itâ€™s up to me and thatâ€™s scary because Iâ€™ll never be able to help myself. I canâ€™t, I know for a fact I canâ€™t and I wonâ€™t 

Iâ€™m wasting so many peoples time by reaching out because I donâ€™t believe a single kind word they say and donâ€™t follow any of their advice because Iâ€™m too lazy to try

It was over for me before it even started
