Fuck this noiseThe last 12 months have been shit. I've been to hospital for physical Illness, I don't find joy in any part of my life, my girlfriend of 5 years left me because she couldn't handle my garbage personality, I've been diagnosed with Bipolar2 which is basically a big sign on my forehead which says 'do not love this person, they are too much effort', My roommate killed herself (most likely because my depressive bullshit got to her), leaving me to pay her side of the rent and I've been fucked working my boring job for money that gets siphoned directly into this house that is only a reminder of how fucking alone I am right now. 

I know everyone says that the pain will fade and I'll build myself back up from this but honestly it hurts too much and I have no idea how to get better. I'm seeing therapist after therapist and nothing is improving. I just want to fucking die, everything is too hard. I have nothing to live for and I spend each and every night crying. There is no hope on the horizon and I want to die SO FUCKING BAD
