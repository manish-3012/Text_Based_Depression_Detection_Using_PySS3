There is that demon inside me that is just waiting for my signal to push me down the bridge...I cannot hold it much longer. I am about to call a cop. Wait for him with a crowbar, beat him, take his gun and shoot my brain out. My purpose in this existence is just gone, and i was already in a massive downfall. I have no support anymore. No one to count on. I am always alone in school and evreywhere. I don't want to go to school and start crying seeing all the others having great disscusion until they see me cry and they will ask what is wrong. There is no way out of this.
I am maybe 17.
I am maybe a guy
but i can cry the fuck out like a pussy, i've always been cowardly minded like this.
It's about to exceed for me. Growing pain. Each night if i sleep i cry. i dont want to drop tears of pain anymore. Sick and fucking tired.
