Some poetryâ€œI know I am rusted metal scraping against sidewalks of forgotten cities.
An unheard grown of a freezing pipe in a condemned building, I know, I know. Believe me, I know.
I know my words vaporize and lose all meaning as they evacuate my mouth. I know that all the years spent, all the miles traveled, all the sleep lostâ€“just time wasted. Time wasted! Like leaving a lamp burning in a room youâ€™re not using. A waste. What a horrible thing, time wasted.
All the ravages of futility. Inspirations annihilating backhand.
At the end of the trail, to find the pockets heavy with foolâ€™s gold, the ribs cracked from the last cheap shot and the heavy helplessly emptyâ€¦ What a waste. And even though this is the cheaply woven fabric of my life, even though I am the hand that knocks unwelcome and uninvited on doors of empty houses, the cultivator of insufferable misery on hot endless nights of paranoia. Ceaselessly unendurable and obsessive repetition. 
A life nailed to the ground by dulled cowardice and uninventive thought.

In spite of all of that, there was a time when Iâ€¦ When I thought something more than all of this was in my grasp.  There was a time when I could feel the ground underneath my feet and I walked forward into time instead of standing still, stranded in the semi darkness with skewed memories of the past to keep me. I donâ€™t remember when I pulled back. I donâ€™t remember when I called it a day. I donâ€™t remember when I slipped underneath the surface of life and ended up here. I donâ€™t remember. I donâ€™t know.â€
