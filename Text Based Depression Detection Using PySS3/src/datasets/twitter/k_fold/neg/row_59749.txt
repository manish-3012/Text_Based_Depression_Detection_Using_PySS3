Feel alone and abandonedI constantly feel alone and unloved by everyone. None of my friends reach out to me. My parents ignore me as though i were invisible. None of my coworkers enjoy being around me. My girlfriend always finds half assed excuses to avoid me and gets angry at me whenever i start to voice that im feeling depressed or suicidal. 
For the past two or three weeks ive been constantly self-harming and contemplating suicide and i just really want to die now. I really cant see a point in going on anymore when all anybody ever does is avoid me.
