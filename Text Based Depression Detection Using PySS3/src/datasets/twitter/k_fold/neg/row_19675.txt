just feels more final putting it on the internetthis is the first time i'm not really having second thoughts

my best friend gave up on me

they don't care anymore 

i can't feel anything 

i'm heartbroken and miserable and i thought i was a whole lot more important than they think i am 

i have everything i need in front of me on the bed 

if i wake up in the morning, i'll check in with you guys 

but i hope i don't 

it's my turn to be selfish. i deserve it at this point. 

captcha is KBETOK

k, i bet it's not ok. but thank you 

EDIT: sup. i woke up. i'll figure it out later. roommate won't be here tonight so i'll feel a lot safer.
