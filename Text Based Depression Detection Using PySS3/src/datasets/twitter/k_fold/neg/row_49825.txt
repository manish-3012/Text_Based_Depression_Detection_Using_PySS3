Got asked questions about my suicidal tendancies by a new clinic and its made me uncomfortable.Going through some huge changes at the minute including moving out my parents house. I signed up for a new mental health counsellor then got an urgant call back in response to the severity of my desire to kill myself. Ive been pretfy good recently and i think when i move out my life will start picking up again but just saying out loud my thoughts on killing myself and being reminded how uncommon(?) &amp; intense those thoughts are. I do find some days unbearable but im doing my best to love myself and not be full of self hatred.
