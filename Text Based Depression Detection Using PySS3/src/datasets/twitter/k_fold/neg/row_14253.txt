helloI'm really bored of life. I'll be 16 in a couple months, and by that point I'll have been out of school for 2 years. all I do all day is sleep and play video games, I have no job, no talents, and no real friends. Everything is just kind of boring, I don't particularly like doing anything and I treat the games that i play as an obligation of sorts instead of a fun pastime. Lately I've lost motivation to do anything at all though, so I might try and kill myself if i dont start feeling better soon
