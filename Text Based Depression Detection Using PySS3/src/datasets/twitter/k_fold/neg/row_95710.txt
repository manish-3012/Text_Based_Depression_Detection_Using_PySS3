iâ€™m really worried about my ex boyfriends state of mind and iâ€™m terrified heâ€™s going to consider suicidei donâ€™t want to get too into it but essentially we broke up a few months ago, not his fault i just need to be alone and work on my own shit, and he seemed to be as okay as you can be after a breakup. we were friends before and have remained friends now, thereâ€™s no hard or bitter feelings. we lived together but obviously iâ€™ve moved out and now heâ€™s got (formerly) our apartment and is living there alone. 

the past week itâ€™s taken a huge turn and heâ€™s been saying really worrying things. how he doesnâ€™t want to be here, nothing works out for him, whatâ€™s the point in his existence and no one would care if he wasnâ€™t here. i did my best to remind him none of that is true and he is loved even if his brain convinces him otherwise. 

heâ€™s been barely speaking to me for days and when he does itâ€™s 1 word answers and heâ€™s been off work. iâ€™m terrified because he lives alone if he does something no one will be there to check on him and iâ€™m considering talking to his friends (he would kill me if he thought i was interfering but iâ€™m terrified heâ€™s going to do something) 

has anyone had any experience with this? iâ€™m so scared and i have no experience with anything like this at all
