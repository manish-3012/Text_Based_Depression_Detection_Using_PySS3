Everything is caving inSchool is going downhill. I lost my girlfriend. I did bad in all of my classes. I'm moving into an apartment that I was supposed to move in with my girlfriend. I don't want to do that. I'm ruining my life as the days go by. I don't know how to pick up the pieces and be the person I was 2 years ago. I was so happy. I was doing well In school. I can't find any way to make it. I don't see any option to make my life worth living. I can't do anything anymore. My life used to be perfect. I was on my way to make a difference and now all I do is fuck stuff up. I can no longer deal with all the stresses of what my life has given me. I can no longer find a way to live and for the first time I see suicide as the right answer.
