Life isn't getting any better so I'm going to kill myself.Constant frustration with my quality of life over the past 20 years. I'm unable to pursue any of my dreams due to my learning disability. I can spend and have years study the things I'm interested in only to not be able to remember or only understand a fraction of what I've wasted so much time trying to learn. I fail at all job interviews and I'm homeless. I just come to the library because I can't take on any more debt for school. Wouldn't matter because I've failed ever class I've ever taken in college. I'm just smart enough to want some kind of challenge but not smart enough to put myself in a position to have a challenge. The same problems everyday my entire adult life. I've asked for help, I spend all my money on trying to better myself. All I'll ever do is be in a place where I'll be abused and not appreciated for whatever the law tells them is the bare minimum they can pay me. I will never have any thing I want in life. I will never do anything to make my dead parents proud. I will work part time and remain homeless because I wasn't lucky enough to be born normal. I just hoped that there would be some kind of relief from this way of life with a better career. Not anything too crazy, just a roof over my head and something to do during the day to keep me busy and mentally stimulated. I can't even volunteer, I always screw it up to the point they tell me to leave. My mental disability picks my pockets everyday. Killing myself is the only way to end the cycle of depression and abuse.
