My rights are gone now basically thanks to fucking trump and amy-who-gives-a-shit. Why should I go on?I'm gonna lose any protections I have as a lesbian. My partner is on state health insurance and they vote to gut the affordable care act on nov 10. I'm on my moms and ACA protected that too since im an adult. I'm chronically ill. I'll die anyway. I'll have another close call with an ovarian torsion bc I'm off my estrogen keeping the cysts at bay and I'll just fucking die. Bye bye estrogen! 

Why should I keep going? My life is going to suck and I'm literally gonna have to wait so long my dad will be fucking dead before I can be treated like a fucking human being again. I can't do this shit. I'm so fucking sad. I feel myself being torn apart from the inside out. I can't stop scrolling through social media and imagining my partner fucking dying in the hospital from covid because the ACA was gutted. 

Why should I go on? What the fuck do I have to live for?
