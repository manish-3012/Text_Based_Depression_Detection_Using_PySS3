18M, fleeting hope.I feel fake. I feel like I'm faking everything. It seems as if people who are really depressed are depressed at all times. They're actually struggling and it feels like I'm pretending. I've been thinking about suicide for a while, ever since the 7th grade. I feel like I can't talk to people about it without feeling like some loser. I can't talk to my friends about it because I feel like I can't trust them. I don't know if it's their fault or mine.

I used to try to talk about my feelings a lot with people, hoping they'd give me some good advice but I soon stopped when I realized no one really cares. It's like I'm talking to walls whenever I try to speak out on how I feel. When my friends are having heart to heart conversations I exclude myself from them because they won't want to hear about how I feel.

Reasons against killing myself is the financial burden on my mom and I don't want her to deal with another one of her children dying. My sister died of leukemia last year, she was about 8 years old. She was my mom's favorite; I've never had a close relationship to anyone in my family. Another reason is pain. 

I feel alone a lot. Even as I'm typing this I feel like I'm whining about something that I shouldn't even be whining about. I feel like I shouldn't even be depressed because other people suffer more than me. 

I feel like I'm not worthy of love. I feel repulsive. I believe I repel everyone who tries to speak to me. I hate my looks, my voice, the way I walk, how I can't hold a conversation, I hate that I don't trust anybody or that I feel like everyone is out to make my life worse. I hate the thought of growing up.

It feels like I've destroyed everything in my life, that my state of mind is permanently corrupted. It feels like I can never be happy.
