AAAAMy life keeps fucking itself up for me.
I keep missing social cues at school and because of that I just can't make any friends.

My only 2 friends are no longer talking to me and that kills me inside. I don't even remember what I did, let alone anything at school.

I can't transition due to age, and my mom doesn't give a shit about me. 
"You look cute!" She says, as she destroys everything about me and my feelings.
Dad is the angry bitchy dad stereotype
My grades are low and i cant do math for shit

Im fucking ruined and i want to die.
