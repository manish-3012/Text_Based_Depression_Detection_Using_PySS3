Do bad people ever get what they deserve?Iâ€™m not talking about criminals, but more like those people in all of our lives that cause damage and pain. I found out an old highschool bully inherited 3 million USD from a relative she didnâ€™t even know 
Similarly so, thereâ€™s so many stories of bullies Iâ€™ve been told and harassers/rapists getting off scottfree, finding love in relationships, getting married, having a family
Meanwhile the bullying victims seem to struggle with relationships with people in general, this struggle probably stemming from bullying 
Iâ€™m trying not to be spiteful but I canâ€™t help but be envious of this girl who has never worked a day in her life, barely graduated highschool, comes from wealth and a well functioning family, already has more money that I will probably ever see in my entire life 
Where I worked my ass off in highschool to try and get into a good college, despite the bullying, broken home life, sexual harassment, and suicide attempts
