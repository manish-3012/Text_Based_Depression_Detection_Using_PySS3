Was it the right choice?Background: My country offers a mainstream high school program that leads directly to university and an alternative program that is supposed to lead straight into the workforce. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently doing the mainstream program, wanting to switch into the alternative program because of a lot of personal reasons that i don't want to go over. But basically im stuck in a loop where i get work but then think that its irrelevant and decide not to do it but then get stressed as the work piles up. 

&amp;#x200B;

To avoid this i've decided i want to switch into the alternative program. I've wanted to do this since last year, i spoke with my parents last year but they lectured me for hours and convinced me to stick with the mainstream program because its "only a few more years". 

&amp;#x200B;

So i tried, i did all the work i was set, i got decent to good grades (depending on the subject) for the first few months. But now all of the problems i had last year have hit again. I just feel the work is really mundane and that it won't help me in the future at all. Yeah, it is only a few years and yeah, if i successfully complete it then it'll all be good, but the only thing i see down that path for me is suicide. There's a lot of work that im not willing to do. And eventually it will get to a point where i try to kill myself, i mean i've already thought about doing it hundreds of times throughout the last few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

If i go with the alternative program, there is still a path to university, it'll take exactly the same time to reach university as if i had gone with the mainstream program and as far as i know its actually a guaranteed entry which the mainstream program doesn't have as if you get too low of a score for exams you might not be able to get into the course. 

&amp;#x200B;

It would take a lot more money though. I would say my families pretty well off and that they should be able to cover the cost easily. But i've learnt from reading reddit posts that parents can hide the fact that they do not have a lot of money extremely well. 

&amp;#x200B;

But anyway, the main thing is that im just getting a lot of doubt now. Like maybe i should do the mainstream program as it is a lot more simpler. Did i really choose the right choice?
