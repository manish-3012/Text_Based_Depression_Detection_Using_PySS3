People suck and life sucks so imma ghostI guess you could say this is (hopefully) a final goodbye. I'm going to write a formal one on a different website for my internet friends over on Instagram so they won't be upset when I stop responding to them. 

Basically, as the title says, people, mostly my nmom, and life, mainly being born into an ugly family situation, sucks, and I thought I could live with it, but I can't anymore. I planned to go last weekend but found some kind of desire to live and motivation to do my homework blah blah blah so I didn't. Tomorrow, imma have to go do the same hard labor that's been making me want to kill myself for the past 7 years or so and I just can't do it anymore. I don't want to. I'm so close to the end of senior year, the moment when I can move out of this godforsaken household, yet I don't want to continue. I'm exhausted both physically and mentally and my nmom is too selfish to care. I'm going to miss a lot of people and a lot of things, but from what I've heard, the afterlife sounds super amazing, so I think it'll be worth it.

Thanks to those of you who despite your anonymity, still behave humanely towards your fellow humans online. Thank you to those of who have been there for me before, despite me posting very little on this sub. A big thank you to those who are here daily helping out others so they don't make the same decision that I and others see as best. Thank you all and I wish you all a safe and happy life. 

Peace out yo &lt;3
