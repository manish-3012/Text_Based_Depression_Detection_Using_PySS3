Just, fuck man.My family is fucking terrible. We're all at eachothers throats or leeching for money, I'm stuck here with a grandfather who has to make it KNOWN he's a tough guy, not someone to be fucked with. If that means grabbing me by the throat and slamming me against a wall during a very mild argument, so be it. My grandmother is just. She's hell on earth. I've never met someone so evil and so fucking twisted in my life. Her excuse is that she was neglected and abused as a child and whatnot, but I really don't think that's an excuse to torture me. So I'm 16 years old. 302 lbs because I never leave my room, and constantly at the verge of losing my shit and splattering my brains all over the place for my dear old grandmother to clean up through clenched teeth because the wood's stained. It all started when I was 9 and just kinda got worse from there. Maybe they can't stand seeing me grow up, who knows? But now I've grown into a very similar beast, I treat my brother like shit and I really don't mean to, but y'know. Kids are kids, he's 9 and annoying, but instead of some little annoyance, the whole "ahhh fuck off", I'm just really fucking angry, like to the point where you forget the boy's a boy, and I explode. I used to hurt him when he was younger, I still get a bit physical now but I've been able to get a hold of that, but I'm still a prick. And maybe this is what my grandparents are like, if just being alive or breathing oxygen was an annoying thing to do. I just feel so lost already, like I've got nowhere to go, and I'm pretty damn sure I'm gonna grow up to be just like them, since this is all I know. I don't want to become a monster.
