No work == No hopeFour years. Four years of looking for work, and nothing but this: call center work. They take *anybody* who can speak without dribbling on themselves.

I have a master's degree, for christ's sake. I double-majored in college and still graduated in 3 1/2 years-- it took most of my friends 5 years just to get ONE degree. I have office experience, teaching experience, research experience, even *fundraising* experience, and *nobody* calls back. Over 1100 job applications and now, finally, I am offered an *interview*...at a *call center*.

Praise rings hollow to me, now. Everyone says I'm smart and funny but it doesn't matter, does it, because I'm also useless. Nobody wants me to work for them and because of that, I can't provide any kind of life for myself or my girlfriend...especially with the diabetes.

I know how I'm going to do it. It will be easy because, as an Eagle Scout who actually paid attention during Emergency Preparedness merit badge, I know how they'll look, and for how long. 

But if I just wander into the forest outside of the city--because they'll assume I was in the city, of course, probably murdered by a minority, they'll assume, because the cops are morons-- I'll be an interesting cold case file for some forensic investigator sometime in the future when a logging company's bulldozer runs over my skull.

It'll be fine.

It'll all be fine.

Monday, right?
