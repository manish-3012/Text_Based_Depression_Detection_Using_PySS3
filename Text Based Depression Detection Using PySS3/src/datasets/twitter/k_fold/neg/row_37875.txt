Depression winsI can't do this life anymore. I'm old and done. I've tried I really have. I have no job, no future but poverty and misery. I have no university education , so all I can get is menial bad paying jobs that treat you like shit. I can't upgrade. I'm asperger's so I suck at social stufff. I can hardly leave my place most days. How can I work? I'm ending it soon. I'm not looking for help, I've tried there is no help for me. I'm going to take every pill that I have hidden away. no coming back, this time. I will tell no one. And I will succeed where I failed before people found out. Can't help me if you don't know, lol.
