First post w/o throwawayHi ! I just wanted to (re)introduce myself, but not under some form of pseudonym or anonymity.

My name is Tommy, 29 years old and from Norway.

I've been suffering(or dealing with ?) Depression for as long as i can remember. To me, Death is the active culprit.

My earliest memory revolving this depression, happend around the age of 10, which is when i experienced death for the first time. It wasn't anything radical that happend in the sense that i witnessed a murder - simply that my great grandmother passed away, naturally and without pain, at the age of... heck, i don't even know. Come to think of it, i don't think i've ever gone down this memory far enough to get to this point before, but let's for the sake of this say that she was over the age of 90, it was her time to go.

But even if it was her time to go, it struck me, it hit me so hard knowing that at the blink of an eye, someone can be gone - poof - out of my life. Not being able to talk to them, tell them how my day was or ask them about theirs. And so, i started what i like to call my "depressional Black Hole" - actually, this is the first time im calling it that, but let's go with it.

I fueled the Black Hole with so much of my emotions, i kept enabling it to take more of me, more of my soul, more of my mind. 

One vivid memory, that i believe is what started fueling it, was right after i had gotten the news about her passing. My mother was about to get in the car to drive over to my great-grandmothers house, and i snuck into the trunk of the car. I figured, if this is the last time my mother is going to live, i want to die with her - she found out once she arrived at the house.

I dropped out of school in the 6th grade (well, unofficially) not only cause of me having problems dealing with death, but dealing with bullies aswell. You see, i wasn't the smallest 'o child - so, let's throw that into my Black Hole of Depression aswell.

I remember my mother, my great wonderful mother, she did everything she could to help me - she got me to see therapists and councellors alike, but i could not get my head right.

Now that we've covered the "how it started" - i want to focus on the present.

I have plenty of things going on in the present that i want to talk about, things that got me crying from dusk-till-dawn - but i dont want to focus on that in this post. I want to focus on what i've managed to accomplish.

I've met a girl - well, re-met a girl - she and I actually went to school together all those years ago, and she's just as lovely as i remember her back then. She's had her struggles, some of which she's still dealing with - but i'm trying to be there for her, as much as she's there for me. I can honestly say if you askes me 2 years ago, wether or not i'd be sitting on her couch today writing this post, i would not believe you for one second.

Meeting her and finding that someone is actually capable of loving me, has triggered me to start loving myself aswell.  3 years ago, i weighed 154.7kg (341lbs) - today, i weigh in at 120kg(264lbs) - and being roughly 193cm(roughly 6ft4) i'm feeling better and better about myself every passing day!


I've never really tried to hide(to those i trust) what my brain is up to, what my thaught-patterns are like or anything like that - however - online, it's a whole different story. 

In person, someone can look you in the eyes, and truly engage in the conversation. They can feel what you feel, they know what you're telling them is real and not some form of attention-seeking effort. 

Anyway, to hell with all that. If we're supposed to help eachother, and be there for eachother(atleast for me) - i need to get rid of my mask, my anonymity-mask.
