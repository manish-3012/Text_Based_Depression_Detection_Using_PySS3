Alone and trying to bury my pain in alcohol.(Sorry if itâ€™s hard to read, Iâ€™m a bit drunk) I live in a country that I wasnâ€™t born in.. i have lived here for the past 3 years and there were ups and downs but now, i have no one, no one who i could laugh with, who I could eat a Christmas dinner with. There is no one for me, no one fucking cares about me and if i would kill myself with pushing it too far with the alcohol then no one would fucking care. God Iâ€™m so tired of this bullshit.. no it doesnâ€™t get better, it just gets worse and worse and worse until i will give up and slit my throat in the middle of one of my self harm sessions.. i just want to have someone.. and for that someone to have me..
