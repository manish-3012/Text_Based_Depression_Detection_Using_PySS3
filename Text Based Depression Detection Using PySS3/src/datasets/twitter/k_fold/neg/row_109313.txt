WorthlessWhen people say "just keep going, itll get better, I appreciate you." It all feels hollow. Like how you could hug someone, but not really hug someone. Its words for people to get something off their conscious, to get the idea of someone wanting to not exist off their head. Maybe not, but still. When theres no point, there's no point. The idea is that whether or not you're here doesn't make a difference- always made me feel at peace. Knowing that my existence doesnt change anything, and that if I didnt exist, or stopped existing, the world would keep spinning, and the world would have one weight lifted off its shoulders. One weight that understands and accepts the futility of it all, the uselessness of thinking, and the meaninglessness of their own life. Understanding that, they arent special, that they can never do anything worthwhile for others to appreciate or enjoy, and that they can never get better, because they're stuck. When they realize that, they're stuck in a limbo between life and death. And it's only a matter of time, before they sink further into that limbo, eventually reaching the other side, a darker and lifeless side. I hate myself, but theirs no point in hating myself, it's already been established that I'm a weakling, a worthless pile of shit, something that's better off not existing. A detriment to the world.
So why cant I just let myself go already.
Slipping into non existence as the fridged aether touches my soul. Why is it so hard to let go of my pointless life.
