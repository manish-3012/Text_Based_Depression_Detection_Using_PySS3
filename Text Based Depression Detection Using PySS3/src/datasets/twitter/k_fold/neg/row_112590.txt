My email to MarkiplierThe title may seem weird, but hear me out. I've been suicidal since I was 10 (now 17). I have had a recent surge in these thoughts after having escaped them for a year or two. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a few weeks now, and I watched the two most depressing markiplier videos that exist. I haven't ever watched him. I've seen clips, I know of him, I just don't really watch youtubers. One of the videos was about a game about suicide, called The Static That Speaks My Name, and the other was a kinda PSA he made after his friend committed suicide. I decided to email him after watching them, because I just had to fucking tell him. Here's what I sent.

"Hi Mark! I wanted to let you know something that I hope will make your day.
Recently, I've been struggling. I've considered killing myself, and harming myself. A lot. I haven't attempted anything. I've come close, but never have, and I now never will. Because I just watched your video "Lost a friend", regarding Daniel.

I have never seen any of your videos, but The Static that speaks my name and lost a friend are the first 2 videos of yours I've ever watched! And at a time where I am thinking about doing such things. But your message at the end after you finished the game and, I must say, particularly your attempt at telling people about Daniel, have helped me. Because having seen clips of you at your peaks, seeing you sing about space being cool and all, I thought "this guy is so happy!"

But then I seen you try and talk but fail as your voice cracked and dissipated. And I realised, after seeing that, that even someone as strong and joyful as you could be broken by the suicide of a close friend.

So no. I'm not going to attempt it. Because I can't, I just fucking can't put my friends through that. I can't bear the thought of my friends trying to tell someone about it and being unable to. I can't bear the thought of not being able to help my friends because I'm not here. I'm sitting here crying my eyes out as I type this, but I have to tell you, or it will eat me up inside.

Markiplier, you saved my life. You weren't the only person to have done so, but you were one of them. A link in the chain that pulled me out of the pits of despair long enough to see that I can't let myself slip. So, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. If you want to, feel free to share this message with people. Maybe other people like me will show up. 

Yours sincerely, [my name]"

I posted this over in depression as well, cause I figured it might fit there too.
