I have Wasted my life.I basically wasted my life. I never broke the rules, I never stole anything, I never took risks, I never tried drugs of any kind, I never drank alcohol until I was of age and it tasted so bad I have not drank since, I never went to party's, never went to bars/clubs, I never explored my hometown or places nearby when I got my drivers license, I never got my college degree, I never attempted to date anyone until I was 22 and now I'm married to the first person I ever dated because I was too scared to find a better fit because I thought I would never find anyone else who would care about me, I never left my country for vacations out of fear, I haven't done anything with my life besides work crappy jobs and play video games. I have no clue what I would be good at and no clue if there is even a job out there that is obtainable due to my no education/experience, pays well enough to live off of, and is something I would actually enjoy.

I'm currently stuck working a job I hate where I wake up at 6AM to get to work and don't get home until 6PM. I have thousands in debt due to failed attempts at college in a degree I don't care for, I have nowhere to go i'm stuck in this crappy situation. 


I just feel like I wasted my life and I no longer have time for fun. I literally don't have time for anything anymore thanks to this stupid ass job, I'm stressed out all the time. I can't quit because I have bills to pay and debt. I am just stuck and the extreme lack of sleep is killing me. If I don't die from exhaustion or a car crash I'm going to probably take my own life.
