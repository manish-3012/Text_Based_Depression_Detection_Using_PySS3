I wish Iâ€™d get a terminal illness and I feel so fucking guilty for that.Iâ€™m a 26 year old female, single, a mortician by trade. Iâ€™m an only child, my parents both adore me and understand my issues, and I have three cats that I see as my children. Iâ€™m extremely content with my career. Diagnosed major depressive disorder, OCD, social and general anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder, and chronic PTSD. Due to multiple life events recently piling up all at once in tandem with my depression getting worse despite responding well to my new medication, Iâ€™m just starting to feel like I canâ€™t take much more. I do have a therapist, but I donâ€™t feel safe going to see her because I have an immunocompromised dad that Iâ€™m terrified of infecting and killing and my insurance doesnâ€™t cover remote therapy. Iâ€™ve been having more crying spells and intrusive suicidal ideation, itâ€™s getting constant and itâ€™s scaring me. I even know exactly how Iâ€™d do it (which I will NOT be divulging). But I canâ€™t destroy my mom and dad that way, and my cats would never understand why mom is gone. Honestly I wish I would just come down with cancer or something likewise terminal. I vape like crazy and work around formaldehyde, surely thatâ€™ll catch up to me? I guess I just want my death to be taken out of my hands because I canâ€™t do it myself.

And I feel so fucking guilty for actively desiring an illness that causes untold pain to the afflicted and their families, a disease most decent people would never wish even on their worst enemy. Iâ€™ve embalmed so many cancer patients and nearly all were wasted to nothing, and their families had to watch it all in all its agonizing glory.

Iâ€™m not in active danger. I just needed to vent between the tears. Thank you if you read this far.
