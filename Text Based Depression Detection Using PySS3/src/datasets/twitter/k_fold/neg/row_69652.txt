My family hates meI'm a 14 year old girl and I live in UK, I always isolate my room because I hate being around my family my father died and They used to be little me and call me fat, useless god everything in the dictionary I had really bad anxiety in the past and my mum used to take me out to the shops she made me get the stuff at a young age while she sat in the car and I mentally couldn't get out like I thought I was fat and disgusting and I thought everyone was laughing at me and talking about me, it was a dark period for me

My brother is the golden child and I'm the black sheep, I get so treated differently to him he gets luxuries and everything I don't care that he gets things when I don't get anything it's just the fact that they tell me I don't deserve anything when he sits on his ass always while I'm busy acting like the mother of the house. we're not even rich my parents find everything to tell me off for everything and when I do something wrong they curse me and call me names and hit me to the ground
This happen everyday and I have to hold my tears back sometimes I cry myself to sleep once my brother was nice to me at one point he used to cheer me up when I was sad, but now he's horrible, someone in my family framed me of taking a box of paracetamol and they think I took them all, my brothers horrible to me now he calls me fat, I like Amy Winehouses music and they ask me snarkily, is she your romodel since she overdosed too, it makes me really sad and I just want to die I'm not good at anything literally. I'm dumb, I tried telling my online friend about my 'depression' and he said its not real and I'm just lazy, after that I didn't tell anyone, in fact it was on a group hat and they both just laughed.

My friend sent a twerking video (she's white) and she got teased by the older year people she sent it to and constantly belittles me saying my life is perfect and I don't understand which makes me feel worse, I'm scared to go home because now I have to look after my sister clean the house and get beat and called names, I hate living I'm in my room all the time and my mum shouts at me for being useless and lazy and then slaps me, they see me as a grow woman another time was when my stepdad told me to do the washing and my mum watched me and beat me for putting too much washing powder It was on Christmas also, my life pretty much sucks and I wish I wasn't born in literally a waste I wish someone sick could have a life like mine because they'd make more of it that I do. 

I didn't want to post this for a cry for attention I just wanted to vent, this has been happening for so long and my life is just getting worse I've told no one about this I'm not sure what I should do anymore
