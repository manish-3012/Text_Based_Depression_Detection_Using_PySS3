I really can't go on like this anymore. My anxiety is at an all time high and even the smallest of things alleviate it to unbearable levels. I just want this to end.Honestly the only reason I haven't gone through with it yet is because of my parents, I don't want to put them through losing a child but I am just really tired of living like this. Everyday is fucking challenge to get through and I can't even afford any help. My parents don't know about my anxiety and I don't want to tell them because they already worry too much about me. I just don't know what to do anymore.
