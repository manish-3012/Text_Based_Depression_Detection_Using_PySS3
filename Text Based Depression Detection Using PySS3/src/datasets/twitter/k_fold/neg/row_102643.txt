I can't wait for this to be over with.I live in fear everyday, all day.  My presence just disgusts her.  My wife, I mean.  I don't know when exactly she started hating me and didn't love me anymore but it definitely happened.  She said she hates this house and me and the only reason we're still together is it's cheaper than getting a divorce.  

I live in fear all day everyday of saying or doing something that will piss her off.  I can't stand her yelling at me anymore.

We were happy once.  I hoped we could be again but I know it'll never happen.  I'm too old and too broke and in too much debt to do this by myself.  I have no other family, no real friends anymore.  No one will miss me.  Only person in this world who needed me and cared about me was the dog and he died.  So...I'm entirely alone.  

I'm getting rid of my things little by little.  Throwing them away, selling them on ebay.  Things that were once precious to me.  Nobody will need them or care about them anymore.  I keep up this pace I should have it all gone before next summer and that's when I'll kill myself.  

I have lots of vicodin and some blood pressure meds, I hope if I take a bottle or two and then wash them down with some hard liquor it'll do the job.  Nothing else in my life has been peaceful, I want this to be.  I just want to pass out and not wake up anymore.  She can sell the house, get my life insurance and be settled for life.  Free.  Happy.  She deserves that.  

It's a nice plan but some days it's really hard to just eat a bullet right now and be done with this shit.
