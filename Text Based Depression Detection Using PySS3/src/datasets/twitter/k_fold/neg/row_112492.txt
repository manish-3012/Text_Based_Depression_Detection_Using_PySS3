I made a horrible mistakeWhen I was 18 I was very depressed and I had always been quite antisocial, so I gave up on social interactions. I had had an awful history of being left out, so I thought it wasn't worth it to try.

Now I am 23, virgin and friendless, and I feel like absolute garbage. And I can't even share my pains with anyone because I am too embarrassed to admit how lonely I have been all this time.

I should have tried when I was 18. I should have kept some hope. Now I am more miserable than ever before.
