I just want the crushing loneliness to endAnytime I try to connect with people I fail. I become too attached while to them I'm just a background character. Most of my friends are in serious relationships and have no time for me. Someone I saw once as my best friend I haven't seen or hung out with in 6 months. The two people left that I talk to have said I annoy them by texting daily. I'm not good at this. Tommorow will ask a girlthat I've been talking to for a year at work girl if she wants to hang out just because I'm tired of my friend group shrinking into nothingness. When she says no I'm not sure how to react. Idk why I fuck up all my friendships. I'm 23 never even been on a date no one has ever shown any level of attraction to me and I don't blame them. I'm worthless and maybe it's time to accept that death is better than 50 years of more loneliness.
