I really donâ€™t think Iâ€™m okIâ€™m really not sure how to put this but it honestly feels like Iâ€™m going crazy. I feel like my life has gone downhill a lot. Iâ€™ve had depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember and Iâ€™ve gone through really easy times and really hard times, but this feels like something more than depression. It feels like something is actually like wrong wrong and I donâ€™t know how to ask for help for the way Iâ€™m feeling because I canâ€™t even describe it.
