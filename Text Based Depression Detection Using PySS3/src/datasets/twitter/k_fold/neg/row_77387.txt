Getting ready.I thought I wouldn't be able to wait until tomorrow, but I don't know if I can put my family and friends through this before Christmas. They don't talk to me much anymore and are mad at me, but I still don't want to make life worse for them. I may be able to wait until afterward. I'm so scared. But I'm so tired.

I've got my place picked out. It's a bit of a drive, but it's a sure thing. I've tried overdosing in the past and just woke up in the hospital. I wake up in the middle of the night thinking of the pain and it is not fun. But I can't do this anymore. I don't think people should suffer. I've tried for years and years. Therapy, psychiatrists. More trauma just keeps piling on and the isolation is unbearable.
