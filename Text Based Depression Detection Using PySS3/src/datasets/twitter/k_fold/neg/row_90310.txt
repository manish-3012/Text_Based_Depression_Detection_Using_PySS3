i dont want to continue with lifei've been depressed for a while, and it hit me today that i really do not want to continue living. i have a specific plan of how i want to end things, but not the means to carry it out, yet. i just... i see years ahead of me and it looks like a very steep hill that i just do not want to climb. i know people say "there's good and bad parts to life", but what they don't understand is that i neither want to experience the good nor the bad. everything so far has been negative, and god, i cant see myself going through another ~60 years of this. can't focus, eating is a disaster, stress levels are high, history of previous attempts.
i guess, it's not necessarily that i want to die, just that i don't want to be alive anymore, if that makes any sense to anyone out there. maybe somebody out there knows why i'm feeling like this.

besides, how poetic would it be to do it on Halloween?
