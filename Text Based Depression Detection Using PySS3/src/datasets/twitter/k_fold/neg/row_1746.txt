Iâ€™m stuckLife feels like an empty void of loneliness. The more time I spend in my head the more I feel alone. I hate him. I hate him for hurting me, but I hate me for letting him. I let him for 2 straight months and thought it was because I provoked him. When in reality, I did. Itâ€™s my fault. Every day is harder and I feel like just ending it.. my mom and pets are what keep me here when I donâ€™t want to be at all. Iâ€™m so dumb.. I was 14, what did I know. Iâ€™m 16 now and donâ€™t know a thing about sexual things. Iâ€™m so sick and tired of crying. Iâ€™m so done with being able to sleep.. when is the end?
