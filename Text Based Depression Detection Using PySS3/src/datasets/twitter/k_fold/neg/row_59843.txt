I ruined it alli ruined the one thing that mattered the most to me. god.. i loved him so fucking much. i became mentally insane and a crazy bitch because of all of this. i jeopardized everything by threatening my ex, nearly blackmailing him, and making him feel trapped. he knew he couldnâ€™t get rid of me at all because i had shit on him that could get him sent away or even arrested. he seeked to be friends only to make sure i didnâ€™t do anything bad to him, even though on the inside he hated me, never was going to forgive me, and never wanted to get back with me. i was led on, on and on by him because of this. this hurt me so badly on the inside each time he did it. he told me he had feelings for me still - but then all of the sudden he didnâ€™t want to get back with me. i feel used, and lied to. if none of this shit happened, if i didnâ€™t do anything like this, maybe he would actually be with me..but instead he did the deed for me instead and got himself sent to the mental hospital thinking he had no other escape from me.. iâ€™ve never felt more manipulative. iâ€™m a manipulative, blackmailing mental bitch. iâ€™ve never felt worse about myself than now..
