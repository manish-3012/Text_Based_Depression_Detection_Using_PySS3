I really feel like dying right now.I fucking hate my life. I would love to die before I started the new school year, preferrably before this month ends. I have nothing to live for. Everything is bad, wrong or affects me negatively and I'm fucking done. It seems as if life was mocking me. I just don't want to stay here. I don't want to live a lie as life, because I'm also done with pretending to be something I'm not. I would love it if I died suddenly for accident or whatever. I don't even care how. This hurts each day more than the last one. Fuck everything. I'm so over it. Life is a shit. Don't want to hear anymore "life is wonderful" "it's worth it, when you least expect it, -whatever- will happen, you'll see...". It is not wonderful at all. If you're enjoying it so much, lucky you. For me it is not, period.
