not sure what to doI didn't go into work today, i left my second job early because I was sick last night. I think I have CO2 poisoning form my vehicle, but i have no insurance or way to get to work without the van. I'm 25 with $70,000+ in debt. I have no talents. I suck at social stuff. I just don't want to live if soulmates don't exist. therapists don't tell me anything new. I just wish I knew where to get an exit pill to be honest. I feel like no one attempts to understand me that much. Religion is a big lie form what I can gather. I just don't want to exit really.
