My 13 year old dog tries his best to live more than meHeâ€™s the only one that loves me and I love him too. Even though 2-3 of his teeth had to be removed and his toe is swollen, he still wags his tail when I greet him and has more energy than me when we go on walks. Heâ€™s at the vet right now, but I miss him so much. I want to see him so badly, I keep looking at the pictures and videos I have of him. I applied to over 30+ rescues and places during quarantine and I almost gave up until I got a call from my local shelter who said they got my application. I met him and fell in love with him.
