Being alive is exhaustingThe sad part is it really shouldn't be. I just spend my time sleeping. I wish I could could just fall asleep and not wake up. How peaceful that would be. I don't want this anymore, there is nothing left in life for me. But I can't fucking do it. I can't handle the guilt. My dad told me that if I ever killed myself, he would too. Even if I'm dead, I think that my last moments would be spent in tremendous guilt knowing that. I don't want that. I just wish someone would do it for me. I just wish I could fall asleep and not wake up.
