I don't wanna exist anymoreI don't wanna die or commit suicide. I just wanna fell asleep and succumb to that darkness forever, just not exist anymore. 
I really wish everyone will loose the memory of me like I was never born or lived or died. I wish I never happened to myself to  my family or to the world.
Just existing and waking up from sleep to pass another day is hell. It's nothing but it feels like the hardest thing ever. Sometimes I feel like if euthanasia is not legal then just pay me for existing, I'll give the money to someone who needs it. Do medical experiements with me, take my kidney my lungs my heart and give it to someone who wants to live and let me die.
