Sometimes i want to die....I've never posted here before. I don't know what is happening to me. One day I'm perfectly fine, the next me and my wife have an argument or I just have a mood swing and I just want to kill myself. I don't think I have depression. But im not sure. The urge usually only lasts a day or two sometimes only for a few hours. I just don't want to exist anymore. But I can't kill myself. I have a wife and stepson, friends and a loving family. That is actually the only thing keeping me from doing it. It breaks my heart thinking about how they  would feel if I killed myself, what  they  would think of me and what it would do to my stepson.  

I feel like I don't have anything to really be depressed or sad about. I have a great job and the social structure I mentioned above. But Everytime this feeling creeps up on me and feels more and more appealing. I start trying to think of ways to kill myself where no one would notice I was gone and the only conclusion I an come to is I have to sabotage every relationship I have. But I just feel like I don't have the will power. I love them to much. I'm just at a loss and I don't know what is happening to me. The feeling subsides in a day or two and I'm back to normal. A funny, happy guy. I'm just worried that one of these times is going to be the last time. I find myself trying to justify dying or wishing I would have a heart attack in my sleep. 

I just don't know what is happening to me....
