I dunno man I'm a lonely incel not like r/incels but a legitimate involuntary celibate person, I've never had any social skills and I can see people only ever look at me with disgusted eyes and fake smiles ever since I was a kid, I've grown up cold and I sensitive and that's doing its job and keeping people away I don't even feel like a fucking human being, just some wash to the shore line pile of trash that no one wants to clean, I guess its just finally sinking in the one thing I learnt from my dad here is a quote from my dad reddit "life is a bitch and then you die"

Every god damn day its always go to a shitty job the think oh looks bunch of truck I could jump under one or I should crash my car into a power line pole and last but not least the consistent thought of nobody loves you just hurry up and kill yourself you fucking piece of shit. Anti depressants don't work for me and Ive gone to see a psychologist and its just some idiot saying "hey you were happy when you were 4, remember him be like that" and I get sunlight plenty enough from my shit job and I go to the gym 3 times a week, yeah sure this is more of a vent then a goodbye but fuck me is this bullshit I'm god damn human too why can't I feel loved without the thought of when are you going to let me down or betray me in the end, I hate living so fucking much
