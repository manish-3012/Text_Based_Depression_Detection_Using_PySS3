I want to end my life just so i can focus on that pain rather than this one.We broke up and it came out of nowhere, we just moved in together and I ruined relationships with my family for her.  Our two year anniversary would have been this valentines day and I was really looking forward to it because on our one year I got her a promise ring and it was the greatest day of my life thinking she was going to be mine forever and now that that's never going to happen my heart is broken, I can't stop crying and I'm so scared for whats going to happen next and at this point I don't want to feel this pain and just end my life in some way.  I wrote her songs, poems and love letters to her, i made promises and I can never follow through with them and that is unforgivable.  I'm listening to our favorite music and the song we wanted to be our first dance at our wedding and I can't believe she's gone.  She broke up with me but i feel like I'm hurting her because it was my fault.  I want her back and to forget these past two days because no one deserves to feel this way.  She was the love of my life, she was my first everything and I wanted her to be my last.  I don't think I can ever trust again or even fall in love again because I let her down and I don't want to do that to someone else and with all those things I said to her, how she's the most beautiful, she has the prettiest eyes, etc. can never be repeated to anyone else because I truthfully feel that way about her and don't want to ruin the way I feel about her.  I'm not mad at her, I'm mad at God and why this pain has to be felt and I think it's time I end things.  I'll always love her because of the way she made me feel during our time together.  I don't think I can hold it together until valentines day.  I didn't cheat or hurt her like that, I just wasn't the man she thought I was and that kills so much.
