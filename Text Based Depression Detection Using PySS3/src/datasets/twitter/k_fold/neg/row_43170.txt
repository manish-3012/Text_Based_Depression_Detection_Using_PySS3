kinda want to dieÂ¿,,Could someone give me a bit of advice? :^
Hello, Iâ€™m 15F and I want to die hhshjs I donâ€™t have depression or anything I just want to die I donâ€™t know how to explain ( sorry for the long and messy text :&gt; )
Life is meaningless, living is boring, I donâ€™t like to be alive, Iâ€™m bored. I â€œfeelâ€ like this since I was 12 and itâ€™s been getting more intense I guess.. Being alive is incredibly tedious, itâ€™s gross, now just the thought of staying alive disgusts me and makes me tired, Iâ€™m sick of living, itâ€™s so boring Iâ€™d rather be dead. I want to die, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a problem, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s wrong, I actually donâ€™t want this feeling to go away, I just wanted some advice on how to suppress this feeling for a bit longer. I donâ€™t even know if the advice Iâ€™m asking for exists or if someone would say it but I think I may be a bit desperate right now so it doesnâ€™t hurt to try asking right sdjsjdj
I canâ€™t kill myself bc Iâ€™m scared of feeling pain hehe but even if that wasnâ€™t the case I shouldnâ€™t die just yet, I canâ€™t leave my mother and my little brother, also my pet bird.. So Iâ€™m just here existing and hoping that I will have a car accident or get sick and die so it would be out of my control,, but I just want to die so much but I canâ€™t and itâ€™s agonizing.. So, is there any way I can suppress this will to die? thanks in advance (*Â´âˆ‡ï½€*)
