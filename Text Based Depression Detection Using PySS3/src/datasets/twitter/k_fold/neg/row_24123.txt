Slumped. Feel disconnectedI snapped. Too stressed, too resentful, too many failings. All just piled up and suddenly Iâ€™m broken 

I feel vacant inside my head like my brain isnâ€™t in sync. 

I canâ€™t talk to people. people did this to me, every talk Puts me further under

Itâ€™s Been over a week now. Felt my mind breaking. Everything in pieces. Nightmares back again. Nightmares I can feel 

I was doing so well. Now I canâ€™t focus. I Want to bleed. It would bring me back to reality. But donâ€™t think release is big enough 

Want to die. Just slip into dark and nothing more. But I have too much relying on me and I canâ€™t walk away from it 

This too will pass. I have to believe it. Ride it out.

I come out changed each time. Losing more and more of myself. How much til I lose the ability to stay 

Iâ€™m sorry, I know I donâ€™t make sense. Mad rambling. Just had to say something to no one i know.
