Is This Continuous?25 year old been thinking about killing myself for more than 10 years.  I have sought therapists and psychologists multiple times and have been told "You do not seem like you are depressed."  This is despite telling them in detail how I was going to kill myself along with actually following through with the plan after thinking about it and practicing for several weeks before the attempt to become more comfortable with the process.  For better or worse about halfway through my unconscious overpowered me and I stopped the process.  There have also been way too many attempts of me trying to fix myself with exercise, self-help stuff, meditation, blah blah blah.

My question for anyone who goes through this: is this a continual urge for you or does it come and go?  I ask because I recently told a friend about this and the friend said that it is usually a constant thing.  For me I never want to live and given the choice I would normally take a "death while I sleep" almost any day of the week.  But, the actual urge to actively kill myself is not constant.  For me, there is a continual desire to be dead, there is not a continual desire to kill myself, and there is always a fear of dying.
