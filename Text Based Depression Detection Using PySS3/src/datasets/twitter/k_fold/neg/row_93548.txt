lmao im trans and also depressed + lost all my friendsi've been out to my family as transgender for a year and a half now. my dad is getting more accepting, but his girlfriend is transphobic as all hell to me. she says hateful things to me that i only expect to see on comment sections. yknow, the horrible stuff that... its like... did you really just say that?

i got tired of her trying to make me feel like shit. "I was JUST like you as a kid, I wore everything in the boys section, I wanted to be a boy!" "you'll never be a guy! and i'll NEVER call you one!" "why would you be a guy if GOD gave YOU a vagina?!" she said over and fucking over and over and over and over and over and over..... and i finally fucking snapped and yelled at her and told her that not everything was about her.

bad enough that i think i believe in god but im tired of being told that god hates me. nobody knows my personal relationship with god except for me... nobody has that RIGHT to tell me what im doing is wrong. god made me like this. i was made to live my experiences... why cant they see it like that?..

not everything is limited to her experiences. i told her i have a medical condition. i told her that i've ALWAYS been like this, for as long as I can remember, and no, its not a fucking phase. and she said to me, "I'm the most open minded person I know, but some of my gay friends CHOOSE to be gay, and you're just CHOOSING to pretend to be a guy." like how the fuck do you call yourself open minded then say that shit?? so i said "When did you choose to be straight" and she looked at me dead in the eyes and said "You can't use that as a response."

ive been dealing with my family being unsupportive, saying these things to me, while the rest of my family -- cousins, aunts, uncles, my conservative ass grandpa -- they ALL call me he/him and "nephew" and "grandson"... but my dads girlfriend is too unwilling to cooperate or at least TRY to listen to me that it makes me want to scream.

bad enough that ive been struggling with being suicidal for years. but i told my school guidance counselor that if my dad wasnt accepting of me i would probably fucking kill myself. and sure enough, i tried to. oh god i tried to fucking kill myself spring of 2014. and ive got a giant gash of a scar to show for it.

i miss hurting myself and i miss seeing the blood and i miss feeling the external pain instead of internal. i miss it. i miss it and im so close to fucking doing it again but i keep telling myself i cant. i cant for the sake of my transition.

i told myself i would stop for my dad. but my dad doesnt even stand up for me. my dad doesnt tell her to back down. when she yells at me for getting a glass of water, when i ask her a question, whne my anxiety kicks in and i start panicking, im af ucking horrible person shame on me everything is MY fukcing fault.

my fucking therapist was supposed to write me a letter of rec for my hormones and then he backed out at the last second. my shtity fuck of a therapist that told me to forgive my alcoholic, abusive, drug addict of a mother (which was, by the way, a huge fucking mistake when she just recently got her ass kicked out of 2+ rehabs and i found out she was cheating on her husband!!), and the day he fucking met me decided i should be put on antidepressants instaed of actually COUNSELING me like he shouldve been doing. telling me i wasnt allowed to hurt myself bc he would tell my dad, yet not helping me find alternatives. telling me i should run away from home (wow holy shit i cant do that i went to fucking boarding school)

and then all my friends. i had a big group of friends at school. i thought we were all good, our senior year of hs. then they started ignoring me/another friend. denied they ignored us. then they started talking about us behind our backs. silly stuff at first, but then... calling me annoying. makign fun of my friends depression. not helping either of us with our problems. not helping anyone improve. so i lost my friends. 

and then, i made a new friend. someone i quickly began to have a crush on.i felt bad for liking them... bc we both had issues, and i was a senior. and their parent was transphobic and hated the shit out of me. told them to not even talk to me, not even so much as be in the same room as me. friend told me they couldnt date me bc of that, and also bc i was a senior, and would be graduating. but we decided to go to prom together.

then that friend went and started dating/fucking one of my "friends" (see: someone i considered a friend then fucked me over like this, along with talking shit and not defending me ever. ever.) who happened to, guess what, be a senior. wow holy fuck. THREE DAYS after prom. three fucking days.

and now, months later, guess what? theyve broken up, but my friend is now dating one of my ONLY few friends left, who, get this, is also fucking trans.. and will be graduating in 2016. how the fuck is this any different? why would they do this...? they both know i still have feelings for my friend. it hurts. it couldve been anyone else. anyone but my roommate, one of my closest pals, who has been ignoring me all summer. no wonder.

and my other friends? busy with work, busy with boyfriends/girlfriends, busy in general. im alone. after dealing with constant shitty family issues, im alone. my friends arent talking to me and i want to die.

i want to fucking die. i really do. i see the guy i am and the guy im supposed to be and its like theyre too separate beings. will i live to see the day? is living worth it when theres so much hate in the world? Are people going to treat me like this constantly? Are all of my friends going to ignore me until they never talk to me again? Why does this happen? Can't they see I need someone.. can't they see I'm currently, actively in pain? Don't they see that?

I would die, but I would hurt my sisters. 10 and 28, I love them dearly. But they don't understand. They never will. Neither of them were abused by our mom and have to look at her in the eyes. Neither of them have to hear "its just a phase" when its literally something so important to you that its keeping you from killing yourself.

I don't even want help. I don't even care about what happens anymore. I could die right now and not care. I would only care about my sisters. My little sister especially. I love her too much, but I don't know if it's enough to keep me from dying.

And I want to rip my skin off. I want to self harm again. Its been so long... Ive stared down my razors, Ive held them against my skin, I've held pills in front of my mouth, ready to go, and ready to die. But something is holding me back.
