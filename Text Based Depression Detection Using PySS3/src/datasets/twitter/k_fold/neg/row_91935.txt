I'm pretty sure I fucked up a great job opportunity in the dumbest wayIf this is a bit rambly it's most likely a mix of drunkenness and a surreal sense of disassociation I've been feeling since yesterday. 

Some quick, relevant background: I suffer from depression and anxiety. I sometimes get panic attacks, typically in situations with lots of strange people, but I don't think I'm as bad off as others in that regard.  
  
  Anyway. I've been unemployed for a little over a year now. I have a little over $40k in credit card debt, plus somewhere around $110k in federal student loan debt from college and grad school (in deferment atm obviously). I have a BS in Comp Sci and went to grad school for CS as well. I've been having trouble getting interviews, and the few I've gotten obviously haven't gone well. My luck changed a few weeks ago, and last week I successfully interviewed and got a job offer! Here's the kicker; I never completed my MSCS degree. I completed all the coursework, but graduation is contingent on taking an exam. I was recruited for a job (my previous job, from which I was laid off a year ago) before I could take the exam. However, I don't indicate this on my resume, because I have all the knowledge and experience you'd get from that degree program, right? Yea I know, I'm an idiot and a worthless liar.

So I get an offer, but it's contingent on a background check. I start to panic, and decide it's best to describe the situation to the recruiter and send him an email. This was late last night (Friday) and now I'm basically just waiting on bad news to come Monday. 

My life's been a series of unimpressive failures, but this one's quite the achievement.

I don't know what to do, I have the worst pit in my stomach constantly. I think I've been having a panic attack for the last 12 hours. (Is that possible?) I don't think I can make it through the weekend. And even if I do? Then what? This whole year has really been compounding on me in a bad way. I'm tired of it. I'm just so *done*. Finding articles [like this](http://metro.co.uk/2010/04/23/humiliated-job-seeker-vicky-harrison-commits-suicide-after-200-rejections-259532/) have not been helpful. Poor girl. This really feels like I was headed toward the end of the line, and the conductor found out I never bought a ticket and is tossing me off a moving train (lol what a stupid metaphor).

Idk I guess I'm hoping just typing this out in a semi-public way will help.
