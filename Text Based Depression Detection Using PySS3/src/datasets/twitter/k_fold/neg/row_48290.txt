I'm only 21, it shouldn't be like this.I've always held out hope, my whole life: "This is the worst that could happen. It can only go up from here." From living with abusive parents, to living with an abusive boyfriend that raped me and tried to kill me. Now I'm effectively trapped in domestic slavery: in lockdown as a live-in nanny, being paid less than half minimum wage "off the books" after being promised a living wage. Nowhere to go and no leverage whatsoever against my bosses. I have to do whatever they say, or find myself jobless and homeless. I'm thinking about either checking into a psych ward or ending things for good. It's like: "Out of the frying pan, into the fire, back into the frying pan, oh look, what's that? Another, hotter fire!" I can't take another fucking soul-rotting day of being screamed at and bitten by a toddler, only to have my boss tell me she's "not having her expectations met", then going to my room to sit alone and wait for the next day of hell to come. No wonder I'm not Mary Poppins! You cut my pay to almost nothing after I moved in with you, you manipulative bitch! Now I live at my job and can never leave because of lockdowns in our state. You get what you fucking pay for, and right now you're paying for a half-sane slave to watch your kid, and getting pissed that it's not smiling wide enough for the opportunity. I'm out tomorrow, one way or another. I'm going to pack a bag, take a bus, and see the city (three whole months living on its outskirts, and I still haven't seen Seattle). I'm not coming back here.
