Just calculated my life expectancy and burst into tears. Statistically I have to live 15571 more days... Jesus ... I don't know how I am going to do this. 

Whatever. People depend on me. This foot goes in front of the other. Somehow it always gets better eventually.

Just needed a place to vent.

... back to pretend nothing is wrong ...
