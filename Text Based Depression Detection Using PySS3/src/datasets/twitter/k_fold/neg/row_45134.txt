Haven't been out in 2 months due to quarantine, caught up on assignments and exams. I'm done.I lost the last two years of college to mental illness and this time around I'm losing it to being quarantined. Online teaching is poor, teachers are assigning multiple exams a week and expect me to perform as you normally would. Clearly life wasn't meant to be, I'm killing myself.
