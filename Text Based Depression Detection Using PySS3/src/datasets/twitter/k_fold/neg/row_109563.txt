Soft SuicideI'm not sure if anyone else appreciates this distinction. I've tried "hard" suicide: about 6-7 attempts over 2 years, culminating in taking 15 oxycodone washed down with a fifth of whiskey. I either want to live or suicide is just one more thing I fail at.
While I try to think of a way to succeed, I'm practicing "soft" suicide: I am inconsistent with my meds, I drink too much, I drive my car/motorcycle too fast, I don't eat right or sleep enough.  Anyone else do this while waiting to die?
