Alternatives to Hotlines?I've been having issues, obviously. I tried a suicide hotline as I have great difficulty talking face to face to anyone, let alone someone who is *paid* to know as much about me as possible. The issue is, the people who run those cover everything they say in layers upon layers of sugar. "Oh, you're so insightful!" "You're special" "The peak of perfection!" yadda yadda yadda and all that jazz. It's insincere, and even if it was sincere, is an "argument" based completely on emotion. Do you guys know of any way I can get help without talking face to face with someone AND where said help appeals to logical arguments rather than emotional ones?

It's fair to note that I have a date planned to, well, you know, but it's a decent ways off (months from now), so don't take my post as priority over some of the others here.
