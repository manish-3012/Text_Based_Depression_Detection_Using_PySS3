So the last 13 days... I think a day after I posted my original post from millionaire to in debt 200k I managed to start a company selling services. I made around 12k during the first two weeks. But guess what I did. I used leveraged and longed bitcoin and got liquidated again. Why do I keep going back to the same exact act that brought me to my knees. Maybe it is the hope that I might be able to recover all funds if I just trade again. I canâ€™t seem to get it out of my system. I feel disgusted. I still have my services going generating me cash flow. I should just save up slowly but I canâ€™t seem to fight that urge inside me that keeps telling me to trade. I donâ€™t feel sad or depressed right now. I feel really empty and confused.
