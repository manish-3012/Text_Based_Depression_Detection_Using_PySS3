LostMy doctor won't prescribe me any medication because I've had bad reactions to SSRIs before. Everyone wants me to see a counselor or therapist but none of them have good hours and they are all expensive. I can't even go to the support group my doctor so â€helpfullyâ€ recommended because it's a pregnancy loss group I would have to take my living daughter with at the time they meet, and I refuse to subject those women to that.

I want the easy way out.
