Iâ€™m a bad personHi, my name is E****, I am currently 16. My life didnâ€™t particularly start well as I was raised in a drug den that I called my home for 6 years. I was constantly abused, mentally and physically. As I was not the son of the man that lived there,due to the fact that my mother had split from my actual father and only left the weekends for me to see him. Some things are blurry and some are clear, but I do believe what happened to me affected me severely. 

I started showing up to my  1st grade class with bruises and marks that hinted an investigation into my home. A while later an confrontation occurred between the man and my mother, it was over him believing my mother had hidden his gun.he was furious and pointed a knife at my mother. I was screaming at him ,pleading for him to not hurt her. Even his kids who lived with us were terrified. He then pointed the knife at me and went close to my neck, what I felt wasnâ€™t a regular fear, it was primal, why did I at such a young age have to feel that? This wasnâ€™t the only incident that occurred but thankfully it was the last. Another incident involved him pointing a gun at my grandpa (Popo, I call him) who was there to pick me up on the weekend. These events led the court to give my father full custody of me and I had lived a better life, for the most part.

My father had always been there for me, and for that I was grateful, I just wish I was able to make it up to him. Shortly after my father got custody of me he broke up with his girlfriend, who was practically a stepmother to me. Our contact did not stop and she is always one phone call away. 
This led us to my father and I living alone for over a year until he met A***, a*** was a single parent like my father, she had one son and one daughter. I never did like her son and had always fought with him over everything,her daughter was smaller and was a little shy. They eventually moved in and due to the size of our house, all three of us had to share a room. This plays a big part of my second chapter 

Sex had always been a curiosity to me, as a child Iâ€™m not sure how it was introduced to me, but it was, and I was completely clueless. At ten years old I was becoming curious about girls, and being the kid who gets picked on , it didnâ€™t help at all. So then I had the bright idea to let A***â€™s daughter do things to me. I didnâ€™t understand that this was a bad thing,all I knew was that it felt weird. Well eventually we were caught in the act and I was charged. My father was furious and had brought me to the police station, the police then interviewed me to find out everything that happened, they asked if there was any penetration, I didnâ€™t understand what that meant , I couldnâ€™t have, I was only ten. But thatâ€™s what it felt like I was supposed to say and so I did. There I was, a ten year old charged with aggravated sexual assault. Life was rough for the years that passed for my father and I, a valley split my father and I, as he blamed me for his pain, he was right, heâ€™d tell me that a*** was the only girl he had never fought with and that it was my fault she was gone, he was right. It was my fault for my abuse, I wasnâ€™t behaving right, itâ€™s my fault for the breakup, I wasnâ€™t behaving right, and now more recently the third chapter had opened. 

My father eventually had found another girlfriend, who surprisingly enough had, one son and one daughter. However this time the ages had flipped as the girl was older and the boy was younger. I interacted with the kids well and over a year and a half they moved in. Things were well and life seemed to move on.J*******, my now stepmom had gotten pregnant and had my sister, my real blood sister, Iâ€™d never really had siblings on my fathers side so having her was truly a gift. 

Freshman year of high school was when things started going south, I had struggled with girls all throughout schooling and could never get girls my age to like me. I would only really catch the attention of girls that were older than me or younger. Even then I couldnâ€™t keep anything that was stable, as I didnâ€™t really feel anything for many. As a 8th grader I had felt really strong emotions for one girl specifically and was embarrassed and bullied by her and others once she found out. I have not escaped it even to this day as I am still reminded by her to simply embarrass and make fun of me when she can. I have never felt anything since, I feel like that had made me more numb to those emotions. 

Sophomore year - thanksgiving 2019

My sister has been close friends with the girl next door.One day during thanksgiving break my step sister decided to invite her over to stay the night. Nothing out of the ordinary happened as I was simply in my room playing gta , just blowing up people in oppressors and the such, since it was break, I had been staying up late, just to get the most out of it. Well I left my room and realized that they were sleeping in the living room instead of their actual room. I didnâ€™t think much of it at first as I only left to get a glass of water.But a thought in the back of my head appeared. The stupid hormonal fifteen year old had done something he would regret immensely.
Her friend was asleep after all right? Thatâ€™s what I thought, I had never done this thing before I had no idea, I didnâ€™t realize until I was finished, I didnâ€™t realize how much of a monster I was, I didnâ€™t realize how much pain I just caused , to me , to my family, to my sister, to her friend. I went back to my room and headed to bed. I heard a small commotion in the living room and thatâ€™s when I kind of woke up and realized the weight of everything that occurred. I went into a shell of some sort. I grabbed a bag, I put clothes , a knife and my wallet. I hopped out my window and took my bike from the shed. I fled my home and left through to a park nearby. My sister texted me and told me how much of a piece of shit I was, I knew and I knew the only way to make it right, I rode my bike up town to the city limits and stopped at a gas station to get some water bottles, the clerk was completely oblivious that the kid he was serving was probably gonna slit his wrists somewhere in the brush. I left and headed towards city limits which was near a small town airport. Thatâ€™s when my step mother , the one who was first with my dad stopped me, to this day I have no idea how she knew where i was but she found me and took me home. The police were there waiting but didnâ€™t take me. Instead my dad, my first step mom and my current one had taken me to the station. I have always been causing stress and pain for others and this is no different, I feel so bad for what Iâ€™ve done and constantly wonder if blowing my brains out on their doorstep would make them feel even the slightest bit better about what I did, there is no good person who does this to others.there is no worthy punishment other than death. I have had my court pushed back multiply times and my next day is March 18, court will decide my fate and whether or not I game end myself or not. Either way I know it will never be enough because I am a monster. I am a bad person. Goodnight
