Stuck in limbo, with no end in sightI want to kill myself, but I can't. Not yet. There's so much bureaucracy around death. Making a will is more difficult than it should be. But I have to do it, or else all the greedy assholes will come crawling out and take what is rightfully my mother's. It's not like I have much, but when you factor in currency conversions and standard of living in my home country, I 10000% need a will. Because if those assholes get their hands on my shit, istg I will come back to haunt their sorry asses. 

And I made the dumb decision to be honest with my psychiatrist for once. Excellent decision making on my part there. So now I have to cooperate and do therapy and accept when they give me meds so I won't be detained involuntarily. Idk. 

I only have about a week until college starts to get suspicious. Excuses and asking for deadline extensions will only get me so far.

So, I'm running out of time on all fronts. And I feel like I've lost the compulsion to kill myself, but I've pushed myself into a place where I have no choice but to do it. I still want to die, but I don't actively want to kill myself, does that make sense? Jesus, why can't this be easier. 

I've got a blood test tomorrow bc of some suspicious symptoms, and it was ordered v urgently bc the symptoms are the same for both something benign and a form of cancer (lol keeping it vague). I keep hoping it's cancer. Then I'll refuse treatment and the decision will be taken out of my hands. I imagine it, and I feel such a sense of relief. But ofc knowing my luck, it won't happen.
