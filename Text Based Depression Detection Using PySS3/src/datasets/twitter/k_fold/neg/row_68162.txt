Im Just Waiting...Everyday I go on with nothing happening in my life... Im honestly just a waste of talents on a body that doesnt want to live... Here is what Im capable of:
1) 4.1 gpa in 9th grade year
2)Play several insturments
3)Technology loves me and I love it
4) Have an athletic body (but I dont play sports)
5) intermediate level archer

But do all those things keep me from living? No. Its my family. If I do kill myself (which I really want to do) My sister and mom and step dad and even my closest friends wouldnt be right in the head anymore. I cant do that to them..

So im waiting. Im waiting til I get older and be able to honestly make my decisions. I dont know how im going to take myself out but im going to do it thats no doubt. Ive already tried 4 times and the feelings is like a rush of adrenaline that never leaves your body! And that feeling is amazing. When I get older im going to have that feeling again, then never have it again.

So say what you want I might take it into consideration and dont tell me how it will affect my friends and family. I already talked to my closest friends and they arent right in the head when it comes to these things. HELL! One of my friends said they wouldnt mind doing it with me! Shows how strong my generations will to live is...

Im 16 and been thinking about killing myself for 5 years... I dont think anything could stop me once I get to that point...
