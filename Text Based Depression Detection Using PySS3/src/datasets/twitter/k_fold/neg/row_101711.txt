Its all for nothingNobody seems to talk about the self harm that isn't physical, but mental. It's sometimes even worse because most times nobody can see that you're hurting yourself. My newest self harm method is to wait until the night before to do all of my work and torture myself. Then the next day I fuck up my tests since there's no way that my mediocre study habits will ever give me a good grade, and then I feel stupid. Then Iie in bed all day because I feel terrible about myself, and push off my work. And the harm cycle continues.

I'm not stupid. I got such good grades until I started to burnout from all the pressure I put on myself and slip back into self deprication and depression. I know I'm capable of doing well in life if I just gave a damn about what happens to me, but I don't. It's all for nothing. So what if I do well in school? Then I get to go to a nice college and be around stuck up rich nerds? And then I get to work a 9-5 for 50-60 years until I retire and then die? What's it all even for? Why shouldn't I just give up if my life is just going to be another average experience? There's no point to it all. And before you tell me that I can make it cool and fun, quit the bullshit. You know full and well that 99% of people are gonna end up average and never do anything actually important. I'm not gonna be apart of the 1% that makes it, I'm already boring. So that's it. That's what makes me want to quit.
