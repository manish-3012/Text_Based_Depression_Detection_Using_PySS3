Girlfriend almost killed herself, need some advice please.Hello, firstly i am sorry if i am wasting anyones time asking for advice for someone i care about. 

Anyway, My girlfriend almost killed herself on Monday (18th of june 2018), I managed to talk her out of it and getting help, She talked to her mother and her mother took her to the ER. We spent the night talking while she stayed in the ER. She then told me the next morning she was being taken to a psych ward I haven't spoken to her since and im worried sick.

Today is the third day in about an hour she has been there 72 hours, my inquiry is what happens now and has anyone been in this position? Should i keep my hopes up i might hear from her today or should i prepare that she could be there for weeks.

For some extra context i am 18 years old, she is 17. She is in the state of New York. 

Thank you in advance for any answers i receive.
