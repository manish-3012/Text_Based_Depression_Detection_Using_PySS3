I don't know what to do...I'm a 15y/o male with girlfriend of the same age.

So I don't want my girlfriend to go out drinking with her friends because someday someone will get hurt.

well she gave me her word that she wouldn't and then went out and did exactly what she promised not to do, and I'm not ok with that so I told her I'm breaking up with her if she does it again,

 and then she started telling me that she'll take some crack pills because I dont want her to go out drinking and she's told me that if I kill myself she'll kill herself and that if I leave her she might kill herself so I dont know what to do because I love her.
