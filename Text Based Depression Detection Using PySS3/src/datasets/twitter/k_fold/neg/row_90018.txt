I think Iâ€™m gonna do it.So my dad just told me that Iâ€™m not shit Iâ€™m never gonna be shit and heâ€™s planning on telling my mom about my political views this is after I finally started getting my depression under control and I didnâ€™t want to kill my self heâ€™s blaming my friends for my views when Iâ€™ve had them since before I had friends and for everything my mom will kick me out when she finds out about my political views she told me if I support this group sheâ€™ll kick me out and I do support this party my dad has threatened to kick me out multiple times before and if it wasnâ€™t for this one person in my life who I donâ€™t want to be hurt in any way I would kill my self I canâ€™t move out for another few years and I wonâ€™t run away if I do get kick out Iâ€™ll have to live on the streets which Iâ€™m fine with but I wonâ€™t be able to get a job because I canâ€™t drop out of school yet I really just want to take a knife and shove it in my eye socket so it hits my brain and I either die or become brain dead either way I wonâ€™t have to deal with this shit
