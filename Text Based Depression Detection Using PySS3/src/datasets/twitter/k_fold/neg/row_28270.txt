I have a decent life. I should be happy, but it seems like I'm always crying nowadays.I feel so empty and lonely, nothing I do ever helps. I've talked to more people, I've talked to less people. I just feel like I'm a robot now. I can't connect with anyone so I just push them away. I can't enjoy the things I used to. Nothing is fun. I pretend that I'm okay, I even convince myself sometimes that I'm happy. But I'm not, and I don't know why. I hate the way I look, I hate everything about me. I think I'm disgusting and I'm ashamed of everything that's happened with me. I wish I didn't feel this way, I feel like I'm a brat because I've got a good life but I'm not happy with anything about it. It'd be easier just to end it now. I'd just disappear like that. If only I wasn't such a coward.
