ImI'm just so exsuexhaustedRecently Iâ€™ve been waking up and thinking I just want to sleep forever, Iâ€™m just done with life and itâ€™s tedious endeavours. I just feel like nothing much brings me any joy. I keep trying to tell myself that sleeping forever and suicide arenâ€™t the same thing but Im realising that they basically are. Iâ€™m not an addict and never have been but my mind has been shrouded the constant thought of taking drugs to try and relieve my anguish. Itâ€™s like there is a hole, a dark, deep treacherous hole in my heart that I can never seem to fill. I have my self surrounded by people yet Iâ€™m still lonely. Iâ€™ve been trying to fill the hole in me with music and meditation but itâ€™s not working like it used to. I want my pain just to stop. Iâ€™m just done with existing. Life just seems so relentless.
