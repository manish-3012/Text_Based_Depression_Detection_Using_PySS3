Something has to changeI don't want to fight anxiety every day for the rest of my life. Its all my life consists of really, anxiety and panic attacks. Every day I want to end my life simply because of anxiety. I just don't see why I should keep fighting and living a mediocre life. The main cause of my anxiety is work. Not just my job, but work in general. Any job I've ever had has been a constant struggle to overcome anxiety, then depression and with depression comes suicidal thoughts. They get worse every day and at some point I will snap. Its not that I'm lazy and don't want to work. I don't mind hard work, it's all I've ever done, but I don't have any reason to keep going. I don't wanna live another 60, 70 years like this. And it's only getting worse. With the eclipse that's gonna come soon I was thinking of doing it on that day. Just as an interesting way to go out I guess. I dunno why I'm posting honestly. No one understand how I feel, not doctors or therapists, psychiatrists. None of them can fix what's wrong in my mind. My girlfriend has general anxiety and understands better than most. She's why I'm still going. I support her financially. She is a telemarketer and I'm a diesel tech so I make a majority of our income. We've both started smoking weed to help with our anxiety and it really does help. When I smoke I feel completely normal and happy. I wanna do things and start back up on hobbies. But I always end up coming back down. I can't smoke  at all and go to work with a job like mine so I go to work without any smoke and I'm miserable and break down at least once every day at work. I wanna be happy like I am smoking weed but it's impossible. And I can't afford to keep buying $90 in weed every 3 days to keep from looking what left of my mind. I can't quit my job because then I'd be homeless, we aren't far from it now.  I don't know what to do anymore. I'm at the end of my rope. I don't want to live anymore.
