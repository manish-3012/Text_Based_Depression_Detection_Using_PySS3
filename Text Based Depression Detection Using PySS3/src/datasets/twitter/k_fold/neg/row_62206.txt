Thinking of hanging myself with a beltI spent my entire savings working for 5 years ($15K) and every paycheck to support my mother and sister. They are ungrateful and complain about every single thing. I sacrificed dream job offers, hobbies, and social life. I don't have the guts or heart to cut them off.

I am approaching 30 very quickly and don't have anything to look forward to. I have no future.

It's almost 8:30 PM. I am alone in my room looking at the belt hanging from the closet door knob. I have high shelves in my closet. I am thinking of hanging myself with it.

Thoughts are persisting. I want to do something keep myself busy and my mind off of this.
