I got some work to absolutely hand in by tomorrow at noon, but I'm too depressed and suicidal to do anything right now. Can somebody talk to me for a bit?I just need someone to cheer me up.... The past few days have been hell. I'm a complete failure at everything and soon it looks like I'll fail at this job too. I'm considering getting some alcohol to numb my senses and focus better. Please....I think I'm really going to die if I fail AGAIN.
