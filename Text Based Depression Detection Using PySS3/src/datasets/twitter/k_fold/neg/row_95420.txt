I don't want to kill myself but right now its looking like a tempting option.My life literally has no meaning. It's just constant studying, work, crying silently in despair, hopeless expectations from overbearing parents and just anything else that would be plain bad. The only thing that I have going for me in any way is reddit and that feels cold and lacklustre.

I don't know what to do especially because of how badly I screwed up yesterday. Just when things are looking up for me my tiredness and despair get the better of me. Can't I get anything right or done right in life?

What point is there here for me? Because of that one mistake yesterday my whole life may come crashing down.  I just want to be loved and appreciated but because of who and where I was born those things are just so intangible. I want to love but don't think anyone will.

Please help me. Anyone. I just want support. Otherwise I don't know what to do. I don't.
