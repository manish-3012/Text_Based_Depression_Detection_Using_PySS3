Will a companion help me?I've been thinking lately about getting an animal to care for; I would like a chubby cat,  since I'm still living with family. I think this will help me, make me understand the world more, help me understand emotions and just cuddling with something seems... calming. Perhaps I'm just extremely lonely, I am 16 so it would make complete sense but I normally don't let such feelings impact me. 

Since a cat won't judge me for my looks, voice, or body, I thought that it would be great. I do have four other cats but they are exactly mine. I want to have a cat that is mine, no one else's.
