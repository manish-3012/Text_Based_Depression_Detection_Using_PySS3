I just don't know...I can't go on...I've been helping my suicidal friend out, trying to keep her alive because she is really my only true friend, but everyone tells me to stop worrying about her and worry about myself. I don't worry about myself at all, I could get hit by a bus all I care! All my dad cares about are my grades and my swimteam, and he's an extreme smoker, so he's always angry at me when I don't do something he likes. I get called worthless, a mess, and I can't do anything right. I'm not even living my own life, I'm living the life my dad wants me to have, I have no will to live. Why should I live if I don't even have a life? My parents are extremely arguemental, whether it's between themselves or to me. Whenever they yell at me, they throw out some hurting things, and I end up in tears. They laugh at me for being a child, why are they doing this? I don't even like myself, and they're making me feel even worse, they don't know I have to deal with my friend practically KILLING herself everyday! They say she's sucking the life out of me, she's killing me from within, but shes my best friend! I'm not just going to leave her in the streets! I'm just never good enough for anyone, and of I actually LIKED myself, I'd be fine, but I can't stand myself! I feel stupid!I wanna get rid of this place, I don't need a stupid savior, God aint gonna help me..
