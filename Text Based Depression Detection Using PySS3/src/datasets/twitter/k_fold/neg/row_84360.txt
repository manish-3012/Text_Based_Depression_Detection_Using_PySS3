the best days are liesTw: selfharm


How fucked up life must be, that the best moments are when I spend fantasizing or wrapped up in a story?

 I spend the day feeling like shit, until I gather enough courage to read some fantastic world in a book or get lost in the depths of my thoughts. I want to die so badly .... This life sucks. Every time I have to hurt myself more to feel something real. And sometimes I'm too tired even for that. I stopped taking the medicines to heal a new fucking disease that was detected this week ... Because I don't see the case at all ... It made no sense to get out of my violent marriage, nor did it make sense to believe that I could go back to school ... It made no sense at all. 

There is no point in waiting to fulfill a pathetic dream. I just want to die ... Although deep down... I know that if I try again ... I would fail again.
