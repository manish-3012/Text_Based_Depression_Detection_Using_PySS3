Please help?Can someone please tell me why I should live? I regret so much. I have things I'll never be able to take back or do over and not get so badly hurt. I'll never go back to being ignorant that people really didn't believe me. Was I really just being a drama queen like some of them thought? I know I put myself in a stupid situation and I know I said and did all the wrong things but I still thought someone would help if I told them I was hurt. It was so long ago but the humiliation comes back in waves again and again and again.
