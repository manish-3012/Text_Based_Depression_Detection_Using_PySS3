Logically, why shouldn't I do it?When people talk about being suicidal they're supposed to be really sad, right? I'm planning on killing myself because I don't see the point of continuing to be alive. It's not that I'm sad or depressed. To me it's like this: I'm going to die eventually. I don't believe that there is any form of life after death, or any overall "point" to being alive. 

In 100 years everyone that I know right now is going to be dead. There will come a time when nobody remembers the sound of my voice. My being here, right now, is absolutely pointless. I read Camus' "Myth of Sisyphus" because apparently that's supposed to be the answer to "why you shouldn't kill yourself" but I failed to see how his argument supports choosing life over death. If anything I found his argument to be pro-suicide. 

When people say "don't do it! think of all the good things that MIGHT happen, that you MIGHT miss out on" it makes me think about religious people who say you should believe in their god because there MIGHT be consequences like hell/reincarnation. It's pure speculation. 

I know I probably sound a little distanced and possibly not genuine but trust me, I sincerely plan on killing myself. I have what I need to do it.  I'm posting here because there's still a part of me that hopes that one of you can prove to me that there is a point to being alive. 

Thank you for reading.
