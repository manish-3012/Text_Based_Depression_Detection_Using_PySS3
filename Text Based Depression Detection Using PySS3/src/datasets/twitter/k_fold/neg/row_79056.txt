In my last few hours.. Even posting seems pointlessI am done. I cant even cry anymore. I am so sick of people telling me that I will be missed or to think of the profound impact I have had and how my absence will affect them. That's the problem though. I am a shell of a person because I give so much to everyone else and receive nothing in return. I am exhausted and worn and sucked dry. I have tried to live for me and it's beyond lonely and miserable. I just can't anymore.
