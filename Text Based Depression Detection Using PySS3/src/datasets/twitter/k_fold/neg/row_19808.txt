Just came to vent.I feel like iâ€™m a burden to everyone i love and that iâ€™m worthless. I want to die but i wouldnâ€™t want to hurt anyone i love. Iâ€™m happy, i really am. I love my boyfriend more than anything and my family and everyone in my life is so wonderful but itâ€™s just me. I feel like everyone would be better off w/out me. I feel like i will never do anything right and will never be able to make up for everything wrong iâ€™ve done. I feel like iâ€™m hopeless and worthless and iâ€™m dumb as a box of rocks and can never do anything right or make anyone happy. I feel like driving my car into a pole or a tree or the river but iâ€™m scared to. Iâ€™ll never follow thru i donâ€™t think because i love my life too much, i just feel like someone else should be living it because i donâ€™t deserve it.
