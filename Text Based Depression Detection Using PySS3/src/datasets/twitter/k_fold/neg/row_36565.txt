I cut myself for the first time on Saturday nightMy mum was at work, she took my sister with her so we wouldn't fight. I was left alone, again. I'm always left alone. I'm always left alone, mum and my sister go to dads all the time. So, on Saturday, i went into the kitchen got a knife, and cut my thighs. Only two of them were deep enough to cause scab things but i didn't bleed. Sadly.
