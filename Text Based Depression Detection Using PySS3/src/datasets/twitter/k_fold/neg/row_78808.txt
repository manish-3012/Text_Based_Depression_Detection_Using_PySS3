i don't think i can fix this anymorehello, and thanks for reading.

So i am here contemplating my options and the siren song of suicidal thoughts is calling stronger than usual.

here is the thing, i am a pretty fucked up person and have been as long as i can remember. I grew up in what i now consider a quite dysfunctional family, so i am very well trained in treading lightly in the minefield that is my parents relationship. Encopresis started when i was about 4 years old, only commentary by my parents were "you always seemed to like being dirty, were very enthusiastic about shitting your pants" after they heard about it from my kindergarden teacher, and that was that. I struggled with that about until way into my teens. Got bullied in school, had teachers who openly ridiculed me in class. After 4th grade i hunched really bad, only ever looked straight at the floor and stopped talking to people. I never got any help, and when i tried to talk to adults about my problems they were dismissive. I have heard it all, so you'd like to be special, you go self diagnosing for attention when you're just a lazy fuck... Got diagnosed with adhd and aspergers but apart from being given these labels no real help came from the doctors. I have basically given up and spend my days waiting for them to pass. Been doing that for over a decade now, living off support from my parents and gf. Have always tried to believe that i can in fact change myself but its very hard to keep going on. I feel like it takes huge amounts of awareness and discipline to move just an inch forwards but there is no resistance in the other direction and i'm feeling like i'm back on square one after every setback. The most infuriating setback is usually that i just can not seem to ever stand up for my self. Natural born victim and tired of it, the thought of killing myself is comforting and seems so obvious. :(
