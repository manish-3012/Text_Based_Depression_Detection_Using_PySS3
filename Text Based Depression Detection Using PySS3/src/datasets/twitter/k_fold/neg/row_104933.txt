It always comes back to thisI have a method in my room with me and it has been my safety net for a few months. I'm really wanting to use it.

No matter what happens I will hurt and others will hurt. Even if I end my pain, I will just transfer it plus more to anyone who cares. Even people who don't know me. People have been dying on the train lines lately and I am so sad for them when I hear. I don't even know them. It would be the same way. 

I never thought I was going to live to be an adult, it just didn't seem like a reality that would happen to me. As it gets closer it doesn't get any more realistic. I just can't let it happen. I'm never going to be ready for it. 

I forgot to go to work. That's a pretty dumb thing to start tonight's whole downward spiral. I have such an animalistic need to be excellent at my work. My worth hinges on it. And I just forgot to go. That's never happened before.

I am just not ready to grow up.
