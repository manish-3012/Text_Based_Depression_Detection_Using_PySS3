Feeling HopelessI can't see a future where I'd be happy. I've been fantasizing about dying since primary school, I've been self-harming before the age of 10 (not cutting, but stuff like pulling out my hair or scratching myself as punishment). I think, at this point, this misery might just be permanent. I'm so angry at how my life turned out. I know I had potential, I know I'm smart and talented, but all that went down the fucking drain because I'm just so fucking tired all the time. I can't focus long enough to do my homework. I can't get anything above 60% in exams. I'm going to have to apply to university with shitty grades, and people always spout this bullshit about \~grades don't matter\~ even though they blatantly fucking do. You don't get good grades, you don't get into a good university, you don't get a job. I can't hold half a conversation without inevitably humiliating myself. I don't know how to make friends. I spent my entire childhood having my brother and father deliberately upsetting me for fun, because they thought it would help me build emotional resilience. All I learned was that I couldn't ever show anyone I was hurting or they would hurt me even more and then laugh about it.

I'm so fucking done. I want a reset. I want to be what I could have been instead of what I am.
