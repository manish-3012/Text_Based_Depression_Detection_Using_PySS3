It would be a lot easier to give upAll I do is push. I've been pushing and pushing. I keep trying to find happiness and it gets shut off every time. The thing that makes me happiest is when I'm helping other people, when I see the joy in the eyes from doing anything, big or small. I take care of myself, too, I have passions and hobbies, goals. I do calligraphy and I love music. I have a great passion for coding, I'm very good at it.

But it's still just pushing. Nothing brings me happiness. I have too much weight on me. All of my actions are directed towards helping other people but that is losing it's luster. I don't get anything from it anymore. I do things for others and I see the joy and I just don't get a rush from it. So that means I should stop finding ways to make other people happy and find a way to make me happy. 

What if what I want is suicide? What if that is easier? If I finally look out for my interests and this is my interest, what, do I ignore it? Am I supposed to change it because it's wrong according to society? How is that looking out for my interests, then?

Why can't I be selfish? If killing myself is selfish then why can't I do it? Everyone is selfish. Everyone looks out for themselves, their best interests. And if in my mind, the best path is to end it, why should I care what anyone else thinks? If it's justified in my mind then why do I have to justify it to anyone else? I don't get joy from anything. If I'm supposed to look out for me, like everyone else, then how am I wrong?

Seriously tell me! How am I wrong? Because it makes sense to me and if something makes sense to me I do it. Would it destroy other people? Yes! But they've all done it to me, too, so why should I care?

Is it a cop out? A cowardly move? No. Tell me I owe it to others not to do it. I don't owe anyone anything. Besides, living to owe other people is no way to live.
