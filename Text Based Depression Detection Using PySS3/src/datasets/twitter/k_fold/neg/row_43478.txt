I want it to endI just got done having a really fun night of bowling and now I want to die. It just hit in the middle of a game and I was having so much fun. Then it was like I ran into a wall. I'm petty sure they noticed and were talking about it every time I went up. I really just want to end this cycle of disappointment and I really don't know how much longer I can hang in.
