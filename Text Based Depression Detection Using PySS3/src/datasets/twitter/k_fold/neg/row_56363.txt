Plan/ crisisMy plan- suicide plan- safety plan- escape plan- feels like the only way out plan. 


I want to make everyone else happy. 
To do that I need to fight. 
I want to make myself happy. 
To do that itâ€™s not to fight. 

For the first time in my life- I feel like the world is a peaceful place. 

Iâ€™m an adult now- I can make my own decisions. I can now legally chose if I want to end my life or not. 
I do. 
Why? 
Not because of you. 
But because of me. 
Iâ€™m not ok! 
And no matter how many times I tell someone they donâ€™t listen, or they do, they just donâ€™t care! 

Crisis- donâ€™t care. 
Social worker- wait? Whoâ€™s that? 

Ring crisis tell them Iâ€™m struggling- just make me feel worse... oh and of course Iâ€™ll get medical attention if I feel Somethings wrong... 
like no! Iâ€™m not! 
Why would I even think about getting medial attention? 

Whatâ€™s the point of crisis? 
Just to put you in crisis? ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜­
I didnâ€™t think I could feel worse.
