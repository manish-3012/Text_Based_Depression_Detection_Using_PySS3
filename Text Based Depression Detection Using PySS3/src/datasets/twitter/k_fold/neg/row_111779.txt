Why do so many of us want to die?I might be asking on the wrong subreddit but I also have suicidal thoughts. My reasons are probably way less severe than any of yours. I feel worthless, That I have nothing to contribute. No special skills or talents, no interest. No one needs me since they have others. I can't study since I hate myself so much and I can't find work unless I get a degree in something. The competition for low-end jobs is tough since even those need certain degrees. I still live with my mom when most others live on their own. She is a bit tricky to live with. I don't think she is noticing how bad I feel. She wants me to do more when I already feel like I'm at my limit. I wrote a will yesterday but I haven't decided yet if I'm gonna do it or not. Sorry if it's not convincing. I get that. It's just another thing that I'm apparently worthless at. 

So what are your reasons? 
Hope I'm not breaking any rules. I'm only asking for the reasons not the methods.
