I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with meIâ€™ve never lived a hard life. Iâ€™m only 18. I have a decent support group around me and i feel like I would be doing no one but myself a favour by offing myself. I just donâ€™t understand anymore. Whatâ€™s the point in going on if we all just die in the end. Iâ€™ve considered just veering off the side of the road but the thought that i might vegetate myself scares me even more then that great beyond. I know this might come across as attention seeking but i literally donâ€™t know what to do with myself. I just canâ€™t seem to get happy anymore. I get false happiness from abusing, alcohol mostly where iâ€™ve had my stomach pumped at least 5 times. I just donâ€™t know how to feel anything anymore.
