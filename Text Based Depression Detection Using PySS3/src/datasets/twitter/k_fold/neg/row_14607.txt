I canâ€™t cry anymoreI just feel empty with no thoughts or emotion. I canâ€™t even hold a conversation with my anybody in my family or people my age and I canâ€™t express my feelings to anyone because I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m feeling. I feel like Iâ€™m just a blank worthless piece of shit and I feel like shit deep down because I canâ€™t connect with my family or friends. Iâ€™m an 18 yr old male going to college in the fall.
