I did something terrible tonight
I hurt myself. Not physically but emotionally and mentally. I have a officially been broken. I repeat the same pattern every damn time. But I never change. God what would my past self say to me now. Probably, â€œWhat tf did you do? Bro we canâ€™t  turn out like thisâ€. Old was stronger but also obviously. The current is struggling to survive and knows too much. All these thoughts and action that I have in my mind I canâ€™t share to my childhood friends because Iâ€™m so goddamn ashamed. Only my therapist can know but she canâ€™t tell me what to do. Only organize my thoughts clearly.
