Suicide is logical for those who only want to live foreverThe argument is this:

I don't want to die i.e. I want to live forever.

I have to die i.e. I can't live forever.

So to fix the problem that occurs with

not wanting to die
having to die
One can believe that they will never die/it is possible to never die. Sadly, most people aren't dumb enough to think that.

Another option is to care about something else. Sadly, I don't think this is possible, not for me at least. I only want to live forever. Not being able to won't change who I am i.e. it won't make me want or care about something else.

So the only option left is to stop caring about living forever i.e. want to die i.e. suicide.

Obviously, if a person cared about entertainment/hobbies or people or idk, they'd care about something other than living forever, thereby giving themselves a reason to live. But this isn't possible for some people, like me.
