Iâ€™m gonna kill myself tomorrow. I just feel sad that it has to end like this.Iâ€™m 24. I have nothing. I still live with my family like a parasite because I live in a damn country where minimum wage is $20 per month. I tried to work on other stuff but I just suck. I canâ€™t code. Iâ€™m not good at it, and I just hate it. I canâ€™t do video editing because my internet connection is so shitty that I canâ€™t download files. I tried writing but no one would hire me because Iâ€™m not native speaker. Iâ€™m too shy and quiet to work on Customer Service, Sales and Marketing. All I have in savings is $20. I have loans that Iâ€™m probably never gonna be able to pay and it makes me so sad and stressed.

Every single day I just feel tired, alone and just sad, depressed and like a failure. I donâ€™t even have a college degree. I wasnâ€™t able to write my final dissertation because of my depression and anxiety.

I have no one. No friends, no partner, and my family just sucks and reminds me every day that Iâ€™m a failure and Iâ€™m never gonna achieve anything. They just keep making me feel so bad because Iâ€™m depressed. I just feel alone every single day. I canâ€™t connect with anyone. Everyone on the internet feels like the same person. It got to the point where I canâ€™t enjoy things that are supposed to be enjoyed, like eating and having sex. I just feel nothing. 

With this pandemic + my countryâ€™s situation Iâ€™m just gonna go nowhere. Iâ€™d rather just die tomorrow that keep feeling desperate every single day. Iâ€™m gonna hang myself tomorrow night once my family is asleep. It should be quick I hope.

And I donâ€™t know why am I sharing this, but anyways. Thanks if you read this for taking your time to read the words of a desperate stranger.
