How I sleep at nightThis might not be the right sub to post on. Sorry if this is the case. New to Reddit.

Does anyone else find comfort in the fact that they might die soon? I'm not suicidal (I think), but every night I fall asleep by imagining that I die. I don't know whether this counts as suicidal thoughts-- where my therapist is concerned-- but it feels pretty normal?

In my head, I pretend that I die. I release all the anxiety and stress that's in my life, and by doing this, I'm comforted and am able to sleep better. The idea that my life could end, and that I might either survive somehow unburdened by life, or cease to exist completely, is comforting so much that I wish those two options were the case instead of this one.

I most often imagine drowning, being stabbed or shot, or falling from a great height. I've imagined a lot more ways to die, but these are the most frequent.

Is this normal? Or suicidal?
