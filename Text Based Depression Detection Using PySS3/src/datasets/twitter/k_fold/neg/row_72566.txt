Iâ€™m sick of being bullied and abused, Iâ€™m too old for this shit and Iâ€™m tired. This might be my third attempt I just donâ€™t have anything to use yet.I guess a bit of a background is I have post traumatic stress / anxiety / heart issues / bipolar and I am epteltic and Austic Anoreic fucking everything
I wanna die because Iâ€™m so fucking dramatic I ruin everyoneâ€™s day, and Iâ€™m so subhuman and stupid Iâ€™m just not worth being around. 
My ex just sexually abused me and heâ€™s continuing to manipulate and abuse me, they say when someone canâ€™t abuse you anymore they change what people think of you, and they do. I have friends in my life who snap at me and block me for doing the littlest things Iâ€™m bullied for doing drugs / and sleeping with the same gender. I just canâ€™t fucking take it. I donâ€™t know why I was put in this fucking world. Iâ€™ve never did anything fucking good, and Nobody will ever see anything fucking good in me, I just donâ€™t wanna be alone, I donâ€™t wanna live. Iâ€™m sick of fucking taking up room. I canâ€™t fucking take this anymore, I canâ€™t. When I tried to kill my self last time ex who takes advantage of me said lmao, I woke up seizing and I had to do everything on my fucking own. I wish I wasnâ€™t so fucking sad and pathetic all of the time, I wish I didnâ€™t spend all of that time being yelled at. I canâ€™t fucking take this, Iâ€™m so fucking scared of everything. I have blades, and glass, and I guess now Iâ€™m not at work my fresh / open scars wonâ€™t have to be hidden anymore
