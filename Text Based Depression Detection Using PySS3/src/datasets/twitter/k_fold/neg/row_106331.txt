Please...please...someone, anyone...all I want to do is die nowI hate everything. I'm really seriously very seriously thinking of just gassing myself Wednesday. I can't relate to anyone. I am screaming trying to reach out and am met w silence, indifference...just put a bullet in my head someone. I can't stand feeling so small and insignificant. No one notices or cares about anything that is happening to me with me or what has happened. Just someone please put a bullet in my fucking head you can look at my post history. People say I can talk to them, but I try to and just get ghosted. I've been trying so hard just to find someone to talk to. My family's completely abandoned me too. Oh God I don't have a choice but to kill myself do I. I can't interact with anyone. I simply can't, I never do anything right, so I might as well be in the ground then to continue living my life fucking up.
