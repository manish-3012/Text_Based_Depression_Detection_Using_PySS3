Body dysmorphia is making me suicidalThe past month, save the last week, has been going so well. Iâ€™ve made so many friends and put myself out there socially. Everyday I look forward to talking to them and laughing with them and they really seem to enjoy talking to me. I even decided I was doing so well that I chose not to start medication for my depressive episodes because I really thought I could get happy by myself. Iâ€™ve even almost completely overcame my disordered eating habits, I havenâ€™t counted calories in two months. 

But body dysmorphia is the one thing I canâ€™t beat. The more time I spend in social situations the worse it gets. Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m becoming so obsessive and controlling with my behaviors regarding my appearance. Itâ€™s so fucking tiring. I spend hours picking out outfits, trying them on, and throwing rejected clothes into huge piles on my bed. Every time I wash my hair I blow dry it, straighten it, and curl it. I go to the bathroom multiple times during the day to reapply my makeup and check my appearance. I spend hours flipping pictures of myself to analyze my facial asymmetry. I skipped a class today because I felt my thighs chafe when I was naked getting ready and had a mental breakdown. 

I once wanted to kill myself because I was overwhelmingly sad and lonely. Now I just crave death because Iâ€™ll finally be free of my body. No more thoughts of self loathing. It sounds so freeing not having to inhabit this contorted sack of flesh anymore. 

Iâ€™m doing everything I can to fight this. Yes I have a therapist. Yes I have supportive friends and family who I can talk to. I donâ€™t have Instagram. I understand the psychology behind the way I feel, and logically know that Iâ€™m an attractive girl with a very nice body and many nice features. 

But body dysmorphia is always there. I donâ€™t know how else to try and fight it. All I want is release. Iâ€™m so sick of living like this.
