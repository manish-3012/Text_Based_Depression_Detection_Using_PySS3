A successful, positive taleHey there /r/suicidewatch, throwaway account here. I'm no stranger to this subreddeit.

I have Borderline Personality tendencies with a physical, unseen disability which I recently had surgery for and have been feeling crap about for the last 6 weeks or so, and mental the peaks and troughs are just...well anyone who is or has experienced depressed knows how tiring this can be.

Anyway, earlier this week, after a really manic high I wrote out a note - well more an essay now I have "come back to Earth" and looked at it (I can't bear to read it). After this I grabbed some smart clothes and knew my family were asleep at 04:00, so off I went, resigned to the fact I was gone already. This just confirmed it - my plan involved a train. But I don't want to appear to solicit anything. You don't need details. This place has a relatively high rate of suicide so I hope this will help someone.

Anyway, after a talk to my Doctor earlier today, I plucked up the courage, overcame the panic attacks and walked my puppy.
I also decided to [leave a note next to the hotline](http://imgur.com/tRAqm) for those who have the same idea as me.

It may seem "rambl-ey" but it's in good spirits and intentions.
I thought I would share it here, just to let you all know that despite the despair, tiresome depression and never-ending cycle, there is a way out. And not suicide.

I apologise if anyone is offended or annoyed at this. I don't want to gloat. At all. If even one person knows there is somebody out there who can help and show someone who is as their wits' end they are not alone, my experience and decision to put this up was not in vain.

There is also a song by the British band "The Streets" called *["On the edge of a cliff"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFLdIGNUKuw)* which is a good listen (I find). [Here's the lyrics](http://www.metrolyrics.com/on-the-edge-of-a-cliff-lyrics-streets.html).

Thank you.
