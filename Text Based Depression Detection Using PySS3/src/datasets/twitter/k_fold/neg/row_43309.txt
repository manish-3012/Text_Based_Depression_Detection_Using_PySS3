My bf of almost 10 yrs killed himself and now I want to as wellI know there is another subreddit for people who have lost someone to suicide but since I feel this way myself I felt it made sense to post here too.

He did it on July 27th. He developed schizophrenia 3 years ago and was never able to get the auditory hallucinations under control with medicine, so I guess he just gave up. He didnâ€™t leave a note or give any indication that he was doing it. I was the last to speak to him, it was a casual conversation, there was no goodbye, just silence.

He was my first love. We met when we were 17. Iâ€™m 26 &amp; 1/2 now.  I guess one of the reasonâ€™s this is so hard on me is because my parents &amp; grandparents died when I was a kid, aunts and uncles when I was a teen. I have very few family left.  He was the first person that made me feel loved since I was a little girl; he was my foundation.

Distractions and my 2 good friends are the only things that have kept me going thus far. I went on a month long vacation only a few days after he died just so I didnâ€™t have to sit at home and face it. Then I threw myself into school but itâ€™s all slowly falling apart. The therapy, the antidepressants arenâ€™t really helping anymore even with raised doses. I canâ€™t remember anything, I breakdown crying in public, I canâ€™t listen to music.

I often find myself on the floor in tears holding his little box of ashes apologizing to no one. I feel immense guilt. Maybe I didnâ€™t make him feel loved enough this year. I was too busy moving into my apartment to always reply to his texts. He would tell me he missed me and sometimes Iâ€™d ignore it. I think overtime I started to feel like less of a girlfriend and more of a caretaker and it might have given me some resentment. And Iâ€™d always be worried about where he was bc sometimes heâ€™d just disappear. But now Iâ€™m just full of regret. 

I keep thinking if I had just been nicer this year, if I had just devoted to him my full attention, if I had just dropped school like I did before to be there for him 24/7 in order to make sure he was okay, if I had accepted his invitation to go to Cali... there was so much more that could have gone differently... all of this could have changed things. And everyone tells me that I couldnâ€™t help what he did, that schizophrenics have high suicide rates, that he wasnâ€™t in his right state of mind, etc. but none of that means anything to me. Point is, I could have made it a little bit easier on him. I could have made sure that he knew he was loved before he did it and maybe if I had done that I wouldnâ€™t feel so miserable, I wouldnâ€™t hate myself so much.

And even though I absolutely dread sitting around crying, self-loathing, wishing I was dead... I feel I donâ€™t deserve to get better. Itâ€™s probably why my heart is not into therapy and putting in effort to actually overcome this. Instead I try to punish myself. Iâ€™ve become very self-destructive which isnâ€™t like me at all.  It feels almost unfair to keep living my life while he is dead. Even if he would want that for me, heâ€™s not here to tell me so... and even if he was, Iâ€™d still feel I was insulting him if I were to ever be happy, meet someone else, have a life. I feel like a part of me died with him and it never gets any easier. I donâ€™t want to keep waking up feeling like this everyday but I also donâ€™t think I deserve any better, so the only solution I can see is to just do what he did.... either Iâ€™ll see him again or I wonâ€™t... but even nothingness would be better.  

Iâ€™m just scared to do it. Iâ€™m scared of the pain. He used a gun but I donâ€™t have one yet; Iâ€™m not really into any of the other methods for various reasons. Right now thatâ€™s the only stuff that is holding me back. I donâ€™t think suicide is selfish, I donâ€™t blame him at all, he must have been in so much more agony than he let the world see. If I did do it, I can only hope anyone who does care about me would understand eventually like I understand him.
