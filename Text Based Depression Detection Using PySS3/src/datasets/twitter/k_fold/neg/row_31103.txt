im non bianary and have a name and pronouns  
but they/them aren't pronouns to anyone apparently  


im sick of it. I cant correct anyone cause they wont listen. i cant get help cause my parents would never take me to a support group. im tired of trying to correct someone before getting yelled at. im tired of it all. i cant even get a car or license cause i dont have the money. im just...tired. but no one cares about what i think.   


im either an it, she, or always wrong.
