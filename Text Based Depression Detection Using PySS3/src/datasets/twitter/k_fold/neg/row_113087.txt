Hating college and suicidal againI recently started college here at Akron 3 hours away from my home. I don't drive so I'm pretty much stuck up here. I thought I would love it here the new environment and a way to make myself a new me. So far it's been the exact opposite I'm in a frat so that's cool but my classes for my major (nursing) are just crazy hard and Idk if I should switch majors or not or what to do. Idk if I even wanna be this far away from home anymore. I had major depressive disorder and anxiety and slight OCD racing thoughts mostly. I was really excited to start nursing and become a pychiatric nurse when I graduate but from where I am now that may never happen. Every day I am always anxious about either my social life or studying 4 hours a day or whatever else may happen. Lately I've just been laying in bed thinking of what to write in a note. And falling asleep thinking of when and how to end it all. I've been suicidal before and thought about it a lot really it has never left the back of my mind for 4 years. I guess I'm just bummed because I have barely any friends and having just a hard time. This summer me and my friends really became brothers and they all stayed together at local college because they don't have the money to come to a actual university but maybe they made the right decision. Idk what to think or say to my mom. Because I quit everything in life and I don't wanna quit college to. If anyone wants to talk please comment or pm me if you have experienced the same thing I am. I'm not very good at explaining things in text.
