I"ve never thought about Suicide Until nowIâ€™m in a dark space right now. Iâ€™ve been so independent in my life and I have been ok with that. BUT, I have a girlfriend and I love her so damn much and just expect her to be there when Iâ€™ve been in a rough patch and vice versa.

I have been telling myself everyday that Iâ€™m mentally strong. But I have had the worst 6 months of my life and I feel as if itâ€™s just come to a boiling point. I lost friends to suicide \(3 friends\), and I had to quit anything sport related or stress related as I had Wolff Parkinson white Syndrome. Then had heart surgery, and I felt like I received no love from anyone except partialIy from my mum. have been through absolute hell. And Iâ€™ve tried so hard to be head strong and push through.

I feel like a ghost, as if Iâ€™m not heard. I felt like I was created to change the world but right now I feel as if Iâ€™m worthless. My girlfriend and I seem to never have an â€˜opportunityâ€™ to speak about these things. Iâ€™ve tried and tried because I know itâ€™s the right thing to do. And again. No response.

Iâ€™m so upset and need someone to help me Iâ€™ve helped So many of my friends and others with issues but feel like Iâ€™m not worth that help.

Iâ€™m in tears right now. The one person that I could of spoken to has moved over seas and he isnâ€™t here to help.

Iâ€™m sorry but Iâ€™m one bad incident away from ending this right now
