I can't do it anymoreFor the first time, I genuinely have nothing. Like, yeah, friends always sucked and school was hard and my family was annoying and boys were all too much. 

Now Iâ€™m in my second year in college and Iâ€™ve never wanted to end it all as much as I want right now. I donâ€™t desire anything anymore. Iâ€™ve accepted that my â€œfriendsâ€ donâ€™t give a fuck about me, today they literally made plans excluding me in front of me, and were to busy ignoring me to go in the lab so I couldnâ€™t even finish what I was doing (they wouldnâ€™t open the lab for just one person). 

Iâ€™m also a disappointment to my family and Iâ€™m never gonna find a guy that actually likes me for me and doesnâ€™t treat me like shit and Iâ€™m probably not gonna make it through college. And truth is, I donâ€™t care anymore. Itâ€™s all too much and at the same time, itâ€™s nothing, I just donâ€™t feel anything. I just want to curl in bed and stare at the wall and thatâ€™s sadly the only moment I feel something. 

Iâ€™m about to fail my exams again, and then Iâ€™m probably killing myself. I donâ€™t even like what Iâ€™m studying, and Iâ€™m probably gonna get a sucky job when Iâ€™m done so whatâ€™s the point. 

I really, really canâ€™t do it anymore. 

Sorry for the long text, just needed to get it all out.
