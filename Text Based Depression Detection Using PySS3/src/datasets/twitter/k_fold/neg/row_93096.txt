Work all day to come home to nothingI spend most of my time working, usually coming home around midnight to find my girlfriend asleep. She's gone to work before I even get up and we don't talk much. When we do talk, it's just arguing about money or cleaning or whatnot. I don't think she loves me anymore and it hurts more than anything. I don't have anything else to fall back on. I don't have anywhere to go if we do split and I have to move

There's nothing else for me. Why should I even be here and go through this?
