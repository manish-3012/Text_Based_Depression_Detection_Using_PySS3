I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m truly suicidal anymore but I have been in the past. My mental state has been getting worse and I feel like any day now I may slip back into it. Iâ€™m terrified because the thoughts just feel so comfortable and right. I want to liveI feel like the name of this sub is a really good description of how I think most of the time. I always have to be on watch with myself, cutting myself off when thinking of suicide or how easy it would be or how if things go wrong itâ€™ll be all right because death is always a backup plan. Itâ€™s been so long since I last felt this way, I thought Iâ€™d made so much progress. But lately Iâ€™ve been so critical of myself and when I look in the mirror I see so many flaws. I want to cry all the time and sometimes for no reason and I beat myself up over such little mistakes. I donâ€™t recognize myself anymore and yet I see so much of the 13 year old me at the same time. I can barely remember what it felt like to be confident in myself but there were almost 5 years there where things were going great. How could I let this happen to me? All the time I am just waiting for my life to fall apart so that I can die. Iâ€™m scared that it will no matter what and Iâ€™m scared that my constant thinking about that is only going to make it happen quicker. I donâ€™t want to be passive but I donâ€™t have energy or the will.
