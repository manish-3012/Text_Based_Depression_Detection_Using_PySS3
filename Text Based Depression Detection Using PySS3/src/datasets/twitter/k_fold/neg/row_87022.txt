Maybe itâ€™s time to become a statistic.31 years old, girlfriend that loves me but also has many many issues herself. Alcoholic, on probation for DUI just recently started outpatient therapy again.

Iâ€™m also 31 with an alcohol problem, making a car payment for a car I canâ€™t even drive or sell cause Iâ€™m upside down in it now.

Playing cat and mouse with the alcohol treatment facility I go to taking RC Benzos to keep it together while popping dirty on every immunoassay and clean in every gc/ms lab test theyâ€™ve just determined one of the bodybuilding supplements i take my intestine digests into a metabolite very similiar that of a benzo.

I walk 4 miles a day to make $13 an take the bus for a total of like an hour and 45 minutes combined. My 8 hour days are like 12.

Iâ€™m tired, I donâ€™t talk to my family much, currently living with my grandparents or Iâ€™d be homeless. Most of my money goes to my car and my self paying for alcohol treatment cause I donâ€™t qualify for free healthcare, and canâ€™t afford real healthcare.

I feel like a burden to most people, I truly think my girlfriend would be better off finding somebody more successful sheâ€™s had guys offer to buy her a car, sheâ€™s good looking and bartends and stays with me for some reason. Feel like an anchor. I recently argued with her mom (she lives with her mom, she has an autistic 3 year old it takes both of them to care for him who I also consider like my own son Iâ€™ve been around since he was like 7 months) anyway she banned me from coming over now weâ€™re back to basically going on dinner dates, I donâ€™t get to see my â€œsonâ€ as weâ€™ve decided to just go with that, not step son as Iâ€™m the only man heâ€™s ever met. Donâ€™t even get the pleasure of that anymore.

Itâ€™s a daily battle not to go get a hotel room for a week spend the rest of my measly $2400 gambling and drinking and then just drink a fifth and OD. I have enough powdered RC drugs to Kill like 10 people combined with alcohol with, I promise you I will not wake up if I decide to OD, Iâ€™d be drinking at least a 5th to myself and taking at least the equivalent of a few 100mg of Xanax. I go to sleep thinking about doing it itâ€™s almost s comfort thing knowing I can and picking a date to do it after payday so I can just throw my phone off the freeway and have some fun by myself for a bit and just go out on my terms.

Thanks for reading If you did, I needed to rant
