Why Should I Live for Others?I do love the people in my life. But ultimately if I choose to go, the consequences and the pain I cause (If I even cause pain) wonâ€™t matter. Future opportunities wonâ€™t matter. What Iâ€™ll miss out on doesnâ€™t matter. All it means is that I wonâ€™t have to drag on 

I wonâ€™t have to struggle through the crippling pain, the PTSD episodes, the DID, the insomnia, the existential pain that I use drugs and alcohol to get through. 

Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m not trying though. I go to therapy, I want to get better. Iâ€™m taking my meds. Iâ€™m trying so hard to find reasons to stay but every second that passes Iâ€™m losing my will. 

Why should I not indulge in vices and let them kill me. At least Iâ€™d go out on a high.

Iâ€™ve called hotlines, and Iâ€™ve been hospitalized. All it does is really just postpone the decision. Throw me in a hospital and restrain me. What then?

What if some people canâ€™t get better. 

What if some people canâ€™t function.

If Iâ€™m going to be in so much pain and fear and paranoia, despite years of taking meds and actively trying to get better, what is the fucking point. 

Why should I suffer so others donâ€™t have to.

If I isolate myself enough. If I distance myself enough eventually I wonâ€™t be a part of anyoneâ€™s life so why should I stay. 

The things â€œIâ€™ll miss out onâ€ donâ€™t matter. What matters is now. And now is unbearable. 

If  Iâ€™m living for others then does that mean my needs and my struggle matter less than what could actually be the right path for me?

I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t want anyone to kill themselves. Iâ€™m tired and confused. Iâ€™m so exhausted. Iâ€™ve pushed myself to be sober. Iâ€™ve pushed myself to go back to school. Iâ€™ve forced myself to find reasons to live. Iâ€™m trying to take it minute bu minute. But nothing is getting better. 

Please someone. Tell me why I should stay
