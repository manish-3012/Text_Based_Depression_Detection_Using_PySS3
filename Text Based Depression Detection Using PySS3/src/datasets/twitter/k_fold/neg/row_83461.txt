i cant stop thinking about it everits like no matter what, i cant stop thinking about it. earlier this year i decided id end things when the summer ended because ive just gotten done with my senior yr of high school and by the end of the summer all my friends will be gone far away at college and ill still be here. idk i just think of my future and literally none of it appeals to me or has me looking forward to anything. all i can think about is how fantastic itll feel to just let everything go at the end of the summer and just feel absolutely nothing for once. im sick of the crushing sadness thats always looming behind me. its like even when im happy theres this sadness in the background waiting for even the slightest bit of unhappiness to strike and fuck me up. i want to feel nothing. im so tired. i have no motivation and no excitement for the future. i cant even picture myself in the future. it just feels like things are supposed to be over. im done. im just finished with everything.
