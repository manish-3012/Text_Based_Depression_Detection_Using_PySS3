All I think about is killing myselfThat's right, I think about killing myself. All. The. Time. When I was 9 I tried to hang myself. It was a very impulsive attempt that obviously didn't work. It just left me with a rope burn around my neck that no one, including teachers, parents, and classmates even questioned. 


Fast forward nearly 2 decades later and I wish I would have died that day. I can honestly say nothing has happened in my life that has made me happy to be alive. 


My mom just calls me a "depressed bitch" that "makes everyone else miserable." Honestly, she's right... my misery is toxic. By NOT killing myself I'm being selfish. I'm so numb right now I just want to end this existence as quick and painless as possible.
