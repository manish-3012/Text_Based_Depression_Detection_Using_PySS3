I want to kill myself, but if I fail my mom will make me leave universityBasically, what do I do? I kinda want to die, I've started cutting again, this time with knives, instead of thumbtacks, and now I cut along my chest instead of just my arm. So, yeah, I like, really, reaaaallly want to die, but, if I don't do it 100% correctly, my mom will make me go back home? I'm sick of being lonely, sick of hating myself, sick of being unable to relate to anyone. Thought I had a shot with this really cool girl, but, now she's pushing me away and we're growing distant, I know she had a boyfriend, but, I don't know, I mean, she said she liked me and wanted to be with me, but she chose him. I honestly have nothing to live for and my depression is once again severely depressed. I hate every aspect of my worthless fucking life. What do I do? Oh, worst part, since we never told anyone that we've done things together, I have to constantly hear about her fucking boyfriend when everyone else is around, even though I don't want to. Just wish I had a gun to end my fucking life with, lol
