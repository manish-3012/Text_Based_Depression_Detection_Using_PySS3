Talking to people makes it worseWhen I try to talk to people or become involved in anything socially, I just embarrass myself and my suicidal thoughts just get worse. Even little things make me seriously consider it. The other day I almost tripped over a chair and someone saw and laughed. I literally thought about killing myself for 5 solid minutes so I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with things like this anymore. Its pretty fucking stupid that I would ever end my life over a chair, but of course, life, uh, finds a way. 

Anyway, it really discourages me from going out in public because I know it will end like this. Being socially awkward and having ADD doesnâ€™t help. I always say stupid things and Iâ€™m ALWAYS aware of the stupidity of what I say. And I seriously just do not ever improve.
