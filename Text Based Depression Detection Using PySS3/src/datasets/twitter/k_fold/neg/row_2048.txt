My fellow friends, I'm looking for your help.I've spent many nights reading through this wonderful community and utilizing the beautiful comments left on these  posts in hopes that something, anything, will resonate with me and give me a moment of relief from the dark ugly thoughts that surround me. Lately, it's been nothing but hell. I don't want to kill myself. I really don't want to. I don't want to, but doesn't it look so nice? I hate that I want to kill myself. Anything to escape this constant terrifying adrenaline. This constant guilt. This constant self loathing. My mind is tricking me and I'm buying it. 
I have lost my father and very close friend to suicide and spent years working passionately against the cause. How did this happen to me?
I feel like I'm the type of girl that nobody would suspect hates herself so much, spends so much time just trying to convince herself there is something worth living for, that nobody lends a hand. In their defense, I don't ask.  I don't even want to go to my counsellor anymore because I feel so fucking guilty making her listen to me over and over, complaining about the same god damn thing. 
I feel as if I've run out of coping mechanisms that work. And I don't want to pull the plug on my life. But unfortunately I really REALLY do. I just feel like I can't suffer for very much longer. Anyway... I guess what I'm asking is for your help. What are your coping mechanisms... Not the bullshit, take a bath, have a tea garbage that only discourages you into hating yourself more. Does anyone have any quotes, pictures, songs, stories, activities, recovery experiences that they found helpful?
I can't really even believe I'm writing this, and have this weird sense of embarrassment even though I'm totally anonymous right now, but you guys.. I'm just so desperate.
