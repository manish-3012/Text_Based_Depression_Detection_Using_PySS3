I took a lot of paracetamol and didn't feel anything.Long story short, I'm, 23M, 6'3 and a lanky 80kg (175lbs). I was in a dark place about 3 weeks ago, and took a lot of 500mg paracetamol (acetaminophen). One day I took 26 tablets and felt a little bit dizzy but nothing too serious. Everything went back to normal(ish) and tried again this time taking 38 500mg tablets, again to nothing more serious than a little nausea for a few days.

Does anyone know why this didn't kill me?

Update: I have decided I regretted both these actions at the time, and am now seeking proper help for my insomnia and major depression. Psychiatrist has put me on paroxetine and quetiapine (for sleep) as sertraline (zoloft) wasn't working for me.

P.S Sorry if there's bad grammar I'm still in a sleep deprived state.
