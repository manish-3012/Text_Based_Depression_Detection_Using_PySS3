And so it will end.i really have nothing more going for me. An old friend of mine conveniently pointed it out. Its all gone to hell, I am a student, I am poor, I suffer from depression, and I cannot hold a relationship. 

I have done everything I can to better my life, medication, trying my hardest to be positive but all ended up with me falling flat on my face.

I sent in my resume to 20 or so companies to try and get something going in Aerospace, but I can't do anything to make them actually want to talk to me. Its a rough field for a college kid, I am aware, but its just disheartening to know that I am not wanted, and thus I feel unintelligent as can be.

I really don't know where else to turn. There is too much wrong and not enough heart left to begin fixing it. I come to you Reddit because you don't judge, you just listen.

Its just tearing me apart, and I feel so lost, so useless. If anyone can at least be my friend for an hour, I would appreciate it because I feel so alone, and so close to being dead, despite the fact I am breathing.

I want to live, I just don't have the heart to live any longer.
