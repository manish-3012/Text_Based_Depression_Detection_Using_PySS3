How to make my walk to work less of a temptation?There is a very busy interstate that I cross over on my way to work each morning.  I walk, as I have no other means of transportation, and recently it's become very hard to make it across the bridge without having to convince myself not to walk up to the actual interstate and throw myself in front of a car.  

There are no alternate routes I could take.  I have tried doing things like listening to music as a distraction and attempted to call my counselor once, but I'm behind on my phone bill and don't have service at the moment.  

I mentioned this to my fiance and he immediately told me that I had to quit working, but we pretty desperately need the money.  I think things have the potential to get better, but as things are, I don't know if I can make it to that point.
