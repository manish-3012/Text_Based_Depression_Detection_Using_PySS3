I wish I was betterI wish I was pretty and didnâ€™t need filters I wish my hands were smaller I wish my feet was smaller I wish I didnâ€™t feel like I had to do whatever someone wanted so they would like me I wish I didnâ€™t hate myself so much I wish I had friends I wish my family actually cared about me I wish I was still a Virgin I wish I was better I wish I was never born I would be so much happier
