Help, from a concerned friendIâ€™ve just received a heavy text from a friend (f18) of mine, who i met a couple months ago... She started by saying how much she appreciates our friendship and how much she values our time spent together. I was a bit worried to begin with, as this was not how she usually acts. Her sweet and lovable personality wasnâ€™t shining through her texts as normal. She went on to explain how sheâ€™s been feeling empty and desperate. She described it as a pit, that she has previously tried to fill with drugs and alcohol. She also told me about her past traumatic experiences at school; Getting bullied to the point where people would throw her to the ground and kick her in the stomach, till sheâ€™d run to the bathroom to cough up blood. Or when she got slammed into the changing roomsâ€™ mirror, and while the glass shards cut deep into her skin, they punched her and left her bleeding alone until her mother called the school at 5:45pm, because she wasnâ€™t home on time. Or the countless amounts of times sheâ€™d be emotionally manipulated and abused, by her friends, peers and family. Or about how she once almost strangled her younger brother (by 2 years) while they were just playing a game, her emotions took ahold of her and her anger spiraled out of control and she couldnâ€™t stop herself, she described it as though she was in a trance and felt like *she* wasnâ€™t controlling herself anymore. When she heard her brother choking and kicking she released. She tried to kill her self 4 times, each time was unsuccessful because of minor inconveniences that interrupted her. There were loads more awful stories that she told me, I was crying so terribly hard as she tried to keep it together. Iâ€™ve never felt more sorrowful in my entire life. 

She ended with, 
â€œAnd I think I may be relapsingâ€

At this point I was at a loss for words and felt like I wasnâ€™t experienced enough/ didnâ€™t have the right words to be able to help her, I just donâ€™t know how to support her in the right way, without fucking something up or saying something potentially triggering or just not helpful. At this point iâ€™m her only true friend that she feels comfortable with, and I feel like the weight of her life lies on my shoulders and I donâ€™t know how to handle it, I just need some guidance on what to say/how to help. Anything would be appreciated.
