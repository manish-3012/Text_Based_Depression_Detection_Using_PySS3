Slaves to the establishment slave to my parents and more specifically slaves to the male disease of Money.I am in a cross road at the moment. I had my money stolen by bandits and I suffer from a medical condition and no one else seem to give a shit. The light at the end of the tunnel is fading and not getting brighter. It sounds like the establishment have made it so that we fall prey to their predatory practice and know exactly how families will breakdown so they either force it to break it down or they sell a fantasy to the masses and people buy it. 

This western or eastern civilization is created off a sick mind who get a laugh out of human suffering and treat people as digital numbers. I just feel like getting away from it all and not going back home. I don't care if it offends my mother/father or creates a missing person list, but honestly, I don't like where civilization is heading towards.  It seems that the establishment have pounded money so much in our heads, that it has become the cornerstone of civilization.
