everything fucking sucksI feel like my meds arent working 
I've fallen back into self harm
I'm mentally exhasted all the time
I'm in so much physical pain I've been upping my gabapentin w/o permission bc it just hurts so fucking bad
I'm out of it constantly and in a haze and brain fog all the time 
I'm physically exhasted and sleep constantly but cant seem to _actually_ sleep, and just lay there exhasted and miserable
I'm sick of living
