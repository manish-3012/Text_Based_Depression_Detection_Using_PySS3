BPD/EUPDIâ€™m almost 20 (f) I developed mental heath issues at age 12, I hardly went to school, barley attended college, tried to hold down jobs and couldnâ€™t now Iâ€™m back at college trying again and itâ€™s really making me depressed. Others my age are driving, holding down full time jobs, going out living life. Iâ€™m so mentally behind everybody else Iâ€™m embarrassed and feel so bummy. I have no idea what to do, Iâ€™ve done therapy, meds, hospital trips etc...
Idk I guess I just want to hear if anybody else is in the same boat or have overcome it.
Iâ€™m struggling to give myself pep talks that everything is going to be okay and to carry on my brain is fucked.
