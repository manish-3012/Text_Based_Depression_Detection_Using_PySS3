Constant suicidal IdeationI have struggled with depression, PTSD, and anxiety nearly my entire 29 years. Childhood abuse, trauma, rape and molestation, parents are alcoholics.
I haven't gone into detail about what has happened to me with anyone except my psychiatrist I had 10+ years ago, and really dislike talking about it. 
When I sleep, I almost always dream of past events. I wake up exhausted, afraid, embarrassed. I am constantly reminded of my trauma every single day and I just feel..... tired.

I am tired of existing. Tired of trying, tired of feeling anything at all.
Of course there are good days, where my problems seem minimal or I am distracted enough to 'be 'in a different state of mind, but it is always fleeting and is too infrequent. I have had suicidal thoughts, feelings, and ideations all throughout my life, but never have they been as strong as they are lately. I have my method planned, and have had it mapped out for about 3 years now, but I am running out of ways to stop myself. I used to be able to hold on to some shred of hope, a glimmer of what-ifs and a possible future. Now, nothing. No amount of therapy and medication has changed this. I'm finding it more and more difficult to stay.

Recently, I've been going through a lot of stress and uncertainty. Feelings or emotions of any kind are just exhausting and overwhelming. Nothing seems to help. I just want to die.
How do I explain these feelings without getting locked up against my will? I'm trying to explain this to my dearest friend, even though he has caused me quite a bit of heartache. 

Why is it so hard to explain to someone you simply don't want to exist anymore; that you wish to feel nothing? That dying isn't a selfish option for a life I did not ask for and no longer wish to be a part of?
I have no immediate means or desire to end my life, but I cannot stop thinking about it or planning it. How do I explain that it isn't to make anyone else hurt or feel guilty?
