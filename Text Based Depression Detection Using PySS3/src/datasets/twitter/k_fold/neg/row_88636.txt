I have decided that I want to dieFinally the idea of suicide isn't an "if" but rather a "when". I don't know my future, I don't remember my past, I don't know what I like, I don't know my personality, I don't know what I want to be, fuck, I even know neither my gender nor my sexuality xD I practically don't exist. So why should I exist physically? I'm replaceable to everyone, thanks to not having an actual personality beyond low effort puns. No one I know actually cares how I feel or what I think. I'm a surface friend to most, a void they can shout their secrets and feelings into to the rest. I have a method. I just need to get my affairs in order and acquire it. If I'm feeling extremely cowardly, I'll stay alive until my 17 year old cat dies, because my mother will kill her otherwise.
It's all too much and not enough.
