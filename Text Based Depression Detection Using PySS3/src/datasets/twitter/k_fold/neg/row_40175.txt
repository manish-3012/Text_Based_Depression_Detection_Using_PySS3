I thought time would heal the wounds but...It's almost been three years since my suicide attempt.
The only reason I haven't tried to kill myself again is the guilt of leaving my loved ones behind and the fear of failing and being put in a psychiatric ward again. 
I know I have a good life and reasons to live for. I have a caring, sincere boyfriend who I live with. Steady job, on study leave right now at a school I like. Pets. Friends in school. On good terms with my family. Materialistic things.
It just doesn't feel worth it though. I spend most of my days with anxiety, feelings of disgust and hatred towards myself, anger as well as suicide thoughts. I've tried to reach out for help (last time was this summer) but I feel as if they don't take me seriously/don't understand what I'm saying. I'm at my breaking point and I really don't know what to do.
