Iâ€™m closer to doing it than ever before. Iâ€™m close so close. Iâ€™m just staring at the sleeping pills. Just wishing i was brave enough to do the final step. I think i finally am. And i feel relived because soon this will be all over.Hey guys. Iâ€™m sorry i keep posting. Iâ€™m 18 and european. My life is a mess. I donâ€™t feel like iâ€™m alive. Iâ€™m a walking corps, i just hate myself. I have zero friends. Iâ€™m a loner and nobody will even notice that iâ€™m gone. Nobody will miss me, and thatâ€™s fine because i donâ€™t deserve being happy. Iâ€™m a bad selfish guy, who fucked up his life. Every day i wish i would just die. I wish a car would hit me. I wish that a Aneurysm would kill me off. Because i donâ€™t have the guts to do it...well i didnâ€™t have the guts to do it. I finally think i can do it. I want this. I feel guilty because i had a great childhood. I was never mistreated,abused no none of that. My parents got divorced but...that was it. And iâ€™m really sorry because of my parents. I love them but the pain is stronger. Iâ€™m writing them a letter so they donâ€™t blame themselfs. They donâ€™t understand how much i suffer. I put a fake smile on me yeah to pretend iâ€™m ok. Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m far from being ok. I have social anxiety. Iâ€™m scared of going outside. Iâ€™m scared of talking to people. I feel like iâ€™m always being looked at. I canâ€™t escape it. I never had a girlfriend and i never will. I never even kissed a girl. What a joke huh honestly. I donâ€™t know why iâ€™m posting this...maybe.....maybe it is a cry for help. Maybe a part of me still dosenâ€™t want to let go. But life isnâ€™t for me. A akward, sarcastic,cynical guy, who dosenâ€™t know shit. Iâ€™m failing school and iâ€™m failing life. I do nothing but stay home and do nothing. Because i just canâ€™t be botherd. Thanks for reading this...i love each and everyone on this subreddit, and i wish you guys all the best. You are worth it. Iâ€™m not. I canâ€™t be saved. But you can.So signing off guys...see you on the other side guys. Where we can all be happy.
