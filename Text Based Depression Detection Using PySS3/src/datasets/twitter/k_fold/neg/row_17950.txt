Killing yourself is not the â€œeasy way out.â€ It takes a lot of courage to pull the trigger.Someone had the audacity to tell me I had to plan for the future and that dying is â€œeasy way outâ€

No. Shut up. Donâ€™t discredit the amount of courage, pain, and mental fortitude it takes to go against your every instinct and finally free yourself from this pain. 

Yes I am strong. I am strong because everyday Iâ€™m building up the courage to kill myself. 

And I will kill myself. You canâ€™t stop me. I donâ€™t care if you love me, because you sure didnâ€™t act like it when I was suffering. Itâ€™s too late to say â€œI love you.â€

Iâ€™m not even going to write letters anymore. No one is worth writing letters to. Suicide is my decision to make and I can chose to end my life because itâ€™s my goddamn life. 

So shut up. Shut the fuck up. Get the hell away from me with your â€œpositivity bullshitâ€ and hand me a shotgun. 

If you really loved me, youâ€™d be okay with me finally ending my pain.
