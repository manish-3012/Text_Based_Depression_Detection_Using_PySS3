My anxiety is eating me aliveI'm super paranoid about what people think of me. If anything small happens I panic, the only thing that calms me down is drinking enough whiskey to kill a small horse. And imagining scenarios of me ending it. What people's reaction would be. The people that hate me, might go "hahaha what a loser" but they might go "oh shit I didn't like that guy but he was going through some shit". I think my end is near I can't handle the pain anymore.
