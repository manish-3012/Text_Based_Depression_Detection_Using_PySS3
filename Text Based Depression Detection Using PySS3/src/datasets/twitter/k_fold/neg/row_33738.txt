What's the best method for a painless suicide?

How do I end my life when I'm too much of a coward to do it? I'm serious when I say that I really have nothing to live for. I'm a trust fund baby with a social phobia, both of which have conspired to sap me of any ambition in life.
The problem is my fear of the pain involved in dying. I don't want it to be drawn out and/or painful .

 I'm not "crying out for help." I went through years of therapy, countless drug cocktails, and hospitalization and the best thing that has ever happened is a few months of peace before I build up a resistance to drugs I'm taking and they no longer work.

Therefore I have no career to look forward to, nor any foreseeable way of making a difference in this world, especially when I'm too afraid to say hi to anyone at the college  I've been going to for years. I've tried school on-and-off, but the cyclical nature of my depression and phobias have made it all but impossible to graduate college. I alienate everyone I come in contact with because I can't make even the smallest of small talk, so people dismiss me as being a snob

  im 18years old and i dont want to suffer more , i want to end up nlt cause i hate life , i just dont like suffring 
 im addict  to Benzodiazepines (xanax ) , opiods (Tramadol), nicotine , cafeine , Barbiturates (phenobarbital ) .
