I ready to die but to chicken to do it.I can't seem to just push my self over the edge.

I can't take crying my self to sleep at night. I know people love and care about me but the reality is that I'm not capable of being happy. So why do I have to suffer because other people will miss me?

I'm just to tired from trying to fight this. I lost this battle long ago and it's time to admit it. I want to say sorry to everyone that u failed them, but they'd only try to stop me.
