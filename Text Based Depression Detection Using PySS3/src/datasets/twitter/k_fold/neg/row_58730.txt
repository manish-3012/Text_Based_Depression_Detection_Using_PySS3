Passively Suicidal(F 16) Alright, so Iâ€™m not entirely sure if this is the right subreddit to be posting on. I donâ€™t want to take anything away from anyone posting on here, because I am aware Iâ€™m not severely at risk; however, I feel like I really need to get this off my chest. For many years Iâ€™ve had thoughts about dying and killing myself. Recently they have gotten a lot worse and I donâ€™t know what to do. Specifically I keep feeling like I donâ€™t like the way the world is and I keep having thoughts that suicide will be an inevitability for me at some point in the future. 

I get this feeling in two ways. The first and, in my opinion, less concerning way is that I clearly imagine that Iâ€™m going to commit suicide in my sometime in my adult life and thatâ€™s just my inevitable future. Some people imagine being married and having kids and I just imagine Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I just keep imagining that Iâ€™m not going to be able to handle living with idiots and injustices within the world anymore. The way the world is has become really scares me, and I canâ€™t help but imagine itâ€™s going to get worse from here. This idea stems from the fact that I am sort of a â€œtrutherâ€. I have this idea that the world will only get worse because Iâ€™ll have to be the one to deal with all the lying and manipulation that goes on. I wonâ€™t just be able to not think about it and let others handle the problems because simply I wonâ€™t be a child anymore and Iâ€™ll have to take responsibility. So within this train of suicidal ideation, Iâ€™m essentially planning for when the world inevitably goes to shit.

The second, and much scarier way these thoughts present is in the feeling that, as it currently stands, I have no more life to live, and that Iâ€™ve reached the peak of my existence and it can only go downhill from here. Part of this is my fears of what my future holds, as Iâ€™ve stated in the paragraph above; part of it is my own insecurities. 

For example, I was fat until around halfway through tenth grade and I was very unhappy with myself because of it. I finally had enough of feeling like shit, so I went on a diet and started exercising. Rapidly, I became half the size I was (quite seriously... I went from the larger side of CAD size 8 to the smaller side of a size 4). I also started putting major effort into my appearance where I never used to (ex. doing my hair everyday, not coming to school without makeup on, never wearing sweatpants in public, etc.). I thought Iâ€™d feel better about myself by doing this, but itâ€™s made me feel worse. I used to not really care how I looked apart from being fat- but even then I didnâ€™t care â€˜til it got out of control. Now Iâ€™ve developed an incredible self-hatred that makes me feel like even my best isnâ€™t good enough, but it also makes me feel like I need to keep pushing myself to be prettier and skinnier. This really isnâ€™t helping my increasing thoughts of suicide. Iâ€™ve finally gotten to a place where Iâ€™m skinny and people tell me Iâ€™m pretty. 

Whatâ€™s scary is, even apart from my own issues with myself, I can tell that this is the best Iâ€™m going to be able to do. Iâ€™m not going to be able to keep up with this forever and as soon as I let go even a little bit it will completely come crumbling down. I canâ€™t get over the â€œpeaked in high school mentality.â€ Part of my anxiety and certainty of suicide is that I feel like Iâ€™m missing my window to find lifelong friends and boys donâ€™t seem to be interested in me. Iâ€™m setting myself up for a lonely life and I feel powerless to stop it. In this ideation, I feel like it would be best to die now and save myself the trouble of pain down the road. 

I havenâ€™t told anyone I feel like this and I likely wonâ€™t tell anyone I actually know about this specifically because Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll get told that itâ€™s not a serious problem. I also just feel vile even mentioning this because itâ€™s not active suicidal tendencies, so there isnâ€™t really a need to be worried; I also have a friend who is actively suicidal and has attempted before. I understand that I am a teenage girl, and that these feelings are just a natural part of life, but I canâ€™t help but feel like my feelings transcend natural teen angst. The certainty I have with these thoughts is honestly alarming at this point, however, I also know I donâ€™t want to hurt myself. I feel awful and I have no idea how to help myself.
