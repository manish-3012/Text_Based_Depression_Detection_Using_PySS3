SchoolSchool's not a place for freedom. It is a place for those who enjoy being slaves.

And yet I have no other choice but to go since my parents requires me to. They don't know that the monsters who made me this way are all hidden in that insipid campus filled with nincompoops. 

I once enjoyed being there. Only once. When someone who understands appeared before me. But then, that someone also disappeared because of me. And now I'm alone and afraid. But I just need to keep my good acting up so that nobody notices how distorted I am.
