Why should i live?The woman I wanted to marry, the woman who I dreamed of having a child with, dumped me because Iâ€™m unemployed. I donâ€™t have a house, I donâ€™t have money, I donâ€™t have a job... Really why do i live? I just wish to die naturally or because of an accident so my mother wouldnâ€™t be angry with me. Life seems pointless. I donâ€™t have any reason to live.
