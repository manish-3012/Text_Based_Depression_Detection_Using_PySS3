The only reason I haven't done itis because my mum would probably be the one to find me - and I don't want her anywhere near me. If she makes a noise, I want to die. If she ever tried to touch me, I want to die. If anyone talks to her about me, I want to die. I just want to die but honestly, if I did, I would want to take her down with me.
