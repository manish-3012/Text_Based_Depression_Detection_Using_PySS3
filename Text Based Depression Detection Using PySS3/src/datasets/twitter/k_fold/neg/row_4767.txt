I donâ€™t think I can do this anymoreIâ€™ve tried to kill myself about 7 times in the past,but those were baby attempts when I was in middle school so they really werenâ€™t going to go anywhere . The last time I tried I almost died from an overdose,but my friend called the police. I deal with borderline personality disorder and at this point I donâ€™t know how I feel anymore . I tend to ruin all my relationships ,but I donâ€™t know if my feelings are warranted or not . Somehow everything gets really skewed with bpd and itâ€™s really a sad mix . I really would need to write pages on pages to describe how I feel on a regular basis ,but to sum it up , I hate myself . I was thinking about killing myself on my bday ( itâ€™s the 26th of feb) but I notice whenever I have the plan to do it , I never actually have the money to buy the sleeping pills . Sometimes Iâ€™m really set in my ways but sometimes I want to get knocked out and just not wake up for a solid year . Idk , Iâ€™m just miserable and I donâ€™t know what to do .
