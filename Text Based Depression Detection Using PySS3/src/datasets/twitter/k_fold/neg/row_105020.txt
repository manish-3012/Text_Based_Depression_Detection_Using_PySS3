The only person I can freely talk to now hates meI have severe anxiety disorder and have been fighting against depression for a while, but never had suicidal thoughts. 
Saturday was my girlfriend's birthday and I screwed up, hurt her feelings a lot (really, a good lot, I can't even look at myself at mirrors) and she told me she wants to breakup, them want us to take a time from each other, them break up and lastly to try to heal it with time. 
I've been living with her for some time now and as I don't usually talk to people, she's the only person I bring problems, thoughts and everything, but I can't do it now. 

For the last 24 hours the idea of jumping from the window of my parents apartment or hitting my car against a wall sparks into my head and if not for slow reaction, I think I would have done it. I am afraid AF of dying, I can't stand leaving my friends, parents, brother, everything I love; but those sparks are really scary, I known how fragile life is and how easy it is to do. 

Talking to you guys seems to help, but what about when I can't talk? When I can't reach someone? What if I can't stand myself anymore to the point it becomes a new recurrent thought? 

It does not stands in my head, but for a fraction of a second, I listen to something saying it will be over if I do it and it shows me how to.
