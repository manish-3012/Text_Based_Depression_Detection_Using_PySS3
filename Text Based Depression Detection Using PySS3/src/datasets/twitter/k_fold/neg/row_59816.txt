Trust fundSo I've been thinking lately, there are many fellows more or less like myself - single, depressed, but have the money and homes that are going to vanish after suicide.

For obvious reasons it's not possible to take any of your finances to the afterlife, so I am thinking if it's possible to create some sort of trust fund and put all / most of your money there, and somehow govern the funds so people who are struggling and suicidal because they are deprived from money?

I am not quite sure how this is going to work, any advice appreciated.
