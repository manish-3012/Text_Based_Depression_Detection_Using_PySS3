Son keeps trying to kill himselfMy 18 year old step-son recently got diagnosed with a drug induced pyschosis because when he was at college he started doing mushrooms and acid and fried his brain. Its been 3 months since he did quit drugs and he says that he isn't recovering and that he's basically living with schizophrenia. For the past 3 months he's been putting his mother and potentially my seven year old daughter (his half-sister) and I through hell. His most recent suicide attempt was his 3rd and the closest he'd gotten had it not been for his mom somehow calling him right before he was about to hang himself in our basement while he was drunk. I don't know what to do, he thinks that if he dies he will just wake up again before he ever did drugs and everything will be right, or that when he dies he'll get to talk to god and restart his life. Nobody wants him to die and I don't believe he really does either, he's scheduled to see a pyschiatrist soon, but im just scared that before that happens were gonna get that call from the police saying that he did it and that were never going to see him again.
