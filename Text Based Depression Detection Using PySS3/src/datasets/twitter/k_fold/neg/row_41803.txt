Does life suck for everyone?I was a homeless dude about a month ago and for the past week or so I was trying to get out of the lifestyle (if it can even be called that). I've been trying each day since then to get up and try to go to a business that's hiring for a job, but everyday I find some excuse. I dread getting up. I'm always sleepy/tired. My neck always hurts. Does life suck for everyone? Does anyone legitimately wake up go to work and enjoy life? Is there even a point to it all? Why even go on living a life that you don't enjoy?
