The horrible feeling in your chest when you think about it...when youâ€™re constantly thinking about it and the thought of imagining your own death drains you. how you wish for it so bad, how you crave for it yet that feeling deep down of hurt.. knowing you wouldnâ€™t mind living if things were just different than they were now. If only things were better, even a tiny bit. The pain from whatever bothers you yet the pain from wanting it all to end youâ€™d sacrifice yourself, all your potential to simply stop feeling the way youâ€™ve been feeling. the depression that you battle every fucking day.. even the thoughts of suicide it brings you, your mind is flooded with such sad sad thoughts. thinking about the plan, who youâ€™ll give your things to, the letter, if you even plan on letting everyone youâ€™ll leave behind why you did it. but what would any of that matter after, right? none of it will. 
it just hurts, it hurts so much that I think about this so much.
