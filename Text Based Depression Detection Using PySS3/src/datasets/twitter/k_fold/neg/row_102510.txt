I don't knowSo. I'm not sure if this should be here. I'm so lost. 

I've let my fears get to me.  I had an awesome partner. God I love her. I'm not saying this for attention or sympathy. It's the one time I've felt like this. Well this much. Jesus I love her. Like nothing I've ever felt before.  

I fucked up. I let my fears get the better of me and I've ruined it all. I have trust issues. Major trust issues. Oh god I need to cry and I don't even know if I know how to. 

I have major issues from my past. I thought I was ok. I moved. I got a new life. I've live thru 6 suicides. And my god I want 7.  Jesus I want 7.  

Fuck me I want 7. 

I'm a bottle of bourbon in. A bottle of mvodka to go.  I don't even know why I'm writing this. I don't ask for anything from anyone.  

My fear was something fucking small. My partner was getting messages from a guy. She was married when I started seeing her. Hell she startsd it. Went after me. I'm no angel.  I went after her with a passion. I fell in love with her. Before she left her husband for me I found out she was also sexting another guy as well. 

She left her husband. Came to me. She has kids. I tried. I was as good as I could be. Loved her. God I love her. Not just her but the kids as well. 
I fucked up. I admit it. I went after a woman I was seeing at the same time we started. I was cheating with her while I was with someone else. It came out. I picked her. Even though she was married. I still went after her. I know I'm horrible. She has kids with him. God I still went after her. 

I got drunk. I went after my old girlfriend. Whether out of revenge. Either against me orher or her. I still got drunk and went after the ex even though Id told my Affair id picked her. Jesus id picked her. I was just messed up in my head. 

She was and still is married. I lied. Every time she asked me if I'd gone back to my ex I lied and said j hadn't until truly I put it out of my mind. The lie became truth in my mind. 

She found out. Mind you this all happened before she left her husband. She says I didn't pick her. That she was th easy choice. I lived thru 2 years of hell for her and I still didn't pick her. 

She left. God I was happy. I love her. She picked me!! God Id never had someone say I was worth so much. 
And it was good. For a time. Till I let my fucking head get in the way. She had been setting another guy before she left her husband. Mind you I found out about it and asked her to stop. This was a 20 year friend she had. She did. But he continued to be there and text her. I let my fears play on my mind. 
He text her. She deleted his texts.  Swapped to Facebook messenger. Still was friendly. He would text her that she was sexy and beautiful. I saw a couple raised it with her.  She said she told him to stop. And he would continue. 

My lie about going after my ex while I had told her I'd picked her even though she was with someone else came out. I don't dent it was an idiot move on my behalf. But fuck I love her. I wouldn't jeopardise any small chance with her. 

Then I focus on her continued texts with the friend.  I admit my trust was slim. I snoop. There are a lot of messages. Messages that when I ask her about she downgrades what was said by him. 

I know it was little. Petty. Him calling her beautiful. Sexy.  That they'd be special friends still. She didn't encourage it. But I still went after it like a dog and bone. I asked. Hell even begged. She didn't see anything wrong. Said she couldn't control him. 

I asked her that if he kept it up to just stop the talking/ texting from him. Instead  I'm the bad guy. Never picked her. Over reacting. 

She won't touch him cause hasn't happened before. 
Y fear got me. My jealiusy. 

It's over. It came to a head. Told me to leave. 

I've decided 7 will be the last. No more luck. I'm not worth it
