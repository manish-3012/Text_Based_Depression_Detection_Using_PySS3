Depression be not proudIâ€™m exhausted. I donâ€™t have it in me to do it anymore. My girlfriend left me. The last only good thing in my life is gone. I have this sick habit of self sabotaging myself when I find some sort of happiness. I have an inability to trust. Itâ€™s also unfair how mental stability has been a prison for her. Feeling like she canâ€™t leave me because I might kill myself, but not understanding that I have spent most of my life feeling this way. Everyday I canâ€™t understand why it doesnâ€™t get better.
