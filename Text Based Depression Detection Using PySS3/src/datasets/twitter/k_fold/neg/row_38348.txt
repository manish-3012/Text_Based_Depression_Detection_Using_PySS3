I'm schizoaffective. Nothing seems to help. I'm tired living like this...I want to kill myself. I just don't see any hope. I've tried every medication and nothing seems to help. I mean it helps, I don't experience psychosis nearly as much without them... But even with the meds I'm on it's too much. Plus with the stress from school, and a complex situation with this girl I met... I don't honestly know if I want to live anymore. I'm running low on energy... I've been fighting this my whole life and I feel like there's no point anymore, that I can't handle school, that life will just keep being meaningless. I've missed a few days of school because I had to go to the hospital for a psychiatric emergency, and that's just adding to the stress because I'm really far behind and just past confused... Maybe I'm just not smart enough to do the things I want in life... Everything just seems so pointless, and full of pain. I'm sick of depression so deep I'm out of my mind, I'm sick of hearing voices, I'm sick of paranoia, anxiety, manic states, going in and out of reality.... I feel like I need someone to snap me out of it. To hear some encouraging words, that I'm cared about... But I'm also scared that it will do nothing at all and that I'll keep feeling this way... Help? :\
