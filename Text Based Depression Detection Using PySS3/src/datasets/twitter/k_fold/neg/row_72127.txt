I'm here all day to talk and trade vent sessions.  If anyone needs something to help them feel better, here's a thread for good vibes, uplifting stories, funny pictures, and feeling better.  Everyone on this board is on here for a reason.  Either that reason is that you've been down to that one final option before, or you're at that steep cliff right now.  

This thread exists as a 'general' for people to come and feel safe and comfortable, talk about what you need, and post uplifting links/pics/stories/etc that make you feel better that others might find helpful as well.  

I'm making a stand; I will not consider that option today, and with your willpower and consent, I'd like you to avoid that terrible decision as well.
