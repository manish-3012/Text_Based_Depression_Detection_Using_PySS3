My note. I love life. Well, I love the â€œideaâ€ of life. I hate the â€œexecution.â€ 

I donâ€™t think that death is worse than life. Just different. And I want to try it out. So, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing, trying death out. 

All of you that Iâ€™ve met here in life I love. You made me the woman I am today and was yesterday. Please donâ€™t think me unthankful. Iâ€™ve lived for a long time now and Iâ€™ll miss you. I love you. I really do.

Iâ€™ve been called tenacious and I donâ€™t think this act disproves my tenacity. I think it proves it. Death is so feared by so many. It is seen as â€œless thanâ€ life. I welcome and invite it.  

Life is hard, and Iâ€™ve lived life as the only way I could. Iâ€™m sorry I overwhelmed all of you so much. I love you all. I love you mom and dad, Iâ€™m sorry we didnâ€™t get along better. I love you Brock, and Iâ€™m sorry that we didnâ€™t get along better. All of my friends, I love you. I mean that. 

It took me a long while to make this decision. I finally came to the realization that I am the most important person in my life, and I feel that I have the right to make this decision on my own. 

No one could have stopped me. I did this on my own.  Iâ€™ve done my best to clean up the mess I left behind. Goodbye.
