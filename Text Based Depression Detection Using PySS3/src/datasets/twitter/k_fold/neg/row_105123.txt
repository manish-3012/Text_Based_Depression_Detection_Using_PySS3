i can't do it anymorei just want to give up. i can't keep up with all my responsibilities. i'll never be able to keep up. 

i'm 27 and everyone acts like i've got my life so in order but i feel overwhelmed and unhappy all the time. my whole life was a fucking mistake. i've always been depressed and i'm never going to get better. every time it seems like i'm getting better, it's just a trick to make me feel like i'm going to be okay but i'm never going to be okay.

there's so many things i want to do and i'm expected to do and i can't even feed myself and keep my house and yard clean enough to not get citations from the city.

my fiancÃ© deserves better than me in his life. everything has to revolve around me all the time because i can't keep it together and im so fucking selfish

i hate the way i look and how nobody else sees the same thing i see when i look at myself. people look at me and see something disgusting and offensive and unnatural. i think they're right.

ive been trying so hard for so long and i just can't keep doing it. im never going to get better. why am i still trying.
