I have no voice in society, I must accept the oppressionHi, I'm baeagon. The guy that everyone on here calls a troll because I don't agree with them politically. I've been kicked out of pretty much every group I've been in because I don't agree. Fuck it what am I even saying. I don't know. It's late. It's late. And I really can't get caught on here, past friends will probably Google my name and use anything I say on here to harass me so I have to keep it short and quick. I don't know what I'm talking about anymore, I haven't ever understood myself, and I don't really think I've been in control of my life in over a year now. Fucking darren, I mean he's a great guy and all, it's my fault, whatever. Sure. Get me out of here. Sorry for wasting your time, I may expand on this
