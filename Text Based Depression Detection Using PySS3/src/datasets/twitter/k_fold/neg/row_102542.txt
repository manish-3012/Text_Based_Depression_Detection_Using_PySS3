I think I'm going to end itI tried really hard to go to school and make everything alright but it didn't work out. It's not fair. I went and I want her to be happy and proud that I went for three days but all she sees is that I didn't go Monday and the days leading up to today. It's not fair. I already told my boyfriend I'm sorry so I think I'm good to go.
