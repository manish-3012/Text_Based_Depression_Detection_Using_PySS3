7th cup of coffeeâ€œShould I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?â€ -Albert Camus

An absurd mantra that has gotten me through worse times than this. I love coffee. It is a simple joy for me, a breath admits a sea in which I drown. 

But I've found myself, as of recently, pulling the trigger of an empty gun pressed tightly to my temple. A place, I've always sworn, I'd never find myself. What an incredible mess I'd make...

The thought actually is rather amusing. Some poor sap having to clean up my mess for once. Rather than I his. 

Alas, coffee loses its allure after so many a dose and reality bites back into my brain. So lost. So unhappy. So secure in having control over my own existence, if nothing else. 

Another cup of coffee. What's the worst that can happen?
