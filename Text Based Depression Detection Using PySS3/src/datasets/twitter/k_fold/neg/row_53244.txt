How do I go any further?I've read a lot of posts on this thread and pretty much all of them despite age and gender seem to be just as close to the end as I am. Times moving faster than I can literally perceive, I look at the time thinking 30 minutes past and its 4 hours later somehow. Everything looks more beautiful and vibrate, nature looks more alive and pretty glistening in the sun. Makes me feel like I'm never gonna see it again. Honestly the only reason I have constant suicidal thoughts is because I've never had someone close to me that I can lean on and talk to. Obviously I'm talking about about having a relationship with someone, but living my whole life without that is soul crushing. No girl wants a guy just because he needs her to survive, but that's the only thing I can think about that gives me any motivation to keep going, is to finally feel loved. 

Instead of being loved by my family my father beat me and my mom, sat her car on fire, discharged guns in the house, smoked meth, marijuana drank alcohol and probably did countless other drugs all at the same time making him a egomaniac villain. He plotted on murdering my mother through poisoning and wanted to kidnap me even saying, "I'm gonna take him and nobody is ever going to see him again." After he left all I had was my mother who was also gone because she worked at night and slept during the day. I was all alone from the very beginning. And now it's hitting me harder than ever. 

I just graduated in 2019 and now that I'm out of school I don't see people at all. Obviously the corona outbreak makes seeing people more difficult but I just can't stand to be all alone anymore. I have friends but none close enough to ease my pain. My step brother is there for me but I feel like I still can't connect with him like how I want to connect with someone.
