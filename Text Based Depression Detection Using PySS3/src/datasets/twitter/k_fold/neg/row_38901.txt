Is suicide sometimes an answer?This isn't about me but instead my mother. She has been suffering from depression for the past 20 years and I don't remember the last time she was happy. She is going through a long divorce with little end in sight. I called 911 on her today because she attepted to overdose on blood presure pills saying she wants to die and all this. The problem is im inclinded to agree with her as depressing as that sounds. I don't remember the last time she was happy she's old and nothing is changing to help her situation. I've lived my whole life dealing with her problems and strugles and I've goten to the point where I think death would be better then the current life she lives. So my question is that is suicded ever an actual solution? What can I do for help? I know the obv answer is be with her and help her but I've been doing that for my whole life with no change and its got to the point where I sort of agree with her...
