Broken, alone, and so tired.I depended on my love and best friend for eight years and the second I showed some vulnerability, she threw me by the wayside and never wants to see me again. Eight weeks later she's already fucking someone else. I almost convinced myself that I'd "rise like the Phoenix" or some other bullshit about proving how strong I really am. I'm so god damn weak. I have all the resources I need to be a successful human being but the ambition just isn't there. It never was. I never liked working and at this point I don't even like not working. I had passion for learning, for music and culture, for other human beings, but it's all gone now. I have nothing. My degree is hard and I'm too behind to work. I hate the restaurant I worked at until my attempt two months ago and I can't find a new job. My parents know I'm suicidal but continue to tell me to grow up and get a real job despite how much they know it depresses me. I neglected my friends to be with my cold, cruel, callous ex and now I don't have any. The loneliness is killing me. No one wants to listen. My therapist and parents tell me not to air out my dirty laundry if I want people to keep me around. They're right of course, but the alternative of bottling everything up isn't helping. They don't understand. I can't even talk to them about it because they'll have me thrown in an institution. 

I am getting really close to the edge.
