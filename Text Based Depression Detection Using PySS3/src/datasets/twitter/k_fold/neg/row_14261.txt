Every negative interaction I have I want to die moreToday is the final straw. My roommate is my only friend and i don't even know if that's true anymore. I have rejection sensitive dysphoria so whenever anyone seems to me to be having a negative emotion I am forced to assume it is about me and that they now hate me. I cannot help this and it fucking sucks.
Something happened and I thought I did something to make my roommate hate me so I asked him if he did. I thought he'd be like no and we'd go on with our lives but that didn't happen. He said no but he sounded upset so I said "you didn't have to be so mean about it" which I admit I shouldn't have said. I tried to clarify what I had said and said "You seemed angry. I'm having a tough time and you know that". He said "Yeah it's a bit frustrating needing to restate things, sue me"
I really can't tell and I'm crying and he hasn't said anything to me since then and I don't know what to do.
I think he's talking to his friends about what happened but I don't want him to and I don't know for sure he's talking about me so I can't ask him to stop. If he isn't then he'll think even less of me
I just don't know what to do everything seems like the wrong answer. Idk how to tell him he really hurt my feelings without being a bitch about it I really don't know what to do
