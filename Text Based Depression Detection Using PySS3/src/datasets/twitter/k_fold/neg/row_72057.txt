Im trying to find my reason to live.My only reason to live is because I have just one person in my life who loves me and accepts me for who I am. But that person isnt perfect, she is dealing with her own problems and I cant expect her to be the one to lift me up all the time. I feel so weak all the time. If I didint have her in my life, hell if we didnt have each other we would both already been dead. I feel truly dead and empty inside. I have hopes and goals for the future but even getting to a better place in life and achieving those goals wont change who I am inside. I have a deep seeded self hatred. I dont have the ability to see the bright side of life even while acknowledging the things that are good in my life. I feel anger and rage everyday. The only thing that gives me relief is weed. I tried going with out weed but I just keep buying more because I get homegrown for cheap. I try cutting back on weed but its just so damn relieving that its hard to stay off of it for more than a day. I feel like I get more shit done while high because I get more motivation when I actually feel better. I try to use drugs to be more productive, rather than just sitting in a canatonic state. Being depressed sober is a fuck ton worse than being depressed while high. I can atleast use my rational thinking and keep my emotions at bay while under the influence of thc. My main issue is that I need more reasons to live for right now. Trying to get back into my old hobbies is very hard, but I dont want to give up. I cant rely on one person for my reason to live my entire life. I need something of my own that can fill the void that is my soul.
