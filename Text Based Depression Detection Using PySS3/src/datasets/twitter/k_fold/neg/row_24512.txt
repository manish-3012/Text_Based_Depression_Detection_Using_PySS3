Path that God has given meI don't even no how to start this but I need to get this out of my chest before it's too late. And I wanna already apologize my english.

Man, early 20s. Suffering with social anxiety and some other mental problems what I believe has come from concussion I suffered 6 years ago. Just hit my head against the ice and have some blackouts from that day. And never felt same after that.

I only have figured this out lately that all my symptoms are from that incident. Anxiety, which have led to lack of friends, can't even speak with somebody about this situation. I remember I was active at school before that concussion but after that I didn't even raised hand a single time at school. I can even see how my mathematics started to go down after that. I was always A-A+ student in that subject but after that I barely got throught in mathematics.

Personality has changed too a lot. I cry lot more, it hard to get motivated about anything. I'm getting angrier lot more. Happiness is just kinda gone.

Also suffering from some memory problems. I could just take something to my hand and take it from point A to B and then 10 minutes go by and I don't remember where I took it. 

Just thinked something else to this post but already forgot it.

All this have just led me to be more suicidal. And it is a sad fact. I'm not man enough to do it right now. But I know someday I will do it. I would be surprised if I would see my 30th birthday.

I just want my old life back - but I can't...
