I could die right nowI could die right now, with the blink of an eye. Blade is sharp. Cold against my skin, gives me goosebumps. It wont last. I wont last. I try. I try. I fail. I fail. I love. I love. Then love dumps me. Anything dumps me. Just another flightless birds. Naked. Featherless.  Hopeless. Defective, in pain. Wouldn't it just be beautiful to rest? Sleep my dear, sleep. Awake in a better life. Life doesn't exist without you. So DIE. Die to live a happy life.
