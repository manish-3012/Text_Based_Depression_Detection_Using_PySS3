I guess I didn't take enoughLast night I downed a mix of pills, benzos. Ssris, mood stabilizers, and cough meds. Guess it wasn't enough. I woke up today feeling....off. Almost like I'm not even a person I'm just going through the motions. I have literally no emotion. anyone ever experience this before?
