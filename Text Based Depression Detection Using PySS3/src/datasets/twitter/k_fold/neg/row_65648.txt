living a liei feel like im living a lie. i go through periods of feeling incredibly depressed and nothing can stop this feeling. i have been suicidal and still am at points. i was raped about a year and a half ago while drunk by a very good friend, who i still am forced to interact with. but to most people i seem fine, or actually great. i am the president of my class, am president of two other clubs, and hold other leadership positions in 5 other clubs, an captain of my field hockey team, and am involved with about 10 clubs/activities throughout the school. I volunteer a lot (about 100 hours a year), and also tutor elementary school aged kids in my community. I do pretty well in school and am in high level classes. i do all of this stuff so people think that i have some perfect life and am super happy and successful when really i feel like my life is falling apart at all times. im never happy. things get better but im still not "happy." i felt happy for the first time two weeks ago, with my then boyfriend. we have since broken up but have remained good friends. he is the only one who really understands me and that i have told all of this to. i have a lot of friends but they arent really caring and if i were to tell them how i feel they would just abandon me. i really dont know what to do anymore and im tired of feeling like this all the time and just want someone who is like me maybe to talk with
