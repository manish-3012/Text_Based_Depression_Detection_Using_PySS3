I became extremely suicidal all within the past monthI had a normal schedule with classes and a good work ethic up until about a month ago. If you had asked me earlier this year if I wanted to die I would have said that I was perfectly content. Good plans and a great chance of success for the future. 

Then last month I started thinking about how easy it would be for me to kill myself. Life is pretty pointless so why go on living if I'll just die later. I don't really care to see what happens or care about my future. 

I attempted two weeks ago and now I'm pretty close to perfecting my plan. 

I know you guys will say it'll hurt your family but I don't owe them anything. And I can't care when I'm dead. I'm very indifferent to what happens after my death. 

I won't make this any longer for the sake of not boring you to death (hah). Life is pointless so I think I'll just stop right here. 

*I seriously wonder what made me feel this way though. Why did I go from enjoying life to wanting nothing more than to kill myself. Is there something in the water supply that I don't know about? Regardless I'm very glad I had this revelation of ending it early.*
