Almost actually killed myself and it was terrifyingI just felt numb and started tying the other end around my ceiling fan. My son woke up from his nap in the other room and it startled me, I nearly fell off the amp I was standing on and it hit me in that second that I could have really died and he would be all alone. I dont know how to feel now. I feel like im holding everyone in my life hostage with my misery. I want to die and the fact that I fucking cant because it will hurt everyone makes me more miserable. And it just hit home that I'll never really do it and for some reason that makes me more sad
