if I don't get into the air force,I'm ending itI've been through so much shit. I'll share if anyone even reads this. I'm lost. I was supposed to go to college today but the money orders got fucked up so now I'm trying to enlist. I took the avsab test and I feel like I fucked it up. Who knows. All I know is that if I can't do that,I'm done. I'm not gonna spend my life flipping burgers,wasting away. I feel too stupid for the world and too sad to exist in general. I just wanna be okay. I want to make something of myself. And all I'm doing is sinking deeper and deeper. The one girl I'm friends with hates my guts because I don't want to date her. So she cut contact with me for some other dude. I was really good friends with her sister but she probably hates me too. My mom's an addict who's never home,I have nobody right now and I'm trying so hard to get my shit together but it never gets easier. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
