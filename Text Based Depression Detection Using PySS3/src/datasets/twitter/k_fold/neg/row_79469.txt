A question that keeps me up most nightsSo Iâ€™ve recently relapsed back into the dark parts of my mind and started to struggle to find the will to live again. Itâ€™s just hit 7am and Iâ€™ve been up all night with a PewDiePie stream, a whole bunch of slowed down songs, and tiktok. And everyone and then Iâ€™ll just shout to myself in my head- If I had the guts Iâ€™d end it! But i always get in my thoughts about it afterwards... am I not strong enough to go through with it? Or am I so strong that I want to carry on? I hope that makes sense to someone Iâ€™ve mentioned it to friends before and they havenâ€™t been able to grasp the concept of it but thatâ€™s probably because they get uncomfortable and donâ€™t know what to say.. but itâ€™s just- everyone always tells you how strong you are when your in times of mental struggle, but I find myself saying that if I wasnâ€™t so weak and afraid, I wouldnâ€™t be here. Itâ€™s just something ironic thats keeping my mind distracted right now. Doesnâ€™t matter what the answer is or whatever I just honestly wanted somewhere to put my thoughts and openly admit that I was struggling again even if nobody sees it. Take care yâ€™all
