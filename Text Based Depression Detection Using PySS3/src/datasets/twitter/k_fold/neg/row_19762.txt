I just wanna die.I just wanna die. Nothing matters anymore. Iâ€™m never gonna make it in the real world. I hate my major. And thereâ€™s no way out. I hate collage. Iâ€™m a vegetable. Iâ€™m just so useless and I fail at everything and nothing ever works for me. Iâ€™m a shame to myself and I feel horrible all the time and I just want to go away and disappear and have friends and a beautiful life. But Iâ€™m just trapped in this hell everyday and thereâ€™s no end in sight. No control of my own life. Whatâ€™s the point ?
