Suicide by OTC?Sorry if this isnâ€™t allowed or is the wrong place. Iâ€™ll go ahead and put a TW just in case: TW: intent. 



 Iâ€™m looking for peaceful methods, over the counter, and cheap. Iâ€™m a SAHM and the only funds I have is a pile of change- I might have $15 including a couple two dollar bills. I donâ€™t want to go out bloody and in pain. It seems like finding a cheap alternative is difficult.
