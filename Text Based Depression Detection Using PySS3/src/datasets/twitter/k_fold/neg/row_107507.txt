I feel like Iâ€™m a puppet to someone else...I have almost tried to kill myself... But I could only watch. It was like someone was controlling me and it makes me 1. Feel like shit and 2. Feel fuckin crazy. I just want to know if anyone else feels this way... So Iâ€™m not alone... But itâ€™s cruel to wish that someone would feel the same as me
