I don't deserve to live. I'm the most pathetic person aliveI'm a complete waste of space, oxygen, money, and resources. There's nothing I have going for me in life. I dont want to live anymore knowing what's ahead of me. If I do continue to live, I'll just be the same lonely pathetic failure ive always been but for the next 60 years. Ill never have people that respect me or care about me. Never will I accomplish anything worthwhile. Never will I find love in my life. Never will I get cured of this sickness that makes my life a living hell. In the end, I'm just another insignificant human out of the billion other insignificant humans in this shitty world, so I guess there's no reason people should care about me. 

 Might as well end it now instead of living a life like that for the next 60 years. The only thing that helps me deal with this pain is drugs. If it weren't for the acid and weed, I would've killed myself a long time ago. What a complete waste of life. After I blow my head off I hope I burn in hell for eternity for being such a pathetic piece of shit

There is absolutely no reason for me to continue living. I dont care if it might gets better. I want to die now, right this instant. Not live under the small hope that it gets better.  Just being alive hurts. 

"people care about you" is another stupid thing people say for some reason. No one gives a shit about me. No one even knows I exist besides my family. Even if people did care about me then that still doesnt matter. It doesnt change the fact that my life is shit and I'm a waste of space. 

Ending my life now would only be beneficial. One less insignificant human on the planet. Me dying now means there'll be so much resources being saved. Resources that could've been used for people that deserve it. I was never going to amount to anything any way. The world isnt going to lose anything of value. 

Doubt I'll get any replies, but ill wait anyway. Today is my last day either way.
