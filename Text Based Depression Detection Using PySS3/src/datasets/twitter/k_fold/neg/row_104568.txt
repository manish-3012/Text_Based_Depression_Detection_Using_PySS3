No one really caresFor all the talk about how people care about me not dying, there's no one that actually wants to talk, no text hotlines that are ever available or working, and no one that won't just shrug me off because I don't have any *real* problems. Even if someone tries talking to me, they realize how insufferable and unreasonable I am and just stop. I can't blame them. I wish I had the courage to hang myself already. I tried a week ago but screwed it up and I've just been the same miserable shit since then.
