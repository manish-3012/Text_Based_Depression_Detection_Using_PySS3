I think in gonna quitMy parents have been fighting my whole life and for 2 years they've been making me choose sides... I choose ones side the other gets pissed and if I choose neither they both get pissed... also my dad has threatened my life on multiple occasions my grandma fucking hates my guts half the time and usually she threatens to beat the shit out of me.... my whole family uses a few words to describe me... such as useless, piece of shit, faggot, stupid, etc..... my boyfriend wants to take a break but I'm 98% positive he isnt into me anymore my friends dont talk to me anymore and if they do they disregard me trying to vent to them... I started cutting 2 years ago and most of this year I've been considering hanging myself.... I tried dont know how much more I can take at this point... I also stopped eating unfortunately that didnt kill me I tried eating again and now i feel like I'm gonna puke when i do... I've been cheated on 4x and all this mom thinks I have not reason to be depressed and she says I'm making it up.... anyway I might just go into the woods some point today or this week and.... not come back... I'll stick around a while before then if anyone wants to talk a bit
