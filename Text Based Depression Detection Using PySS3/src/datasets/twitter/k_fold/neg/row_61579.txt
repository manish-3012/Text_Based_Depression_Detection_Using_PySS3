I feel trapped inside my own mind.15yo

I sometimes hear voices in my head that encourage me to harm others, sometimes I even feel like killing someone. Iâ€™m a pacifist, I try not to even voice my opinion if it has the chance to hurt someone, I try my best to resist the voices in my head.

I feel so much guilt from my past actions, I have hurt so many, and I feel so guilty. I have always been a quiet person, I would say I have anxiety but I never let it stop me from doing things that make me anxious, I like public speaking, meeting new people, etc.

I have bipolar tendencies, Iâ€™ve never let anyone know because I donâ€™t want any attention, I donâ€™t want anyone to know.

I never want to say Iâ€™ve had a bad life because things could be so much worse, but I have a lot of experiences.
 
I donâ€™t want this to be a long read but I feel so awful about my past actions.

Iâ€™ve had to mature earlier on in my life, I donâ€™t blame anyone for how I feel. I just want to love everyone in my life and show them how much love I have, I have been thinking about just ending it all, it makes me feel awful because I donâ€™t want anyone to think itâ€™s their fault.

I would really just like to talk, I have the blade ready when I finally decide if I need to do this but donâ€™t feel as if you need to intervene, Iâ€™m a rational guy (for the most part)
