Loneliness just might kill meWhen I first starting writing this post I included way too much details of all the bullshit I've been through this year and through out my life. I stopped myself because...I don't want to bore you with my sob story. Long story short- in 28 years of my life I have lived to the fullest while battling major depressive disorder, ptsd and anxiety. I've been abused in all forms by people who claimed to love me, including my family. However I have also traveled, created cool art and danced a lot. Fast forward to today, I am in my cute lil apartment with my 2 cats within walking distance of my job. Im just sitting here thinking how much longer I can take this feeling of loneliness. I have a handful of people that I consider "friends", most of them are far away.  Its difficult for me to imagine me getting romantically close to anyone every again after my most recent relationship, which has left me traumatized and broken. I have coping skills- but they aren't working anymore. I don't know what is going on in my head or why I can't reverse this broken heart. I've been able to overcome every single relationship but this one has been rough. My chest literally hurts. Idk why I am even writing this anymore. Being heard sounds nice.
