Just was told that I have to move out.I knew it. I knew everything would just get worse. The one person in my life that I thought wouldn't betray me like this has. I was told to move back to my father's. Okay, yeah sure, I'll move back to a place where my mental health was in one of the worst places ever. A place where all I had to my name was a couch to sleep on. Perfect.
I have no where to go. I have no one and soon I'll have nothing. I'm officially set over the fucking edge. Tonight I'm going to clean my room and kill myself. I have no choice. I've got a shit ton of pain meds. Should work. If not, I'll just go to my backup plan.

To my pets, I love you and I'm sorry. You deserved better.
I know it sounds stupid to say that to my pets as they can't understand, but I feel like I need to.

To reddit, thanks for offering me a platform to share.
