Least deadly drugs to overdose on?My life is over, I have autism, there's a trial going on in Canada for a murderer and the defense and media is blaming autism for the crimes, now everyone is gonna hate me for being autistic.

Now I need a method of suicide since everybody is afraid of me for my mental illness now, I want to overdose but I want some drugs that won't impair me too much if I survive the overdose, but something that is enough to kill me.

Any suggestions?
