Every time I come home my dog is so happy to see me. The thought of making him sad and suddenly never seeing me again is one of the main things stopping meI can see how sad he looks when I leave for work, or how happy he looks when I return. I can see how grateful he is when I feed him or let him jump and sleep on my bed, or when I take him for a walk.

I know he misses me when I'm gone for just a few hours so imagining him without me for a long time makes me hesitate about suicide
