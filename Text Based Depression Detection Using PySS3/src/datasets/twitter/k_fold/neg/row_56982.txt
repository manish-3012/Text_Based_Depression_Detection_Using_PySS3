I want to die, or get seriously hurt, but it would kill my loved ones.I've been really unhappy for a long time. I had an eating disorder from about 14 to 18, and wanted to starve myself to death. I went to uni, and was going to stop eating completely there, but I met a guy, and I really loved him, and for a while I was happy. I felt loved by someone who wasn't family, and if he thought I was great, I thought I couldn't be as bad as I was. I was still unhappy, but I was getting better, and didn;t want to die. 

He was on a year abroad though, and two years ago went back to his home country. we kept it going, and though, of course, it was hard, I loved him enough that it was worth it to see him in the holidays. He didn't find it so easy, and we recently ended it. We still talk, and he's a very good friend, and I dont see that changing. He's the most important person in my life, but without him, having to be careful what I say in texts so as to not accidentally say i love you or something, and knowing I wont see him again for a long time has been really hard and I've started slipping again. 

I've gone back to cutting and hating my body and not eating, and I just want to die, or get hit by a car or something, but I think that if anything happened to me it would kill him too. It would also mess up my family, who I love so much. I have a little sister, who it would destroy. 

I can't die, it's simply not possible with people caring about me like they do, but i want to so much, or to just be in an accident and get hurt.
