the least painful way to die?Im always thinking that I should die. At least once a day I think "I deserve dead" or "i should die" or "everyone would be much happier without me". I usually brush it out and continue with my life. But today is not a good day (it's my birthday, I suppose everyone here can understand how horrible birthdays are). I just want to end it all, but I don't think I could right now, I know I still have things to live for, but the more I think about it, the more I understand that probably my life will end in a suicide. 

I'm not sure if I would do it or how I would do it, I think the less obvious is getting a deadly disease (HIV seems to be the easiest to get) and just let it be, let the disease take my life. But I feel this would be really slow and painful.
