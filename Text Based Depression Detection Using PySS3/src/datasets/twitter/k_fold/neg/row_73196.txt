When frontliners die from covid, I'm here like "why take the good people? why not take me, a useless piece of shit, instead?"If it meant giving my life to the doctors, hell why not??? I don't even want to exist anymore. But they need to because the world needs them. I just take up fucking space in here. 

Don't anyone dare say any nice comments. Fuck off, fuckers.
