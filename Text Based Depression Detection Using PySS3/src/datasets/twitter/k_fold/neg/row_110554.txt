Wish I could just understand betterI did what I was supposed to do. I told someone I cared about; he cheated on me, then blamed me for making him sad (which apparently drove him to cheat).  

Now I'm pregnant. At first I was so happy for a chance to do something right, I would pour all my positive energy into making my baby happy, and who cares if the rest of my life is shit ? But now I'm more miserable than ever because I don't want to ruin my baby's life. I don't know what to do. I always wanted to be a mom, build a family. . . Now it seems impossible. 

Thank you for reading. I don't think I can live with myself if I abort. But I don't think I can live with myself if I don't.
