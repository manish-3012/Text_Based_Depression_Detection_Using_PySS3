I'm not suicidal, but my problems are similar so maybe you guys can help out.I don't want to kill myself, because the potential for pain is too frightening, but I have absolutely no reason to live.  Nothing at all gives me joy.  I have student loans and a car loan forcing my into bankruptcy while unemployment is threatening to cancel my benefits because I can't find a job because there are no job postings and no companies I have cold called need anybody for anything.  My life is just a giant pile of misery.  I figure these are similar to the feelings a suicidal person has (and, even though I'm not suicidal, I certainly wouldn't mind dying at this point), so maybe you guys know some coping tips.  Don't refer me to /r/jobs or something like that; I know how to search for jobs, I know how to sell myself, there just isn't anything.  I need to learn to cope with a crappy life, not how to improve my life (which isn't going to be happening any time soon).
