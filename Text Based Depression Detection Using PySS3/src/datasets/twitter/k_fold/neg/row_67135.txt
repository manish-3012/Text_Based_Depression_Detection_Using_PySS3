Today is a bad dayEveryday is a bad day, but today is worse. 

Not for any particular reason, but my heart aches. I canâ€™t quite breath and im on the brink on crying. 

Help. Me. I need someone to care. I do not want to die, but if I have no other way to stop the pain I will. Its a last resort and im getting close to using it. 

Im taking the meds. Im exercising and get my sunshine. I have a friend who I like and meet up with. 

So why. Im doing everything right. Why.
