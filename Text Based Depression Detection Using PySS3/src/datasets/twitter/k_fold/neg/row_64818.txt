Venting have nobody to talk toI lost my love of my life over a month ago she took the car the dog her stuff and disappeared My family hates me Iâ€™m homeless with nowhere to go Iâ€™m tired of life Iâ€™m sick of it I feel like Iâ€™m in everyoneâ€™s way Iâ€™ve got a lot going on just making it day by day on pennies on the dollar literally I feel like a piece of shit I lost everything itâ€™s crazy out here the little money I did get got robbed from me Iâ€™ll be completely Iâ€™ve got a warrant out for me So I canâ€™t do anything canâ€™t go to a homeless shelter or anything I just feel like what the Hell do I have to leave for my lifeâ€™s in shambles I have nobody I have nothing Itâ€™s all my fault Iâ€™ll probably edit and add to this later just needed to get a little off my chest
