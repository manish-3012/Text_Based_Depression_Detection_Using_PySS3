Dating and Suicide ? (X-post)I met this guy like two weeks ago while in my godmother's town for the summer and I'm super fucking in love with him, and I know that's wayyy extreme and super fast but I just KNOW that I love him. However, I have had plans since September to end my own life. Now I don't know what to do because he's sensitive and I don't want him to take it personally, should I explain to him what I'm going to do? Should I just talk about it in the note? I don't know what to do .. I know me dying will hurt him regardless, but is there anything I can do to make it easier on him?

also, i'm already working with a therapist and a whole crew of doctors on my mental health, but at the end of the day i'm sick and suicide is 10x more likely to kill me than any other cause of death, regardless of when it happens i'm 99% sure it WILL, and that could be at the end of summer or in 10 years, but i'm not asking about that.

how do i go about making it so my mental health problems affect him as little as possible?
