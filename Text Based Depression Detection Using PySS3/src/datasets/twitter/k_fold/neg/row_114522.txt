its almost timei would really love to end this. I've attempted 3 times: once with a gun once with a rope and once with painkillers. I've been fighting this so hard for 10 years now but i feel like it's time. I have burned everything i care about through alcoholism and i have nothing. I don't even have a way up. I just don't have the guts to use the gun i still have access to. Someone please talk me out of it. Im worthless and near homeless and i'd love someone to tell me why i shouldnt do it.
