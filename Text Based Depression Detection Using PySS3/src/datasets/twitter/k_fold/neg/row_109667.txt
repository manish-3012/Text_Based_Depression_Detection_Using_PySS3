Small penis guy thinking about taking on his life. Help.Hello Reddit. I feel that I must share my thoughts with someone or I will hurt myself. I am 24 years old. I am a virgin. Never had much confidence. My penis is about 4.5 inch  long. This is like a curse. I don't feel masculine. I have suicidal thoughts. Lately I met a wonderful girl. We went on couple dates. She already wanted to go to bed with me. I found an excuse not to. But I am pretty sure she will insist on the nearest occasion. I am terrified. Never told her that I am neither a virgin or below average in my pants. Bad thoughts are coming to my head. Like I will disappoint her and got rejected and go back to my miserable life without any love in it. I always dreamed about relationship. Having someone close to share feelings and my life with is one of my biggest dreams. I don't see the point of living life without significant other. 
This is just overwhelming me. First I met her I was like on cloud nine. Super happy. Now I am just a emotional wreck. Don't want her to leave but I feel that she will when she find out I am crap in bed.
