Please help me understand myself right now.I was having fun and I guess I seemed drunk cause I was laughing a lot but I wasn't and 10 minutes later I was told by my mom if I didn't go to college this year that she would lose 2000 dollars from tax write offs and that money pays for our food and ability to live in a apartment. I than tell her how that made me feel ( like shit) and she said " well than forget what I said it's ok honey" well mom I can't forget what you just told me. That will burden me. I have a job interview tomorrow too. I'm 18 btw. Anyways after a while of telling her I can't just forget and her telling me I can I went 0-100 real quick. I have a old habit of punching doors and breaking stuff and well it's been kinda long since I freaked out and I was pretty calm before and and BAM I punched 2 holes in 2 dif doors and than I punched the metal door a lot and than threw stuff like books off the counter and than I was moving a back back my throwing it under my right arm and BAM broke a glass panel in the China cabinet. Whoops but she thought it was on purpose. I told her sorry and helped her clean it up even in my rage ( shows I actually cared) but she said that this morning my brother said sorry for something last night and what i just said was not sorry. So Idk why I went from 0-100 after being so good and even getting a interview for a job tomorrow and being happy the whole day. I'm not bipolar I'm pretty sure cause I have depression and I see people for help. I also was gonna swallow a whole bottle of pills but mom slapped my arm and pills went flying on floor. I didn't want to die but I was scared the police were gonna come and I was gonna go to juvie again or the mental hospital and that is a HUGE setback and I can't have that. I feel like I lost so much progress. Anyways thanks for reading if you took the time. I appreciate it and you mean the world to me.
