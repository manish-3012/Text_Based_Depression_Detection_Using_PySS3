dont stop me.... im fucking useless.I hurt a lot on the inside... i always feel like people purposely want to hurt me, I always feel the need to die.... these past couple of days have been different in my suicidal world; I've been seeing this image inside my head along with voices.... this image... is me stabbing myself repeatedly with blood pouring everywhere and me coughing blood until I die... As one of my friends said, its something I wish to happen to me, and it's true. I keep thinking about doing that to myself no matter what I'm doing, I could be doing something that would normally take my mind off of this like technology, but I just sit there with this image in my head... non stop I've been cutting trying to create that image... on my wrists and legs.... Reddit, I want to fucking die, I want the most painful death there is, I want it all. I hate the fact that I have to live here with pain, I hate it. Please, somebody, end my life...
