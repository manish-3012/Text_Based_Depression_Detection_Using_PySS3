(Rant) How the Mighty have FallenI feel happy at school, I feel like I fit in, and suicide is the thing I think about the least. I have many friends, do my homework, and make my parents proud...

Is what I would say before we moved. Now it's the opposite. I used to be a prodigy, GT, the likes. I had friends, friends who would miss me if I was gone. I had people that I would miss. I do miss them. I miss having friends. I have some shambles of a social circle but they're all imperfect and not one of them understands me, not one of them can relate to me. Being unique sucks. I hate being special. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if I was successful, happy, fulfilled, like the other kids. 

I got my first F. As someone who used to get amazing grades, it weighs me down so much. Algebra is such an abstract concept that, even I, someone who advocates for the fact that you use math a lot in life, can say is bullshit. I'm much better at geometry but that's only for kids who are 'advanced' and after that you take algebra II. I blame my mom subconsciously, I just tell myself that I inherited her math deficiency. She failed math 5 times in high school. 

I've considered it all. Bleach, pills, noise, even freezing to death. The one thing holding me back is my dog. The thought of him being sad and looking for me makes me want to sob uncontrollably, kind of like right now. I think of all the stress and sadness I'd bring, but I remember that I wouldn't be there to experience it. 

My life is set up to be a complete failure and I'm only 14. I'm barely making it through middle school and I'm set to fail high school, work in a dead end job, live with my parents and die alone, not knowing the touch of another human. All that shtick about following your dreams and achieving anything just crumbled before me. 

I dreamt of running away for a while. I ruled it out after realizing I could be traced too easily and I couldn't give up my phone or laptop because, and it hurts to admit, I'm addicted to them. They are the only things driving me through my pitiful life. Wake up, Reddit, go to school, Reddit at lunch, finish school, Reddit home, sit on my ass, Reddit before sleeping, sleep, repeat. 

I'm tired of "it gets better in high school", because it doesn't.  Same people, same bullshit, same routine, just with more difficulty. I get to retake algebra I, but more patronizing. It's supposedly "no shame" but you can only take basic classes after it. If it was no shame they'd let you move on like normal people and not deformed experiments. 

The style of teaching they use is absurdly stupid. Twiddle your thumbs for 30 minutes while the most bland teacher you've ever met rambles about something X something Y, until you're hit with 3 pages of homework. If you're curious, my old school, the teacher gave you a packet, and you followed along wit the teacher, so you knew how to do shit. Homework was able to be done in class, if you shut up and did it. Fair enough. This new system throws it's hands up in the air with a big fuck it, do it yourself attitude.

Sometime this week my parents will find out I have an F. My mom was pissed when I had a C-, and now I'm basically fucked. My laziness is catching up with me, I've gimped my whole life, and I see no other way out but death.
