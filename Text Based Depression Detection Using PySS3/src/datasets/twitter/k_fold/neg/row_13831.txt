Hitting the weightsThat's how I cope with my suicidal thoughts, my anger, my frustrations. I have a minimalistic home gym, and work out every day while blasting some violent deathcore or whatever. This is just one of many things to do. And a perk of this, is naturally a better surplus that physical activity brings. Just a note.
