It's timeThe end of my time has come. Let us list all of the failures:

1. 3+ decades on this planet without anything to show for it financially
2. Failed engagement
3. Fired, quit jobs
4. Bouts of unemployment (currently 15 months &amp; counting. Before, 6 months)
5. Failing current degree program at enormous cost

I come from a wealthy family and all my family members are doing well except me. Anyway, I have had clinical depression for 12 yrs, and a severe form of it for a yr now. I'm done thinking about it. It will either be a jump from a parking structure when no one is around, or a hanging by rope. The life of man is nasty, brutish and short, as was said by someone famous. It is perilously short, said Einstein. And for all his fame, he is never coming back. They say to enjoy your life, for you are a long time dead. They say man believes he is killing time, when time is in fact killing him. They say much. But in the end, no matter what is said and done, we all die. The womb and the grave are never satisfied. It is time the grave swallow me up. I have lived enough. I'm tired of it now. God, take me and let me rest. Please.
