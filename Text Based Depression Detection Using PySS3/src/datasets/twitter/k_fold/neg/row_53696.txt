I literally don't see the point of living. At all. I don't understand human life.All you do when you're alive is work, most of the time a shit job you don't like. Then you force yourself to go to school to make a living. You deal with shitty family members who don't give a fuck about you, treat you like shit and are annoying as fuck. You have no one to trust because people are living breathing piles of shit, you have no one. You fight your demons every single fucking day. You have yourself. You have issues. You're fucked in the head. 

What is the point? Seriously?
