Fking hell. I can't take it anymore.I just cant fking stand this shit anymore I mean fk me. I'm absolutely cracking up. What the fk. I just feel ready to explode. I have friends and family, yet im so alone, all i wanna do is walk in front of a train, i honestly cant fking cope. Isolated, alone, shame, guilt, scared as fk but honestly, wish there was something else I could do. I'm fking trapped and I cant bear it anymore, Going to hospital won't help, I'm trapped there. I wish there was any way out other than eventually killing myself. FK Fk FK.
