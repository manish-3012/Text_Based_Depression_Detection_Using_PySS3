I'm completely worthlessI'm a female college freshmen. My memory is shit, I have to write stuff down fifty fucking times to remember it and yet I still miss deadlines. I struggle with the most basic of mathematical concepts, leaving me fucking lost in my chemistry class. I live off campus, so I have no friends in college. I have no free time for clubs.


I don't particularly like the remaining friends I have from high school (with the exception of a single person), I just hang out with them because I don't really have any other options. I don't have any social networking sites like instagram, and I haven't used my facebook in years.
I have a shitty part time job at a shitty store which occupies all my time on Friday nights and weekends. My old boss was amazing, but he was replaced by a cunt. The job is easy, but I make small fuckups all the time. I feel like many of my co-workers perceive me as stupid. I do not blame them.


Physically, I used to feel average. Now I feel ugly. I have horrible acne on my back/arms/parts of my face. I can't find any fucking foundation to wear because they all either look too dark or like I never put anything on at all. I don't think I really look good no matter what I wear. I've never had a single person be romantically interested in me. I don't really think anyone will ever love me.
I want to hurt myself, but I'm too weak to withstand any pain. I'm so fucking stupid and so fucking weak. I really want to die sometimes, and have a shit ton of suicidal ideation. 


I also have really bad anxiety and mood swings. Honestly, I might be in a great mood in the next twenty minutes.
I don't understand what the fuck is wrong with me. Why can't I just be fucking normal


edit: I got a pm from someone telling me I should kill myself... great sub this place is.
