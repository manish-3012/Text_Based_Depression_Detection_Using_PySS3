Goodbye7 years ago today my best friend from High school was buried in Arlington Cemetery. Tomorrow would have been my brothers 42 birthday, and two years and a month and a half ago was the anniversary of my sons passing. 

I don't want to see any more anniversaries, and no longer want to remeber or feel anything. It might not happen tonight or even this week, but I have every intention of taking my own life by hanging. No one will miss me and no one cares. I am a speckk of dust floating in the wind.

Goodbye
