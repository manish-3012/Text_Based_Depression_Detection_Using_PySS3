Would people start loving me if I killed myselfIt's not that I ask for much. It was just for some people to care about me. 

I'm a physics master's student in a quite good institution in my country and I also recently got a research assistantship position too. But even after that, I look around and there's noone to be happy for me or anyone that I can share what I think. It's just same crap 9 to 5. 

My family unfortunately doesn't exist anymore (mostly 6 feet under) and people I loved just do not want to talk to me because I "burden" them. Psychologist was not convinced that I had any problem that is concerning. 

Just the idea of people coming to my funeral makes me happy. I just wish someone to think and have just a little regret that they ignored what happened to me. That's all. I certainly don't want to die for this but I just don't have anyone.

Thanks for taking your time to read it.
