Trying to survive.Background info: I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts/ideation since I was very young, around 11/12 years old. I started therapy when I was 15 and have been going on and off ever since. I was hospitalized for 5 days when I was 18 and ended up back in the ER a couple months later. I currently have a diagnosis of Persistent Depressive Disorder with reoccurring major depressive episodes, and PTSD. I'm 27 now, considered very high functioning (working part time and going to school full time). I've changed my meds several times over the years, most recently adjusted them last summer. 

With the persistent depression, my "normal" involves experiencing suicidal ideation maybe a few times a month. Usually these ideas are vague; "I wish I was dead" or "it would be better if I were dead" or "I deserve to die". 

But my mood has been going downhill for months. And as of the past week or so, these thoughts have become much more frequent, intrusive and defined. Daily, without an obvious trigger, I imagine myself implementing means and dying. I imagine what it would feel like. It's not a fantasy because it brings me no comfort; quite the opposite, its terrifying and makes me feel physically sick. 

I have an individual therapy session scheduled two weeks from now (it was the first available). I've confided in a few people close to me that I'm having suicidal thoughts, though not in this much detail. I'm trying to stay on top of my meds. I'm doing everything I know to do, but everything hurts and I feel like I'm losing control. 

I don't want to go to a hospital again. The last time they just dosed me up with sedatives the entire week, I barely remember it though the benzo fog they had me in. I also don't want to get kicked out of school or let go from my job for being high risk. 

I just don't know what to do anymore.
