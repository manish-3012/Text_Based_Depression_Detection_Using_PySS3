Falling apartI'm 20 and about to drop out of university. I'm simply far too depressed and anxious to cope with the work load. I worked so hard to get into this uni in order to get away from my narcissistic father but now it seems that I will have to move back in with him. I have no work experience or skills whatsoever. The only thing I've got going for me is the fact I got straight A grades in my A-levels (not sure what the US equivalent is; I'm in the UK) but that doesn't mean anything to employers. I took a year out before coming to university and did do some volunteering in a charity shop but I spent most of my time in the stock room so it wasn't very useful. In this economy it seems that someone with no experience and mental health issues is not going to get far at all. When I think of my future it seems incredibly bleak and disappointing. I've been on an SSRI since Thursday but it's just making me feel even worse and the side effects are awful. I had therapy last Wednesday but I find it hard to talk about my problems. 

Thankfully I have my mother and grandmother back home who are hugely supportive but I can't live with them for various reasons. I have no friends back home though. I hate my hometown. It's not far from a major city but it's still small and incredibly boring. Everyone from my old high school is moving on with their lives and I'm at rock bottom. I have no confidence to make new friends. The only social contact I have is hook ups but it never progresses beyond sex. Nobody in their right mind would date a loser like me anyway. 

I would honestly rather die than face a lifetime of unemployment/misemployment. The only thing stopping me is the guilt of what it would do to my mum. I'm her only child and it would destroy her. As I say though, I really can't face my current situation. I can't think of any other reason to go on.
