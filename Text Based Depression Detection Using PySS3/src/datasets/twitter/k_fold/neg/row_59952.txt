I think the world would be better off without meI am really struggling today. I have been very depressed and exhausted for a while, it looks like I may have a thyroid problem but there is a wait to get in to see a dr. I have had a lot of fluid retention and weight gain so they had me stop all of my other anti depressants and anti anxiety meds. Iâ€™m a social worker and recently changed jobs so I have a lot of stress at work. I also am in a pretty hard hit COVId 19 area so thereâ€™s just a lot of stress with that. I dropped something off at my parents today and my dad was just looking for an argument about COVId 19 and poor Donald trump, I shouldnâ€™t have engaged but I did. This whole area is short on medical supplies and we have a lot of family in the medical field. It became a fight that ended with my parents saying how disrespectful and awful I am. Iâ€™m just done I had such little energy to start with today. I told my boyfriend the world would just be better off without me in it, he can find someone that is happier and skinny and move on with his life. Please help me.
