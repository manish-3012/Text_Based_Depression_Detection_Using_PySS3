Recurring thoughts that suicide is the answer.After graduating high school, I went straight into college and took six years to graduate with a degree in computer science, that was a waste of time since I can't program very well and passed thanks to classmates. I was lucky that I had cheap renting expenses and was able to get by with a student job.

After graduation, I moved states to move back in with my mom. I was able to find a developer position, but couldn't do the work very well and needed heavy assistance. The company was doing poorly and I was laid off in June. I felt my future was ruined and reflected on my poor life choices. 

I use to be highly ambitious, but didn't put in the effort or have the aptitude to reach those unrealistic goals. I have lost hope and keep reminiscing about the past. How I should've stayed in my previous state since I hate where I currently am.

I'm having a hard time thinking and writing this out. I have had cognitive issues and am not too strong of a writer either.

Lately, I have spent most of my time looking for jobs and reading them in my current &amp; previous state, but had a hard time applying to them. At this rate, I'm just going to be a financial burden since I'm not going anywhere with my life.
