Iâ€™m losing my mindIâ€™ve just found out the the girl I had feelings for for just under a year said she â€œwasnâ€™t readyâ€ and only said so because she wasnâ€™t interested in me.
This sounds stupid and it probably is but Iâ€™d rather been told that year ago when we first got close. This isnâ€™t the only reason Iâ€™m feeling like this but itâ€™s what pushed me over the line. Iâ€™ve asked my so called â€œfriendsâ€ to talk to try and get my mind off of ending it and the people who ended up answering just took the piss. If anyone here answers and mean whatever they say then thank you. This is my last chance. Iâ€™ve already tried to think of ways to end it without hurting the ones I love but thereâ€™s nothing and I donâ€™t want to cause them more hassle let alone being stuck inside 24/7.
Sorry for long post but Iâ€™m seriously losing it.
