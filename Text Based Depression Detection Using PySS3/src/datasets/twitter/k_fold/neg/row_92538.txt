Just another college student ready to give upIâ€™ve (21f) been doing worse and worse recently - Iâ€™m scared and canâ€™t get through a day without spending hours crying. Iâ€™m so ready to give up and the only thing thatâ€™s holding me back is my fear that itâ€™ll cause someone close to me to do the same.
