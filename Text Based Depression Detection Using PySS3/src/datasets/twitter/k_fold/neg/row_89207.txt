For anyone with suicidal ideationI don't share my feelings too often as the darkness is unsettling to most. So I'd rather not divulge too much right now as this isn't for me it's for you.

I struggled with depression anxiety and loneliness for years. I tried everything under the sun until I realized the simplest thing worked. Music. I have playlists for every emotion and mood and it helps me work out my own feelings. So I hold on to music. Every chorus every lyric every beat. I hold it in my heart and never let go. It keeps me going. It eventually healed broke bits to broken pieces to be affixed one day

With that being said, find one thing no matter how insignificant or dramatic it may seem. Hold on to it like its your anchor to this world. If you are at your very end atleast you tried to hold on to even the smallest amount of solace you could muster.

Also give yourself time to be hurt to heal to go through these emotions because it takes months or years to figure this whole life thing out.

P.S. you are not alone. Someone has felt the way you do and we no longer have them with us. So live for them.
