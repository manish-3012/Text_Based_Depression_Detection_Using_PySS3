back here again... i seem to be escalatingmy friend staying with me for a few weeks and in that time I was really happy wasnâ€™t depressed at all but since you left Iâ€™ve just been hit with everything again. if it wasnâ€™t for my dog i wouldâ€™ve done it. even though my dad is an unsupportive asshole with anger issues and my mom died, i wonâ€™t want to hurt him more for some reason

too many fucking problems.. injuries, pain, bad friends who fucked up my life permanently but at least i learned about the painless method now I have a way out thatâ€™s easy and painless 

 iâ€™ve been sober for a while now but iâ€™m probably going to relapse and get heroin tonight to numb myself.  when my dog pass away then iâ€™ll go, he never abandoned me and I wonâ€™t abandon him

sometimes i think he would have a better life elsewhere though

. since my mom died iâ€™ve got nobody supportive in my life, nobody that cares. iâ€™m invisible/unwanted and society sucks
