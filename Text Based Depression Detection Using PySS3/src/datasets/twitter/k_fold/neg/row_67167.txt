Why should I keep on going?I love people, but hate myself.

I will always take care of people over myself. I will always help people battle their own demons over mine.

I have always been kind to people, and tried my best to not bother. I always stood up for the people I loved.

I have been battling depression for a little over 5 years now.
My biological father left us when I was four. 
My stepdad came in, took his place, raised us like his own with my mum until I was 16.
Kids always hated me at school, I was always bullied, had no friends and never stood up for myself, but donâ€™t touch the people I love.

And 5 years ago, my stepdad started suffering from depression and left us.
Suicidal tendencies started occuring.
Nothing has been the same ever since.
The few friends I finally started to have all turned against me.
Tried to kill myself again.
Mum was starting to be broke and struggling, and I ended up meeting a guy that not only abused me, he raped me 3 years ago.
Suicidal all over again.
Fought for help, psychiatrist, psychologist, meds, have a correct diagnostic, have someone to help me with my vaginal problems...
I met a guy this summer, sweet gentle and nice.
And screw it all up, because I was too insecure.
My best friend of 8 years is getting distant, I pissed her off, I did something, and my mum is always over at my stepdadâ€™s these days...
My brother and my sisters are all dispersed and I am all alone. I lost my job, and pissed my classmates because I am too unstable to function properly in the team.

I hate myself so much...
