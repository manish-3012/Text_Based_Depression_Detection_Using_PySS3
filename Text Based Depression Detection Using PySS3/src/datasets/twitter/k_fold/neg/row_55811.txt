Life too frustrating . I want out.I'm a 26 year old lonely depressed dude and i'm tired of it. It's been like this my whole life. I hate it. I never feel desired, and the women I like are always in relationships. I feel like an even bigger failure because as a black guy in Germany I should be "pulling women left and right" apparently, but I have the worst luck.

Every time I take steps to improve myself, it all seems useless. I even quit watching porn and masturbating. Its been 8 days since. I go to a swingers club, find a girl that's into me and all of a sudden I can't get it up. WTF. I was at a party the week prior with no problems in that department. 

There are many other things, but these are the most recent.

I'm on a month long vacation right now and should be relaxed but instead i'm fucking stressed and crying.

I'm pissed, tired and I don't want anything to do with this shithole experience we call "life" anymore.
