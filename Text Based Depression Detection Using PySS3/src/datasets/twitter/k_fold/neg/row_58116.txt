GratitudeCame here to talk about how I'm feeling but now I'm just happy to see so many nice people still around. It's hard to listen to people when they are at their lowest, and I just want to thank all the folks who browse this subreddit just to help out. This place restores my faith in goodness in the world. Maybe that's a good enough reason to keep going. With each new day comes new opportunities to do good things. I'll forgive myself one day, learn to love myself again, and really be a positive force in the world like you guys. Where do I start? I just hate myself so much
