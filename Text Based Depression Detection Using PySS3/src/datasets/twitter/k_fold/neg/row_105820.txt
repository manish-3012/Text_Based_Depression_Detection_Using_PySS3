It's happening in 12 hours.Hi, it's the OP from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3inasb/its_happening_monday_night/) thread. Monday rolled around faster than I thought it would. My dad dropped me off at my university about a half hour ago, and when we got to my dorm and gave each other our goodbye hugs, I didn't want to let go of him. A few days ago I felt so relieved to die, and now I feel so scared and guilty. I actually don't want to die at all, but I have to if I don't want to be in pain anymore. My first class of the day starts in five minutes, but I don't plan on going to any of my classes today. I'm going to go through my day like I planned it, then slice my wrists open tonight in my dorm.

UPDATE: Not sure what the etiquette is on this sub, but I figured you may want an update. I'm still alive. There was one redditor in particular who messaged me all day, talking me out of it, and Skyped me for over an hour to make sure I was okay. Not to sound cheesy, but the supportive comments on this post helped pull me away from the ledge as well, knowing that there are so any people - strangers, at that - who want me to stay alive. I plan on going to my school's therapist today and tell them about yesterday and possibly seek out another trip to the hospital. I wish I could give all of you a big hug. Thank you so much for helping me survive another day.
