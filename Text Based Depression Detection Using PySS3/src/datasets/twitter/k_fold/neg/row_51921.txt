i wanna hold a gun to my headit's in my car, my emotions are erratic, I can't calm down. 

Google says to tell two close friends but i don't have any, basically at all , much less those im comfortable with telling im suicidal, and that could actually help plus it's late idk. I did text one person vaguely but she's sleeping which is fine 

i feel like i "cry wolf" a lot because im dramatic and haven't attempted and was told today from my significant other that people think im fine bc i say im fine and make a lot of jokes about the whole thing but im not comfortable opening up to any of the people around me (3 people i don't see often at all(at all))) or any random person who asks me what's wrong but i really do always feel so suicidal lately im just. 

im hyperventilatingi can't see what would happen in the immediate future if i killed myself besides it being messy.
all i can see is awful visuals of hanging from my neck, how weird i look in my reflection, and what I'd look like holding a gun to my head. 
i was thinking of calling a hotline but i have really bad anxiety with phone calls and ive heard about more bad experiences than good from them i feel so stuck. 
i wanna bring my gun inside but idk im scared but i also don't want to be here but 

i stopped seeing my therapist earlier this month bc i don't have the support around me to keep seeing him, esp when i feel so much worse trying to work through a lot of childhood trauma and then just sitting by myself for days afterwards until my next appointment. it was making me sick and really manic and i was self harming a lot, which is an option since normally i feel better and can come down from whatever this feeling 
another option was texting him but im afraid he won't be awake either, or he will be and notify authorities since he has my address but im afraid if i get up to shower and hurt myself im just going straight for my gun 
i don't want to feel like this and i don't think i really want to kill myself i am actively seeking ways to avoid it I think?? i just am so scared for myself and so upset because i really don't want to be here and alive but don't have a single person i can really tell and feel safe around and validated idk i just found this so im here
