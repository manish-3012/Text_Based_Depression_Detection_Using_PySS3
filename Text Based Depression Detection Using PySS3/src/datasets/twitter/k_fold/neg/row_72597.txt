Really contemplating...Really contemplating suicide right now. Got turned down for yet another job. It just seems the universe has everything against me. I think I'm going to start my note soon. The weight of my failures is so heavy it's hard to just get out of bed most days. I just want to toss in the towel, say my goodbyes and make my pain and misery to go away. I've posted on here a lot so I'm already going to assume no one will even comment on here since everyone thinks I'm "the boy who cried wolf." No one would even notice I'm gone.
