I feel totally worthless.I'm completely dependent on others for my self esteem. I feel so lonely. I feel like no one wants me, or if they do, it's only for sex. I can't stop myself from carving up my arms. It's hard to get past the thought that if I were only brave enough to cut a little deeper, all of my pain might go away.
