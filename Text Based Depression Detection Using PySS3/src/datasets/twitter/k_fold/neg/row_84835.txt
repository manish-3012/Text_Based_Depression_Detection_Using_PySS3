Please helpI'm not sure if this is the correct sub reddit to post this.

But I have been feeling suicidal lately, and I can't break some thoughts down. (I have intense OCD and aspergers)

Neither care center nor psychiatrists permit me CBT or curator talks, I have no fucking idea what to do.

Got any ideas on how to proceed with life?
