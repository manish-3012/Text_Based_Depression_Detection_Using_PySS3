Why notDon't see a point in trying anymore. I don't care if I hurt the ones who love me. I don't have the motivation to work for a good future. Nothing about life is fun anymore. I'm so fucking numb. I don't see why I shouldn't just get it done and over with. I hope this will be my last post, that I will finally be strong enough to go through and kill myself.
