So sorryI just want my family to know when they look through my phone, I am so sorry. I didnâ€™t want to get to this point, but I didnâ€™t want to drag you back into my problems so soon after everyone thought I was doing great.

 To combat this episode I started SH again and used real deal razors. Made vertical with horizontal cuts overlapping. That pain wasnâ€™t pain to me. It was bliss. I felt invincible, untouchable. But it was so short lived. So it became an addiction.

To Cody,

You were my best friend. You understood logical things like math and science, but not the depressed human mind. I felt like when I talked to you about it. You wanted to help, but didnâ€™t understand how. I am sorry.

To my Parents,

God. I donâ€™t even know where to start. I want to just end my emotional torment. I didnâ€™t want to hurt you emotionally, but by committing suicide, I did. I will see you in Heaven.

To my Siblings,

Look, we didnâ€™t get along well, but I knew you looked up to me. Sorry. I.. I wish it didnâ€™t have to be this way.

To my School, Teachers, and other Friends,

I am sorry that I put you through this, all I ask of you is to move the hell on.

Other family,

I loved you all, and forever will in Heaven, I am so sorry that I put you through this, I guess we will meet again someday.

To reddit,

I am sorry that you read this. I am sorry you will mourn the loss of a kid who you never even heard of until he died.
