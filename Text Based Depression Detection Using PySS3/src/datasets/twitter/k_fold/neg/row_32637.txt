Is it better to leave a note or not?I guess basically would it be better for my family if there was a note - even one that probably could never be enough to make it OK - or is it better not to leave something for them to brood over?  What about a practical one (is financials, contacts) versus a personal one? Maybe even a practical one is dumb because it assumes I'll still have some control over things I'll no longer have any control over. I don't know. Thoughts? Suggestions? Anything...
