Can we do this another time?Iâ€™ve been struggling for almost a year now. 
I have been my whole life really, but this has just been... different.

I have no one. I have nothing. Iâ€™ve completely isolated myself. I go long periods of time without even speaking, and I donâ€™t really leave the house anymore. Iâ€™m just slowly deteriorating. 

Had a lot of shit pop up recently that really helped send me over the edge, and have since been begging for help - to no avail. 

Started using again. During one of my comedowns after a two week binge and its subsequent heightened state of distress, I just turned and saw the razor I used for my drugs, and before I know it I started slicing down my arm. It didnâ€™t take much before, for whatever reason, I stopped and decided I needed to ask for help. In hysterics, with blood staining my long sleeved shirt and starting to creep down my hand and drip to the floor, I walked out of my bathroom, approached my parent, and begged for help. I was only met with, â€œCan we do this another time? Itâ€™s getting late.â€ 

Essentially being asked to reschedule my mental breakdown was really hurtful, but I tried to compromise asking when itâ€™d be convenient for them. Annoyed, they gave me a day where they said theyâ€™d take me somewhere. I felt a little bit of relief, enough to start to gain back some composure. That day comes and I wasnâ€™t taken because it was too inconveniencing. They had one thing to do that day, which took them about 30 minutes to accomplish, but that was evidently more important than my wellbeing. 

Since then, Iâ€™ve been trying to just make it through each day. But knowing how insignificant I am on top of everything else is making it really hard for me to even want to try anymore. 

I donâ€™t know. 
Iâ€™m just exhausted.
