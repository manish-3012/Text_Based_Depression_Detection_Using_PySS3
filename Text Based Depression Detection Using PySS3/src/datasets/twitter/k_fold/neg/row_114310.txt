The clock is ticking awayI'm a 26 year old male virgin. The fact that I have not had any sort of relationship with a girl is seriously wearing on my psyche. How I cope with my condition is I imagine that I died, however, everybody important to me has a chance to convince me to live and during my thought experiment I teach everybody around me why their reasoning is flawed or why they do not have the qualifications or credibility to tell me how to live or end my life. Nobody knows I am suicidal and have been since I was younger when important people in my life have died. This is why I think I cope with my condition through thought experiments such as this, because I WILL NOT, talk to or open up to, anybody in my life. Ever since the deaths of important people in my immediate family when I was younger I refused to let people know about my suicidal thoughts. I gave myself until the age of 25 to lose my virginity or I would commit suicide, and I almost did. I thought about writing a goodbye on my facebook wall, I never go on facebook, but I'm glad I didn't because I did not go through with it and my secret would have come out into the open. Coming so close to death is strange, I kept thinking about my little sister and fictional conversations between me and my family/friends where they try to convince me to live but I wouldn't listen. The reason I did not do it was because I did not want to leave my family in debt to deal with the funeral costs and my student loans because I remember the toll it took on us when we went through my brothers and sisters funeral... I decided that I would postpone my suicide until after I pay off my loans and save up enough money to cover the cost of the funeral. I'm almost there. The only happiness I'm able to get in life comes from my thought experiments where I imagine how my suicide will affect people I know or have met, where they learn how and why I'm committing suicide. Is that bad? I do not know. Anyway, I do not have much going on in life, I'm looking forward to the end but I do not know if I will be able to go through with it once I have enough money to cover the funeral.
