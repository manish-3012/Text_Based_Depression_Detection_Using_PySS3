FailedI've lived with suicidal thoughts for decades.  I have tried to kill myself over 10 times in 30 years.  I have failed each attempt.  Six of those attempts were before I reached the age of 25.  Two of them were during my 30's.  These last two times have occurred within the last year and a half.  I thought I had it under control.  I hadn't made an attempt in almost ten years.  The little voice in my head telling me to kill myself has been something I live with every day, it's always there.  Day after day, night after night, I fight that voice.  But it's getting harder.  I'm older now and I'm tired.  Living in emotional pain every single day is a horrible affliction.  The last time I tried was last week.  I injected myself with 8 shots of blood thinner.  It was supposed to make me die.  Nothing happened.  I woke up the next morning wondering why I'm still here.  I fail at everything, even suicide.  I just want to end it.
