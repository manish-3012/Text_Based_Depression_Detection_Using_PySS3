Can you tell a therapist about suicidal thoughts/desires without them reporting it/doing anything?Cause as it is, I'm too scared to talk about it. I list out my problems, and if they ask about suicide, I go all, oh that? I would never!

And, I don't like my autonomy being taken away. Which, I'm scared they'll be legally obligated to do. . ?

I'm in the US, and am any adult, btw.
