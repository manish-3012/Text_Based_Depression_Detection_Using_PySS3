Worried about a friendI'm worried about a friend because for a couple of weeks he keeps saying that he is bored, life is shit and he wants to kill himself. I'm not 100% sure if he is serious and I'd feel very uncomfortable asking him directly. He said that he is depressed but still I'm not sure if he is serious or not (we are making a lot of bad jokes all the time). I find it really difficult to assess the situiation, because I only know him through the internet and we live too far away to meet each other. What should I do?
