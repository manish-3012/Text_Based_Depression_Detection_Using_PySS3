Why live?My mother lost her jobs due to corona. No company wanted to hire me even before the outbreak. Now companies are putting hiring freezes on and I see no way I'll get a full time job with benefits in the coming years.

We are going to experience another Great Depression. This means tons of people will be killing themselves due to financial ruin. Why not just be part of this huge flock? My life was awful before the pandemic and it is worse now. I don't care about "getting through this". 

I think I'm killing myself this weekend.
