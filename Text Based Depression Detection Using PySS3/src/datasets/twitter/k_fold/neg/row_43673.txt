What happens when the fear of death goes away?Iâ€™ve attempted a few times before, being hospitalized for my last attempt. What made me fail in the past was my fear of whatâ€™s next. I would get to the very end and something would scare me enough to back off and call someone.

But Iâ€™m not afraid anymore. I have a gun in the house. I put it to my head and didnâ€™t feel that fear Iâ€™ve felt in the past. The only reason I didnâ€™t do it right then, was because I could hear my parents coming in the house.

I think itâ€™s time. Iâ€™m not even sad about it. It just feels like a chore that needs to be done that Iâ€™ve been putting off for far too long. I was always great at procrastinating. Probably the only thing I was ever good at.
