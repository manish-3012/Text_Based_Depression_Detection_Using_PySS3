WonderingsI often wonder about how things will be after Iâ€™m gone. I wonder how people will react, how they will describe me. I wonder if theyâ€™ll bend the truth and say I was a lovely girl who was always cheerful and caring, or if theyâ€™ll be honest and say I was a lonely teen who was withdrawn a lot and probably couldâ€™ve gone so much further if only Iâ€™d tried a little harder. I wonder if any notifications will build up on my phone, if any followers will message me from any accounts because they noticed I havenâ€™t been active for a while, I wonder if people will send me messages when Iâ€™m gone, hoping that Iâ€™m in a better place. I wonder if those people who are no longer my friends will pretend to care, pretend that they loved me and that my death is a shock to them. I wonder if theyâ€™ll just shrug indifferently instead and think â€˜at least she was honest when she said that stuffâ€™. I wonder if theyâ€™ll even find out straight away, if news will spread and their parents will tell them that they heard from a friend of a friend that I had finally done it, I wonder if their parents will tell them that they are sorry and comfort them. I wonder if instead theyâ€™ll find out in years to come, when they plan on reconnecting with all their old friends on whatever app is popular then and they realise that there was never an account for me, because I donâ€™t exist. I wonder if people will feel bad, I wonder if theyâ€™ll look back at all my cries for help and feel like they shouldâ€™ve done, said something. I wonder if theyâ€™ll think I had it coming. I wonder how many people itâ€™ll affect. I wonder how many people will begin to care after Iâ€™ve gone instead of trying to be the support to prevent it. 

I know that one day Iâ€™ll do it. I know that this world isnâ€™t for me. I donâ€™t fit in here. It may be in a couple of years time but I will go through with it. I know I will. I know that itâ€™s what I want to do, what I have to. But I do wonder about how things will change after it happens.
