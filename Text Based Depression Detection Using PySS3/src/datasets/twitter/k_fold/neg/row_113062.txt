My Experience Being SuicidalI developed my depression when my social anxiety got out of control. All my life, I've struggled with anxiety. Even back when I  was extremely young, I struggled to make friends and attend a public school. My anxiety got so bad to the point where it made me physically sick, and I'd usually end up vomiting every morning. I lost immense amounts of weight this way.

One high school hit, it developed out of control. Being in a school with over 3000 other teenagers was too much for me to bear. I got sick every day, I missed classes and eventually just couldn't show up.

My doctor told me the best option for me was to go on a hospital homebound program until my anxiety was under control. I started on new medications and meeting with new therapists. Many of which helped me for quite awhile.

When I left public school, I lost contact with most of my friends. I felt isolated from my family, my friends, and those whom I cared deeply about. Both my parents worked all day and came home late, my mother was also an alcoholic and drug abuser at the time, even though I didn't know it, and my older brother wanted nothing to do with me. I was alone, all day, every day.

Eventually, I felt so isolated, alone and sad for so long that I couldn't remember whom I once was. I couldn't remember a time where I didn't feel sad, I forgot how I used to act. The things I once enjoyed doing no longer brought me happiness. 

I stopped caring about everything. My grades slowly starting slipping, as I was not motivated and didn't care enough to worry about them.

I planned to end my life.

I was a disappointment to my parents. I never felt like I was enough, I would end up starving myself to be skinnier and occasionally throwing up my meals because I worried about gaining weight. I felt as if I had no one, I was alone. I cut myself.

What was the point in living if you can't share a life with others? What was the point in living if you were always alone, always living a life on repeat, never feeling any different?

I cried until there were no tears left, until I was numb. I had watched a movie about a girl who attempted suicide one day when I was alone. That day, I planned to kill myself. I cried and my nose bled, but I didn't bother dealing with it. I sat in a puddle of my own blood and stared at a wall for what felt like hours. I was so mind-numbingly afraid. I said goodbye to the one person who seemed to care about me, the girl who to this day I owe everything to. She begged me not to do it. She called me and messaged me begging me not to go.

I had a handful of prescription pills, and I put them in my mouth. I had researched earlier to see how much I needed to kill myself, and I had the right amount. I held those pills in my mouth, covered in my own blood, shaking, crying and screaming while my friend was messaging and calling me like crazy. 

I ended up swallowing some of the pills, not enough to kill myself though. I pushed myself to get up and clean myself up. If I couldn't continue living for myself, I have to continue living for her. I cleaned everything up and once everyone came home that night, it was if nothing happened.

I still feel the urge constantly to end my own life. I still don't know who I am or who I used to be. I'm still alone and isolated. I still cut myself. I'm still hurting and scared, but I'm still here. I'm not too sure why, either. And I'm not too sure how much longer I'll be here because one of these days, I'm going to be brave enough to do it.
