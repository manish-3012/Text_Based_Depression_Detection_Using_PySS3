I Almost Bought Caffeine PillsI almost bought caffeine pills. When I ordered them, I didnâ€™t have any plan of abusing them or attempting anything with them, especially with how rarely successful it is to die of caffeine toxicity or a caffeine-caused heart attack. I just wanted to cut down on sodas.

Then my mind went into a dark place. I thought more and more of how easy it would be to â€œaccidentallyâ€ take a few too many, and to disappear completely. Iâ€™ve had a different, more successful method in mind for years, and to add an ungodly amount of caffeine to the method, off I pop for good.

But ever since I started taking antidepressants, Iâ€™ve started seeing everything in a more positive/innocent light, then my mood drops and I remember just how smoothly my plans could go, how easy it would be to off myself for good.

I cancelled the order &amp; decided not to cut down on sodas, since thereâ€™s no risk of temptation. I donâ€™t know if iâ€™m ever going to not want to disappear.
