I tried to do it last nightI drunkenly drove thirty minutes at like one AM to the seventh floor of a parking deck, and I walked on the edge. No matter how much I kept drinking and how much I kept thinking about how things would be different, I just couldnâ€™t bring myself to do it. 

That doesnâ€™t mean that the thought has left my mind, I keep thinking of all the ways I could do it, and Iâ€™m honestly afraid that Iâ€™ll be too much of a pussy to ever do it and Iâ€™ll be stuck living this existential hell that Iâ€™m in right now. I just want it all to end and I want to just be numb.
