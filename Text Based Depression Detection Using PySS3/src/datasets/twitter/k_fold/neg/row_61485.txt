School is making me suicidal and I don't know what to do.Hello, so I'm sixteen years old, living in Poland with my single mom. I know I probably don't lead a "hard" life compared to a lot of other people, but school is killing my. Currently I'm failing Chemistry, French, Polish, History, PE (I know, I know) and something called knowledge about society (learning about politics and how they work, stuff like that). With about three months of school left I would have to get straight A's to pass, which is pretty much impossible... And that just triggers my anxiety (which by itself is really bad right now). 

It's not that I don't want to live, but all I ever wanted to do in live is to go to Art School and while there start a rock band (shit career choices, I know) but how am I supposed to do this when I'm failing school constantly? I feel like such worthless person because of it...
