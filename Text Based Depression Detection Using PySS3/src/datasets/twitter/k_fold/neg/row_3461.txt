Iâ€™m so close to commiting suicide and Iâ€™m scaredTW: Suicidal thoughts and Self-harm just in case



I just want to die already. I keep on hurting myself. Iâ€™ve been searching for ways to kill myself. I just want to. I want everyone to leave me alone to die. Death is the only way I can escape. Iâ€™ve tried everything. Nothing works. Iâ€™m gonna kill myself. I canâ€™t do anything else. I have no friends anymore. I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore. Iâ€™m just so tired. And scared. And I hate myself. Everything needs to end. My life is useless anyway. Iâ€™m toxic and nobody likes me. I NEED to die. My life needs to end bc Iâ€™m a terrible person. I need to hurt myself because I deserve it. To feel less empty then normal. Nothing else helps. I need to die. I need to hurt myself. Sorry for this post. Goodbye.
