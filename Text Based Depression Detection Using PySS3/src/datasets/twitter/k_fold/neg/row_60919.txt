Can we follow up on people who are thinking about suicide?I know reddit tries to maintain some anonymity. But I am usually on between 8am to 4pm and will be giving to help anyone. I have no background in the field. But I have tried suicide 5 times and have recovered without the help of anyone. I do not know but I think this subreddit needs more publicity.
