I just got unofficially diagnosed with a bi-polar disorder and I don't know what to do.I'm pretty sure this is the wrong sub to post this is but I'm lost right now.

This morning when I went in for a med check my psychiatrist unofficially diagnosed me with a bipolar disorder (going in for a second opinion soon but it seems like a slan dunk already). I already felt unlovable before but this just hammers the final nail into the coffin. I've been told by at least two possible romantic interests in the past that "girls dont like broken guys" and I've hated myself since. I hate myself more now. I just want to end all his fucking pain.
