It wonâ€™t stop and Iâ€™m selfishThis happens every day. My family is mad at me. I think I should overdose tonight when everyone is asleep. Iâ€™m not doing my homework and Iâ€™m skipping classes becuase they make me so anxious. I have, for years, debated and always chosen no when asking myself if i should die. But Iâ€™m sick of choosing no. Iâ€™m sick of always thinking about how it will affect everyone else. I just want to die.
