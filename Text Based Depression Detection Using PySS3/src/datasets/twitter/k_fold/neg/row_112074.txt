I can't. I don't know what to do. I have to dieShit is so beyond fucking complicated, I can't fucking take it. My best friend says she can't trust me anymore and wants to distance her self from me and I can't take it I need her. my life the past 5 months has been hell and this is the nail in coffin I give up it's over. It's the easy way but I sure as fuck can't handle the hard way.
