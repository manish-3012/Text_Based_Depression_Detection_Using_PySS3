I'm not sure about anything.I have no friends, no one to talk to, no one to go out to get a coffee with. I'm Alone. "Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty" When i read this quote for the first time when i was in high school i didn't know what it meant but now i do.
Being lonely, not having any friends has left me empty i have money i have shelter but i don't have peace of mind or anyone that cares about me.
So why am i here?
i dont know.
