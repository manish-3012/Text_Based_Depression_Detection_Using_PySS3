I hate my life. And it's not that I feel sadIt's that I feel nothing. I feel like the empty shell of a person. How I wish I could feel something. That I wish I could even feel sad. But I feel nothing. 

The only reason I ever really talk to my boyfriend now is to feel sad because at least he makes me feel something. It feels like he doesn't love me anymore and he doesn't want to be with me. Who would ever want to be? But I'm still so in love with him and the feeling that he doesn't love me back makes me feel pain. At least it's something. I just want him to hold me, admire me, do something to show I matter to him. But I don't get that. Just emptiness. 

Sometimes being around my mom helps. I don't have to say anything about how I feel but she knows when I need her. It must be some sixth sense. She'll cook me a warm meal, take me shopping, do whatever it is to see me feel even a bit more full. 

I don't trust anyone, not even my boyfriend. I feel like I'll be judged or brushed off. Whenever I try and say something it feels like my throat is closing, like my body is physically stopping itself from reaching out. No one wants to talk to me either. Even when they know I'm hiding something it feel like they don't care enough to ask. But when they do I feel nothing but judgement and it feels like people are always trying to defend themselves. 

All I want is a wonderfully warm hug, someone to hold me and make me feel like nothing else matters. A long, meaningful hug. Something to make me feel like the birds are chirping again, the rain is falling slower, or even just a sign that I'm still living, not just alive. 

But I am dead inside and I wish to be dead all around. I hate my life. I hate myself.
