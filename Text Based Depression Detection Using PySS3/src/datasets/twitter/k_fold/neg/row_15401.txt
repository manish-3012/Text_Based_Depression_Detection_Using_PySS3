I don't know how many more months I can hold out.I'm thinking about suicide every day now. I'm looking for work and not currently enrolled in school. I have nothing in my life. I have no friends. I'm home all day; I have no leisure though. The whole time I'm stressed the fuck out. I hate my life. I want to start moving forward with my life so bad. I can't until I become employed. I feel held down. I'm going nuts being stagnant. I'd like to live and be happy, but if I can't I want to die. The longer in unemployed, the more attractive suicide is. It's all I can think of right now. Help.
