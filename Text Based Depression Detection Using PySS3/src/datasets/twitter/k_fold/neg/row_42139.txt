I can't make friends, I can't socialise, I can't learn how to do it. I'm jumping at midnight.I don't know why I'm even bothering typing this, a 17 year old with Aspergers who only ever wanted to be understood, and to understand. I just wanted to know how I could actually socialise with people i didnt in, but there were no answers anywhere, and theres only so much loneliness I can take. I cant even learn from vague self help books because of my aspergers.

I suppose my only fortune is that Scotland having the Forth Bridges makes actually ending all this a lot easier, its about a hundred foot drop, and I'll probably finally get the catharsis I need when I jump. I'm just giving myself until midnight to mentally prepare as much as I already want it all to stop right now.
