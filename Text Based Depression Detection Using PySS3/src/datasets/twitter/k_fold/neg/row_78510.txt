On the brink of madnessTeetering on a mental breakdown.

Having a very hard time articulating my thoughts. Apologies if this is a incohesive grammatical mess.

My mental health has been on a downward sprial these last few months. Each and ever day my suicidal ideation grows. Its fucking killing me. Today, however; it's in a free fall. 

On my way to work I found evidence that my father may be cheating. Initially, I felt nothing. However, as I clocked in, it hit me. 

Why? Why am I bothering to live? Why do I have suffer through agonizing depression and anxiety? It's so frivolous.

My father and the rest of my family are in therapy (individual and couples.) But I believe I'm the catalyst for they're woes. I didn't live up to my parents expectations. A child not worth being proud of.

Living the sterotype of a basement dweller. Staying in bed on my time off. Eating once or at all. No motivation or passion to pursue previous interests. Allowing myself to whittle away.

I'm ignoring potential health risks. Hoping that they lead to a terminal condition. I know, its ignorant. But my cowardice can't do it any other way.

Typing all of this out is making me feel worse. Maybe I can look back on this for reflection. I don't know.

Apologies for the pettiness and selfishness of this post. I'm done. I just want off this shitty ride.
