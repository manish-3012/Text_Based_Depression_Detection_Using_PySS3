Anyone got any thought provoking stuff to keep my mind off killing myself? lolLately I just been thinking about just fading away n shit and how nothin would b different if I wasn't born or some shit. I love deep thinking n all but I think I'm going a lil crazy just thinking about death and how little I'm worth. Does anyone have something fun to do or think about when ya'll get in a dark place? Lmk
