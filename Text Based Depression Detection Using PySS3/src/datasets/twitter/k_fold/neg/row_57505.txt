suicideSo anyone else feel like this? If there was a way I could kill myself but there would be no evidence it was a suicide. The reason I don't is because my mom and other family would be hurt to much by it. but If some random guy could just kill me or I get struck by lightning id take it. I really wanna just die. And I cant crash into a tree because my mom recently found out I think about suicide and am depressed so she would know.
