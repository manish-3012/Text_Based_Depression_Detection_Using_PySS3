My 20+ year old cat is dyingI can't take him to the vet. I have no money. A friend said he would let us borrow money to put him down. I can't until Monday. 

It's so painful to watch. Longest I been away from him was 3 months and that almost killed both of us. 

I don't think I'll be okay. He's so much to me. My steady constant in life. My best friend. And my baby. 

(Not meaning to dismiss anyone who lost a child or anything it's just that he was like a child to me. I don't mean to offend.)
