I need helpI've been fighting the urge the kill myself for a long time now, but the pull to succumb has gotten too strong and I've grown weak. My anxiety is so severe I can't leave the house most of the time. Every aspect of my life is controlled by panic. I've become useless. 

I have a plan. I think about it all the time. I need help. I've told my husband but he thinks he can "fix" my sadness by distracting me. No one takes me seriously and I'm scared that I'll give in. I can't hold on much longer.
