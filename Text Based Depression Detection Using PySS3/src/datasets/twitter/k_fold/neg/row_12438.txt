Highly irrelevant post.My favourite flowers are sunflowers. A close second is white roses along with white lilies and white daisies. 

I hate flowers cut up and in bouquets. We're all cutting a living organism to watch and enjoy its death. Every time I see flowers in vases, I feel terrible. But I eat vegetables and it's the same and we have to necessarily destroy to live. It's terrible but that's how it was programmed. 

Maybe my only consolation is that death doesn't deprive a thing or person of its/their beauty. 

I'm sorry I'm having rough night and I just want to hang myself but I can't do that to my mom and I don't have a rope but mostly mom. I wish I didn't have to live with myself anymore.
