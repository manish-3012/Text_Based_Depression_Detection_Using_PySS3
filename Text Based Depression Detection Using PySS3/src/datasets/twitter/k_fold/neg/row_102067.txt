Life with panic attacksI am going to end it. I have been mentally &amp; occasionally physically abused my whole life, I have never felt good enough, even though I feel that I have accomplished a lot. But itâ€™s never enough. I believe this is what developed my hourly panic attacks / racing mind. No one in my family likes me, my friends or SO donâ€™t like me. Itâ€™s like I barely know anyone. I canâ€™t ever please anyone, not that Iâ€™m trying to. I am just used. No one ever listens to me. 

I talk too much. I talk too much about things that interest me, I must be annoying. 

Iâ€™m constantly in a state of vigilance, I can never put my mind at rest. 

I have multiple health conditions besides panic attacks. Iâ€™m just tired. Tired all the time.

Goodbye, I hope no one else experiences this
