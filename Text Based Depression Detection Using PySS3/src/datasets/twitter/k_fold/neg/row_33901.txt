Iâ€™m a bad personI think the world would be better without me. Iâ€™m honestly a terrible person. Iâ€™m mean, Iâ€™m angry all the time, Iâ€™m hurtful and useless. I hurt so many people. Maybe Iâ€™ll do a good service if I just get rid of myself. Iâ€™ve tried therapy, 5 different kinds of medications and I still feel trapped.
