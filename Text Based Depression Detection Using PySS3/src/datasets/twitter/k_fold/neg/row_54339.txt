Considering it for the first timeNever thought I'd get there.  I'm a graduate student who was both very good and very interested in my subject.  Mental health issues, for which I didn't have the energy to consult, made me fail everything and I'll be kicked out of school.  I see a lot of people who had not the same motivation nor ability as me succeeding and it makes me feel sad.  Not that they do it, but that I couldn't.  I can not get back in my domain nor in grad school in general after a failure.  That's how that shit full of pretentious ass holes work.  No humanity.  You do, or we assume you can't.  I could if I was healthy.  They will never understand that.

I can't see myself doing anything else, I don't want to do anything else, I've lost basically all of my adult life to get there, only to be killed by mental illness after 7 years of hard work that now becomes useless.  I won't ever be able to find pride anymore.  If I live, I'll be pissed at this my whole life and won't be able to enjoy anything I do.

Sorry.  I didn't want to die.  Now I'm considering it.  

I don't know why I'm posting on here.  Perhaps to have the feeling someone will read and understand, somehow.  But it won't change my situation.
