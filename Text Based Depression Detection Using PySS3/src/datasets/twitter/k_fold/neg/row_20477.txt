How to get help.I'm not here to talk about my feelings, I just need to know how you tell someone that you need help.  I have severe social anxiety so I can barely talk to anyone face to face.  I'm a full grown man and my father is my best friend, but I just can't figure out how to tell him I need someone to talk to.  He's the only one I trust to talk about my problems but I just don't have the social courage to tell him I need his help.  He's the greatest man in the world, I know he would do anything he could if he knew.  Help me get the courage needed to talk and figure out how to communicate to him that I need to talk please.
