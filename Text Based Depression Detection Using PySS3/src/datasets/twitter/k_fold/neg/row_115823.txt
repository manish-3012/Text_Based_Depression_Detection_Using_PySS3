The future is so daunting.26/f/USA

This week I met a group of people I've known online for 4-5 years now. It was a huge high point. I haven't felt loved like that in a long time.  But after we all went home, I started feeling really down. A couple of other people told me they felt the same way, but I don't want to overuse them for emotional support.

I don't have much of a support system IRL and I really don't want to burden the people I do have around me now.

I grew up in a household with no emotional support whatsoever (childhood emotional neglect describes it pretty well) and I've had a longstanding pattern of latching onto one or two other people and just using them for emotional support until they get tired and leave. I don't want to do that again. One of the friends I met helped me yesterday when I was freaking out. I feel like reaching out to him again today, but I really don't want to be a burden or put too much on him. And I don't know if that's me being respectful, or me being 'waah waah dont worry about me, i'm nothing'. I do have needs, and I've learned to respect those needs in myself a little more, but I still have this nagging feeling like I'm going to ruin friendships again by being too needy. I'm just afraid.

I live with my parents right now and I've never felt comfortable showing emotions around them. After reading lots of books on the subject, I realize that they're both very emotionally immature. Their emotional lives are very shallow and they seem okay with that. Even though I know why, and I know neither of them will ever be able to give me the semblance of emotional support I need, there's still that little kid inside of me crying to mom for comfort. And it hurts. I've always felt like I had a deep black hole inside of me. 

Also, I'm at a point of potential major choices in my life. I grew up not knowing what the fuck I was going to do with my life and ended up getting a fairly useless BA. After school, I went through a long depression after not being able to find a job, then I moved back home and this continued. Then I got a job for about a year and a half which was really depressing (processing disability claims), and then I decided to quit. My decision was to pursue teaching English as a second language and I eventually got a certificate to do that. Now I have a job offer in Vietnam and I just feel paralyzed with fear.

I think at the center of all of this, I just feel like I'm not enough. Like I won't be able to do any of this stuff I set out to do. Did I even want to teach in Vietnam in the first place, or is this another stop on the "what the fuck am I doing" train? TEFL isn't exactly the most long-term career. Like, what the fuck am I going to do with myself if I go there and hate it? What other fucking choices do I have? And even being in Vietnam, I'm going to be one of the fattest people there. Part of me thinks "ok, maybe I'll learn to get over it" but I know I'm going to get tired of it. I think that's another thing. I feel tired by it already. I always feel tired. Then when something like this comes up, where I have a big choice to make in my life, I jump straight to "well, I should kill myself" because it all is so fucking daunting. 

That's my suicidal ideation pattern- whenever I get to a point where I'm like, "I don't know what I should do" in the big picture, I go straight to wanting to kill myself. Like, I intellectually know there's people who care about me and all, but I just don't feel like I have what it takes to succeed in this life. And I feel like I'm doomed to repeat my failures- spending years of my life doing absolutely nothing like I have in the past. 

I don't know what I'm looking for in posting here, but I just wanted to get some words out in a place that might understand. Thanks.
