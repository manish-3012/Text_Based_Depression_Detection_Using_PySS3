I think I'm done...I'm 36, I've been on meds, therapy, and had ECT for 20 years. I've come to the conclusion that there is no solution. I can't live a normal life, I can't feel love. I have been "successful" going off societies definition. I'm so tired, I'm so broken. My last love took all my hope with her. I don't know what to do anymore...
