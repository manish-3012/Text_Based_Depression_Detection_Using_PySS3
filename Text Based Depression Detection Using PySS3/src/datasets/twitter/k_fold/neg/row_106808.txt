Y?Idk wat to do. I keep failing. It runs in my family. I've constantly let the people closest to me down repeatedly. I constantly make mistakes that i should be punished for. I really think it's to late for me to achieve what i need and want in life. Honestly I don't think it was ever in god's plan for people like me to be succesful. Im a bastard born in one of the countries deadliest cities (Chicago). Maybe i was only supposed to be a pawn in the world, a role player who sets the atmosphere for those who are doing the right things. I really feel like I wasn't supposed to be hear and i never asked to be hear. Now im stuck in a nightmare. I don't fit in society. The mistakes i made in my past prevent me from progression now. I just want to give up, cut all ties. I'm at the lowest i've ever been and sinking further everyday. I don't even want to end my life to end my suffering. I know my actions cause sufdering to those i love. I feel like i owe it to them to just take me out of the equation.  My heart is broken, my bank account is empty, im in debt way over my head, my car jus got repoed yesterday, Im unemployed, my family is falling apart, and i can't take it anymore. Im done. I know i shouldn't be here but i fear death, but im less scared of it then i use to be. It seems like the easy to fix everything. To take my burden off those who have helped me time and time again with no results. Here i am now a failure of a man. The empty shell of a man. I hate what i have become and i don't want to waste the space and use up what someone with potential can create with. I don't waste anymore of god's time but i know i will have to answer for my decisions. Hipefully god knows that i always had good intentions in my heart, i jus wasn't strong enough. Im sorry for all the bad i put out into the world.
