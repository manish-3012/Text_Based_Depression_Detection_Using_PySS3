Been thinking about it for a while...My family doesnâ€™t support me. Financially is fine- I have a roof over my head, and then some- but emotionally not so much.

My mother always cuts me off from a subject that's important to me to say â€œoh your eyebrows are a little offâ€, â€œyour hair's a mess! (and by mess she means a single strand of hair.) I came out to her wanting to transition from female to male a few months ago (after feeling such a way for 6 years), and she assumed I was genderfluid, and I never heard her speak of it again. In turn, I assume that she doesnâ€™t want me to transition, causing me to pretend to be cisgender female, which makes her think that I lied. I am also pansexual, and nonreligious, but considering her reaction to my gender identity, Iâ€™ve been afraid to tell her. Because of this, Iâ€™ve had severe anxiety for the last 6 years, to  the point where I cannot read sometimes, causing me to fail one class (Iâ€™m a straight A student), and she acted as if it were the end of the world. She also yells at me when Iâ€™m anxious, and a few hours later acted as if she didnâ€™t know, and even goes so far as to say her anxiety is worse than my own. I am not one to judge, but my mother isnâ€™t the one breaking down in a crowded store.

My dad canâ€™t help it on his hand. Having brain injuries and PTSD, he says a lot of things he doesnâ€™t mean. Sometimes, he doesnâ€™t remember it at all, or even thinks he said something else. However, he thinks my anxiety is baseless, and I have no reason to be. I donâ€™t want to be anxious, but he treats me as the villain for having it. He is very anxious himself (kinda a package deal with PTSD), but I donâ€™t understand why he doesnâ€™t understand this.

My two-years-younger sister, who Iâ€™ve always protected and stuck my neck out for, couldnâ€™t give half a shit. I try to talk to her, and she gives me a withering glare and is incredibly impatient for something that will literally take just a minute of her precious time, impatience even turning to anger if sheâ€™s using something electronic. I know I never did this to her, even when playing games. She assumes I donâ€™t listen to her now, and because of that weâ€™ve been fighting more. I asked for her, once, to say that I bought something for her (which I did) to my parents so I wouldnâ€™t get in trouble, and she told me â€œdeal with my own problems.â€ Which I do, and then help her with her problems. She just hates me at this point.

Now, Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself for the last year. The only thing thatâ€™s making me live is my dog, the only one that cheers and supports me when I cry or am anxious. My family treat him like shit too. I have no friends, and am not dating anyone since I broke up with my boyfriend, afraid to come out to someone who was born and raised in the homophobic town I live in (not helped at all by the neighboring base, where stereotypical feminine and masculine roles are hyper generalized. Itâ€™s looked down upon if a manâ€™s wife is a marine, and he is not as well.)

I canâ€™t deal with this problem anymore, and if someone doesnâ€™t help me soon, I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do during my next anxiety attack. Note, that I am 18, and while I can move out and transition on my own, I donâ€™t want to leave my family, despite what they have done, and continue to do to me. Iâ€™ve been trans (mentally, unable to transition due to homophobic town and being a minor at the time) for six years, my religious stance being known for seven, and my sexuality known for four. My only escape is my dog, and video games which I have not had much time for it due to a busy college schedule.

edit: Forgot to mention that I am constantly in pain due to hyperthyroidism (only recently came up, but my thoughts have been the same long before I showed signs of it.) Sometimes, I don't move for an entire weekend...
