DID Boyfriend's Alter is SuicidalBasically the title, my boyfriend has a personality that took the brunt of his bullying from grade school. As a result, he has self loathing issues, major reoccurring depression (it's across the board, being the same brain and all) but it's mainly him. He used to pull out taste buds with a nail clipper, and has what appears to be melonchilia and is apathetic. Any ideas on how I can help him? I'd like the whole be stable, but he's the major hurdle.
