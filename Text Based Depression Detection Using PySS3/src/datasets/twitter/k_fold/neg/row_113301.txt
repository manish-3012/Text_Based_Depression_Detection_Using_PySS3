I see no reason to be here, no one actually loves, everyone is just faking caring about me.No one actually cares to listen and understand me.
Im at fault of everything, nothing is reversable. Nothing makes me happy absolutely nothing.
I have a plan to go outside the city and hang myself on a tree. I even picked a specific tree, its easy to climb has a place to tie a rope, and thick enough to hold my weight.
