My life literally is fuckedSo to give you guys an overview.

- I'm an 18 year old guy and I cant stop fucking up

- I managed to fuck over my driving record to the point where i'm probably gonna lose my license.

- I don't know where i'm gonna get the money to deal with this shit at all.

- Even if i don't lose my license entirely my insurance is going to be through the roof.

- I continually am fucking up in school (managed to fail a course and have to withdraw from a course in the first semester) and struggle with all my classes.

- I hate my job with a burning passion and can't seem to bring myself to leave.

- I don't even speak to my mother anymore because she went insane and caused a divorce between her and my father.

- I'm pretty sure my father is almost at his breaking point with me as well.

- I literally have no motivation for anything and have no aspirations either.

The only thing holding me back at this point is that i'm too afraid to off myself.
