I can't help myself, I think I'ma just kill myselfFuck this life honestly,

I'm 17 and I know I'm young but I think I have no hope, I feel like I've done everything I can but everything fails.

I've been diagnosed with OCD, clinical depression and social anxiety disorder, and I potentially have ADHD., I've been seeing 2 psychiatrist back then but they just suck and 1 of them misdiagnksed me with bipolar then give me the wrong medications that made me hallucinate and a zombie for weeks, I'm glad I stopped because I might end up with worse problems.

Now my father won't allow me going to another one because he believes that it's all in my brain that I'm the only one that can control it, and I tried from meditating everyday 2x a day, exercising, exposure, nothing helps. My parents are pretty ignorant about mental health and my mom she understands me but she doesn't really understands what I'm going thru, I am tired with this shit, no one can help me and I can't even help myself, everything is overwhelming, everything is hard for me, nothing is enjoyable, I can't concentrate easily bored and can't retain shit, no social life, failing at my classes, I feel like my life has been taken away from me, even music that's my passion is not enjoyable now. I am losing hope and basically suicidal. I don't know what to do and the only option that I think is killing myself.
