Deal for a life timeAnyone else make deals with themselves? I don't know if this is just me. 

Some background: I've never have kissed anyone, been on any kind of date, or experienced any love from people who weren't family. I guess this makes mean insel or how ever you spell it. 

I've felt alone for such a long time that o couldn't handle it and I started to genuinely figure out how I would finally end it. One of my friends found out and talked me down. It's still just as bad as before but now all I can think about was how sad everyone would be if I was gone. I also recognized that my lack of romantic connection was particularly my fault. 

So I made a deal with myself that if o don't have a successful date my the time I'm 25 I'll get to off myself. On the condition I actually have to try. So I'm actively on dateing sites and doing my best to make good first impressions.  

So has anyone else done this or am I just crazy?
