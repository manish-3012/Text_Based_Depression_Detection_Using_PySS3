The only reason I havenâ€™t attempted is because of how my family would be after. Does that mean I should move back with them and burden them?I (F, 25) should start that Iâ€™ve never had an actual attempt but Iâ€™ve thought about suicide a lot and even a few weeks ago I was researching what type of pills I should take specifically and Iâ€™ve never done that before. I havenâ€™t seeked help because i canâ€™t afford it and Iâ€™m too scared. I hate asking for help. 
I moved to a new state by myself and my parents and siblings are 1,000 miles away. I have one best friend within an hour of where I live currently. I live alone and I was recently furloughed which has left me to my thoughts by myself with hardly any real distraction like work used to provide. I started dating someone in March but there were a million red flags which I ignored because I believed him to be different, he is still living with his ex and his kids, he kept promising he was going to move out soon to live with me and heâ€™s been distant recently, today he finally admitted he wasnâ€™t ready to leave soon and he jumped into the relationship with me too soon and that we should break up. 
I donâ€™t just feel this way because of a break up, Iâ€™ve been depressed for a long time. Just feeling like losing the only person I had to confide in in the world and the only person I thought about the future with has sent me down a spiral. 
My main question is, do I admit that I have failed at growing up and moving out and being independent and move back in with my parents just so I donâ€™t kill myself? It feels so cowardly and burden like that I donâ€™t know if I can do it. Is there any hope for me continuing to live by myself in this quarantine?
