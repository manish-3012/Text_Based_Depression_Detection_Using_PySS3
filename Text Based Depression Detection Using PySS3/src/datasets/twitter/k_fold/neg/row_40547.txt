im scared because i could do itim away from home with two friends and i know it would be so easy to do something right now, like go for a walk and not come back or overdose on my pills or.. i dont know. im scared im going to do it because a small bit of me knows that soon ill feel a little better,

i feel horrible right now one of my best friends is trying to call me and i know they are going through a rough time and i cant even bring myself to answer.

i just dont wanna feel like this anymore
