It will all be over by Sunday.I grew up in an incredibly psychologically damaging home, and in a high-control cult as well. I left as soon as I could. I'm young now, early twenties. I've been unemployed for just over two weeks, and my money is beginning to run out. Before that I had a job I (mostly) enjoyed in a corporate environmentâ€”my first proper jobâ€”but that didn't end up working out. They really screwed me over, basically. It's okay though.

I've been depressed my whole life. I've been suicidal since I was nine. How could I not be?

I've tried anti-depressants. I've gone from having literally no social skills whatsoever, due to being entirely cut off from society, to being a fairly popular young person in a large, bustling city. I'm incredibly good-looking. I'm smart. I'm funny. I have a lot going for me on paper.

I'm going to kill myself by the end of the week because I can't live inside my own head anymore. I want to die, and I'm finally going to do it. I'm tired of holding out hope that things will get better. Yeah, they do sometimes, but it's never more than temporary. I hate myself more than any of you ever could. I'm going to jump off something very tall, and then I'm never going to hurt or cry again.
