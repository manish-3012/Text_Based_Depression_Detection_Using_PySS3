Tired, trapped, and hopeless... Want to kill myself.I've felt betrayal by my friends. No one cares. My parents make everything worse, pretending that They understood the whole time. Onto my 3rd suicide intervention program with the counsellors and nothing gets better. Every time I bring up back the subject ,y dad just yells at me for hours in hours, blaming me for it, and making everything worse, I can't trust anyone to talk to who wouldn't report me to the counselors and telling my family. They will never change. Everyday they break me more and more. My friends who I could trust just never cared. No one cares. No one is going to help me. No one can help me. I'm trapped and hopeless. My closest friends all betrayed me. My family doesn't care. Parents restrict me from doing extracurriculars because all they want me to do is focus on education only. I can't even go outside when it's summer vaction because they are overprotective. No one understand my situation, I can't talk to anyone because it's all a chain that will lead up to parents who will one hundre percent make it worse. I've never been so depressed and suicidsl in my life. Im tired of putting all this stress on my body thinking about Suicide but there's no other option. Parents are unchangeable, by the past 3 suicide programs that I specifically aimed at them. And they are just bad parents in general who try to break my self esteem. No one is goi g to help me, so I have to help myself, in the only way out of this impossible situation... Suicide
