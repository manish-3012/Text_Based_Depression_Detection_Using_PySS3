byeI'm most likely going to be fired from my job soon. I've yet to look for new openings because I know they won't be there. It's just a matter of time and when the day is right before I decide to leave. I was thinking about how other people achieve happiness and how that's unobtainable for me. I always remember going out to eat with my mom during Christmas time when I was younger. We sat down at a table and across the room was another mother and her daughter. I remember watching them laugh and talk and smile. I wanted to cry because I didn't have that relationship or feel the way they did. I bring this up because even then I never had the same appreciation and normality for life like most of everyone else does. I'm done fighting this and I'm done looking for hope in something. Everything goes wrong for me. I have nothing to say or share. I've repeated the same stories, the same plans, the same conversations, the same self-comforting, all in my head. The only person that was there for me was myself. I'm ready to die. If anyone sees this, my parents, goodbye. I'm sorry.
