Am I shit person for ignoring my bfs depression and suicide threatsSo a bit of back ground I (f22) met my fiancÃ© (m22) two years ago when he was suffering from mental health I did not know this at the time. I lost my virginity to him around this time and he lost his. He blocked me that same night and a few days later wrote me a lengthy explanation. 

Fast forward to now, I tried leaving our relationship because he became very insecure and controlling, no friends, new social media, canâ€™t go anywhere apart from work and uni and having my location on at all times. I grew very tiresome of this as I like to have a good time spending time with my friends and smoking the occasional joint but now Iâ€™m just at home all the time and honestly I feel depressed myself. When I tried breaking up with him he called me saying he was going to take his life as it no longer has meaning without me and that he was by the canal. I was distraught and pleaded with him and took him back as I canâ€™t bear being responsible for such a thing and the thought of it honestly scared me so much. Now a few months later nothing has changed Iâ€™m still not allowed to do anything, I canâ€™t even go smoke without him hounding me.

Right now I am trying to end it once again and he has told me he doesnâ€™t want to be here anymore and that he is depressed. I have ignored this as I am tired of dealing with his depression for the past two years as it is messing with my own mental state and Iâ€™m tired of being responsible for someone elseâ€™s happiness. So AITA for ignoring him.
