Eating disorder is killing meI am a transgender man and I have a binge eating disorder and have had enough. I'm sick of wanting to kill myself after eating food. I have tried to fix my habits many times alone and currently I now have the mentality of an anorexia sufferer, but I still binge. My anger issues are off the chart and I can't cry anymore because of testosterone, and I've lost a lot of friends because of my anxiety and depression and self harmibg, I had 3 panic attacks in Sainsbury's today alone and I don't want to carry on with this. I have always eaten too much food but over the last 10 years it's seemed to get worse, I eat when I need comfort, I eat so much then feel like shit after so I'd eat more to cope with it
Today I ate 2 tubes of pringles, half a pack of biscuits, 6 packs of chewits and 10 kit kat bars not including breakfast or tea 
I knows it's wrong and I try to tell myself to bite my tongue when I want to eat, I need to be empty and I used to write down every calorie I ate, but I'd always crumble and binge again and be right back where I started
