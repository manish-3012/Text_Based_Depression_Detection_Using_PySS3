I wish I was dead. 21 MI honestly wish I was dead. Iâ€™m never going to be able to accomplish anything in my life. I have no will power or motivation. My life is and is always going to be pointless and Iâ€™m never going to be good enough or be able to support myself. Iâ€™m just a burden on everyone. My bones are so brittle because I never leave my house. I have only left my house 5 or 6 times in over a year and 1/2, because thats when my ex left me and I lost my last job. I know my moms getting tired of having to support me and I feel awful for not being mentally stable enough to look for a job let alone actually work. I thought I had a job at Dollar General because my friend was a manager but that fell through now I've completely given up.
