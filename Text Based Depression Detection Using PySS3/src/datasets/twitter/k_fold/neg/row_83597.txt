I know that I've hot the friends and family to take care of me but I still feel like sh*t!I'm in high school at the moment year 11 going on to my GCSEs and I'm quite well known around my school year with a lot of friends with my family by my side. Though people are mostly depressed and are suicidal because there is no one for them me I feel cramped up heavy and straight shit as I have been feeling like this for years since year 6 though it wasnt as severe as it was I just felt depressed in those times cause of losing friends and starting a new life in high school. In year 10 is when I first felt suicidal around January, start of the year, I just put all my effort in on some tests and just stopped feeling like I was a part of something. During lockdown, when we're all broken apart, I somehow felt better because I wasn't judging myself on how I'm falling behind in lessons because I did nothing over lockdown. Just feeling like myself alone made me feel happy and not pressured but going back to school it just washed right over me again were i felt just hanging myself so i dont have to deal with any of this. I think another reason could be my friends saying that they're all depressed and lonely whilst they're more popular and have gf all of this and I dont. They are all happy but one second they cant do anything they are alone with nothing to do they just put them selves infront of everyone saying "I'm so depressed" or getting angry and agitated over being alone putting others in a bad mood not caring about other people's emotions which makes me feel like sh*t no being able to do anything for them whilst I look back at and think they have everything and I just want to be included. I have also speaking to a member of CAMHS (Children Adults Mental Health Services) called Katie and she has been a massive help for me but I still feel horrible about everything that I've done though others are just seeking attention for themselves which I dont know if they are but it seem like it in my eyes.

Thanks for reading and please tell me how others cope with this and how I could please?
