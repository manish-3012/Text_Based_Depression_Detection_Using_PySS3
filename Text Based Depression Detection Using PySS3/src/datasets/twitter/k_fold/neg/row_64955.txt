Why can't I just dieI hate feeling like I'm stretching out my death, I've been wanting to die for years. I feel too much nothingness. I have so much anxiety of everything I've wasted on Earth in my short time here, I don't want to live the full expected life span. I just wish I could snap my fingers and be erased from existence. I have no will to live. I fucking hate myself so much. I'm too stupid to even know how to successfully off myself. I'm a failure at everything.
