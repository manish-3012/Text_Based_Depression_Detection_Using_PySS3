I want to keep cutting myself.I've cut myself before and I've been doing more.  Not real bad, I hardly draw blood and it scabs really fast, but I keep thinking about doing it again.  I need to not do it, I know, but mostly right now because I need the marks to go away before i go home next week.  I don't know what to do.  Should I call 911?  I'm afraid they'll hospitalize me or something, and I don't want to be on antidepressants again because I'm really proud of myself for not being on them for so long (almost four years).  Should I call my friend?  I'm afraid he'll think I'm bothering him, but he's one of my only friends here and the only one who knows about it.  We've had some weird problems the past couple weeks.  But i really want to call him and be like, hey can we just watch a movie.  Except he always says no, he's busy, and i don't want to be all like, well then i'm just going to sit here and be sad.  Not going into detail about our problems but what should I do?
