Don't know if I can go onI have never posted anything like this before. But with nowhere else to turn I seek the kindness and advice of strangers.
I have dealt with depression ever since I was 13 and my parents split up. Ever since then it has been an uphill battle. Lucky for me I met a girl at 13. We fell in love quick. It had gotten to the point where I could not imagine my life without her. She was my everything. 10 years later, on our 10th anniversary, I asked her to marry me, she said yes. We had plans to move out together, get a house, raise a family, we both had recently gotten promising careers. Everything finally seemed to be working out for me. A few months later they hired a guy at her work. She developed feelings for him and then suddenly everything changed. She texted him all the time, he validated everything she said, every complaint about me. It did not take her long to become a different person, we fought constantly, she was never there for me anymore. 2 months later she calls the marriage off. We split up and gave all of our stuff back. Suddenly I don't have my best friend anymore or any direction in life. Suddenly I don't have a future. I am glad she is gone because it was a toxic relationship for those few months, but the pain she left behind is still alive and well. 

I have a great group of friends, but their patience with me is wearing thin. A lot of the time I don't even get responses anymore. They always hang out with me but my depression usually takes over and I end up crying. I feel like a burden and like I am making their lives worse. So lately I have been isolating 
myself. I hate everything about myself.

About 2 weeks after the breakup, I told my friend it was over, I tied a noose and tried to hang myself. He called the cops and they cut me down, half dead. I spent days in the hospital. I see a therapist and psychologist now, but none of it seems to make a difference. At the end of the day, I come home to an empty bed. I have tried multiple medications since then. None of them seem to make a difference. I am starting to lose hope that things will ever be better. I am starting to think this is just who I am now. And that I have to accept this or just end it. I cry almost every day. I spend my day looking for ways to escape. And when my mind is not occupied, I constantly think of suicide. I think to myself that everyone would be better with me gone because all I am anymore is my depression. 

I have always been a social drinker and always in moderation. But lately I have found myself seeking comfort at the bottom of the bottle. I know this is makes it worse but sometimes I feel like the alcohol is the only friend I have in the world. I know my parents love me and care so much for me, they visited me in the hospital every single day. It kills me to know what I do to them. But I wish this mattered more to me. I still cannot see a future for myself and I feel so damn alone no matter who I am with or what I am doing.

I fantasize about being terminal because that way I wouldn't have to make this choice to live or die every single day of my life. Truth be told, I really don't want to die, the thought scares me. But I am living in hell right now. Its a struggle to get through the days and the pain and loneliness I feel makes the unknown permanence on the other side a lot more appealing. I have no idea what to do. I am not planning on killing myself again anytime soon, but I worry if things don't get better I may decide its time to go. 

Any advice or sympathies would be greatly appreciated.
