Tried to slit my throat last night, failed, and my dad was banging on my door this morning because I still didnâ€™t apologize for calling him out on not giving a fuck about my depression18M.

Iâ€™ve tried to commit suicide a few other times, but last night I just sort of thought â€œfuck itâ€ and didnâ€™t care about how painful it would be if I didnâ€™t have a chance at survival. So I took the sharpest blade in the house, my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and pressed as hard as I could and quickly went from artery to throat to artery.

I have no fucking clue how, but it barely penetrated the skin. I just have a ring of dried blood around my neck now. I can PM photo proof if you donâ€™t believe me. I donâ€™t understand.

I knew Iâ€™d never be able to hide it from my parents so I just handed them everything sharp in my room and told them what happened. Dad 110% gave up on me long before this so I donâ€™t really know what I expected, but I definitely wasnâ€™t expecting him to be banging on my door hard as hell, demanding an apology for talking back to him.

Fuck. My. Life.
