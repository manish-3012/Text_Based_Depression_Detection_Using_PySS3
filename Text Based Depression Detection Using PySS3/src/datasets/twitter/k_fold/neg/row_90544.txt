Being forced here by a thread.I write this as I should be walking out my door, starting yet another day of this broken existence of mine.  Failure has corrupted me.  Sadness has taken me.  I have finally been raped by the words of others, after years of remaining somewhat resolute.  I have lost those that I hold closest. In short, without going too far into my story - for the sake of time - I am sad, lonely, and I have no interest in living anymore.

-I hit the snooze button again at this point-

I have, for quite some time, been ambivalent towards the idea of death.  It's a scary prospect, not living anymore.  Through our existence, we have only known one thing, and that's life. It's what's familiar to us, and we are understandably scared of just not "being" anymore. 

I had, up until recently, not cared whether I lived or died.  I would be curious as to whether the large truck next to me on the road would suddenly swerve into my lane, throwing me off into the thick wooded area to my other side.  I had a nightmare about this once, I remember ,during better times, and it frightened me.  I didn't want to die.  I didn't want to have those last few seconds of struggle and confusion, leading to that nothingness.  I had things, people to live for.  

Now, I only have obligations.  My mind is diseased, unable to take happiness, knowing that it will eventually be taken from me, leaving a larger hole than the space that happiness once occupied. My heart is riddled with such holes, and I have no interest in forming any more.  I don't want to take the effort living up to the expectations of me. I simply can't, no matter how hard I try.  I have to put on a face - a mask - to hide the fact that I'm despairing so that others don't feel uncomfortable around me (this mask has since fallen off - apathy wins out again). 

Without being religious, I am a very morally-obsessed person.  I've studied more philosophy and psychology than anyone else I know.  I think it is this reason, as well as my own cowardice, that I am still here.  I can't bear the thought of leaving such a hole - as I have mentioned earlier - in the lives and hearts of others.  I can't seek treatment (though I have my personal objections against this, though probably illogical) because my parents would think that they are failures - that I am (as I am) a sick, depressed child that they created and led down this path (as I am not - this is my own doing). For the very same reasons and more, I cannot kill myself normally.  My friends - as few as they are - would hate themselves for ignoring the signs (or so I hope they would.  I don't know for certain), my parents for their "failure", the people I interact with every day for the fact that they could have tried (most likely without success, but I don't know) to make things better. 

As such, I have flirted with the idea of making it seem like an accident.  I can try to put on that happy mask again, go about living my life for another few months (and oh I can hardly bear that thought), and end up driving under the influence in my rural neighborhood (less chance of hurting someone else) and hitting some tree, most likely (the uncertainty of this example kills me) causing my death.  Then I'm dead just because I'm an idiot.  My parents have told me a thousand times to never drink and drive.  My friends do not know me to ever drink, so they would not blame themselves for not stopping such an occurrence.   Then again, I am a coward.  I don't think I'll do it. 

I want to, though.  Each day is so full of pain. 

I might edit this later.  I'll probably delete it eventually.
