My life isn't worth livingI've decided to kill myself today. I'm 22, overweight, autistic, ugly and stupid. I have no skills, nor the aptitude to learn any. I havr no natural talent for anything. I have been unemployment for two years. The country I live in is a joke with no future for anyone who isn't rich or well connected. There is literally nothing to be content with. Goodbye
