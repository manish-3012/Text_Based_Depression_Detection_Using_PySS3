I wish for cancer or a heart attack literally every day.Dad left to work overseas around 10. Mom only ever cared about herself and drugs. Never actually been thought how to do anything in life. Moved around constantly so I never had any friends or any kind of relationship. I was put in homeschool because it was more convenient for my mom which pretty much ruined my future. I turned out exactly like I was raised to be. I get blamed for everything (which is not an exaggeration) including being a failure. Ended up gaining an insane amount of weight and after looking at myself in the mirror I became disgusted at myself. Now I barley eat if at all most days. Iâ€™m to much of a coward to kill my self right now but the only thing I want is to die. Why was I born? I have nothing and no one.
