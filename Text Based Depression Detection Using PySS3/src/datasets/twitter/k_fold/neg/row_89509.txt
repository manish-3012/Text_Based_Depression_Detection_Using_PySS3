I hope I get kidnapped by an alien, or something.Yes, this side of me has taken over, and she knows sheâ€™s right, she knows sheâ€™s right. She knows that when I â€œtry to get betterâ€ itâ€™s just escaping from the truth and reality. She knows that I will always relapse and come back to this place. Come back to her. She knows everything about me. She knows how pointless trying to live my life is. She knows that Iâ€™m only alive because of my family. She knows that sheâ€™s, I am, going to suffer for the rest of my life. She knows that this is the truth. She knows that when Iâ€™m â€œbetterâ€ Iâ€™m just avoiding reality, waiting for that breakdown to push me into this hole again, pathetic, trying to climb out of here, you will always come back here, you are such a.

She knows the truth. She knows. You should listen to her. Iâ€™m listening. Yet she doesnâ€™t know what to do either. She knows that you should be dead. But she knows you canâ€™t die, cuz of your family. She does nothing yet everything.

Youâ€™re so â€œawwwâ€ when you try. When you try to convince yourself. When you think you can sorta, temporarily escape from me. Youâ€™re not. Cuz I know the truth. I know thereâ€™s no point to this. Youâ€™re trying so you can live one extra second without being a rotten flesh, useless, but so aware of herself, thatâ€™s her only shining, still not sparkling so faint, piece of evidence of existence.

That she knows. At least she knows. Donâ€™t you hope you didnâ€™t? But we canâ€™t go back anymore. You knew your destiny then, and thereâ€™s no way of forgetting about it. Oh, you wonâ€™t forget about it, youâ€™ll just discover it again.

Oh wow. Hope you get kidnapped by an alien or something. Oh no. Thatâ€™s hurting your family too. Wow, you can actually hurt someone like youâ€™re that important, funny cuz youâ€™re not.

Not everyone is worthy of being called mentally-ill. Youâ€™re not. You know your mind is pretty fucked, but thatâ€™s just the natural outcome of your life, oh yeah, the life that didnâ€™t have to be this pathetic but you ruined it. But whatever. Youâ€™re gonna discover the truth anyway. Whatever. Is your mind fucked? Well, it has made you such a useless breathing organism for sure. Mentally ill, no. Mentally ill or not, youâ€™re the same at core, your truth doesnâ€™t change. Youâ€™ve just discovered it too soon, and youâ€™ve done such a terrible job outside of it that itâ€™s so hard for you to cope with facts.

Waste of all. â€œYou sound depressed.â€ Doesnâ€™t matter. Doesnâ€™t make a true difference at the end of the day. Just makes me more useless. Oh, what a human. â€œMentally ill.â€ No, you donâ€™t get to get that. Unworthy. Itâ€™s reserved for others, not you, not YOU, you, you, you, you. You should die. You. Me. I shouldnâ€™t be here. Shouldnâ€™t be alive. But being dead is a privilege too. You donâ€™t get to die. Youâ€™re here to suffer. And Iâ€™ll watch you pathetically struggle, â€œtryâ€. Itâ€™s such a boredom of a show. Arenâ€™t you tired? So repetitive. Youâ€™re always gonna come back here. Youâ€™re just living second by second, one more second of still living, one more second of avoiding to face the truth.

Oh and I know what youâ€™re gonna do. Youâ€™re gonna try to fight this â€œdemonâ€ now. Youâ€™re gonna find â€œflaws in my logicâ€. Oh Iâ€™m sorry for being so straightforward I just wanted to get to the fucking point so I made it simple for ya. Continue. Youâ€™re gonna convince yourself that most of what I said â€œcould beâ€ wrong. And youâ€™re not gonna subscribe to that. But you know oh you know...........you know the truth too. And since youâ€™ve found it, you know itâ€™s all an escape, welcome back. Have fun trying and going through this circle. At least thatâ€™s admirable of you. Look at you still trying. Look at you trying. Iâ€™ll let you do your thing. Have fun zombieing and getting away from the truth. Run run run...itâ€™s a circle, so hey!. Welcome back in advance.
