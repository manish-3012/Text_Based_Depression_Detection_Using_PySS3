Just looking for a comfortI know this may sound silly but I'm so sad. I moved to Missouri from Washington to be with my GF. I lost a lot of things in WA, my friends, my family. I like it here but the memories I have keep creeping up on me. I've had nightmares for the past few weeks about home. I've been reminiscing with my friends through text but nothing seems to work. I've beenever drinking a lot, more than usual. I don't know how to fix this. I'm religious so I feel I can't kill myself for fear of going to Hell. I can't kill myself because I know it will hurt the loved ones I know. I take antidepressants and they don't seem to work. What do I do? I don't know how to make myself happy aside from just ending things but that's bad and I don't want to go to hell. My gosh this is a terrible circle
