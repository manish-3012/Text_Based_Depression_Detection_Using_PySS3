My whole life in check.English is not my native language, so I'm using a translator, excuse the grammar. 
 
I want to commit suicide more than 10 years ago, every day I think about it, the idea evolves and becomes stronger.  Although I have seen lights of hope lately, nothing has really changed.  The only thing that stops me is the idea that no one escapes from this, ending the life of the current vessel in which I find myself will only delay the inevitable path.  What I cannot solve today, I will have to solve tomorrow, in this or another life.  Then I will achieve nothing by surrendering now.  But I no longer have the energy to continue, to charge a black hole so long has me very weak.  Energizers do not work.  Neither does meditation.  Love is not working either.  I see the past and my life has always been shit, I see the present and continues to be, so I think the future is just the same. There is no hope, maybe nothing will be enough for me, laughing or having a good time is very difficult for me, who was me many years ago, that happy child, already died.  Don't talk to me about therapy, my mother is a psychologist.
