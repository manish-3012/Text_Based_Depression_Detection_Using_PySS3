If it weren't for my daughter...My daughter is the only thing stopping me from offing myself or hurting myself.
I'm beyond stressed out. I work two jobs. I barely gave anything to her for Christmas. I returned the 2 things I got from my job on a discount, one of which was the only thing I got myself for Christmas, and I still had to ask my cousin for money because my bank account was in the negative. I haven't paid all my bills. I can't pay a babysitter. I owe money to my cousin, my aunt, my uncle, and I still can't pay my fucking bills.
I don't want to live. I dont want to deal with the stress and the pressure of the world on my shoulders. I don't want to be depressed and wake up to nightmares every fucking night anymore.
I don't get to see my daughter much because of work. My landlord doesn't like me and probably won't renew my lease. I can barely afford the cheapest thing here.
I want to kill myself.
The only thing worth living for is my daughter. That's it.
My suicidal thoughts have only increased even though I'm on medication.
I can't pay my first month of health insurance and I've been bleeding profusely out of my vagina for two weeks straight with no explanation and there's nothing I can do about it.

If it weren't for my daughter, I would have offed myself already. I've considered hurting myself, but I won't because if she sees it she'll kiss my boo-boos and that'll make me feel even more like shit.

I don't know what to fucking do. I'm at wits end.
I just want to die. But more than that I want my daughter to have a good life. Her father is abusive and can't give her that, but I'm poor and depressed so I can't give her that either.
