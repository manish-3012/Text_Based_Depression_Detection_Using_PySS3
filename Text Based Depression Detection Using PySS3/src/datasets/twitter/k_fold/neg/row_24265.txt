No one tells me they love me anymoreJust lost my partner of three+ years.  It came out of nowhere.  I knew he was struggling and I was too, so I want him to do what he needs to be happy, but doesn't make it hurt any less.  I was already having a hard night.

My work as a caretaker is emotionally draining and my family life isn't comfortable or affectionate, and I really don't have any opportunities in life or chances to get out and be around people, and I took for granted how nice it was having someone text me they loved me every night, even though in hindsight, recently, I was probably the only one saying it with him just saying it back.  

My partner made me promise not to take my life before he left, and I have to be around to take care of my grandmother because she doesn't have anyone else.  But I so badly don't want to be.  I just want the world to swallow me up, I wish I never existed.  I don't know why I ever had to exist if it just meant having to slowly lose everything.
