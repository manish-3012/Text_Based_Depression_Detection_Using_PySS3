i wish i didn't have to be herehi. everything is too much.
i'm not going to attempt because i know the people close to me will suffer and i haven't thought this through enough to create that big of a ripple in all of this. but i just now had the thought that i've always been a void, and i think i can shape things around it, and bring it trinkets, and angle it with care to the right angles so it can look at pretty things in pretty light. but it doesn't care. i don't care. truly deeply and genuinely, i don't care. i've never cared. 
to try to get this message across im gonna set this up: the me that sits under all the filler of personality and like, where im from, and the earth, behind everything- and i say "me" because i don't know what else to describe it as, it's not a separate entity or outside force, and the only reason "me" feels wrong is because of all that filler. this me, we will call Juliette. Juliette doesn't care.
it's all just fluff - it being literally everything else around me, and contrary to a lot of other people i've talked to about this, my void doesn't consume things and make them bad, Juliette just... exists. and i don't think she was made for here. i'm sick of everything happening all the time to me and around me. i feel like every time something happens in this reality it creates ripples and waves, and i'm really, really tired of them hitting me. i'm tired of being in the water at all. i want to wake up. i cant believe this is my existence. i cant believe juliette, i, was wasted on this painful fucking existence. and not that my existence would be more worth than someone else's, but just. a life. a grain of nothing turned into an even smaller grain of something for this. i cant believe it. nothing means anything.
