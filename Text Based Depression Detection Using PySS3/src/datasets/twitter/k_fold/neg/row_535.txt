I honestly hate everything.....How do you not end everything? Nothing has meaning. Nothing even has a purpose. I don't care about anyone. My parents mean nothing, my brothers and my puppy they mean everything but they equal nothing.  I have friends and I wish I could be as happy as I am around them all the time. If that makes sense. I honestly have no goals, well maybe I do. But I fucking hate everything, fuck. FUCK. FUCK. Someone talk to me and convince me that life is worth living.
