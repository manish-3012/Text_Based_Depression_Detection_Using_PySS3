Goodbye, WorldI just can't do this anymore. I'm killing myself tomorrow. I'm tired and the only way to rest at this point is death. Going on feels completely pointless cause it'll all end in death anyways. Might as well spare myself from a future full of suffering and pain. Nothing's ever gonna get better, and I'm not writing this expecting anyone to change my mind. I just wanted to write it down somewhere and felt like this might be the place.
