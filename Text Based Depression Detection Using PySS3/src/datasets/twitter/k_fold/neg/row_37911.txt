Attempted twice this week.And I failed. I don't know what to do- the last time I called crisis, they wouldn't admit me to the hospital because I've already been this year. 

I was raped a little over a week ago. My father abused me a few days after. My ex boyfriend, who I'm still in love with, just got a new girlfriend. 

I haven't talked to my friends in days. I know they're concerned, but I can't bring myself to talk to them. I'm not okay. The only thing keeping me alive is the extreme fear of physical pain. 

I don't know what to do. Every part of my spirit is broken, but I can't even succeed at my own death. 

Where do I go from here? If I can't bring myself to kill myself, how do I embrace life?
