I want to die.I feel like this life has nothing for me. The only things in my life are so superficial. I can never have true happiness. I can never have actual worth to someone. I can just goto my job, play some video games, whatever I do every day. 

Nobody here can help me. I'm experiencing unrequited love and it's torture to me. To have actual feelings that aren't just required or superficial...to have them so strongly for someone and them just be rejected. It's the worst feeling ever to me. 

I've spent too long "loving myself". I've spent too long waiting for life to finally get better. All I feel is worthless, because I'm not good enough for anything. At least, not anything that matters. I'm amazing at taking care of myself. Amazing at my job.  But what's the point of life when I'm just alone and have nobody to share it with and nothing of significance to show for it?

Nobody here will have the answer. Just goes to show how desperate I am. Desperate for anything to make me feel better. Desperate for a sign, be that to confirm my desire to kill myself or deter it. I don't know. Help me. Please.
