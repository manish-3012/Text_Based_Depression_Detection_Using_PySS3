Sigh... First time reaching out for help...As I have many friends who are redditers and know of this subreddit I'll be vague yet descriptive...

I've been depressed for about a decade now. I'm 21 almost 22. I've attempted suicide three times. Last time I attempted suicide the only thing I remember is laying down on the couch, siren lights flashing through the windows, and the paramedics saying I'm doing it for attention.

People who know me, were surprised the first time. I don't show depression, I hide it well, on the outside I'm a kind loving person. I'm happy. I do what I can to help everyone out. On the inside I feel as if I'm rotting. I feel dead. After my first attempt I lost friends, I've just been going into a worse and worse state of depression that it's no longer sadness. It's no longer crying, it's no longer feeling lazy. It's a numbing state of depression. I don't eat much, I kill my appetite by smoking, I just gave up on everything and I guess I'm comfortable this way. Tonight is one of those nights that I just can't continue going on... 

I never talk to it to anyone, I never show it, it angered me so much that the paramedics were saying that I was looking for attention. It did give me an excuse though to avoid being put into the psychiatric ward at the hospital. 

Tonight, I'm reaching out for help, for answers, for solutions, for anything. Friends, I have none. Family, let's not begin. All there is is me, myself, and I with prozac, xanax (purchased illegally), alcohol (I've become quite the alcoholic), and my laptop.

I don't know what to do... I don't see a reason to continue on... I can explain my reasoning behind not continuing on and not reaching out to anyone...
