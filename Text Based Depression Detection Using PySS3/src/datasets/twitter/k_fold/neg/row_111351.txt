Please anybody help me.If I hadnâ€™t lost my mind before I certainly have now. 
I have asked myself â€œwhat is my purpose?â€ For years to no avail. I have full on convinced myself my purpose is to commit suicide successfully. 
Iâ€™m on meds, have been since I was 9 (Iâ€™m 22), being swing a therapist at least once a week for years, been to group therapy, been hospitalized at different facilities countless times. 
I have ZERO support system. My family didnâ€™t even call me in the hospital or see me. They can look me straight in the eye after Iâ€™ve said Iâ€™m thinking of ending my life and switch the subject. I have no friends and no one to talk to. Broke, canâ€™t hold a job, canâ€™t live on my own. Canâ€™t live at all. 
Iâ€™ve also done ketamine infusions, ECT, and TMS. Is there really no hope for treatment resistant depression? Should I just give up and make it a game of how long I can last
