...So like I was going to end everything just put a gun to my head and pull the trigger but my parents were home and now I'm just suffering I still plan to kill myself but I'm starting to have trouble hiding it from people now I'm just constantly falling apart and I can't do anything about it I just wish I could've ended it but now I have to wait
