No One KnowsI swing pretty hard. One moment I loving life and then seemingly out of nowhere for no reason I just get sucked into to this sadness and overwhelmed feeling. That life is too much and Iâ€™m not progressing. I get strangely comparative to everyone around me and feel like garbage. 

No one know I get this one. Itâ€™s just me being off. Slept on the wrong side or something. Belittle truly I just feel depressed and get suicidal. And it scares me. I donâ€™t have the backbone to go through with it. At least not today... but what if that changes? A year ago I remember kissing my one year old good-bye forever. I donâ€™t remember what stopped me. But nothing changes. 

Just scared. Lost. Down. Probably just an echo chamber.
