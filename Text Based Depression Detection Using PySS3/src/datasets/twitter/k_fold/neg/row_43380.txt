One minute I'm euphoric, next minute I'm suicidal, it never stopsI'm gonna put it pretty simple, otherwise it would be sickening to read

Sometimes, I feel like I don't have a single worry in the world. During those periods, I always seem to carry a bright sight on the future, planning songs to be released if I get famous, planning higher education etc. It's like I completely live in my own bubble, observing the world around me with bliss. I feel like the entire planet is an entire living entity going in a certain flow.

But, it's enough for one bad thought to appear for my entire head to get filled with them. I suddenly lose all hope for humanity and the planet, and I know that I'm not likely to be able to change it very much. I sometimes even question whether this world is real. Then, I don't know what makes it worth to keep on living if I can just end all suffering forever easily.

I also know that if I were to commit suicide, everything would cease to exist since existance is only my own perspective. I have no way to perceive it any other way. Something that have kept me from actually committing suicide is the fact that I have no idea what death looks like, and that there is a chance that this world is in fact real. If I would kill myself, my family would be devastated beyond repair.

But as it seems now, I have a higher risk of dying by suicide than any other cause.
