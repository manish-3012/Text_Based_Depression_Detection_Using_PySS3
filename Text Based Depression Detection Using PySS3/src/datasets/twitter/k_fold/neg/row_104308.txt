Husbands porn addiction. I just want to die.He is addicted to porn and has been our whole marriage. Our stipulations were no porn and no side anything to devote to one another from the very start. He lied and would lie to.my face for years leaving me with this hole with this shame. I feel like there is something wrong with me I am.ugly I am boring I am hideous to him. He quit having sex and would go to porn deny it and become violent and vindictive if confronted telling me I was making it up. 

It hit rock bottom. I hacked the incognito browser modes. I find the proof 10 years into the making praying it's not him. He comes clean and I am just blown away by the nights and weeks and months I spent alone wondering what is wrong with me. Why not me. Speculating in silence. All the hurt and pain and torture of what he did the neglect the lack of love the emotional abuse and torture. 

It's too much to stand. He is promising to get rid of his computer his phone everything he can get online with but I don't trust. I just feel like it was my fault if I was prettier or better or like the whore women he watches on casting calls and that sick junk. I want to die I can't take the pain. I hate my ugly body and face and breasts and my imperfections that drove him there. 

I don't want to breathe. I just want the pain to stop. The hurt the 10 years of pain and loneliness. The nights I spent knowing he watched whores but never me and shamed me if I ever felt any urges. I can't do it anymore.
