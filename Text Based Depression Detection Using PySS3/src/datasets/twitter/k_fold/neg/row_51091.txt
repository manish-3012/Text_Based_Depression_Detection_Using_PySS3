Tried to Overdose Last NightWell... I got my grades back from this semester and I failed one of my bio classes.. I got so overwhelmed. I think Iâ€™ll lose my scholarship now. I freaked out and just did it. I made myself throw up right after though. I feel better today. I didnâ€™t take enough anyway, maybe like 15-20. My family has been watching me closely and Iâ€™m headed to therapy today. Itâ€™s weird, I almost feel better since trying? Itâ€™s like now the voice in my head that tells me to kill myself is like, well, I mean we got her to try! Canâ€™t tell if thatâ€™s good or not. Iâ€™m glad my family didnâ€™t send me to the hospital
