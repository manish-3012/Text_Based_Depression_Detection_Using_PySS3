It's come around againI'm going to vent here, soz

Every time it's more intense but this time I'm alone. My friends are there kinda but there's this gap where I can't open my mouth about stuff. Not because of them mind you, they're wonderful people. My care coordinator has taken a while off and Into screwed without him. My family are as shitty as ever.

And I hate myself. And I love to do it. And I look at my hands and remember I can do something about it. And then I remember that I still want to commit. Do or not do. Die or live. No difference in the end is there? So why not. I should right? Pills, so many pills I've used and failed because I'm weak. Maybe a noose this time. Seems easy. Practical. Horrifying of course but I'm in it for the long haul. So perfect! I'll hang myself. I can do it in my room and easily too.. but when? Have I really given up? Do I want to give up? Probably. Definitely. But yet

I'll prepare. Once it is done I'll say goodbye to the people who bothered to listen. And then I'll fuck em all by dying. Sorry yall, I'm selfish.
