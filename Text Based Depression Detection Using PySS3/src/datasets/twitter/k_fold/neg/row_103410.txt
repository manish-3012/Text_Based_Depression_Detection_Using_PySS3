The only reason why I havenâ€™t killed myself is because I have a little brother and sister.Iâ€™m an afghan veteran. Iâ€™ll be out of the military soon. 

I sit back sometimes and think about why Iâ€™m still here. Itâ€™s because of those two. I couldnâ€™t do it to them. Everyone else, whatever. Our parents.. whatever. 

Iâ€™m alive for them.
