I want to go backI want to be a child again. I want to be in high school. I feel like time is going by too fast. I want time to let me have more time to think. I feel like I need to move on all the time and I just can't sit down and just think. And I've had plenty of time doing nothing and yet. I graduated college and now looking for jobs. I feel like a failure. I don't want to complain to my friends because they have jobs and I'm just pestering them with my bitching. I feel like I played life wrong. I want to go an earlier save file. Or just stop time. I like to stay up at night. It's when I'm most at ease. Everyone is asleep and I'm just there with my phone doing nothing. I hate when I fall asleep and suddenly is the next day.
