I know nobody cares, so I really don't see a reason to keep living. Nobody wants me here anywayI know this post will be ignored just like any other cry for help I've let out. Nobody cares about me and nothing in my life is worthwhile, it's not fun being alive. 

I'm just gonna do it. Fuck it all, there's no reason to stay here.

I'm really gonna do it I can't wait.
