Hi.Hello, I was just wondering if anyone had any advice or anything for my situation. I'm 21 and I live with my parents, never held a job longer than a week or two, have no college education and no skills. 

I've been subsisting off the desire not to break my family's hearts by killing myself as well as apathetically refraining from committing due to it being too much effort, but at the same time I've been passively destroying my life pretty much since middle school by doing nothing productive (ie playing video games, reading fiction, watching yt, etc.). 

I keep going back and forth on trying to get a grip and just, idk how else to put it but just existing pointlessly, but I can't seem to do anything at all. I don't do anything.

Only times I've been motivated to do anything is when my sister yells at me and stuff, but unfortunately that just makes me want to take a knife and stab my wrists a bit.

I've been refraining from this because I feel like she'd blame herself, along with my usual disinclination to do anything, but either ways I think things will come to a breaking point very soon and I'd prefer an outcome where my family is left unscathed, though I don't have the heart to make any changes to myself which makes this, as far as I'm concerned, impossible.
