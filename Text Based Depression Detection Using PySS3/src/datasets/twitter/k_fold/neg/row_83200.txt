Im becoming a monsterI fucked my life up so bad. I don't feel a single goddamn thing anymore. I don't know who I am anymore. I've been calling and calling to get a therapist and no one's fucking ever available!!! I fucking hate this shit!!!! I've cheated and treated all.my exes like shit and had numerous amounts of hookups and shit and today was my last one. Not only was it terrible but it really made me look back to one of my exes who I can't believe cared about me so much. He did so much for me but I was blind as fuck!! I Fucking hate myself so much right now. Everything's starting to fall apart and it's like im on a ride I cant get off of. It's scares the shit outta me. I have a friend who I currently chat with long distance. We dated for a bit but I ended up cheating on him twice. He still wants me in his life though but I just can't trust him anymore. I get paranoid he's keeping me out of spite. Usually when we talk, he starts to berate me. Calling me a pussy, bitch and a slut (im gay btw)  he told me he forgave me but I just don't see it. I've broken up with him SO MANY FUCKING TIMES and he keeps coming back. I feel bad for everything I did but everything is starting to pile up. I got no one to talk to or anyone who'd want to listen. I've been trying to get therapy but idk how it's gonna go cause it's labor day weekend and I s2g I feel like im going insane!! I can't stand feeling like this anymore. I feel like im stuck. Shit, I can't even draw anymore cause it won't stop playing in my mind. Idk what to do anymore...

TL;DR im losing myself fast and all my creativity is gone and my life is going to shit.
