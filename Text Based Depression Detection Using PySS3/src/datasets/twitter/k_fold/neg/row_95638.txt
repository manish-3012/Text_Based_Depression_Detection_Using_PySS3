You've Ruined Me and I'm About Reading To Die. Are You Happy? [ Long ]Dear Narcissistic Parents,

I don't know what made you decide to even have kids in the first place. You should have stopped at my older sister; your love for her seems unconditional, and it's clear that's where the love ran out.

Over my 33 years of life, you've completely broken and ruined me. Your Narc behaviour, your emotional whiplash, your gaslighting and your physical and mental/emotional abuse have ground me quite solidly into the ground and, as things stand right now, I don't know if I'll actually get back up.

I'm not perfect. Sometimes I lash out and snap. But why is that, N-Parents? Why is that, do you think? 

Mother, could it be that you used to hit me every time I did something wrong to the point that my sister also started hitting me? I never thought this was odd. It was the 80s, people smacked their kids. But now I remember you never did it publicly. Never when dad was around. She was never punished, but I remember when I hit my cousin I was screamed at and told not to dare do it again. 'We don't hit people', you said.

I remember your thankfully dead skank of a brother asking me for a 'real, adult kiss' when I was a teenager because he was a drunken asshole. I said no but never told anyone cos I knew you'd call me a liar.

Could it be that, after a small foot surgery as a teen, you accidentally stepped on my foot, said 'oops sorry' and because god forbid I said 'ugh that hurt watch where you are treading' you said 'good I am glad it hurts', because it was too much for you to just apologise and actually mean it?

Could it be that you have knocked at my weight my entire life? That you have made me the butt of almost all of your jokes in company? Could it be that friends of yours I've never even met came to know me as 'the troublemaker', even though I was never actually in any real trouble?

Could it be that you threaten violence at me, but when I threaten self defence you call me disgusting that I would 'hit an old woman'?

Father, you never hit me. Growing up you were actually not all that bad. But thanks to that bitch you married and decided to breed with, she changed you. You're worse than her now. You call me abusive, you call me names, you despise any presence of me in the house. You leap out of your chair and get in my face to try and scare me, but when it doesn't work you just use words to make things personal.

I left my job to look after both of you. I took Â£300 a month pay drop to look after you. What do I get? Quips to guests about how I am your staff member, and you are my employer, but you don't need to pay me because I don't pay rent. I can't afford to pay rent, and you know that. But your goal in life right now seems to be the need to villanise me.

I do everything for the both of you. I cook. I clean. I take out the trash. I deal with the recycling. I iron. I do laundry. I hoover. I do the dishes. For 3 adults who are home all the time. And yet dad, you act like you are run off your feet because sometimes you feel up to taking out a third of the recycling, or washing up 3-4 items and leaving the rest. Mom, you do fuck all. You have me do things you know you're capable of doing yourself.

You outright refused incontinence pads and proceeded to piss all the way up the stairs on your lift - twice - and when I put my foot down you said that you only did it by accident 'because I never bought the pads'.

I don't know what I did in life to make you hate me, but I remember a lot of my childhood these days. For years I couldn't remember anything and didn't really know why. But now I know. I repressed it. I didn't want to 'wake up' and remember what your true faces are like. Now I know why I had recurrent nightmares about you, mother. I was scared of you growing up. You were violent, and a bully. You're still a bully.

All this and whenever an argument breaks out that you can't win you call me abusive. You threaten to call the council and have my carer's benefit taken away from me. You threaten to call authorities to deal with my abusive behaviour. 

I'm not abusive. I argue. I shout. sometimes needlessly. But it's all because of you. You have ruined me. I am a shell of a person with not a scrap of joy left inside of me.

I hope you're happy, and I hope you feel like absolute shit when they find my body in n alley somewhere after no word from me for several months. I'd rather starve to death on the streets than live with this any longer.
