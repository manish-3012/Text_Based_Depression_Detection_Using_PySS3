.I wish I would lose touch with reality. Then maybe I can finally intentionally or accidentally kill myself without any sense of guilt.

I know.

Go to bed and everything would be better when you wake up, donâ€™t you hear.

Billion worlds and realities, why couldnâ€™t you? Youâ€™re not special.

May you never hear anything again. See or feel, think or dream.
