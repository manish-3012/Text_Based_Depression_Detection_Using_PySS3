plansBeyond helping at this point.  Every attempt I've made to make my life worth living has come back to bite me in the ass.  I don't have the strength to try anymore.

I'm thinking hanging.  I might be able to pull it off by putting my belt around my neck, then putting the end of the belt into a doorway and wedging it tight so it won't collapse under my weight.

Wondering if I should even bother leaving a note.
