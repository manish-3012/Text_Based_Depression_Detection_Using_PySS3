I am a failureNothing I have ever done has been right. I am a failure. The only reason I do not kill myself is because I would screw that up. Life sucks if you're the loser. There is no release other than death. Things get worse, things get worse, things only get worse. Life is a zero-sum game and some people have to lose. I am so sick of losing. Do you pray for death? What do you do when you have no power over anything? I am so broken and alone and nothing was ever good enough. This is so empty, I wish I was born right so that I got to deserve attraction and intimacy, like a real person, rather than this fucking carrot on a stick that never comes any closer, no, only death comes closer. I don't fucking get it at all. How was I ever deluded enough to think that just because people say they are good, say they are inclusive, means they are. People are disgusting. People are so fucking disgusting. People are monsters; being self-aware and acting like they do, is the definition of evil. The worst part?  No one will ever care.  It's death alone now or then. I wish I had the courage but instead I just pray.
