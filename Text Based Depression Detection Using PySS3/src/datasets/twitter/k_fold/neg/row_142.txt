I've been suicidal for 15 years, why am I still alive?I'm turning 26 next month. I've been suicidal since I was 11. More than half of my life. Looking at the math, I feel like a fraud. I feel like I should have killed myself already. Survivor's guilt maybe? Why haven't I done it yet? Hope or cowardice?
