Maybe tonight or tomorrow nightMaybe today is just a bad day but I really want to. I want to take a bunch of pills and sleep, and not tell anyone. I'm so tempted. I would just fall asleep like normal and not wake up. I feel so conflicted, like part of me wants to live but then this part dulls those feelings down.
