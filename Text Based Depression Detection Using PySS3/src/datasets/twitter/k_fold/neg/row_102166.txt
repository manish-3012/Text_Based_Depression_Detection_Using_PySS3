I think I deserve to dieI don't think I deserve to live any longer and the reason is When I was about the ages of 9 to 11 I was an extremely problem child, I had extreme anger and behaviour issues, I was expelled from three schools because of violence, I was just so terrible and I hate that I did it all. I'm quite a few years older now and I know I'm not like that anymore and I know I've changed, but I still feel so bad for everything I did and everyone I hurt, even though it was years ago and I know that. I still feel so bad, I think I deserve to die and that's why I keep feeling suicidal
