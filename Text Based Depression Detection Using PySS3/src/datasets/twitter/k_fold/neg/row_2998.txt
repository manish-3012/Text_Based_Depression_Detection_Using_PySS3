Suicide at 18?I know this might sound weird, but I always had a decerped feeling that my life would end either at the age of 13, or 18. I had this thought since before I was 10 years old. 13 has passed, and I am now 17, 18 is two months. I just started college, and I had to take remedial math from failing it in the last year of high school. I am still struggling with math, I already failed the first test, and my second test is not looking good at all. I will have to take a whole other year of college again if I fail math again. I am struggling to keep up with all the assignments from the teacher, suffocating inside the workload. I have been skipping out on most of my readings to keep up with the work, going into the questions blind. I started to wonder about suicided recently, it seems like an easier solution to all the problems in my life. 

As well as suffering from the pressures of school, I suffer socially. I've been called ugly my whole life, and I get stares from people walking down the street. With severe social anxiety, this is crippling. It's gotten to a point where I don't feel comfortable walking outside in fears of people laughing at how ugly I am. I honestly think of myself as being the most hideous being that ever existed in the world. I was bullied for so long, and I have no friends, I am alone. 

Becoming 18 years old is just around the corner, and I can't help but feel as though, maybe I was right about my life ended at either 13 or 18 years old. I can't seem to do anything right, and I too impacted by my social anxiety to even feel free. I just want to rot and die, maybe it will end all this pain.
