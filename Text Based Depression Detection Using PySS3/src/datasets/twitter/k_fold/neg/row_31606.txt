How long did it take in therapy before you stopped thinking about killing yourself?I find myself thinking about killing myself a lot. I think itâ€™s escalated over the years. I think it started out with me just thinking about how I wished I was dead, and then it turned into me thinking about how if I was dead maybe the people in my life that treated me badly would feel regret about how they treated me. Now I just canâ€™t stop thinking about it, how I would do it, what would cause the least pain, ect. I find myself writing a lot of suicide note drafts too. 

I started seeing a psychologist after my mom pressured me bc she thought I was depressed. Iâ€™ve gone twice so far but I donâ€™t think I feel any better. I think I feel worse. I feel more upset and I think Iâ€™ve been crying randomly more easily since Iâ€™ve started. Did anybody else go through this? Did you see any improvement after a while? Should I be more direct about my suicidal thoughts to my therapist? Iâ€™ve mentioned it to him but maybe I underplayed it? Sorry if this is a bit of a rambling post, I feel rather emotional right now.
