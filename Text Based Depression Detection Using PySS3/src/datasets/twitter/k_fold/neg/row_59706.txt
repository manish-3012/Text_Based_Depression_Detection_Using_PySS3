Iâ€™ve set a date and Iâ€™m not scared ..Iâ€™m really ready to go. My cousin killed herself a few months ago and Iâ€™m ready too. If she can do then I can do it. I have no fear anymore and Iâ€™m ready. The only things thatâ€™s hard is the beautiful family I will leave behind. But itâ€™s not fair to me to live like this. In pain...So July 20th Iâ€™m going... but Iâ€™m gonna use this time to make some good last memories for the people that I love so they can remember that. Bc thatâ€™s all I can really do them. Iâ€™m so done, and after June 20th I can guarantee I wonâ€™t be here
