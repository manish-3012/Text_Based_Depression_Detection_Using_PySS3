Not exactly wanting death, just wanting to run awayMy life is unbarable. I've been through hell and all I get are people judging me for it.   
As a child I was sexually molested at 4 by a friend's father, then again at 7 by a cousin, then gangraped (oral) at 12 because I lied and said I was on my period.   
I have been emotionally abused all my life. I have been in poverty all my life.   
Then, I found love. We got married after several years of dating, and I became pregnant almost immedietly. After my daughter was born, my husband was hit by a car. He sustained a TBI. He wasn't the same that he was, for the longest time. Recovery has been hard. I won't go into details on his recovery but it was BAD.  
My daughter it turns out is autistic, as are we, but she's more severe and I'm fucking tired.  
I just returned to school after having to stop due to the pregnancy.   
And all I get from people when I tell my story online are downvotes (which i expect here, because why not, everyone fucking hates me) or pity, which honestly I don't want either.   
So I want to run away.   
A new identity  
Just to be somewhere else, someone else.   
I hate my fucking life.
