Demons in my headI have (figurative) demons in my head ALL THE TIME telling me over and over what a piece of shit I am.  They also put visions of death on screen two.  My mind is a continual projection of death. I see bullets tearing through brain tissue as they tumble through my brain. I feel the cold metal of a shotgun barrel.  I experience the blackness that would come as I sit down with a belt tied around both my neck and a doorknob.  

I can't stay away from r/watchpeopledie (NSFW).  The voices in my head consume me.
