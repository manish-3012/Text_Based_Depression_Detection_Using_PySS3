I think I will be alone foreverAfter being in such a long, unhealthy and abusive relationship, I have been dating again. 

At first I was optimistic. At this point, after so many dates that went nowhere, I don't think I will ever find someone to be with for the rest of my life. I haven't felt like I really clicked with anyone. The men who seem to have the right qualities aren't interested in me.   

Nobody normal is interested in dating a disabled person, even when it's an invisible disability. Even being attractive can't overcome that. I have no career because I got sick. Nobody wants to deal with that. 

I'm tired of seeing everyone else in happy marriages with families. It just reminds me that I'm not good enough and won't ever be. I'd rather just die than be alone for the rest of my life.

I have a lot of great qualities and a lot of love to give. Just no one to share any of it with. I feel like today might be a bad day for me. Hopefully I can keep myself from ending it all.
