Wish my parents allow me to own a dog to help my depressionA dog would change my life so much. 
I would:
- Go outdoors more
- Be happier and healthier
- Feel more motivated
- Feel less lonely
- Less depressed and suicidal

But sadly my mother will not allow me to and i will continue suffering the way i am.
