I know i might get this removed but might as well remove it from my headHi, i just made this account and do not seek help at all. I am very much ok with death and plan on dying before the age of 60, not the point but i am a schizophrenic, autistic(very functional so im ok on that :3) and severely depressed among other issues i will not go into, because of my experiences no solution to life for me can be found and i am now on the strongest medications you can imagine, i cannot sleep anymore either due to my insomiphobia. I have my plans set for if i do die and i know its cliche to say but, if life is real and an afterlife exists, life for me. Do the things i couldnt do, i dont know anyone of you but i just want you all to live like i couldn't/cannot. I do not know wjem ill die but i saw my reality in happiness and sadness. Colors change, air feels different, all of it.  My rant may be repetative or looping but thats fine too. No one recognizes a writer's work until he dies, so the story goes. How would my cousin feel if i died? Horrible? Happy? Is he even real? The nihilist in me says no but my recently small amount of feeling and remorse tell me yes. 

If my post isnt removed i will keep up to date perhaps, after all thats all im using this account for anyway. Hello reddit, i hope its not as horrendus as the internet says you are.
