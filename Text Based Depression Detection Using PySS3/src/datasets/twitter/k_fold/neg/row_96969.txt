I'm confusedIâ€™m confusedâ€¦

I tried my best to help my family, always showing an interest in their lives and trying to help where they can. I am far from perfect I have a lot of depressive episodes which cause me to go in on myself and isolate myself, and my parents and family perceive this as laziness.

I want to get better, but I dont see a point in living where I am in a loveless family. 

I tried my past to be part of my family and society but I always end up doing someone wrong or my mind takes over.

My family hate me, I hate me. I tried my best.

Iâ€™m done.
