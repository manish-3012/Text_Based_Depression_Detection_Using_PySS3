It's only fair that I get to die on my own termsI can't cope. I'm shit at coping.

If I'm already struggling as a dependent young person, life is just going to get worse. Everyone knows it. Life only gets harder. Don't tell me about it getting better internally because I know what I'm made of and I'm not made for this.

Shouldn't letting me die and not live be a viable choice of journey in life? Dying as a premature ending to Life, this great play with scripts and cues destined to end anyway?

Give me a choice now, since I didn't get a choice in coming to the world. Give me a choice to leave.

It's only fair that way.

Don't tell me it's going to get any better because as long as I am in this body, I will be tortured to no end.

The greatest irony is how all my pain started in a single moment of ecstasy in copulation- pure animal selfishness. 9 months of encased bliss then a journey to hell.

Please, if mankind has any conscience left, let me die. At least grant me the power to be the playwright in this tragic script.

Free me from this torture chamber that is my body.

Burn away the traces of my sad existence.

Scatter my ashes on Earth so trees and flowers can grow.

-

I will miss the trees and flowers.

But tempt me no longer.

I know the pain too well.

It is coming for me and it always will and it will never stop until I die.
