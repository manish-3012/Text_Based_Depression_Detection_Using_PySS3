I don't feel like I'll be taken seriously that's why I don't talk. (rambling)I have tried getting help from Therapists, physicians, reddit, and other places. No one seems to be able to help. I have posted before on another account but ended up deleted that account because I got tired of seeing "This is way too long" in the comments or just no responses at all.

I just want to feel good. Every day it gets harder and harder. I tried killing myself and laid on the couch after taking a half bottle of pills. It felt really weird taking lots of pills. My arms felt an odd pressure in them, they also felt light at the same time. With the exception of a sharp pain every once in a while. Yet, the next day I woke up in lots of pain. I lived. And I want to try again and succeed. I guess killing yourself is harder than I thought. 

I'm not sure what to do. I've tried taking risks, investing into the stock market, purchasing 2 lizards, and spending thousands on them. I have a nice chunk of change for being a college student. 

What do I do? I feel like no one can help me. I don't want to talk on the phone for risk of someone hearing me as I live with my parents. I just want a text talk platform. I want someone who cares. :(

My parents would be sad. But I don't think I can continue with pain. 

I also realize that the odds of anyone replying are slim as the last few times I posted on my other account. This is it. If I can't get help, I'm going to be a selfish a** and succeed this time. 

I want to feel better. Please help me. :(

I have done crappy things in my life and have asked for forgiveness and tried making ammends. I am starting to believe when I attempted suicide, I actually died and am currently in hell. I don't believe I'm real anymore.
