Iâ€™m trappedI want to die but I canâ€™t without hurting my family. Theyâ€™re the sole reason when it comes down to it. My friends would be able to move on but I know my mom would be broken. I canâ€™t kill myself knowing what it would do to my parents even though theyâ€™re the reason I exist in the first place. I never wanted to exist. I donâ€™t want to live but I have to. I can barely do the bare minimum to exist. I regret everything I do  even if it feels good in the moment. I donâ€™t want to try anymore. Iâ€™m tired and everything I do ends up making me feel horrible.
