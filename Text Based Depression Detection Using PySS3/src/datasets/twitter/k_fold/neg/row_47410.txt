I am tired
I feel as if im a blank canvas that is waiting to be painted but the artist has no idea or thought of where to start. I am there, blank with no colour or beauty, I am plain, and because I am just a white blank canvas everybody doesn't notice me. I am just there, out of sight, as the dust starts to cloud my mind. 

I am tired, I am not physically tired but I feel tired in my chest. I feel that hollowness as I look blankly on the wall, its like my soul is telling me that it wants me to lay it to rest. I just feel tired, I am being offered a job in a beautiful island in Spain and I have absolutely no excitement, I am just exhausted to go. it is what I wanted and I thought it would make me feel happier, but I have lived life dreaming for so long that my mind just doesn't want to live for false hopes anymore. I am living life dream to dream but dread the day when dreaming ends. my dreams have ended.
