Today is the last straw. I spent the last 3 years in prison because I'm stupid and can't argue well. I lost everything I own. I've been living in homeless shelters and I just want to start over. It's not that simple though. My life is fucked up beyond repair now. 3 years ago I quit my job. I quit because my boss and other coworker stopped coming in. For a couple of months I was the only person running the store. I got paid no overtime and was expected to do both their jobs including mine. I got fed up with it and told my boss I quit. He showed up before I can get the door locked and punched me in the face. We rolled around in the parking lot until the police showed up. We were both arrested. My boss took me to court. The public defender I got was a moron and I'm too stupid to argue my point well so they pinned a bunch of stuff on me including breach of trust and I spent 3 years in jail. All these charges stuck and now finding a new job has been impossible. Today was the last straw because I'm sick of these businesses asking me to stop calling them.  I'm tired of living in a homeless shelter. I'm tired of a life of no advancement because I got sick things and wanted a change for the better. 

I don't want to kill myself but I'm afraid that if things don't get better real soon I am going to kill myself. I've been pushed to my breaking point. It's not like I'd be leaving anyone behind anyway, all my family is dead. It's not worth living a life where things won't get better. I'm tired of these assholes telling me to hang in there because things will get better. When is the last fucking time they've slept outside propped up against the library waiting on them open up so you can go look for jobs on their computer? I'm tired of smelling like shit all the time too. I can't get to a shower regular enough to look presentable. It wouldn't matter anyway because of my criminal background. 

I just want to stop breathing and leave this world. I don't care what anyone thinks about me or what would happen to my body. I just want it all to be over and done with.
