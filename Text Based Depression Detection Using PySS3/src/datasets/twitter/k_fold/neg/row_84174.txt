Please help mePlease help me.
In the last 12 months I've lost everything.
My life is in a shambles.
I planned my own suicide last night.
Wrote letters.
Got my affairs in order.
Fixed any outstanding debt.
I was ready to do it.

I just wanted one last final conversation with my ex.
But she moved on within a week.
My community hates me. 
I've been defamed on most social media. 
I can't leave my house without fear. 

I haven't eaten for 4 days. 
I've only drunk water for days. 
I think I'm wanting to just collapse and die. 

Today and last night I researched for hours the most effective way to kill myself. 

And honestly I'm prepped and ready to go. 
I've got pills galore with alcohol to match. 

Every day I feel alone. 
Every night I feel like I'm going insane 
I can't sleep anymore. 
My mind is constantly restless with bad thoughts only filling my mind. 
It's been happening for the better part of 8 months. 

And now I'm just a shell of the person I used to be. 

I don't want to be here anymore. 
I tried reaching out to friends but always with the same response of " oh sucks you're depressed, I'll see you tomorrow" 
Then they never see me. 

I can't handle life anymore.
I need a real reason to live.

Please.
