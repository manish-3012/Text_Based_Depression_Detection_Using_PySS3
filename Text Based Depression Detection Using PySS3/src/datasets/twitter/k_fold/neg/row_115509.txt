I'm killing myself today.Nothing you can say or do that will change my mind. Neither of my parents love me. No one in my family reaches out to me or wants to speak to me. I have no friends with many dead ends. I have no one. And no one likes me, or wants anything to do with me. So i might as well kill myself, because i have nothing going for me. No one that wants to see me succeed, no one that wants to see me be better. 

I give in. I give up. I no longer want to be a part of this world. I've never been accepted and understood by anyone. Goodbye
