I need a reason not to kill myself todayI don't mean to sound over-dramatic, but that is what I need. I have a nearly 2 year old daughter and I live for her, but just lately it feels like her life wouldn't be any worse without me in it.

I don't have any other reason to keep going and I feel so low.
