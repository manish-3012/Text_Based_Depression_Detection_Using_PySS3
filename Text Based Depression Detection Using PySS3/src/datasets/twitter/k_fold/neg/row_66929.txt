I might kill myself tonight.I don't know. A part of me is afraid I'm going to actually go through with it unlike all the other times I didn't, but another part of me knows that I have to. Everything hurts. Too much. I keep going through these cycles of rage and sadness, numbness and overwhelming guilt and I just can't keep going on like this. Life has been a series of disappointments, one after another. Sure there's the ooccasional glimmer of happiness but it all fades away. I'm tired of not being in control of my life. I'm tired of being told my feelings aren't valid because I had an easier childhood. I'm tired of being told I'm better than I actually am because I'm "handsome" or "intelligent". I'm tired of all these god damn expectations I have to live up to. I'm tired of being told life isn't shit, because it is. It absolutely, 100% is. And that makes me so sad. I hate that this is all that there is. No crazy plots or heros, no magic, no sparkle, no happy endings. Just this same old, busy, dying world. I'm so... so tired. Things never go the way they should. Everything is so negative now. Etc. Etc. Etc. 
I wish my mom actually cared. I wish my dad's advice worked. I wish I wasn't such a failure.

I don't think there's anything left for me in this life. I really don't. Even if there was, I don't want a part of it. At least I can finally exercise some control over my actions now.

I can see myself dragging the knife across my throat, my blood spilling out onto my shirt and the carpet. It sounds painful. But the end of it all sounds delightful.
