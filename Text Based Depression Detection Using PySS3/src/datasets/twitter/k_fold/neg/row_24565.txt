Iâ€™m a waste of spaceNot going to lie, if I were aborted for being autistic I wouldnâ€™t even be mad. Well I wouldnâ€™t be anything because Iâ€™d be dead but you get he point.

I canâ€™t function socially. Iâ€™m ugly. Yes I shower and have good hygiene but that doesnâ€™t change my unsymmetrical face. Iâ€™ve never been able to have friends. Throughout school Iâ€™d get bullied and heated up. I grew yâ€™all quickly so it stopped because your average 13 year old is probably like 5â€™5 meanwhile I was 5â€™11. 

Please save your â€œsomeone will come alongâ€ â€œitâ€™ll happen when you least expect it!â€ Because itâ€™s lies. Iâ€™ve expected it and havenâ€™t expected it and nothing has changed. Iâ€™ve only known rejections. But why would a girl go out with an ugly autistic man when she could at the minimum get a average looking guy with a decent personality? I canâ€™t make friends so itâ€™s stupid of me to even think that I could have a girlfriend. 

I used to frequent incel type subreddits but they donâ€™t provide a benefit. They only make you more angry and tell you that self help doesnâ€™t work. It does but only to an extent. Plus I donâ€™t hate women and Iâ€™m not a â€œnice guyâ€.

Please save your â€œItâ€™s gets betterâ€ and â€œthereâ€™s someone for everyoneâ€ because itâ€™s a fucking lie. Iâ€™m the freak that ends up 40 and a virgin. You might seen me in person and think Iâ€™m normal but over time you see that no girls want me and no one wants to hang out so it then clicks that Iâ€™m a virgin freak thatâ€™s destined to be alone. 

*You make all these assumptions and itâ€™s wrong. Iâ€™m not fat or underweight. I work out. I eat well. I have good hygiene. Iâ€™ve tried socializing. I have hobbies. Im not a neckbeard. Iâ€™m not a hermit. I know most of you will just read the title and type your typical projecting responses so thanks for the â€œhelpâ€. *
