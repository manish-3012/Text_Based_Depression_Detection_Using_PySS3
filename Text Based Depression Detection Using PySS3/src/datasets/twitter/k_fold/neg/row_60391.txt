I wish my body would finally give out alreadyI never sleep, I never eat and when I do I purge it, Iâ€™ll binge on tens of thousands of calories and purge until 6am, and Iâ€™m just sick of this but Iâ€™m terrified of getting fat. Iâ€™d rather be dead, Iâ€™ve had an eating disorder for 20 years. Therapy wonâ€™t help, money and a different life would but thatâ€™ll never happen cos Iâ€™m a depressed chaotic piece of shit. The man I love left me cos of my disorder, proving Iâ€™m too broken for anyone to love me. Iâ€™m seeing 3 different guys but I feel nothing for them cos Iâ€™m too scarred from last time, and Iâ€™d never dream of telling them I have this cos theyâ€™ll find out what a disgusting monster I am and leave me. Iâ€™m so numb, I just feel nothing anymore. My life isnâ€™t worth anything, I just keep wishing my electrolytes will be so fucked someday that Iâ€™ll die of a heart attack in my sleep so my mom and guys wonâ€™t blame themselves. My jobs still in lockdown till March and I donâ€™t want to work anywhere else, I know Iâ€™ll just smoke weed all day at a job and eventually snap at a Karen or break down and cry like I did once as a mechanic working on something I couldnâ€™t figure out cos Iâ€™m such a stupid fucking loser. I freak out at everything and canâ€™t function unless Iâ€™m stoned and I donâ€™t really get that high anymore. Iâ€™m old anyway (36) so itâ€™s no great loss. Iâ€™m done, just throw the whole girl away.
