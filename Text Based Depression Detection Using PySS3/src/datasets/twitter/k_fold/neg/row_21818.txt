The more I think about suicide, the more enticing it becomes.If you think about it enough it becomes kind of like a fantasy. Death slowly loses its terror. It seems rational, because thatâ€™s literally what your brain is doing. Itâ€™s rationalizing it. 

The thought of not having to deal with the pain anymore seems like such a relief. I donâ€™t think killing yourself is weak. I think itâ€™s a release after having to be strong for too long.

Iâ€™m convinced that I simply wasnâ€™t meant for life. I look at some people and envy the hell out of them. Iâ€™m jealous of happy, free, attractive people. Iâ€™m jealous of their lives. Iâ€™m jealous of their looks. Iâ€™m jealous of everything they have that I never got the chance to have.

Iâ€™m 19 years old. Thatâ€™s not a long time to be alive, but itâ€™s an age where one can decide whether or not the rest of their life is worth living. Mine is not. 

I donâ€™t have hope that it will get better. How could it get better? Nothing about my circumstances are things I can change, and the things I *can* change have already damaged me psychologically. My life has always sucked. There are people who become depressed at certain points in their lives, but I am not one of those people. Iâ€™ve always had a shitty, meaningless life. I hate it so much. 

There are certain things I want to do before I die, but after I do them Iâ€™m signing off. Itâ€™ll probably be by 21 or 22. 

The bullying. The abuse. The social rejection. The mental illness. The self-hate. The self-disgust. The confusion. Itâ€™s TOO much for one person to handle. I canâ€™t handle it anymore. I have no one who will truly miss me anyway.
