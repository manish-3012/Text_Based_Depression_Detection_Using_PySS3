Iâ€™m out of reasons for anythingLife doesnâ€™t have purpose. I wake up, eat, sleep, go to school, do what people tell me to, then go home and refresh reddit for hours on a blank page because thereâ€™s nothing else to do. I stay up all night doing nothing at all because sleep is worse than being awake. I donâ€™t have any reasons to die, but I donâ€™t have any reasons to live either. Thereâ€™s nothing to look forward to and everything feels like itâ€™s fucked anyway, and I donâ€™t want to live painfully in hope of a better future anymore.
Iâ€™m too coward to off myself yet, but if I could with no strings attached, I donâ€™t know if I could find the courage to keep going. Iâ€™m very tired.
