if everyone hates you, no-one will miss youthis is my cureent mindset, I don't actively think it but I know subconsciously I do. for the past couple of months, I've been distancing myself from the people closest to me, avoiding them, talking to them less, or getting irritated by the smallest things they do, associating negative thoughts and feelings with them. I feel like this is me preparing myself for leaving, even though I'm scared of death. I do want to die, but it worries me more about what awaits after rather than the consequences on other people. does anyone else feel like this? does anyone else purposely, but subconciously, act horrible or distant to their friends and family because if they hate you then it's easier for both you and them when you kill yourself? I don't want to be a bad person, but I don't want them to think they're missing a great, amazing person from their life when I die, I'd rather they be happy I was gone than sad.
