Not sure if it's the right place but...I've got a bit of money left and I want to donate it before I go. You know, the *"last good action"* shit.

.

So, to whom should I give it? [Doctors Without Borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9decins_Sans_Fronti%C3%A8res)? [Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement)? [Amnesty International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International)? [Restos du CÅ“ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurants_du_C%C5%93ur)? Someone else worth it?

And how? Cash in a envelope? Via card and website?

As a 20 year old French citizen, would there be any legal repercussion on this? Should not me any, but one can't be sure enough.
