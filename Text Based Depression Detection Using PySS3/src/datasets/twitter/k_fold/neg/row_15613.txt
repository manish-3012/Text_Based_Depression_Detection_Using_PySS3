Iâ€™m done with trying to feel betterThe only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because I know my mum will be devastated if I ever killed myself. If she ever passes while Iâ€™m still in this state Iâ€™m not going to hesitate on ending my own life shortly after. 

Iâ€™m almost 23. I take my meds. I go to therapy. Nothing seems to help enough. I just donâ€™t want to be around anymore. I hate feeling like this, I wouldnâ€™t wish this upon my own enemy. My brain feels like itâ€™s constantly like a static tv here it wonâ€™t shut up from all the overthinking I do. I think Iâ€™m running out of options. I donâ€™t see myself living past 25. 
I just got accepted into a health science degree but I donâ€™t even know if I wanna try. I know Iâ€™m smart, but my mental illness holds me back to where I think I canâ€™t do anything and Iâ€™m not good enough. 
I need fucking help but I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve run out of options.
