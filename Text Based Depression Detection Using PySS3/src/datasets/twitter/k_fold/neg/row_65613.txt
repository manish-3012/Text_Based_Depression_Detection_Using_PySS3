Healthy substitutes?Ive been off my meds for about 2 weeks (my mental needs hold low priority to those around me) and I have strong urges to self harm again. Getting a tattoo is a nice treat since I get some art and poked with a needle enough to tie me over. But that gets expensive. Are there any other methods besides taking a blade to myself that might curb an cutting urge?
