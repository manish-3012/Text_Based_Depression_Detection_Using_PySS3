aspergers + a shit timewell iâ€™m young. iâ€™m only a young child almost in high school. i have a whole life ahead of me. i struggle with aspergers and that just is really fucking annoying. itâ€™s hard for me to make and keep friends. i canâ€™t communicate how i properly feel to people so i feel very isolated around the thousands of students i know. 

basically in mind right now is this:
everyone loves me, but nobody likes me. 

iâ€™m known as the â€œfunny and smartâ€ kid at my school. i won some stupid math contest and now everyone has high expectations of me. i feel like a tool for people to come for me for help. and because iâ€™m so lonely i give in for any chance for a friendship. so they treat me nice. i havenâ€™t told anyone about my aspergers which is really fucking stupid on my part but itâ€™s okay for me. i only have 2 real friends. everyone likes me for my humor and brain but they couldnâ€™t care less if i die the next day. 

and on top of this shit my girlfriend 2 months just broke up with me yesterday so i just felt like shit. as soon as i properly caught feelings she left. as for my only 2 friends, one of them has divorced parents and theyâ€™re both fucking shit people. i canâ€™t get in contact of him outside of school. and my other one i try my hardest to talk to about my gf sadness.

i havenâ€™t told anyone about me cutting myself and crying hysterically in my room. wearing my hoodie i used to give to my girlfriend so it smells like her, listening to sad music. contemplating about how deep to cut. iâ€™m living the life. 

school is shit. after failing again again to my family and peers high expectations isnâ€™t helping me either. my bad habits of obsession and the same schedule donâ€™t help me. they only thing going well for me right now is video games. because that is my life at the moment. i donâ€™t ever study and score high 80s and my family is mad at me because i donâ€™t fucking care about my grades. they know and i know i can better in school but i donâ€™t give two shits. they want me to get into good habits before high school but i feel so unmotivated to do anything. 

i donâ€™t want people to think i want attention because i really donâ€™t. i just want out of the hell that is my thoughts. iâ€™ve thought about telling others because of my social skills i think theyâ€™ll misjudge my intentions. i donâ€™t want to life but iâ€™m scared to die. iâ€™m scared of the endless uncontrollable subconscious. 

especially my family because theyâ€™re religious. oh fuck. 

i just have a lot of shit i wanted to get off my chest and rant about.
