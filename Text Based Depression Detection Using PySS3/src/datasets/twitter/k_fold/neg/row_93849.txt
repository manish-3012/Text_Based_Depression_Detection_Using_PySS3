Are there any benefits to admitting yourself to a hospital?I mean it doesn't seem like it helps at all. You're gonna be put in a psych ward and what not for a bit and then you're going to have a statement on your record saying that you're crazy so that eliminates some jobs for you. They give you pills to numb the pain but from a lot of people I've heard it only lets them tolerate life and slowly go on. That itself already sounds like a painful slow life of waiting to die.

Are there any other Cons that I've missed as well?
