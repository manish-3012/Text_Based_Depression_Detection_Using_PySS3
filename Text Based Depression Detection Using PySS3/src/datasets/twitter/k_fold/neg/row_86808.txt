This is not a cry or a warning. Yet?I have always thought about dying by my own hand just sometimes for no reason from a very young age. Its one reason why I don't own a gun, it just seems easy. 
Im not very happy with my life path, i feel that i have not ever bloomed as a person in work and maturity and i keeep getting angrier not yelling but pissed off at everything, and society as i get older. I dont like who i am. I am in my early 40's with two daughters married don't think there is a problem there either. 
Yet with the suicide of a bmx racer announced today got me thinking. He is early 40's married 2 daughters and has done things been successful and achieved an amount of celebrity and has actual skils, yet he didn't want to live anymore. 
Why am i here? I feel like my offering to existence is negligible, and i feel like i just make others sad by being angry. I dont like where i live, i dont like what we as humans do to the world and each other, and i feel like i am tired of seeing us as a whole get worse and i dont want to be a part of it. I don't feel like it is depression because its really the entirety of the society, economy created by humanity that indont want to a a part of and there is no other choice but out.

I'm not going to go kill myself but i have had the strongest feelings of not wanting to live that i have fealt in a while. At least it must have been enough for me to make a throwaway and express my feelings to strangers.
