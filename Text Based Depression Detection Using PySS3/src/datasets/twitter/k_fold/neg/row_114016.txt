Fuck this shitI'm sick of this fucking life. Can't fucking find a fucking company to hire me that actually has its own fucking shit together. Can't find a fucking job that's actually fucking DOABLE in a way that doesn't set up it's fucking employees to fail. 

Why the fuck should I keep waking up every day? I am so fucking sick of my literal survival and basic fucking life being completely held hostage by any shitty fucking job I can find just because I'm an incompetent piece of shit with no valuable skills. 

And then there's the actual fucking work, where I have to basically endure 8-11 hours of feeling like a complete and utter fucking idiot under the direct pressure of my employers to prove every fucking second that I'm not some fumbling idiot that can't do his job. Every fucking weekday. 

And then what? I have to keep on doing shit? Just to fucking survive? Just to keep going? There is no joy to be had in life. There is nothing that makes keeping my car maintained worth it. There is nothing about eating food that is worth it. Every fucking thing just has to be some kind of challenge. Do this. Do that. I don't want to fucking do any of this shit anymore. I just want to get high And then die in my fucking sleep.
