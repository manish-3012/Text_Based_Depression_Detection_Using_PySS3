Wrote some suicide notesI wrote some suicide notes last night to the important people in my life and the ones who i have fucked over. To my coaches, where i skipped most lessons bc i was stuck depressed in bed, basically wasting their time. To my brothers. To this teacher i once had, that helped me stay alive a bit longer without him even knowing he was helping me. I still have a few more suicide notes to write. Ik i wont kill myself right now bc idk how to, but if i ever do, i want my suicide notes ready.
