I'm not even sad, I'm just fed up.This all sounds like bullshit to me. It probably sounds like complete bullshit to anyone who reads this but I don't feel like trying anymore.

My family isn't rich, I'm not rich. I work hard, I'm good at my job. But I confront the fact that I'll never be rich, I'll never be at a point where I'm comfortable with my financial situation. I just don't feel like putting in the effort.

I hear things, I read things that reenforce that fact constantly. I just don't want to try. I'm tired of trying. I don't want to keep trying. I'm legitimately ready to just be done with it all. But I'm too much of a pussy to do anything.
