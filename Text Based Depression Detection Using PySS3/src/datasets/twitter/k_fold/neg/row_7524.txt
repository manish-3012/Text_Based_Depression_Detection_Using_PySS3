Iâ€™m so fucking tired and done with this shit.I canâ€™t make a decision that will be good for me in any way. I just keep screwing myself over because I have no other choice but to be unhappy. When I was younger I made decisions based on the idea that Iâ€™d be dead by 19. I keep purposely making life choices I want with the hopes that later itâ€™ll cause me enough problems so that it can act as motivation to actually kill myself. The plan is working and Iâ€™m starting to see the effects more and more every day.  
When I was younger at least I had the idea in my head that people would understand why I am the way I am but now I donâ€™t even have that. I just know what a burden I am both alive and dead. Itâ€™s been almost a decade and Iâ€™m only twenty. And itâ€™s going to be the same for the rest of my life. Iâ€™m tired of being a spoiled selfish little brat thatâ€™s going to squander every opportunity thatâ€™s going to come my way. I just want a fucking brain that isnâ€™t intent on destroying itself. I donâ€™t want to think anymore or wake up feeling the same numb apathetic feeling everyday. Itâ€™s either sad or stress or nothing. I just want to do it. Itâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™ve wanted for a long time now. Itâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™m allowed to want. I fucking hate it here and itâ€™s never going to change. I even fantasize about being brave enough to kill myself and it acts as a sort of solace.

God I wish I could talk about this with my counselor without getting the cops called on me.
