What are we holding onto Sam?I lost the love of my life.  I went to college for a crap degree and now have $82,000 debt.  I have a terrible job that pays next to nothing.  I live with my parents.  I also have no real friends and I haven't dated in years.  Women laugh at me...

I've tried to get another job.  I've tried dating.  I've done everything in my power to fix things.

My life revolves around working my awful job to pay my loans.  Taking shit from my parents, and being a joke to my family.  They literally make fun of me to my face for having a useless degree and so much debt.

I am tired of working for absolutely no reason other than to pay off my student loans...  I know lots of people have student loan debt, but I was lied to by my parents.  They said they'd pitch in.  Now they laugh at my debt.  FUCK THEM!!!!!!!!!

Yes, I tried to do some programs that would allow me to get a better job, they always turn me down though.  Teach for America is one that I thought I'd definitely get.  Nope.  I have to do customer service for $8.82/hr.  FML.

Does anyone have some advice before I go through with this?  I'm not a dick.  I wont do it during the holidays.  I just realized tonight that it has to happen though.  My situation has been awful for years.
