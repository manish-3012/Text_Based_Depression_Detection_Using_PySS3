This is not just in my head anymore. It's real.I have been abandoned by the father of my children three months ago. So have my children. Their father just left and won't come back, won't be in touch. He has been ghosting me which adds to the feeling of not being worthy of anything.


I thought I had found an angel along my way. A very precious man who was being a good friend and somewhat acted towards me like a lover (but he just didn't want to commit to a relationship). His presence in my life was helping me getting up in the morning, helped me so much, and find motivation to go on.
Now he's quickly detached himself and stopped being in touch as well, without me doing anything.

I think I keep having confirmations over and over that I am not only not worth of love. But not worth of any sort of consideration, care or attention. Sometimes even a few words of closure would help, but I can't even get those. I feel like a pile of garbage. And I won't contact him and ask why he's no longer in touch, trying to do that with my ex has drained me and left me scarred, and I'm afraid I'll only feel worse. 

My heart is so broken I can't go on. I have my children, I know. And I don't feel like I am being a good parent to them because all these things are taking my energy, my mood. I just want to lie in bed all day, but I have to look after my two children. There's the guilt on top of it too. I really don't know how to go on. 

I just wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. I guess I had to get these things off my chest. I have not a single friend to talk to. I wrote one faraway friend today, she was online but didn't even open my message. I'm just a drag to anybody. And I never speak about my problems, it's not as if they want to avoid that. I always try to be friendly and hide whatever I'm going through. It's just that it makes no difference to people if I exist or not. I am unworthy.
