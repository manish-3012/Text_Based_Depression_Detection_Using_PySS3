Why should I feel bad for wanting to die? Why is it bad to be selfish?I feel like I lived my life trying to make everyone happy. Iâ€™m constantly told what to do( how to act, who to hang out with, what to do with my career, forced to be happy, etc.) I donâ€™t even feel like I have a voice to my body, life, and choices. When I tell people Iâ€™m sad they just brush it aside. They tell me they care but just go right back at telling me what to do. People in my life just love telling me what to do but when I express my sadness they want nothing to do with me. Itâ€™s like they want me to be happy for their benefit but not mine. I feel like suicide would be me claiming my body back and doing what I want. To not be alive. Itâ€™s selfish but whatâ€™s wrong with it? I lived a selfless life and it did nothing for me. Why canâ€™t I just be selfish this one time. I feel like I deserve that.
