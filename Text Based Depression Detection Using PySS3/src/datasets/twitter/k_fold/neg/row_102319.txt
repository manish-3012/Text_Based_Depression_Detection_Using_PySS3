Military Spouse. Need advice urgently.My husband and I have been having a lot of marital problems. We got in a huge argument over skype and I have finally said that I am sending him the papers. Now he has threatened suicide. Who do I call? I may not feel the same way about him anymore but that does not mean I want him to die or to hurt himself in any way.
