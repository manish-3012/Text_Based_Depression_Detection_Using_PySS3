It's all going downhill againI thought my mental health was improving but I couldn't have been more wrong.
I started taking antidepressants in May, they were helping until this past week

Now I constantly just want to be dead. 
I've started worrying my friends because of how often I talk about dying/killing myself.

fast forward to today, I've not been paid by a client for the work I did for them, I'm broker than broke and I have exactly one antidepressant left.

So honestly, I'd expect this to be my last post. 

I dont think I can go on anymore. I don't even have the energy to try to fight it anymore.

you win brain, I'm done.
