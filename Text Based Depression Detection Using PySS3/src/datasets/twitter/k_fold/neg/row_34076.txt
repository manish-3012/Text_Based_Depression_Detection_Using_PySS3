I don't hate life but I hate myselfI'm 18 and a few weeks ago I got blackout drunk at a club and according to my friend I was being a creep and grinding on random girls from behind with some pushing me away and some grinding back. I couldn't remember any of this but I do remember a few months ago when I approached a girl from behind and moved my hands from her hip, to her waist and then her butt. I got no reaction from her so I thought this was ok but when I got sober I realised she may not have wanted this.

However I'm not like this most times I go out and I really don't want to act like a creep or a sexual predator. However I'm disgusted with myself for the times I have. I wonder what people would think of me if they knew. I don't approach girls I like at college because I don't feel they don't deserve a creep like me and they wouldn't like me if they knew what id done. I really hate myself because of it. I feel like I've ruined my self-worth completely and can never get it back

For the first time in a while I wish I was dead however I could never do it myself because I'm way too much of a pussy and I would hurt a lot of people. I'm just tired of hating myself and I can't change the past so I'm not sure how I'm meant to not hate myself. I enjoy life and living but I truly hate myself. I'm going to drink less in the future and not make the same mistakes but I can't undo the past and continue to hate myself for it.
