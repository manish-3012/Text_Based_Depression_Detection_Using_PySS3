Try to Remember, Forget...So guys, it is my birthday, it is a new year. I should be happy that I am still here. Light up a new joint, put on an old shirt; try to remember, forget how my brain works. But I could read a book a night before this year, I knew every word their definitions clear. But now in stealth I check the thesaurus - it's become my guilty mistress. So I heave my breath at burning wax because I know that spark ain't coming back. I've got all my friends here but they haven't been talking as of lately because they've all found new bro's and babies. I have smoked away my pride, there is nothing but the cinders of it inside. But I believed in more than nothingness last year and under every quiet failure it's still here. Buried breathing under 18 years of tragedy and fear. If I could crawl my way out of this grave just think of all the time I'd save. The stereo's playing the same old songs but we still hum along.
In no time we'll be spread across the earth, donning business suits to show the faceless master what we're worth. From our huggies to armani, and it all seems so rehearsed. Anyone else agree?
