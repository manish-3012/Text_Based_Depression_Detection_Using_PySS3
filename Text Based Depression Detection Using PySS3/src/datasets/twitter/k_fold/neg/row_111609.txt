My Suicide AnniversaryI never planned to 17 years old. I was gonna die 16 with a lot of wasted potential, good grades and a life filled with nothing, that would leave nothing and would mean nothing. I was gonna overdose on pills and die while my family was out, I stayed home as I always do.

I wouldn't say I have been depressed as other people describe it. Most people can't get out of bed and feel no drive to do anything. I just kinda lost my will to live, I could get out of bed and waste an entire day without knowing it before it was too late. Staying in bed all day sounds nice to me, yet it always felt wrong.

I'm still kinda down sometimes. I would say I am probably worse off emotionally now than I was back then due to life progressing faster than I can keep up. I'm nowhere near another attempt and my suicidal thoughts are starting to slowly disappear. But there will always be that moment of the day, where I look out the window.

Imagining myself jumping off a building.
It brings a smile to my face.
Entertain the thought, don't act on it.
Some poor janitor is gonna clean that up.

Guess I'll run away or move out or do something where I get away from my current life. Time will tell I guess.

Happy Anniversary me, you lived bitch.
