Why go further?I can't break away from the idea of ending it all. I'm currently not working , my girlfriend left me bc she wasn't happy and my family has always thought very low of me. I have nothing going for me and I can't really name a whole lot of people who would care if I where gone idk I feel stuck i know I should end it but I'm scared to die but at the same time there isn't anything here for me I'm just floating around maybe I'll convince myself to end it it's the best option for me and I'm ready to go I just hope the other side is somewhat better
