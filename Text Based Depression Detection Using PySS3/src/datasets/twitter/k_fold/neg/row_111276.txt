It all appears greyThe world is kind of a grey place now. I feel numb to it all like I've already died inside. I don't know if this moves me closer to suicide or not but I feel completely disconnected from this life. I'm sitting in my office contemplating why I bother to do this anymore other than it being part of the expected routine, just playing my part in the circus we know as every day life. I feel selfish for my feelings because I don't think my current life is horrible but I can't seem to rid myself of the demons that come with growing up abused and misunderstood. I hate people because I feel they've always hated me but I also sympathize with them because I hate myself too so I understand their disdain for me. I'm tired in a way I didn't think was possible, a fatigue that sleep can't cure. I'm tired of having this internal conversation and feeling like it's just part of the process. I feel like the voices in my head sound like they're tired of the same old song and dance, maybe everything just needs to stop.
