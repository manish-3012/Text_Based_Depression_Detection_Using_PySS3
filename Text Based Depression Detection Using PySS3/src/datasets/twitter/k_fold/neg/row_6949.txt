I think I'm calling it quitsI can't get better no matter how hard I try. I thought things were going better with my ex wife. I thought we were getting back together. It's been months of us hanging out almost daily and having a lot of fun. But now she's officially with someone else. I'm barely succeeding in college, trying to finally pursue my dream, and it's so hard.  My anxiety basically prevents me from going outside of my apartment unless I'm with her. Now I have a new deadend job at a day food restaurant that starts tomorrow. I need the job because the disability insurance I get for my depression, anxiety, and ptsd is barely enough to live off of, so I need some supplemental cash. But because of the anxiety and stress over having to go to work tomorrow, I can't sleep. So I'm stressing and smoking about that. It bothers me so much that the only time I was ever successful at anything was while in the military. Literally blowing people up. I'm an absolute piece of unlovable garbage and I've wanted to kill myself since as far back as I can remember. 

I've decided. I'm leaving it in the hands of the American people. 
4 more years of Trump and our terrifying descent into fascism is, honestly, the least of my concerns, but I've decided to make it my ultimatum. If Trump wins, I'm killing myself. 
If anybody can think of a good way that could double as a "heroic" or revolutionary death, I'm all ears
