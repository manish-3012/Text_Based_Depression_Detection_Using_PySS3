Rough story from this weekend.Last night, I had a bit too much to drink and ended up kinda spoiling my friends' night. It came out of me that I wanted to kill myself. One of my friends sat with me and talked to me. I opened up about feeling like nobody in my life really cares about me and like I'm the odd one out in every place I go. He said he cared about me, and wanted to get me to bed but he'd check up on me in the morning. I told him that I've gone through similar things before and know how'd it go, people just displace me and I become a burden to them. He told me that's not how it'd be. Today I woke up to a lot of shit and negativity from friends. I tried talking to him again and he ignored my messages the entire day. It turns out, he just again validated my fear and trauma of being cast aside by people I open up to. I am indescribably hurt by this feeling getting cemented. This has really made me feel compelled to kill myself tomorrow because I again feel like I have no one. Please someone help me feel better about this.
