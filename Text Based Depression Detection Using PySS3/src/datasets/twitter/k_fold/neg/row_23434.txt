I don't think I can hold on for longer.I feel horrible. My head hurts, my heart feels heavy, it's a little hard to breathe. I can't think or focus at all, everything is foggy. It's like my head is full of invisible thoughts. I feel so lonely, so alone. It feels like there is noone for me. There used to, but I can't depend on them any longer. They really have enough on their shoulders. It hurts to not receive the things I gave. They keep asking me what do I need and what do I want, but it's so obvious. I want you to talk to me, even if you don't feel like it, because that's what I did. I literally told you. It's like noone understands me. I feel misunderstood and disrespected. Noone bothers to message me and ask how I'm feeling, they even said they knew that I feel like crap. It hurts, now they're just ignoring me. I didn't even get mad or addressed the issue. 

My emotions feel like driving up a frozen hill while using summer tires. My actual health is sinking down like an old, broken ship. Grades are terrible too. Funny how I used to be the top student. I've never been to the beach, I've never been to another country, I didn't even visit the capital of my country. I didn't achieve much and I didn't inspire anyone to live or start something truly awesome. That's okay. Lived long enough, my emotions are finally letting me die. No more sudden fake overconfidence, no more happiness when I never was happy, no more extroverted feelings that feel truly fake. Here are a few things I want to address:

- Mother, I never hated you. I always loved you, I just really hate your actions towards me. I'm sorry I'm this way, I never asked to be asexual, dumb, a burden. I'm sorry I tore your dreams apart like a hungry wolf searching for food. I'm sorry I could never be someone to be proud of.

- My friend, I really enjoyed playing minecraft together. I hope you like the cathedral I built for you and your friends. We both wanted to see the 1.17 update with axolotls and stuff, but I don't think it will happen. Your maymays were really cool too, keep going.

- My other friend, I'm really glad I had you in my life. I'll never forget our philosophical and political discussions. Even though our opinions were very different, we still respected eachother. P.S you're trash as an assassin, go back to support

- My beloved, you're my sunshine and my snow, you're my lungs below below, you're my diamonds and my crown, I would never let you drown. I didn't keep the promise, I made your life harder. Should have stopped whining. You would never judge my emotions, but you did judge me and it hurt a little, but its fine. Really. I wish you the best, find someone better. Someone who's pretty, smart, healthy, selfless, kind, warm, empathetic. You made my life easier, I found out what happiness is. It's being calm and peaceful, not extroverted, loud, uncontrollable. I'm glad I had you in my life, I really do. We really are polar opposites.

- To one of my classmates, I never knew you feel the same way I do. Hard, isn't it. Hard to hide your feelings, hard to stay awake at night, hard to have these uncontrollable confidence/happiness episodes.

Sorry to let everyone down, I shall not do it anymore.
