I'm not made for this worldThis social world where interactions and social norms/expectations determine how well you do.  

I'm a quiet guy that doesn't get out much.  It doesn't help that I can't drink due to a pretty severe reaction that leaves me feeling like I'm dying.  

I don't know how to be outgoing and just strike up a conversation with a woman.  I'm 23 and out of college where I only managed to get one date my entire college career.  I don't know how things are going to go now that I'll be starting a real full time job now.  Where I'd meet even less women and those that I do I shouldn't date because of the whole co-worker thing. 

I feel like I have the passive personality that only works for women.  If I were a woman I feel like I would have been in a much better situation.  I am very bad at going out and expressing interest first and pushing it until I get a reaction.  

Okcupid and tinder both suck, neither have worked out for me.  The few women that I get dates with lose interest quickly.  Hell the woman I was talking to for the past 3 months on and off spent the summer going on trips abroad and even went on a 2 week vacation with her ex and his family.  She claims she's bad at texting and doesn't respond very well.  But I feel that if you're interested in someone you'll make the effort to respond.  

I don't know.  I just feel like I'm so bad at dating and "putting myself out there" that I'm going to live the rest of my life alone.  However long that is before I figure out I'm done with this alone bullshit.
