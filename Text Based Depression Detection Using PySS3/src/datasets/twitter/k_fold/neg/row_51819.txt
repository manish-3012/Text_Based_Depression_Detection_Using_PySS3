Help16. Sometimes suicidal but sometimes just wouldnâ€™t mind dying and sometimes fine. Might be asexual but want my own kids so I donâ€™t see the point. Will always be lonely. Think that I will never be in a relationship. All started when I was around 9 and wanted to die and felt worthless. Yes, have been feeling like this since I was 9 also with extreme anxiety about shit that started from my maths teacher when I was 9 stressing that this was the biggest test of my life for weeks (wasnâ€™t at all in reality). I literally cried myself to sleep as a child because of depression and anxiety. Help
