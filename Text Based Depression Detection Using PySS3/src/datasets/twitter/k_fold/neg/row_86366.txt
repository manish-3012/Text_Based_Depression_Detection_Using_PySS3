Three months off of my SSRI medication. Nervous breakdown with no friends to help me.My girlfriend is drinking at a party, my best friends are asleep.

I'm crying my eyes out, and it's fucking pathetic how much I just want to have somebody here to give me a little bit of affection.

Never asked for help before, but I feel fucking rejected that she won't come help me. She told me it wasn't a party, but as soon as I asked for help she told me that she'd been drinking and that I should call a different friend.

Fuck everything about tonight.

I'm honestly just too embarrassed to call a suicide hotline, or call anyone else. I thought I was done with suicidal thoughts and depression - I never knew that it would come back like this.

I'm so overwhelmed with negative emotions. Hate and jealousy and anger and self-loathing and fuck-everything-in-this-entire-planet. I don't know what do do, guys. How do I deal with an emotional breakdown?

I think I'm losing it.
