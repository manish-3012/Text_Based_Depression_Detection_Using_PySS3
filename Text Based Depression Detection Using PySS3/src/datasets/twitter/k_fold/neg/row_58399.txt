Life is an endless cycle of painLife is a cycle of pain. The cycle goes: traumatizing event, learning to cope and trying to heal from the event, period of calm, maybe one good fulfilling day, and then a traumatizing event again. This goes on for ever. I canâ€™t do it. I fucking canâ€™t. Those minuscule moments of happiness donâ€™t mean fucking shit to be compared to the traumatizing moments. I donâ€™t want to keep going.
