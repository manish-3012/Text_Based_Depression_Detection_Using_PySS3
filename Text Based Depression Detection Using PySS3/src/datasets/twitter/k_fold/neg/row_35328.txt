Making plans, because I don't want to live like this.I've been ill for the last two years with an ongoing blood disorder, which has really made my life considerably more difficult - I still work, but it's all I can do to keep it up (despite my business making amazing accommodations for my situation). It'll kill me eventually, but slowly.

The last eight weeks things have gotten considerably more difficult, and I feel like I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going. If this is my life now, and for the long-term, I don't think I want it.

The thing is - I've been diagnosed with bipolar (prior to getting sick - physically, I mean) and I'm really struggling to work out whether this is really as bad as it seems, or whether I'm depressed and that's leading me here.

I'm not immediately about to end my life, but I'm self-harming more than ever (cutting is considerably easier when people get used to seeing you with bandages and surgical patches) and I'm starting to... Make plans.

I don't have anyone else to talk to about it because I know they'd tell me "you're a fighter," and that kind of thing - which I just don't want to hear, because there's only so long you can fight for.

So here I am... Any advice would be very much appreciated.
