It doesnt make senseIm 14 years old and have been thinking on and off about suicide for the past couple of years. At first I didnt even realize I was suicidal. At 12 I used to imagine what would happen if I died. What would my parents do. I decided that eventually everyone I knew would move on, and eventually die themselves. Now I am thinking of acting on that. Just thinj about it. Life doesnt make sense. Why did humans evolve. Why did we choose to destroy nature and wrongle it around to make housing. Why do we coom our food. None of it makes sense. It makes no sense to continue blindly with something that makes no sense. Social interactions make no sense. Why should it matter whether or not someone looks a certain way or acts a certain way. I know if I just power through high school I should be ok but I dont know if I am strong enough. Even if I do manage to escape high school the cycle just continues. As a upper middle class white boy my life will go 1 of 3 ways and I already know this.
1. I go to an average college work and average 6 figure job and get a wife, settle down and maybe have kids, die at 80 something. All the while I wonder what more I couldve been.
2. I drop out of school and do wahtever dropouts do until I finally realize again how fleeting life is and end it all
3. I end it with a note to my parents apologizing later tonight and finally accept that none of these fates are good, even the first one because in the end we all die, no matter what you do in life, how many people you impact.
Also I want to belive that it is about the journey, not the destination like ive read so many times on this subreddit but it just doesnt make sense to me, all the journey you take will be forgotten, along with the journeys of all the others youve inpacted and all the ones theyve inpacted until the sun finally takes pity on humans and expands to engulf our pathetic, puny society that we built
