What to say to a friend who tried ending her lifeNot really sure if this is the right place to ask, but I couldn't find a better sub for this kind of question. My best friend has been considering suicide for a while and because of many reasons today was the day she snapped. I've been learning how to talk about depression and whatnot, even read some books on the matter, but this time I really have no idea on how to face her. Should I even say anything besides showing support and comprehension like usual?
