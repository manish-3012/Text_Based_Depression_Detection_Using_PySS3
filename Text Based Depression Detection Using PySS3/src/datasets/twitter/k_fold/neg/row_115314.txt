Does it ever get better? I'm serious.Ever since my earliest teens I've been suicidal and I've been depressed long before I even knew what depression was. I remember being around 10 maybe, sitting in my room and thinking about how just flat out sad my life is. And nothing has changed since.

Is life worth the effort put into sustaining it? Especially when your mind refuses to cooperate? Seriously, I can't even think straight at this point. The only thing that eases the situation is being asleep.

To all you people of r/SucideWatch that have gone through it, how did you do it? Judging from my experience it's nearly impossible. It's like trying to play the guitar with a single hand.
