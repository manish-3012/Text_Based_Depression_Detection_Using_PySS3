I honestly have no idea what to do anymoreI've had depression for years, and I think this month might be the month where I finally off myself. I've been running on fumes ever since I went off to college. I hate it there, it's a tiny liberal arts college that just feels like high school because everyone just sits in their dorm, there's never anything to do, and the surrounding area is so run down that you can't leave campus. I can't transfer because of financial reasons. I haven't met anyone there that I really like, and I haven't hooked up with a single fucking person since I got there. I'm a 19 year old virgin, which is reason enough to kill myself on its own. The worst part is that I'm above average in attractiveness, and not socially awkward, so I just can't understand why. I always ask my friends from home, and none of them can come up with why. I have zero energy or confidence left to put myself out there, so I can't improve myself in any way, and even back when I did have energy left I'd get nothing out of putting myself out there, joining clubs and going to parties got me nowhere. I feel like I've just run out of whatever happiness/energy that people need to keep going, and there's nothing for me to do but blow my head off before winter break is up and I have to go back.
