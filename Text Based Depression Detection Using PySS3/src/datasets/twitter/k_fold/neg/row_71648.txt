ugh...i have recently like, lost my emotions just a couple of weeks ago, but i have regained it and now i'm fucking sad again. i used to be neither sad, nor happy and just like at peace or something. now all can think of is how alone and unloved i am and how no one actually cares about me.

&amp;#x200B;

i should just kill myself, maybe hang myself or jump infront of a train, who knows. not like anyone would give a fuck or realize i was even gone.
