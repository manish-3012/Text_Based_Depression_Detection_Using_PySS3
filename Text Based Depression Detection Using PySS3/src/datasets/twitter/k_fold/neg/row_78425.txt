Iâ€™m done with my life and I plan on hanging myself in my basement once everyone is asleepI always was bullied for my learning disabilities, my grades and it basically ruined me for as long as I can remember and especially how my teachers and mom told me I needed new friends and they werenâ€™t really my friends, which I think started my trust issues but I guess they were right. When high school rolled around they ditched me, but I was more or less my moms fault for posting about them on Facebook. 

Then I was forced to get a job I didnâ€™t want which affected my mental health and school work and fucked up my anxiety. I was told I would be working in the back not with customers because of my anxiety. Which was fine with the manager but I was always put on store front and it sucked, I wanted to quit but my mom said sheâ€™d hate me if I did.

Then it started with mom saying I made her hate her life, and then I caused my dads diabetes and that theyâ€™re marriage is failing because of me, my two older sibling didnâ€™t help when I tried to talk to them about it.  This shit hurt the absolute worse. All because I didnâ€™t have a job but I was afraid to get one because of my last job.

I had a break down one day and my dad tried to punch me in the face.

Then my girlfriend got pregnant and I was happy for awhile but she miscarried, and my work forced me to go in the next day. No one cared and no was supportive at my house and I wish I had the kid because maybe Iâ€™d be happy. 

No to short after I got a puppy, heâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m living and I love him more than anyone and anything.  One day he got into an unmade couch that was left on the ground. My sisters were in the process of moving out but I didnâ€™t actually know what it was and he tore up some off the stitching. Luckily it wasnâ€™t the part of the couch youâ€™d see. Anyways my sister got mad and demanded if something happened like that Iâ€™d owe 500 bucks. I told her thatâ€™s ridiculous and it was mistake from my dog and you should have told me or something what that was anyways.  And if it was so important itâ€™s not my job to look out for it. Donâ€™t just leave it on the ground and donâ€™t care. 

We got into a screaming match, she called me names and blamed me for things. I was done with the argument and went upstairs my sister followed me into my room even though I closed the door and continued to hit me three times. I was broken inside I left the argument and yet she wouldnâ€™t stop.  She then proceeded to cry about how shitty I am while my other sister comforted her outside my room right in front of me, one the words my sister said was I hate you and I hope you die.  Our relationship is better but I donâ€™t really feel comfortable being around either of them and I donâ€™t think I can ever truly forgive my sisters or my parents. 

Then my ex has been doing this thing where we say weâ€™ll work things out and Iâ€™ll stay at her place for week and then when I leave sheâ€™ll find something I did wrong and leave. It makes me depressed and sad for weeks and no matter what I do or say she doesnâ€™t care.

I donâ€™t feel like being alive anymore, Iâ€™m my short 20 years of life I feel so shitty all the time about the stuff Iâ€™ve done and how my anxiety has ruined any from of relationships Iâ€™ve ever had. 

I actually plan on hanging myself later tonight, Iâ€™m not expecting anyone to read this or respond because itâ€™s kind of long but I just canâ€™t do this anymore. 

Stay safe guys
