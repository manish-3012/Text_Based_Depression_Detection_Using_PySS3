How to help someone who shuts themselves off?Hello, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place. 

My friend is at work, and he received scary texts from his girlfriend threatening suicide. 
We're trying to talk to her (with a lot of help from the resources on this sub, ty!!) but she texted "Bye." And won't reply anymore.

I'm out of town and I feel pretty helpless about it. I have a lot of faith and hope that nothing will happen but it's mostly to keep myself calm in this situation.

Does anyone here have any advice? Especially if you've been in the girlfriend's shoes? How can I help?
