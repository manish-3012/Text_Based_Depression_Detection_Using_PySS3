The thoughts are growing louder.So, I've been looking around on DNM for a way to buy a euthanasia kit. I just wan to kill myself so bad. It's everywhere, when I'm awake, when I'm asleep. It's in my fucking dream's.  My life isn't totally shit, I mean there are good things. I live in a first world country i mean and it's not like i live in a village that been shot up for a genocide. But, It's just that I'm dealing with a lot. Ive failed second time of first year and i have zero motivation to do anything. Ive have still to yet to conquer my depression, I locked myself in my room for most of my day's this year,  I have no family as i grew up in a foster family Ive literally been living alone on my own for two year and I can't stand the discomfort (god I sound like a pussy for saying that). I have no friends. I just want to die and have permission. there is no reason for me to live or suffer in this mental pain. WHY CAN"t i just go. I want to achieve great heights but i don't believe i can. Im going to find a way to die by the time I'm 21 and by that time I know my time for comfort will have run out and my depression can only grow worse. Life goes on, people will move on, I am truly nothing and there isn't anything worthwhile in this to salvage. I know I'm posting on suicide watch and of course you think this mean i want attention. but what i really want is answer's and a acceptance  that one day my fate will come and something will be left. a trail maybe. idk I just want my brain to shut down without pain.
