Second attempt, and this time im going through with iti have tried a thousand things to make myself happy. i have an exciting life and am very active but at the end of the day i just lay my head down thinking 'what is the point?' I have yet to find the answer and it is wearing my life away. So here it goes. 

Edit: Thank you everyone. You are all very wonderful people. I am making sure to put as much thought into this as i can before i make a 'mistake'. I am going to be up for a while and continue posting until i make a decision and i will let you all know.

Edit #2: I am going to go out longboarding for an hour or so. it usually calms me down and may help me sort my thoughts out. Ill be back before too long hopefully.

Edit #3: I have decided against the easy way out. thank you guys so much. a great deal of what you have said gave me a more positive outlook. i talked to a close friend as well which helped a great deal. there were a couple posts giving me advice on how to to it correctly which i reported. for everyone who had positive advice you have been given real life karma for saving my life. thank you so much. live long and prosper.
