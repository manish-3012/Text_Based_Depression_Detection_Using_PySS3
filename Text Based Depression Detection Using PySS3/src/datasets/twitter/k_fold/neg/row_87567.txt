Almost time.I'm just trying to hold on, and hang in there. I just don't see much reason to though. My best friend, isn't even really my friend anymore I don't think. She at least doesn't even want to talk to me anymore it seems. I don't even know what happened. The only friend who still talks to me is one who I've never even seen in person. My nephew's birthday is this weekend. After that, I'm sorry. I've been selfless for long enough. My entire life I've always done everything that I could to make others happy, never caring about myself. Well it's my turn to make myself happy. For that, I'm sorry.
