i hate being lonely no girl seems at all interested in me. sometimes it really hurts, just a bit too much. im just tired of being single and alone, nothing i seem to do really matters. seeing all my friends in relationships seems to hurt even more. whats the point of living if you cant even find someone to share it with.
