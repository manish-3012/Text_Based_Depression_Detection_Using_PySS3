I'm just a fucking failureEveryone leaves me, they always have. Either they leave themselves, or someone else makes them. Everybody can see I'm just the worst possible fucking thing to ever live. I hate myself to much I literally cannot express it. No amount of words or actions will ever come close to how much I hate myself. I need to die. It would generally improve the life of everybody around me. And I guess anyone else I'm inconveniencing by taking oxygen. I'd write a letter asking my organs to be donated but they'd probably kill someone. For all I know my heart is black and fucking dead. I try to be kind and people just fucking kick me off the ledge, I lose my grip, and I spiral down being mentally unstable. I'm not worth anything. I'm just a fucking peice of shit. I would shoot myself but I think if I live long enough, someone else will do it for me.
