I regret not ending it when I wanted to6 years ago I was at my absolute worse and stopped myself at the last second from committing suicide. Objectively I know my life has gotten better, I am undergoing treatment for my CPTSD and am safe and in a stable position. But looking back all I can do is regret not going through with it. I don't feel like any of this has been worth it. I have put so much effort in and worked so hard just so I can function at a base level. If I knew what this would have been like back then I would not have stopped myself. 

I just feel like an awful person because I should be happy that I am here and alive but I am not. What I have to look forward to now is an indefinite struggle mentally as well as permanent physical injuries from my childhood that cause me excruciating pain. There are only so many times I can complain about this before friends get sick of hearing about it. I am 24 and can barely walk for an hour before the pain catches up to me. Again, how is this better?
