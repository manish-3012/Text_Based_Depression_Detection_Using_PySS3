Iâ€™m convinced the cure to suicidal thoughts is to put that energy into constant self-expansionSuicide is the ultimate denial of the self, to cut yourself short abruptly and completely. Killing yourself is saying to the universe that you have gone as far as you can possibly go into the unknown, and all that is yours ought to be cut short in this moment. 

As Camus said, we always have the choice between suicide and getting a cup of coffee. There was a meme on Reddit (or Deadit) here about constantly choosing between suicide and success. 

We have energy within us that needs to get expressed. Itâ€™s Nietzscheâ€™s Will to Power, and at every juncture we have to express ourselves somehow. So why not funnel that energy that wants to blow your brains in into expanding the self further outwards? 

The ways to do this are near limitless, but are expressed best in saying â€˜yesâ€™ to connecting with other people. Read a book, dive deep into a topic, pick up an instrument, try drawing, learn a joke, go for a jog, watch a movie, flirt with someone, try harder at a job...

Iâ€™m convinced that all human existence is just a realm for action and doing, and that to really live means aiming for success and mastery through your actions.
