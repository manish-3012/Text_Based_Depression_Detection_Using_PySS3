I will leave my shitting life once my troublemaking girlfriend go back to RussiaI am tired of my life and have no reason or purpose to carry on. I want to die from overdoes or COVID-19 or whatever! However I canâ€™t leave the world while the troublemaking girlfriend of mine stuck with my parents. I donâ€™t want to selfish and unfair for leave out of the blue on them. All I can do is waiting for the date for stupid court then go back to Russia as she supposed to go back 2 fucking years ago. What she did is cyber stalking and harm on someone (I dunno who but I donâ€™t care) she claimed to make friend with. I told her a hundred of times to accept that this lady doesnâ€™t want to be her friend and move on but my advise is as if it go in her ear and out of other ear! She went to the ladyâ€™s place unannounced and pound on the front door like a maniac ! She get herself arrested for that! What the fuck keep CPS from make a decision whether she have to go court or not! 

She is the one that destroyed my pride and drive me depressed a big time due to being forced to hand her the money after her credit card has been expired! She caused other troubles with my friends and lose 3 people of my life over her! Lastly, I am tired of listen to her whinnying about lockdown etc! 

I donâ€™t want to do anything with her anymore. Sheâ€™s stay in our guest room for a while. My parents are way too nice to herâ€” means they donâ€™t have a gut to throw her out of the house. I means she donâ€™t have a place to go. We have to keep treat her as a guest until she retrieve her passport (oh yeah home office took it when she arrestedâ€” thatâ€™s why she canâ€™t leave UK until then)

I canâ€™t wait to leave this cruel world as soon as she return to Russia. I have no purpose to carry on after that. I have no child. No marriage. No place of my own. I doubt woman would like to date a skinny guy with autism crap! I need to leave so badly. I donâ€™t care if Iâ€™d go to hell for things Iâ€™ve done as a teenager and reborn as a cat or bug!

Sorry for my shitty Englishâ€” Iâ€™m learning disability.
