Does suicide ever feel inevitable?Sometimes it feels like it was just meant for me to go this way. I havenâ€™t thought about it in two months now but suddenly itâ€™s keeping me up at night again. I canâ€™t sleep anymore. 
I started sertraline 50MG about 8 weeks ago and it helped initially. What is happening? Is it not working anymore? Having trouble keeping thoughts at bay
