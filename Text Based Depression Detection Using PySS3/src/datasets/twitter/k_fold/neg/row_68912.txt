Help is not availableMy therapist misses our appointments or is late.

I can't eat or sleep, but I have to wait a month and a half to see a psychiatrist because my insurance only covers a single provider.

Fuck, why tell people there's help when there isn't? I've been suffering for a decade hoping what normies say is true with regards to help being there. But it isn't, they just say that because they're uncomfortable and don't know what else to say.

Fuck it.
