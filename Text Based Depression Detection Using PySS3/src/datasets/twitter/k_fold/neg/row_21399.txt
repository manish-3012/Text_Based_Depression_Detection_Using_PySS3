I'm not going to do anything, but it would be so much easier if it were just over...Recently came out as transgender to my family, everyone seemed to take it ok, and that's it, just ok... A few days ago my dad told me that he'd try and be supportive and be as loving as he could be regardless of what I do, but he didn't know how much that would be. That's not something you want to fucking hear from your father. It feels like that unconditional love you're supposed to have from your parents doesn't quite apply anymore... I felt like I was making a lot of progress in this area and that almost completely shattered me. I don't speak to my mom much, so she's not so much in the loop. 

My girlfriend of two years broke up with me in July, partially because of my transgender feelings in addition to long distance and just general stress between us. I loved her and I still love her and I can't ever stop thinking about her or worrying about her... She's the only person who I've ever loved romantically and I am fucking devastated. We've been talking again after a few months of the silent treatment, but we can't be together, it'll only end in heartbreak again and that just tears me apart. I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months and was on antidepressants for a while, but now my refills have run out and the pharmacy has been waiting for over a week for approval to give me another... 

I have no right to be depressed like I am or have been, I haven't had a hard life, but I DON'T feel like my life is right. I just wish I was normal, I wish that all of this extra stress would just go away, I just want to go to school and live a normal fucking life. I wish that the people I cared about most in my life didn't have a problem with the genuine me... I'm only 21, but I'm ready for it to be over. I already feel this bad about life, I have trouble seeing how it will get better, so it doesn't seem worth it to stick around for 50 more years of heartache and hiding from myself...
