GoodbyeItâ€™s been a struggling few weeks since my girlfriend died, in that time I have cut, screamed, cried and starved myself. All while wrought with guilt and pain.

I have made my mind, I want to be with her again.

Iâ€™ll order in our favourite sushi, from the place down the street we love, have a warm, soapy bath, and end it all there, in the warmth of the tub.

I have left a note for my terrible family and one for my few friends. Along with an email I have set to go out tomorrow morning informing someone I trust of my passing, and where to find me. 

Unless something major happens, that email is getting sent, and I will be with Kat once more, forever. 

Baby, Iâ€™ll be with you soon, just 10 hours away. 

I love you.
