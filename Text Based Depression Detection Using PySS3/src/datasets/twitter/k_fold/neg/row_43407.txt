How can I get out of this cycle?I am drowning in suicidal thoughts. I try my best to carry on each day but I canâ€™t ignore the searing pain that I feel. I have shame for being so defective- no matter what I do, I come back to these desires of ending myself because I feel I am nobody. Am I lying to myself for moments where I think things are getting better? I try to maintain such a positive outlook and treat others with kindness, but it feels as though my efforts are ignored and never appreciated. I know I shouldnâ€™t expect my acts of kindness to be reciprocated, but I worry that Karma will never find me. I am trying my best to implement meaning with my existence, and to offer something to the world by being a good person. Why doesnâ€™t that fulfill me?
