Final exams pressure, and problems from mom.I have been peeling away at my skin (metaphorically) ever since i joined the IB. I worked so hard for the MOCKs and got terrible results. My mom says that i have to get a degree from a university no matter what, or else she will do something. I don't know what that something is, but it's probably something i am very scared of.

I really don't give a crap what kind of job i work as long as i get some money, but the amount of pressure i get from my mom is killing me. My dad is person i love the most in the world but he's very busy yso we don't spend a lot of time together.
everytime i come home at 6 or 7 afternoon, the first thing she asks me is:
- What have you studied today?
-How much have you studied?
-What is your plan?
-Show me your notes
-Show me your plan
And then this goes on for 30 minutes, after the terrifying interrigation with my mom she asks me how my day went. but she asks in a way as if it's a chore and she is forced to be "nice".

I WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS HELL OF A SITUATION!! but at the same time I'm scared of doing something alone! Suicide? yeah, it seems very attractive, no bullsh*t pressure from my school or my mom. suicide seems to be a very nice deal to me, it's free and effective! And guess what, no one will give a shit about me. I don't even have friends that i can rely on, let alone my mom.

Throwaway so that my classmates don't see me and laugh at my miserable situation.
