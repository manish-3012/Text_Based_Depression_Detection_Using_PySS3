iâ€™m so close to leaving this house but what if i donâ€™t make itsince i realized that i wasnâ€™t the problem, i have been counting down till i could leave my abusive home. this is my last year and iâ€™m so close but what if something happens? my dad keeps guns not locked up around the house and iâ€™ve never felt safe that way because iâ€™m scared of him.. but what if i should really be scared of myself? iâ€™m stable right now and i just want to get through this year because i know i will be more safe from then on out
