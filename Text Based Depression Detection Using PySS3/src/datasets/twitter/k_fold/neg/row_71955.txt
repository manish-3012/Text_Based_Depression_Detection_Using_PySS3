Matter of timeI have to talk myself out of suicide every night. I cry myself to sleep all the time. I've been clinically depressed for years and it's only getting worse. I'm posting here as basically a last resort. I know I'm going to do it one day soon but this small part of me wants things to get better even though I know they won't. I've done countless hours of research on suicide and I know how I'm going to do it as well. If anyone is going to waste their time and comment with things like "stay strong" and "things will get better" please don't waste your time. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm posting here. I guess this is as close as I've ever gotten to talking to someone about it.
