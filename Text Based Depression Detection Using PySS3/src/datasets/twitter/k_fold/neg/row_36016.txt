Borderline personality disorderI have diagnosed BPD, which, among other things, makes me fear rejection and be highly insecure in relationships, today, my boyfriend broke up with me. We'd been together 6 months, I was relatively happy and just feel like a giant bomb was dropped on me and I've been kicked in the gut. The rational side of my brain thinks I should be able to cope with this, but I just feel like this is just a cycle of me letting down my guard and being left alone that won't stop. I feel like I won't ever be happy and feel safe and secure in any sort of relationship. The only real friend I have is my sister and I barely know anyone else here.

The thing with bpd is, suicidal thoughts are an actual symptom. This would not be my first attempt, but the thoughts won't leave my brain. I feel so lost and don't know what to even grasp to to live for at this point.
