I'm tried guys, I'm sick of everything. I'm gonna have one last roll of the diceI grew up in poverty, even my most basic necessities were never met. I've been fighting all my life and to be honest I don't think I can do it anymore. It's just too much. I wish I still had the sprit of my 10 year old self, but all these years have taken its toll. I can't keep giving my all despite the constant failures. I can't struggle any longer, maybe I'm just not strong enough. As a last ditch effort I applied for a public university. If I get accepted I'll try to turn over a new leaf and start over. But if I'm rejected I'm gonna call it a day.

You guys might think I'm pathetic, but this is the last shred of hope I have. I just can't go any further. In a way I think I'm fortunate cause guys like me were destined to fail from the start but I have one last opportunity. I don't know what will happen, I think my academic record is good enough to get an admit, it's 50/50. I'll get the decision letter in less then a month.
