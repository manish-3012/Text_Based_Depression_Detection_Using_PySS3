Just kill me now. There's no reason for me to keep trying.I'm miserable. My skin is itching everywhere. I have a project due in a few hours and only did half of it. I just spent two hours crying and it's not gonna stop.  
I keep fantazising about drinking bleach. I just imagined it. The sole thought of it made me feel more alive than I ever did. I was fighting with an unknown man, he dared me to do it, and then I did and he tried to stop me because I wanted to drink more.      
Just kill me now if you exist God. I don't believe in you but if you exist please fucking erase me from this existante now. If I meet my soul mate like I dreamed in the other side then great. If I don't, then also great because I won't feel it. No worries, no pain.    
There's no point. I'm never going to be normal. I'm never going to be happy. I'm never going to be good at anything. My only destiny is crying and pain and self loathing. It's been 20 years God you had your fucking laugh. It's over. Do it now. I will pray honestly for the first time in my life and it will be to ask you to kill me. Please. Do it.
