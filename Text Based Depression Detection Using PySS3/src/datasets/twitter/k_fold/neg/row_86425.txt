Why Do I Exist?I feel like my life has no purpose and that I'm a burden on society. I've had depression since I was 10. Never realized it, was too depressed to admit I even had a problem or that it wasn't normal to cry myself to sleep and pray for the end of the world. Too depressed to commit suicide because family wouldn't leave me home alone and no one would care. At 15, began listening to Paramore and other depressing popular shit that came on while playing on pottermore for like 7 hours a day when I got home from school. High school grades sucked, (1.7gpa, 2nd semester freshman year) Also downloaded candy crush soda... bad idea I'm so addicted right now. Then I began listening to bands like Three Days Grace and reading depressing shit on quizup while answering questions. I've never had any self confidence, don't know how to build any up either. I always feel like a failure even if i know the answer to something because I feel like I'm wrong. I relate to everything dark and gothic. Suicide is my dream. 16-17 really fucked up my mind, discovered the dark side of the internet. Fifty Shades, bad fanfiction, erotica, gore, and horrifying shit on 4chan. 

Anyway I feel like I haven't done shit with my life. 
-I'm not as smart as everyone else (because Autism, and the fact I don't get help for it because I don't want to be associated with those kids who don't try or are just plain stupid...messed up but true. I think help is stupid)
-I have cut and plan on doing more in college if my plan on getting anorexia and dying as a direct result fails
-Still depressed even though its been nearly 8 years, mainly from going to a private school with 50 kids in the grade and everyone hating me (from one girl I was scared of to the point i was convinced her parents would murder me in my sleep-yeah I hate her and continue to talk shit about her bc this caused a mental breakdown leading to chronic depression)
-I have social anxiety and don't know how to talk to more than one person at a time
-On level 1505 of candy crush (830 levels in past 8 months)
-going to community college bc i cant pass algebra 2, and my gpa is 2.5
-Making friends is so hard, I can't even make an internet one so here goes nothing with this.
-I'm a christian... not really I'm going to hell at this point from all the erotica I read and the music I listen to (vampires, immortality, fallen angel, pagan, sex, drugs)
-I don't/can't grow up, I just can't... I wanna die before that happens or at the least before 20, I can't stand getting older and going to college to get a job

I don't know why I even posted this. Guess I just want to find a purpose in this life. Or make an internet friend. Or to have someone tell me my life isn't worthless.
