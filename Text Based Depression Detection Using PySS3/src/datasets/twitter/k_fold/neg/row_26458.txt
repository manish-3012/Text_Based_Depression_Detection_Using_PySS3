I've waited, and waited, and waited, and it's not getting any better. It's only getting worse.I am just beyond miserable. For months now I've felt that my life was meaningless and empty. I've had a complete lack of desire and motivation. Everything has just been pointless. Everything just keeps getting worse and worse. I have absolutely nothing. What is the point in living when you don't have anything at all?

I don't think I'm going to be around tomorrow.
