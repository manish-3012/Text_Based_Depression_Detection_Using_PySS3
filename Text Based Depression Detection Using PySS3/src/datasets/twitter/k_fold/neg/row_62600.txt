Itâ€™s never a way out.My brother took his own life on Sunday and itâ€™s only since then Iâ€™ve seen the support offered to me and my family. Although people may not seem like they care they do. Itâ€™s never a way out. There is always someone to talk to, someone willing to listen. To anyone here thinking about it or a had a thought cross feel free to reach out to me and contact me. Is a decision at the moment I quite donâ€™t understand and I have first hand seen the damage it causes so even if you donâ€™t reach out to me, reach out to someone as there is always someone willing to listen. He was 18 and saw that it was the only way to go. But if he saw how the effect heâ€™s had on such a small place of the world and how the support thatâ€™s been offered has helped us and how many people have reached out to help Iâ€™m sure heâ€™d still be here. 

Please if you are having these thoughts whether itâ€™s mental health or troubles in your life PLEASE TALK TO SOMEONE
