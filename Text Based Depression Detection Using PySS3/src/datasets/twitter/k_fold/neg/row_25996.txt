Itâ€™s over as soon as Iâ€™m truly aloneFor years Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide. Iâ€™ve thought about it so many times in the last 4 years that Iâ€™ve lost track. But, Iâ€™ve finally realized that the best time is once my mom passes away. She suffers from major depression along with a heart condition. I canâ€™t leave her alone in this world. It wouldnâ€™t be fair for me to do that to her. As soon as she passes away, itâ€™s over for me. I wonâ€™t have anything else to live for. 

I wish it wasnâ€™t this way. I wish I had some sort of ties to life, something to keep me here and never think about suicide again. But in reality, sheâ€™s all Iâ€™ve got. Thereâ€™s nothing else waiting for me here. The world doesnâ€™t welcome me and Iâ€™m done trying to make it. I have nothing going for me anymore. Itâ€™s just a waiting game. 

Iâ€™m so tired of existing. I wish that this was not my reality. I have nothing, I pretty much am nothing at this point. So tired of it all.
