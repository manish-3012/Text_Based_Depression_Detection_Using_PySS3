best way to stop the feeling?hi

iâ€™ve been on again off again suicidal for roughly 6 years. i was hospitalized about 5 times and since my last visit i was actively trying to improve myself and genuinely started to feel better. some shit hit the fan in my life and for the past several months iâ€™ve been feeling very depressed and suicidal. 

sleeping has become more and more difficult as i lay in bed and a sudden wave of â€œholy fuck i need to do itâ€ hits me.

deep down i donâ€™t want to act on these thoughts and just want them to stop. iâ€™ve tried medication in the past and it made me feel worse.

any advice on how to stop the feeling of constantly wanting to drive my car off a bridge?

thanks
