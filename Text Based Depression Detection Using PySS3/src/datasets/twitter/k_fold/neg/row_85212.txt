18, female, disabled and depressedI don't exactly want to kill myself, but I don't want to stay alive. College is so difficult and painful with my condition, people won't make friends with me and the boy I like likes someone else. I don't have access to therapy or psychiatry anymore (UK mental health system is fucked). I'm so full of despair and don't want to continue being so lonely.
