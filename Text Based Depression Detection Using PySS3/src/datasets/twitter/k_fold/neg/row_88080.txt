never rly one to post on reddit, i just read and vote, but iâ€™m at a new low &amp; donâ€™t even know if i want to be talked into or out of suicideiâ€™m not gonna go into why because deep down no one really gives a shit, but basically feeling like this isnâ€™t new to me. it just feels like if i donâ€™t do it now then when. the next time iâ€™m this low? idk. 
iâ€™m a drug user so i have the means to end my life literally whenever i want, i just canâ€™t bring myself to for some reason. which makes everything so much worse
