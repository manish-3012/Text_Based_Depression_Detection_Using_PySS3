Trying to tidy up my affairsI'm already fighting not to kill myself. Been especially fighting it today. Everything in my life is shit. The one person I care about messaged me with their goodbye note to me and has gone radio silent. So, guess they're dead somewhere. I've snapped now. Just trying my best to quickly tidy my so called affairs as I think of my own suicide plan. I just don't have the mental and emotional strength to keep on with this shit. 

Kudos to people who can be happy and stay that way. I've never felt envious about it. I always hoped maybe I would experience it but that clearly just ain't gonna happen so fuck it.
