help please I'm a 16 year old kid from Sri Lanka and I've never felt good or happy with my self for my entire life. i go to school wearing a mask , pretending life is good and making jokes. i kept whoever was close to me at an arms distance and because of that i feel like i have nobody that will stand by me. i don't even remember the last time i felt genuine and in the moment . i don't know who i am anymore or whether i'm an actual person or not. i was so afraid to tell anyone about this because of my anxiety and fear of being outcast and pushed in the corner. i walk everyday with a fake smile because in my mind / my faith told me that even if you are not happy try to bring happiness to some one else, so i that's exactly what i tried to do.... and for just a brief moment in my life i felt like i was worth something... but i guess nobody got the signs , non of my "friends" are with me. I'm all alone in room full of people . my mom always told me that i was the most bravest one.... but i don't think ill ever be brave enough. suicide has been on the mind for the past 4 months and i don't know whether i'm gonna make it through. Thank you, whoever reads this, I hope you have a blessed day
