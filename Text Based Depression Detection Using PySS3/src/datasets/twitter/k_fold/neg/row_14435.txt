I'm backHey guys I'm back. I've been home for 5 weeks because of sinus surgery but I'm going back to boarding school Sunday. I'm really depressed and I just get the urge whenever an opportunity comes up to kill myself. I might run away but one of the only thing stopping me is the life I have ahead. My whole future set out for me, I'm going to be inheriting a large sum of money when I'm older so I figure that life will be great then. Another thing stopping me is what happens after death. If anyone is available to chat with me I'm interested in what other people believe what happens after death please comment or pm me.
