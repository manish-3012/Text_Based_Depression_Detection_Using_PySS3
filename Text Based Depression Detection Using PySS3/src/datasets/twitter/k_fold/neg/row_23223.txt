The anxiety of thinking about my parents' future death and the inevitable depression is making me want to take the easy way outIt's cowardly I know. But I feel the only way to avoid the suffering of my parents dying is to end my life first. I'm 28, I'm an only child, and I still live at home for half my time (the other half is spent abroad). 

I can't handle the thoughts of my parents dying one day. My mom is 57 and she weighs 14 stone. My dad is 64 and has type two diabetes. Either one of them could get a stroke or heart attack any minute.

My dad takes his meds and my mom is going for a check up soon. But my anxiety about their future death is unberably strong. I know I wont be able to cope. I dont have many friends. 

I will end up lonely and crying every day. I feel absolute zero control over their destinies but the only destiny I have control over is mine. I guess I'm seeking some comfort to get me out of this dark headspace. I cant stop panicking that either of them will die in the near future. Thanks for any help.
