Iâ€™m gonna kill myself tomorrowI studied classical music, and Iâ€™m fairly good. Finished my B. Mus at a very demanding school and was on my way to apply at one of the best conservatories in the world for a master degree.

My parents let me take a gap year and stay at their house so I could study and practice for the examinations and everything was going well until last month.

To make things simple, letâ€™s just say I had an accident.

Applying for the master this year is not even plausible, but staying another year at my parents is embarrassing at this point.

Iâ€™m worried that Iâ€™ve already spent a decade to be good, and it could take me another one to overcome this.

Iâ€™m already about 5 years older than most people at my level, and that, in music, is a huge gap.

This is what I wanted to do, and how I wanted to do it, but after effectively a decade of being in this extremely competitive, stressful, venomous environment that I wanted to be in, I broke down.

I barely go outside, most of my few friends are overseas and donâ€™t have anyone to talk about how Iâ€™ve felt all this years. So today I took the dogâ€™s leash and hung myself for a few seconds.

I thought it would hurt a lot, but it didnâ€™t. It made me cry to think you could vanish so gently.

I will try to kill myself tomorrow.
