Swallowed some pillsI just swallowed pills. Me and my girlfriend broke up a month ago because I was borderline abusive to her. I kept contacting her when she didn't want it. I talked to her today and she told me we are never getting back together and to focus on myself and to move on. I then took some of my ADs and she told my sister over Facebook. My parents came running into the room and shouted at me, took away the pills, and want me to go to the hospital but I just don't care anymore. I would take more pills tonight if they hadn't taken them away. I feel like a complete and utter psycho. I want to die.
