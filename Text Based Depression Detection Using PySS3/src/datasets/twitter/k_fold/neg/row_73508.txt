I'm worthlessI'm a fucking worthless piece of shit. Everyone around me is able to be an actual adult. They all have decent paying careers have a house can afford to buy things.

Here I am 32 living with my parents. I'm a veteran and have a computer science degree. Can't afford to buy a house. Can't find a career or even a decent paying job with benefits. All I am good for are these stupid ass recruiters who want me to work for the shitty ass recruiting firm for 12$ an hour after taxes with no benefits.

Recruiters suck and they make me want to stab myself in the chest directly through the heart. These people suck. They are terrible people with terrible jobs consistently fucking people over. The shitty part is nothing will change. I FUCKING HATE YOU RECRUITERS. YOU ALL CAN GO SUCK A HORSE DICK AND CHOKE DOUCHEBAGS

Since covid started theres twice to three times as many job applicants for each job and it's just ridiculous. I can't compete with a master's degree or someone who has 12 years of experience already. I just can't win. I want to crawl away and never be seen again. I want to disappear. I just want to not exist anymore.
Its just all to depressing and fucked now. I hate playing the game 
of life and I want to quit like the worhtless piece of shit I am...................................................................................................
