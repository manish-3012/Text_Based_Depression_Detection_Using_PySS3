Would a fresh start help in your case?Let's say there is a program. You are taken to brand new location with no possession, no history, given a new name. Your friends and family are told you died of an aneurysm. You have a small room and a basic job assignment, all your basic needs are taken care of.

In my case, it will probably be enough. All I need is some books and maybe some drawing material.
