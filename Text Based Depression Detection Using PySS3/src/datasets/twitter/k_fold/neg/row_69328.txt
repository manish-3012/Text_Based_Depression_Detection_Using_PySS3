I donâ€™t want to be here anymoreMy whole life I just wanted to help people. For the last 5 years Iâ€™ve just felt stuck and used mad worthless. I donâ€™t want to be here anytime. I hope I die in my sleep and I hope my organs can help someone. I want to just perish and die. I donâ€™t ever want to wake up. I canâ€™t see myself living another year.
