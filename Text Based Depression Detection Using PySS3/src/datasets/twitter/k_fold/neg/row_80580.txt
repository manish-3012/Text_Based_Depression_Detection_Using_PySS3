The undying loneliness has gotten to meI tried to be happy, 18 years of loneliness is too much, being sheltered and innocent of the outside world. I never made friends or a lover, I don't know how it feels to be loved and a sense of belonging. Each day of suffocating loneliness, no one to ever talk to, I've reached my limit, I cant wait to be able to sleep forever in a few hours. Maybe I'll meet someone in hell.
