Don't leaveI know you're feeling better suicidal and I know you're depressed. I'll do everything  I could so I can help. But if you leave without  telling  I'll be worried first. Then question if you're okay and then blame myself because I never was good enough  and the weight will grow heavier....

I don't know, but this may happen to a friend who I tried to help. I'm worried  and I'm waiting for a response. she could be anywhere but after the last suicide attempt  i don't realy trust her being alone.
