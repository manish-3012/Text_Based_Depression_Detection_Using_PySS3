I canâ€™t do this anymoreMy kidneys and heart are not doing good I am only 26/f and Iâ€™m struggling with my anxiety &amp; depression at the same time. Iâ€™ve been praying to God to take me in my sleep so I will not burden anyone in my life.
I canâ€™t do this anymore and Iâ€™m crying while Iâ€™m typing this. 
I wanâ€™t to give up. Iâ€™m so tired mentally and physically. I canâ€™t do this any longer.

I was planning for my future I had so many plans then my body suddenly decided to slowly give up on me.
