When I tell the doctor I'm thinking about suicide..I told my psychiatrist about my suicidal thoughts and they upped my meds that are already giving me side effects.  I tried to explain that I'm in the planning stages, but all we do is up my meds and talk about counseling.

I don't know if I want to be better.. well.  Of course, I do.  But do I just want to hurt myself so I can prove people care?  I know people care.

I'm afraid to tell my significant other that I have been thinking about killing myself because their life is so complicated already.  I'm afraid it'll be the straw that breaks the camel's back and that they'll finally leave me.  I try talking to my parent and it doesn't work.. parent is compassionate, but overwhelmed after years of dealing with me.

I don't want anyone to have to deal with a body if I do this.  I don't want it to be painful and I am scared.  I am just so exhausted.  I'm tired of waking up in the morning.  Waking up sucks.
