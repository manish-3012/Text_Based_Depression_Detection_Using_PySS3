I've struggled with depression for a long time but I've recently hit an all time low and I'm thinking of suicide.I've always had feelings of worthlessness accompanied with other self depreciating thoughts but a recent group of events have pushed me overboard. My ex of 5 months, who I lived with for almost 5 years, left me to be with my best friend. They both say that nothing happened until after we broke up but the fact that he just randomly showed up right when we were breaking up and the way he talked to me about it makes me think that they'd been up to this for a while before we split. I've never been so hurt and betrayed in my whole life and I feel fucking awful. I alternate between extreme sadness and loss to full blown rage. I've never wanted to murder anyone before but I've thought about killing him multiple times now. I feel like my life is over and that I'm such a worthless piece of shit that I don't deserve to be loved or have close friends. I don't how to recover from this. I can't trust anyone again now and I don't have anything to keep living for. My life feels hollow and I can't think of any reason so not just end the whole thing.
