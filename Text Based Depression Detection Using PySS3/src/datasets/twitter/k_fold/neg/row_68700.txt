Contemplation.Is there a checklist one can go through, before ending it, so as to make things less worse for everyone? 

[eg: get all your finances in order, get approved for organ donation, get in  better shape so that every organ is in great shape for said organ donation, leave a note for everyone important, handover passwords to someone trustworthy, etc.] 

I hope this doesn't violate any rules. 
Just curious. All is well. 
Thank you.
