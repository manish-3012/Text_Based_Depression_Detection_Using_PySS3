Going to kill myself if I can't find a jobHello,

I'm a 23 year old guy from Pittsburgh, I am desperately trying to find ANY type of work that I won't despise to sustain myself, I have an associate's degree in cybersecurity, and I graduated at the tippy top top of my class, only community college but still I'm a pretty smart guy, basically went to community college to save money. I cannot find anything that isn't back breaking labor, and I legitimately do have an extremely terrible back for my age, I feel like I'm 190 years old. Bottom line is, I need a desk job, I can't do ANYTHING requiring a substantial amount of physical labor, I'm in so much pain as it is even with doing yoga, exercising, and taking oxycontin (you got that right, only 23 and on a legitimate oxy regimen). I am suicidal, over 4k in debt, and I need to feel productive SOMEHOW and start paying it off and getting out of my financial hole. I don't care if its minimum wage, I need to feel productive, I can't stand this stagnation any longer, and I don't know what to do to unstagnate, as no opportunities come my way, ever. I'm seriously gifted when it comes to computers, and could have made millions by now through cyber fraud if my moral code agreed with it, but I choose to pay my taxes and do things right, but so far that's impossible. I'm honestly considering robbing a bank, and possibly killing myself if it goes wrong. I tried to be legal, I tried to fit in with the system even though I'm a deviant by nature, I worked harder than most, yet here I am.
