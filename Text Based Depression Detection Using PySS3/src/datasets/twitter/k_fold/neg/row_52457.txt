throw away account don't plan on stayingI feel so alone in a world full of people. I just feel all alone and feel like I need something more intimate than superficial "friendships" I have but am always alone in everyones presence. I'm so tired of just being alone and can't put up with it much longer. Don't even care how shitty my life has been, its the fact I've been alone the whole time.
