I feel like the only good thing in my life seems to be going to shit.In October 2018 I got out of an abusive relationship. I escaped with no physical injuries but I have PTSD, stress induced chronic illnesses and likely have trauma induced schizophrenia.

I've been with my current boyfriend since the end of november 2018 and that relationship is basically the only thing that's keeping me going but recently my boyfriends been really selfish and refusing to talk about problems we have.

I'm on the verge of just giving up. I've not self harmed since March 2017 but it's getting harder and harder not too, I don't want my skin anymore. I want to walk away and just keep walking. I don't care where kr what happens. I just want to walk.
