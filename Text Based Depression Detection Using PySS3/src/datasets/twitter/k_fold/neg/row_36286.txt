This breakup is tearing my heart right apart and making me have thoughts of dying, help?Backstory: i met this girl about 7 or 8 months ago and she was in half of my classes, for privacy weâ€™ll call her Monica, i didnâ€™t know Monica that well because sheâ€™s a new student and although she was new she was more popular than me, in one of our classes we were allowed to use our phones for the period so we played some 8Ball together, an old friend of mine who iâ€™ve known for 2 years whoâ€™s also a girl, weâ€™ll call her Rebecca, she invited me to walk from school to a park near my home with Monica, Rebecca, and i, i accepted and a day later Rebecca tells me that Monica had a crush on me, at the time i was dating a girl, who weâ€™re gonna call Erika, Erika and i werenâ€™t very serious because the only time i saw her was on my school bus and we didnâ€™t hangout a lot, we didnâ€™t talk a lot, basically no communication. I find out Monica has a crush on me and i didnâ€™t think much of it. a few days later and itâ€™s the day weâ€™re walking to the park. Turns out Rebecca canâ€™t go anymore so it was just me and Monica (by coincidence) so we start walking and weâ€™re having lots of fun and weâ€™re enjoying ourselves and ya know day goes by and it was fun, i started to develop feelings for Monica, this was in March btw so it was very close to spring break for me, spring break comes by and i ask Monicaâ€™s two best friends if she likes me just to verify, they both say yes, without thinking about Erika, i ask out Monica and she says yes, but then asks me about Erika, a few days go by and i was planning on breaking up with her in person on the bus, i was too impatient so i do it on Snapchat, 3 days before spring break ends we go to a Barnes and Noble and we just sit down in one of the isles and talk, probably one of the most romantic settings because weâ€™re both very comfortable and we are open to talk, i forgot to tell her i broke up with Erika so she proceeds to tell me to go back with Erika, i tell her the news and she says â€œNOOOO GO BACK WITH HERâ€ needless to say i was confused so i assured her that i wanted her, she had very deep hatred for herself, and as do i, so we argue abt Erika and all that BS, tell her idc anymore and im with you now so itâ€™s too late, 3 months go by and everything was going smooth until she started telling me that she doesnâ€™t deserve me and that you need to leave me before you get hurt, tell her idc iâ€™m in love with her (i really am) and it stops there.


Fast forward to this week and iâ€™m in universal with my family, Monica tells me we need a break, i donâ€™t feel like im in the right state of mind and we need a break. Iâ€™m confused but i tell her that sure we can have a break because i want to be nice and give her time and space to think, she and i joke about how weâ€™re not dating anymore (for some reason we were still texting even tho she wanted a break) she said we can get back together when the new school year starts, i say â€œi canâ€™t wait for school to startâ€, she asks why, i say â€œi was gonna save this for later but iâ€™m gonna ask you out on the first day of schoolâ€, she says could you please not, iâ€™m confused as fuck, â€œiâ€™m gonna say no because i donâ€™t want you getting to attached to me and i donâ€™t want to hurt youâ€ i donâ€™t understand how she is hurting me? â€œdonâ€™t ask me outâ€, we have a whole argument abt how she doesnâ€™t like me anymore and she ends it by saying â€œif i knew you were gonna be like this i wouldâ€™ve never dated youâ€ thatâ€™s where my heart shattered into pieces and she says â€œmaybe we were just meant to be friendsâ€ iâ€™m still texting her today, she fell asleep an hour ago but this had got me thinking i did something wrong, i told her to block me on everything and try and forget i existed, immediately regret that. Now iâ€™m sitting here thinking about killing myself in a Hotel in Florida

Please someone help me and tell me what to do here iâ€™m scrambling and iâ€™m starting to do xannys and percocet and i donâ€™t want to be addicted and suicidal, send help people, i have no one to talk to abt this shit
