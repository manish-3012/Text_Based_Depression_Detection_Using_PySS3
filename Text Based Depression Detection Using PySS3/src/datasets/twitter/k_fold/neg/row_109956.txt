I'm so disappointed by myself I don't want to live anymoreFor many years I have been contemplating the meaning of life. I have always been the kind of undecisive person never taking a real path and always changing my mind about things. I changed my major at university so many times and never actually graduate. So I took a job and got married at 22. Then moved to Thailand, my wife's country and found a job where I worked for 8 years and we had 2 kids. Unfortunately my confused personality reemerged again after my 31st birthday and I started sort of mid life crisis that pushed me to leave my job, I felt unhappy and wanted more but without any qualifications I was already lucky to have that job. I had panic attacks when I gave my resignation letter to the boss so that he realized I wasn't really 100% sane so now he doesn't want me back. 

After that I stopped sleeping, had furious panic attacks with me screaming in front of my kids and wife. Eventually I went back home and got in a psychiatric ward for a month where they gave my heavy sedatives and anti depressants. I attempted sucide with pills once. After a few months I felt better and went back to Thailand and for 1 year I have been able even to work for a new place and earn money.

Problem is now I feel deeply unhappy and insecure about my life, underappreciated by everyone. My wife simply doesn't understand me and tries to find obstacles instead of helping me. I feel depression coming back and I wish to end my life. Only my kids keep me here, I want to help them to survive this heelish world but with this conflict inside of me I don't know how to find peace.
