Light at the end of the tunnelI lost my job in the summer for speaking out against discrimination. Rejection after rejection later, and unemployment since then, I had my first suicide attempt after feeling so depressed and worthless. I finally started something that has given me light at the end of the tunnel. Please show your support. Www.mellymax.co.uk

Finally, anyone feeling low, depressed, rejected or any other negative feeling. Please hold on toght, be stronger for a little while longer and talk to someone. You are not alone. You are not worthless. You are loved.
