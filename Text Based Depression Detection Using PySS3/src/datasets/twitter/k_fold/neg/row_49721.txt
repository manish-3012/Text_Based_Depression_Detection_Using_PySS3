a numb dick is making me want to dieI took sertraline (zoloft) an ssri about 6 months ago.. one pill 

six months after i still have sone of the "side effects"

instead of helping me it may end up killing me.

no one knows why it happens or what to do.. i miss the full sensation of my dick.


urologist says it's mental, endocrinologist says it's mental.
whatever it is, is still with me

i don't want to die
