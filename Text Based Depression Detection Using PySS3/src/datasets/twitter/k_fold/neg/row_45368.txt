Don't know when but I know soon.Everyday I go to school with people who hate me and try to avoid me. I call them my friends for lack of a better word, but they make it clear everything I say irritates them and that they hate me. I cannot talk to anyone about my depression there. My teachers all suck and I am completely intellectually unstimulated. I go there everyday because it's a law and I know my future is bleak from my family life our financial status. My family is horrible and doesn't like to talk to me unless it benefits them. I use to think self harm is stupid, but about two months ago I started. We have a bottle of pills and I don't care anymore. The only thing that stops me is that I am religious and believe in hell and the chance that I could be sent there lol. Not that it could be much worse.
