I don't want to...Not really. But the thoughts intrude.
I hate myself. I am trash. Pathetic. 
But I'm doing everything right and supporting the ppl in my life that care about me.
 I think I care about them. I'm supposed to. I'm just numb.
Sometimes I want to cry. Other times I want to die.
I want to be something like happy. It seems like a myth. Happiness is that mask people hide behind when they're scared of exposure. Fake smiles and empty eyes.
I feel alone. I'm not. I am loved, I know. But I don't feel it. Just a weariness thats been tugging at me for a long time now.
I have made no plans to commit suicide, but its there on the fringe of my thoughts.
My happiness is simply when I forget to hate myself.
