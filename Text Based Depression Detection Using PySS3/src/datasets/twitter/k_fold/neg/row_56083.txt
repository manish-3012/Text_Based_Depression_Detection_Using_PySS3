Have family and friends, but just dont care cuz my thoughts are too far goneDont think that ill ever kill myself, but all i ever think about everday are my failures and my thoughts that have haunted me for years and i just want to die in my sleep. 

im tired of keeping up appearances and having to see people, and quite frankly all of my family and friends support me in my stuggle with suicidal thoughts and depression and ocd and they check in on me and want me to get better but,

i just dont see the point of getting better and secretly i dont want to. There is no point to anything in this world and every night i go to sleep i just wish i wont wake up, but when i do thats when the nightmare starts again. because truthfully ill never be myself again after fighting my thoughts and seeing what this world does to people
