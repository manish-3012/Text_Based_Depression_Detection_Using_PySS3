It's funny when you're asked to explain yourself when you've also been trying to understand why the hell you are the way you areOften I have spells of bad anxiety, a general discomfort that can last hours a day. Sometimes it's not there, I'm sometimes confident and often not. I like to be around people, but I'm also scared of being around them too long. I struggle forming maintaining relationships, I can make friends but can't keep them...... Blah blah blah, I've been trying to understand myself but this life is just too much. I feel like I have to deal with the world and also babysit this mass of garbage I call me. I'm trying to juggle maintaining my insanity and maintaining my performance and I think I'm done. I don't see myself making it past next year. But who knows.
