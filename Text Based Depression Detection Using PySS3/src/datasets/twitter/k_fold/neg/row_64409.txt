i wanna die lolI want to die so bad. my lord, i have never felt such an intense hatred for myself like I have today. I just hate literally every single thing about myself and there is no escaping from it because its all I can think about all day. even when I should be happy and content I'm really not. I have such a good life and all I can think about is how much I don't want it. I thought that even if I don't want my life I could dedicate it to helping other people like medicine but I'm still never going to be intelligent enough to ever do that. 
I have a love of science and I wanted to do that as a career but I'm still too dumb to even do that i'm so useless. and the fat that I'm such a leech to my friends doesn't make matters worse and my girlfriend could do so much better than me and I feel selfish staying with her because she is just so much better than me and I'm such an embarrassment and so annoying i just hate myself so much I'm so fat and greedy. i just hope that someday I will build up the courage to finally kill myself.
