Dear, Everyone in my lifeI wish I could be dead so badly, Iâ€™ve tried telling my parents how bad I am, but they wonâ€™t listen. They just think Iâ€™m being dramatic. The other day at work I kept messing up and making everyone elseâ€™s job harder, my boss was annoyed with me and my co workers were too. At the end of the day I went home and cried. I hate my job, I hate school, I donâ€™t really have anyone to talk to anymore, when I have tried talking to people no one takes me seriously, or wants to listen. 

I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ll ever find someone to love me, Iâ€™m in my 20â€™s and Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship. I feel so lonely all the time, my life is never going to change, I try my best at everything, but itâ€™s not good enough. 

I want to be dead so badly, I wish I could kill myself and make it look like an accident.
