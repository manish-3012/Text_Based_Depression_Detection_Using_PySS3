I might just do it and iâ€™m okay with that.Iâ€™ve lost myself and the only thought thatâ€™s in my head is to just kill myself. Nothing else. I feel like itâ€™s going to happen soon and honestly i am very okay with that. I wasnâ€™t before but i genuinely just loathe myself so much, i know everyone is better off without me. I am just tired of crying. I donâ€™t want to cry anymore. i donâ€™t want to hurt anymore. i donâ€™t want to keep hurting anyone anymore. i donâ€™t want to wake up anymore dreading to exist. i feel like iâ€™ve lived a somewhat fulfilling life, im just so tired of it all.
