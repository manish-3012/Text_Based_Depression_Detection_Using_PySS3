Apologies if this isn't the right place to ask this, but is there some way to contact authorities in an entirely different state if I have evidence that a friend from another state is attempting to take their life? (Apologies if this doesn't belong here, I don't know where else to ask)If this is the wrong place to ask, could someone at least direct me to the right place?

To make this more clear, say I have a friend in San Francisco who told me online that they swallowed a bunch of pills and had pictures of proof, and I live in Baltimore. Is there a way to get them emergency help from so far away? This isn't an emergency now, but it's something I'd like to know for the future, and seems like it could help other people.

Also, if my name sounds at all familiar it's because I posted here before while at risk, and those who commented genuinely helped me, so thank you for that support. It means more than I could ever say.
