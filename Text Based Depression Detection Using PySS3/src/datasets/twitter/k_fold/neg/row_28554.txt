I'm a fuck-up. Again and again, without fail, I ruin everything I love.I can't get out of this cycle. Nothing and no one I love ever lasts, and it's always my fault. Even now I'm pushing away my (former) fiancee, his friends, my friends, my family. I don't feel as if I can trust anybody anymore, least of all myself.

I'm miserable and a failure. How the hell can I go on...
