i donâ€™t think life is cut out for people like mehi, i donâ€™t really know what all to say except that iâ€™m just exhausted from trying to get better and fix my depression. iâ€™m sick of trying new pills and spending so much time in therapy. iâ€™m not being cynical, it just genuinely is NOT working and i donâ€™t feel like it ever has. i feel dissociated all the time, i donâ€™t feel joy, i feel like the only emotion i experience regularly is frustration. i donâ€™t know if itâ€™s frustration at myself or just life. i feel like i have truly failed and i have a busted brain. i was cutting my wrists in the bathroom at middle school for godâ€™s sake. i got raped last august and itâ€™s been downhill fast since then. i donâ€™t feel real, i donâ€™t want to, i just want this fight to be over.
