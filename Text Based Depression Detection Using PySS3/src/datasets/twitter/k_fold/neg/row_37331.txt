give me one reason why I shouldnt throw myself off this bridge.The water beneath me looks more rewarding than the shit life I lead. I just wan one reason not to jump


*edit

 I sat on that bridge until sunrise. I went back to my car and then fell asleep after a lot of crying and reading everyone's comments. You guys will never know how much you helped me, and I cannot thank you enough for your kind words. All I wanted was to know my life mattered to someone, to at least some degree.
