I can't anymore.I can't. This is the most visibly depressed I've been in my life. I've lost 10+ pounds in the course of a month. I've been having headaches every single day for the past week. I feel like my boyfriend is losing feelings for me. My counselor has to call DCFS on my mom for emotional abuse so I'll probably have to go into foster care because my boyfriend and his mom can't take me and I have no one else. I don't have any form of a life outside of my room. No friends I can hang out with or anything. I'm just really thinking about ending things, for good this time.
