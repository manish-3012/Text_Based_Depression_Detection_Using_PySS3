I don't know what to do.Fiancee left me a few months ago, I guess that is the main thing. Ended up failing this last semester of school because of that. Everything sucked but I held out hope they might get better, or perhaps I just was just in denial, thinking she would come back to me. Needed to move out of my dorm earlier this evening, no idea how to do that. I left my car at home since I didn't see a reason to take it to college, my mother (whom I barely speak to) said maybe she can pick me up this weekend but she already made some plans. 

I broke down and ended up texting my ex a few times and she is ignoring me. I have no idea what to do. Should I just throw all my belongings away and go walking on the street until whenever? I know I'm being immature and selfish but I don't know what else to do.



I'd say more but you guys, if anyone reads this, already has a decent wall of text so I don't really see a point. Sorry for my horrible grammar and spelling mistakes, not really in the mood to look over it at all to fix it.
