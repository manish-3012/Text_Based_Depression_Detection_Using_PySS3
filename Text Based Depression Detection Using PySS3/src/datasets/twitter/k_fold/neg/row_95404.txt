Suicide is a daily consideration for me.I'm transsexual. I haven't come out, I'm not on hormones, and nobody knows. My life would be a million times worse if I actually went and came out to anyone. 

More than that, I'm depressed. I'm truly, unendingly depressed. I sleep 18+ hours a day, and I'm exhausted and miserable no matter what. I have no friends, interests, aspirations, hobbies. I'm 23 years old and live at home with my parents. They tell me that I'm burdening everyone with my attitude and my misery.

They're also kicking me out. My father is forcing me to see a therapist, on threat of kicking me out. He now demands to be able to speak to this therapist, and will kick me out if I don't let him. He said, verbatim, "I have just one question for her. *Can you live independently?*" In other words, he's kicking me out. I'm going to be homeless.

The only reason I haven't ended it all yet is for my 4 year-old sister. But I fear that even she's starting to adopt the attitude of everyone else towards me. She won't let me come near her, and she is increasingly unpleasant towards me.

I don't even know why I'm writing this. I hate everything about myself. I just want to die, and I'm too much of a coward to do it.
