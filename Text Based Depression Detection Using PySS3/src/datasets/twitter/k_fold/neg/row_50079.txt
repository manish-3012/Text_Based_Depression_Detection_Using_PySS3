The Worst Part of Contemplating SuicideFor me, the very worst parts of contemplating suicide are,

You donâ€™t get to have a rational conversation with your closest confidant about what youâ€™ve been thinking about, the options youâ€™ve been weighing out. 

You donâ€™t get to express your thoughts and feelings to strangers, friends, family or doctors without a 911 call being made.  

You donâ€™t get to ask for an unbiased opinion on whether or not you should. 

You donâ€™t get to explain to people face to face why you are considering suicide, why you believe this to be what is best. 

The entire monologue of your mind and reality becomes this MASSIVE secret, which youâ€™re deathly afraid of anyone knowing about...because ultimately that would result in complete loss of free will- as well the option to end your life. 

And the very worst, 

You donâ€™t get to hug, say goodbye, and tell your people how much youâ€™ve always loved them. 
How many nights theyâ€™ve kept you alive.
How youâ€™ve only been standing for this long because of them. 
You donâ€™t get to tell them that you love them so much. That youâ€™re so terribly, dreadfully and horrifically sorry. That the amount of guilt you feel is completely immeasurable.
