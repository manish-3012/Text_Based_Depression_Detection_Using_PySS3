FailureIâ€™ve really been thinking about ending my life. I feel like iâ€™ll never be enough for anyone, not even my significant other. I even feel guilty for being sad because so many other people are going through so much worse. I have such great friends and family, why donâ€™t i feel happy? why would they even care about me? iâ€™m just such a lost cause that i hate it when others try to console me, because i know i wonâ€™t feel better. i hate everything about myself, and i really donâ€™t think i can take it for much longer.
