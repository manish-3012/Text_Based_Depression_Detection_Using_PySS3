Difficulty coping with being a physically non-desirable man.Sort of bought into the narrative that looks weren't all that important for a man. Pretty ridiculous looking back how I never experienced intimacy with a girl before the age of 25 (and that was with a very low self esteem girl and ended badly) . Always thought my personality was to blame. Sort of kept the wheel turning like an idiot, have a masters degree in physics (did enjoy my time in physics though), went into medicine after that which in hindsight was a stupid decision but I thought it was something I wanted to do at the time. Now a radiologist in training. I'm in a comfy space financially, have a vivid social life (not a lot of close friends though), I do organise sport events (cycling) and other stuff and try building my leadership qualities. I feel bit of satisfaction from time to time, but it's very few and far in between. I'm also getting a bit more female attention now even though I've never been intimate with a second girl. While a intimate relationship is what I desire, ultimately a loving partner I can care and provide for and be cared for by, I don't feel very good about this. I have almost 30years of experience that women are not attracted to me so I can only assume these people want to use me. I've experienced this many times now, only after finding out about my accomplishments, what I work and where I live they warm up to me, I cannot trust them. I know this doesn't sound too terrible but I don't know how to cope with the fact that I jumped through all those hoops to have a shot at getting laid(just a space holder it's not about sex) with someone who'll use and discard me, while better looking people can just experience "true love" ... I feel like it's a no win situation and I feel incredibly inferior. The only thing keeping me alive right now are my parents for I don't want to hurt the only people who truly love me and a few friends...
