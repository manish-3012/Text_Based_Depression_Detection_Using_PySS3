what do i do if my brother hits me and calls me names but i cant fight back?So basically most of the days i mess up on something i am told by my brother that I am a "failure" or cant do anything right so I take that to heart and I sometimes get depressed by that and tell myself that I cant do anything right.. I sometimes think of ways to kill myself but I don't do it because I am too scared to die. So reddit users, what do i do??
