I was told life was supposed to get betterI've literally spent my entire life waiting for it to get better, but it always seems to find a way to fuck me; and now I have a single friend left and it's only a matter of time until she leaves me too.

I've come to terms with the fact that I'll probably kill myself in the next few years, just as soon as there's no one left to cry for me.
