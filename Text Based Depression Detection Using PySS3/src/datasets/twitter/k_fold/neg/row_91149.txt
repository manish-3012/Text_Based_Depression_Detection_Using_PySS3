My dog has cancer.So, a few days ago, we've pretty much confirmed that my 12 year old black lab, Bella, has breast cancer, and as is, it's spreading fast.

While she isn't my first ever dog, i lost my first back when i was 10, so i can't say i remember that one as much as i do with her. So, in a way, she feels like my first. 

She's like goddamn family to me, and she's been with me through my darkest times. And despite her age, it still feels like she has so much life in her yet. But we're thinking of putting her down relatively soon, before she... isn't herself anymore 

I was... very much passively suicidal, back then, not really caring whether i'd live to see the next day, feeling like a burden to everyone. 

She was the one that got me through it, and while i feel better about myself in comparison now, i feel those old thoughts of mine creeping back now that i know she doesn't have much left.

Sorry, just needed to vent somewhere... It just doesn't feel fair that someone like her has to die when she's still so full of life and activity as she is. And i know that i rationally couldn't have done anything to spot and prevent it, there's still the damn feeling that i've failed her. But for now, i'll do what i can to push those thoughts back, and just... enjoy our last time together. I can at least give her that much.
