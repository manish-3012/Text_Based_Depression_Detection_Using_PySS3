I am suicidalPlease help. I canâ€™t deal with the suffering in the world and I canâ€™t deal with my self and my self-sabotaging behaviors. Iâ€™m failing school and Iâ€™m too stupid to grasp basic math concepts. Iâ€™ve reached out for help but I have to wait until Wednesday for my therapy appointment. Everywhere is filled with so much evil. No one actually cares. I doubt anyone reading this cares. Oh well. Iâ€™m a failure anyway. I want to pain to go away. I want this emptiness and longing to go away. Life is not a fairytale. Donâ€™t tell me it gets better. Iâ€™m 22 I know things can change. I know logically things will probably get better but I canâ€™t believe it right now. I just want to go away. Stop. Stop. STOP.
