It's not fucking fairI have to go to dbt group therepy every saturday and therepy every monday. Im literally the only person in the group that has shown up to every god damn session. My boyfriend invited me to go camping but my mom wont let me go cause of therepy. Im not just upset cause i cant go camping im upset becuase my mental illness always gets in the godamn way. Im finally on a manic epispde and i finally have the opportunity to enjoy life and my mental illnesses STILL get in the fucking way even when i feel fine. I ruin every thing that could possibly make me happy. Im never going to be happy, im supposed to enjoy manic episodes, now im just even more determined to die and im boiling over with anger at myself. Why the fuck was I born like this i can never be happy i will mever be happy, i should kill myself, bet my mom will be happy i atleast got to go to one more therepy session before i died. Fuck life i really hate it.  I hit my head repeatedly in hopes of changing something, anything, atleast a concussion that leads to my death. Im shaking from how mucn im crying I can barely type, ive never cried like this on a manic episode guess it just means things are always gonna be bad. God i cant believe i was stupid enough to be optimistic
