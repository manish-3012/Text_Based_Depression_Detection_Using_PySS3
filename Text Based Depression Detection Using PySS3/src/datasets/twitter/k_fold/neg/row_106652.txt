I dont wanna kill myself but im tired of going through this shitIve been depressed for a really long time I cant even remember when it started. I used to just deny it and tell myself everythings fine and it will all get better but its getting progressively worse every week. All I do is work and come home, I never really hang out with anyone, im very socially anxious so I dont talk to anyone at work, im constantly seeing people I used to go to school with but I never talk to any of them Im just getting really tired of trying cause it doesn't seem worth it. Lately ive just been fantasizing about leaving this area and moving somewhere else but I don't have the means to do so, I just have to keep working non stop and try to save as much I can but as some point something's gotta give
