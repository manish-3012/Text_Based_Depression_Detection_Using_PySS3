Cut off from others and myself.I don't know what I want because what I'm doing now obviously isn't doing anything for me, but when I spend time with people, it's not enjoyable because of my social anxiety. It also takes away too much of my energy with no reward to make up for it. That's the feeling I get for life in general, a whole lot of effort for nothing particularly rewarding. I just want to get away from people when I'm around them to get some relief, but being isolated is deteriorating my mental health. I thought my social anxiety would improve from exposure. Well, I'm a few months into working as a cashier, and I've never felt so socially inept. I feel like I've lost an extreme amount of confidence because this job just seems to prove to me that I suck at talking to people and I hate doing it as well. Much of the time, I have a lurking feeling in my chest and stomach like something horrible is going to happen any second. One day or for a few hours I'll feel ecstatic and be glad I didn't kill myself, the next day or next hour I'll feel so down and wonder why Iâ€™ve kept on going and it oscillates like that. I've been in the mental health system since I was 12, going to mental hospitals, in therapy, on meds, was enrolled in a therapeutic high school for depressed/anxious kids with IEPs. It seems like my efforts are for nothing, and Iâ€™m tired of trying. I eat well, exercise, get at least 8 hours of sleep every night, read psych books, have straight A's in college. It doesn't get me very far at all.
