I dont know what to say other than that i dont see a point.For months ive told myself that it (life) is too hard, and with EOC tests coming up, its either study and kill myself anyway, or kill myself now. No point in waiting right? I have friends, sure, but I dont want anyone to know about my depression, not even my best friends. I need to say something but cant.
