What is the point really.I often wonder what is the point of living. All of us have their demons throughout or lives, some of us worse, some of us better. We are just existing and no matter what we do in life, we will all die. 
The ones who ended their suffering donâ€™t suffer anymore. 

I tried killing myself when I was 17. Almost succeeded, but was saved by my mother who called the ambulance. She gave me the mental issues genes, bless her. After the attempt I was drugged and for a month I was not even allowed out in the mental instituteâ€™s garden I was so fucked. 
After that, I grew so much. I promised that I never would do it again. I would never want to hurt my family. 
I soon moved abroad, started two different careers that I never liked, financially I am exactly where I was when 18 - almost got nothing. I am about to leave my second profession, because I have burnt out and feel used, under appreciated. Just doing the last few days of my shift. (Live in carer)
I always chose the easy way out and seem to be incapable of sticking to things that I want. I donâ€™t think I am a fighter. 

I am frightened, because I wonâ€™t have a job an income. More frightened of unhappiness and being in a job that eats me up inside. Of life. I thought I found the happiness in a relationship, but it seems like me not being able to accept myself and my mistakes is ruining it. My partner is calling me out on my flipping behaviour, but I only do it because I am unsure of myself. Today I was trying to explain that I am really low and I cannot talk to anyone and I donâ€™t know what to do. He doesnâ€™t understand it.
I donâ€™t dare to say I have been broken throughout my whole life. I donâ€™t dare to tell him that I have been suffering throughout all the way, with highs and lows switching places constantly. I donâ€™t dare to say that I am not normal. That the idea is back. Yes. The thought of suicide is back. I have been really low in the last few days but today I cannot cope. I donâ€™t see the way out. It would be so easy to end it all. We all think of our loved ones but life always goes on. It is weirdly enough but the feeling grew on me as I followed Scottâ€™s story from Frightened rabbits. He has been suffering from depression all his life. His last two tweets explain exactly how I feel. And he has given up, he ended it all. He is in peace now, cannot hurt anymore. His family is broken but will learn to live with the pain.

So tell me, you who read this. What is the point? So many people find their peace and end this whole tragedy. I will never be able to live, think like a normal human being. I am 26 now. 9 years since my last attempt. There were months when I felt ok, but this feeling always comes back. I am 26 and couldnâ€™t find the right career, ruined my relationships and constantly feel like a failure. I cannot see why should I carry on? What for?
For love? Most people around me realise that I am broken. Donâ€™t even have friends. My partner does not understand and blames me for my attitude. I am 26 and it hasnâ€™t got better. What is the point if we all die anyway?
