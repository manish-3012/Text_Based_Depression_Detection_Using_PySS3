I Seriously Have a Problem**If you can, comment any sort of suggestion or help for me, I don't want to traumatize everyone close to me or fuck my life up.**

Ever since seventh grade I have been utterly obsessed with this one girl. I can't at all explain it, she's so dreamlike and perfect and I've thought about her 24/7 ever since i laid eyes on her. It got so bad that just a year later I had suicidal thoughts over the fact she rejected me after asking her out. I've cried until it physically hurt so many times I've become numb to every sort of sadness and bad feeling, except for death and my feelings for her. 

I'm now a junior in high school and these thoughts have only gotten worse since. I've tried therapy, medication, and today I contemplated driving my car into oncoming traffic saying it would be easy and painless. But I can't kill myself because; 1. What it would do to my family and friends, and 2. I still haven't had the satisfaction of being with her yet. My whole life revolves around her and my grades and personal life have gone to shit as a result. I would die at the drop of a hat for her and would fucking kill to get with her (something else I've thought about). Her and I are friends and we're both still in band (where I met her), but it really does feel like life is just tormenting me with this shit.

I can't actually get with her because she has a boyfriend in the next city over, and i want to rip his spine out or something.   She's also a bit of a slut which pisses me off every time I hear she gets with someone, because that someone could've been me. I honestly feel like a useless psychopath who should just rot in hell.

So ya, any suggestions /r/?

P.S. let me know if I left any plot holes or anything, thanks guys.
