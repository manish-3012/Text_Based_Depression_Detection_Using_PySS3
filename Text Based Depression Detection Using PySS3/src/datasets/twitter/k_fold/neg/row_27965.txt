My "Friend"My "Friend" once was a genuine asshole. he was racist/homophobic/sexist. when i first met him i thought it was funny ( Very VERY wrong ) he lied to me manipulated me several times bullied me to existence it was unbelievable. then he met cooler friends while keeping me in touch in case i wanted to do something he didn't wanna do. this year things changed. he became out of touch so i of course went and showed new me. alot of people that hated me because of what he did were now my best friends.I was the new class clown/popular guy  i was living good. until the news came to my "friend" who then started leeching back for clout. i was better than that though and called him out. so he threatened to release videos of me doing weird shit for " funny jokes " and said if i didn't do what he said he would post them. then he got all of my friends against me except 2 ( one is my best friend today and the other my gf ) i thought it was over my entire life at that point ( it will be later ) until he went on a dm spree that i screenshoted and posted. everything came back to me and im living good. but my shitty parents make me do work all day that he managed to get back at me and " reveal " stuff about me (never happened) and he is back on top. i would be fine with that if he leaves my gf and friend group alone. he did try to get my friend group back because they had personal experiences with him and they don't like him. but my girlfriend doesn't know the half of it. he dumped his gf and went for mine. and.... he got to her. i don't know what to do anymore he is everywhere and can't deal with him cause of chores. ive got things sorted out but he got into my friend group too with a second chance. i have no one to turn to. ive organized tonight as death date.
