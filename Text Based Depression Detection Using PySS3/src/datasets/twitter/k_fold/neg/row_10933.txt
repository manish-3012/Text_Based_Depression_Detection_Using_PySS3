I canâ€™t do this anymore and Iâ€™m only 14Last year was on of the best years of my life I had finally made friends at school and did more social stuff but then my parents put me in an online school even after i explicitly explained I didnâ€™t want to. They just thought I know better because Iâ€™m older. So here I am a week behind excepted to work all day with no brake on school. And online school is horrible for one main reason, it doesnâ€™t engage you itâ€™s just words on a screen that you have to memorize. Iâ€™m told to sit at my desk from 8am to 6pm non stop working. I really canâ€™t take it. I just want to end it so badly but I donâ€™t have anything to do it with. My dad wants me to find a future job even though Iâ€™m 14 I canâ€™t even drive. And he wants me to figure that out. I have no room for break no room for relaxing. I barely eat anymore Iâ€™m probably going to stop drinking as well.
