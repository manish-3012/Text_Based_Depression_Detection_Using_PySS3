The thoughts keep comingFeeling at the end of my rope.

I'm starting to hate my friend I live with, I can't discuss any issues with him because he pays the rent and the only other option is to move back in with my parents which is no better. I'm getting hardly anywhere with SSI and am unable to work due to physical and mental hurdles. I'm getting fed up with life so the thoughts of suicide are strong again. I keep trying to make change but hardly anything truly does change. I have no plan but honestly I don't think I need one. If I don't get SSI soon to help me out I just might check out because I'm tired of this bullshit.
