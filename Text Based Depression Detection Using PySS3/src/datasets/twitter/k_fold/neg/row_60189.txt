i'm having some uncomfortable ideationi'm just tired of how nobody treats me like a normal human being. i'm tired of everybody asking the same exact questions when i come out to them. i'm tired of having to explain my to my mother that she is not allowed to ask if i am still capable of orgasming. i'm tired of random people sneering at me, of liberals telling me i'm tearing apart my famuily. i'm tired of meeting someone specail only to find out that they trash-talk my sisters who don't look pretty. i'm tired of having to tell myself that this is not normal, while my mother and father tell me that i'm fucking insane

normally i'm not this fucking depressed. i can usually brush it off with my bright demeanour. but i got fucking blindsided by an attack article featured in the guardian showing up in a list of porn results. 

i just want to opt-out of our current society. people would miss me, but it wouldn't be bigger news. i'll just become part of the 41 percent of my sisters who try to off themselves before they turn 30. nobody wants me to do it, but there's people who wouldn't mind. I know my father would rather "be dying of fucking cancer" than have me as a child. my mother isn't any better. to them, they don't have a daughter, only a son.
