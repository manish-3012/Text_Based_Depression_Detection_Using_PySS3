Iâ€™m getting blamed for my â€œfriendsâ€ addiction.This June is the third year since my dear boyfriend died at age 33. Itâ€™s been hell.

I have a friend Iâ€™ve known since 2002, and he became an addict. I have tried to be there for him and itâ€™s almost impossible to protect myself. I was close with his family for years and respectful. I cannot say heâ€™s been the same towards me. Long and short of it - last week I came by and he said he had dope in the bathroom. Because Iâ€™ve lost so many ppl to the damn devil drug, I thought â€œgreat now Iâ€™m going to have to watch himâ€ bc if he does overdose I need narcan! So I was there with a new guy friend (ugh dk about that) watching over him where he at times he was non responsive. At 5 am I went around his house looking for narcan and my friends dad flipped and yelled â€œWTF ARE YOU DOING?!?! GET THE FUCK OUT!â€ 

I mean.....then yeah we did leave. My friends dad kicked him out too I later found out. 

12 hours later my friend borrowed a car and totaled it, and he was found with a prescription bottle for anxiety meds from my purse on him. He also hit another car.

I called his mother to see how he was, and she said, because of me, this happened. Heâ€™s not talking to me and his parents are assholes. Youâ€™re all welcome Iâ€™ve been worried over your sons life, been upfront with you but still I get the blame.

That new guy friend is no one. Since my bf died I am SUPER protective of myself and honestly DO NOT believe â€œfalling in loveâ€ or â€œcatching feelingsâ€ will happen to me and I donâ€™t give a flying fuck. My hearts been broken to the core you think I have patients or am after that?

So yeah I do feel guilty. Smh. I was in the hospital from a panic attack and my throat closed up on me. Think I expect my â€œfriendâ€ to give a shit? No.

I have tried to keep him sober and clean and motivated. Heâ€™s lied, heâ€™s stolen and I shouldnâ€™t even care. Verbal abuse you name it. Itâ€™s like heâ€™s a great person one minute then heâ€™s the devil. But Iâ€™ve tried to keep him alive! 

Iâ€™m just never feeling better, even if I stay away.  I wish I was dead everyday.
