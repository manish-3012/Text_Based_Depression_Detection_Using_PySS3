I don't even remember what it's like to be a person anymore.Most days I feel like a vehicle to help other people reach their end goals. Anyone else? It kind of sucks that the only reason other people want me to stick it out is because they would feel sad or empty if I was gone. It's really not like I'm bringing anything g valuable to the table. I'm always cynical, unappreciative, and I don't have any goals or desires of my own. I'm becoming a fat alcoholic with no discernable skills and I have no idea why my partner is still with me.
