No one cared.After sending my ex girlfriend a goodbye text, hoping a paramedic would find me and not my family. I told her that she could have half of whatever money I had and the other half would go to my best friend, who had been pushing me away for afew months, anyways, she told her mother and before I could figure out what to do with myself, I was called my by principal. He spoke with my mother, and told her to bring me to a hospital. Without even speaking to anyone, they all assumed I didn't mean it and I just made a joke or said something I didn't mean. They don't have any concern. They wouldn't miss me. My best friend and I had completely cut contact, which is my fault. My ex still wants nothing to do with me, I can't blame her either.
