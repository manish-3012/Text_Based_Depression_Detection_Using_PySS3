Afraid to keep livingSitting home alone and pretty sure my ex-husband is trying to serve me with divorce papers. Now Iâ€™m freaking out with nothing to do and no where to go. Iâ€™m terrified to leave my house bc of who might be sitting outside. Ever since I moved back to my home town I look over my shoulder everywhere I go and this just made it worse. I donâ€™t want to do this, I donâ€™t want to feel this. I am so tired of feeling sick and afraid all the time. I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep going. I have therapy today and Iâ€™m even afraid to leave for that now. I just want to fade into a black hole and not come out. My anxiety has been high leading into this week already. I just canâ€™t anymore.
