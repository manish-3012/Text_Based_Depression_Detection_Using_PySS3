The urge to kill myself is stronger than ever.I'm not doing well in university, not understanding half of things and can't concentrate at all. My parents are abusive and have high expectations. I've been dealing with depressive and suicidal thoughts for years. For years I haven't seen a point in life, I don't have much to live for. I'm going to a psychiatrist but it's only once a week and it's definitely not enough. I seriously want to hack at my wrist or jump off a cliff. The urge is so strong.
