I can feel it creeping in againIt frustrates me.
I fill my days with distraction after coping mechanism after distraction. Nothing works. I still find myself staring at my ceiling wishing to try it once more. 
*Maybe this time you'll get it right.* 
I'm sickly excited at the thought of trying it again.
