I need help to support a friend who has lost her way.My friend and me have been best friend since high school and before she just had a snarky atittude and kind of a bully complex but she was nice. then we graduated and I went straight to college. Her mom didnt want her to go because she felt she wasnt ready. I just finished this year and that was a lot to do for myself because I had overbearing parents who neglected me and focused on my sister. I was bullied servely and even sexual harassed to point where I wanted to kill my self. In college I went to thearpy grpup and session and I allowed myself to grow in ways where I can say I am happy with my life. I am even improving my relationship with my parents and sister and I am being more honest with them.

My friend had to drop out and i tried helping her get back to school. I even set up appointments and dates with prospective schools and she didnt show up. She said there was no point. I have supported her and even gave her baby steps to be kind to herself. She is talking to a counselor but I dont think she knows all that is going on. My friend is back in school now but doesnt want to try because I graduated so she doesnt see the point in. She is mostly doing the bare minium and is barely passing. I am trying to help her along the way. 

Our lives are changing since majority of our friends are trying to be adults and better themselves including me. I am learning to love myself more and more and let go of the past. I noticed she is just stagnated and today she dropped the bomb that she was gonna kill herself or other people around her. I am trying to calm her down now but i am not sure what to do.   

She has also spazzed at me for becoming happy but. I dont take it personal really.
