Christmass/birthday aloneI'm turning 27 on the 31st December no family no freinds gonna be alone on christmass and my birthday and have been alone since I turned 20 each year gets more painful depression/loneliness going deeper at this point I'm hardly able to get out of bed or do the very basics in taking care of myself often find myself entering a catatonic state when alone often eating very little or no food for days recently fainted on a bus after not eating for 3 days and altho people got me up and asked if i was good they where all just asking if I wanted to go to a hospital to which I declined knowing why I had fainted I just got off the bus and got food at a reasturant alone it feels like even if i dont kill myself directly it is inevitable that I cant survive alone and I can clearly see that I'm a lost cause socially no one cared when I was healthy and doing good and now I'm hardly a person at that point why keep living I'm stuck suffering endlessly anyways
