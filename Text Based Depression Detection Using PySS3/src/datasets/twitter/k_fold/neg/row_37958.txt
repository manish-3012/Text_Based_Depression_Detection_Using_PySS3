Iâ€™m so sad and lonelyWhy does my wife hate me? The worst part about feeling sad is not being able to explain why. My parents are judgemental so they are no help and my wife is losing her cool with me again. I canâ€™t talk to anyone. No one understands. Maybe I should die! Maybe thatâ€™s the best way. Iâ€™m sorry to sound like Iâ€™m whining, but I am in pain, and it hurts...bad! I thought physical pain would be worse but I hate the pain Iâ€™m feeling now. Why canâ€™t anyone understand?
