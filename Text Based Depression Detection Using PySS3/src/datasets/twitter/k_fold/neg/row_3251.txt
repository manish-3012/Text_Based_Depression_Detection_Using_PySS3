Bucket List?Would it be dumb to make a bucket list before I go?

Iâ€™ve been thinking about it, just packing up a bag of essentials and heading out to complete a short list of things Iâ€™ve always wanted to do before I go. 

The thought of leaving all my debt, my abuse and stress all behind and living out the last few weeks of being here free from it all just sounds great. 

Wish I could do it permanently but everything follows you not matter what.
