I have a good life, why do I wish to end it?First world country, great career, amazing parents, gorgeous and loving (or at least, used to) wife. Yet, for the most of the day I've been researching how do people hang themselves from a doorknob and where can I buy a rope near me (yes, I know I can use belt). Am I just seeking attention? If that's the case, why did I lock myself in a bathroom, sitting here in the bathtub and writing this soapy message? I feel like a fucking daisy princess who hasn't been given enough attention, I feel silly. It is not alright for men to cry, yet I want to. A grown ass man, laying in a bathtub feeling sorry for himself and seeking attention from strangers on the internet. Pathetic sack of shit this sight is me. I used to know this guy who off'd himself by overdosing on narcotics, had a suicide letter and all that. It was sad at the time, but life went on and all his friends don't even mention his name anymore. It is all about getting ahead in life and having an image that you're better than those around you. I think only his mother hasn't gotten over his suicide. I now wonder what was in his letter? I just don't want to put my mother through this.
