I have my first appointment tomorrow...And I am in full blown panic mode. I was filling out the new patient paperwork and there are three questions about suicide. Iâ€™m terrified that if I answer honestly and talk about it theyâ€™ll commit me. I have kids. A husband. How am I supposed to just be like â€œyea. I donâ€™t want to liveâ€ and not be scared? Iâ€™m thinking about just not going. 

My husband is fully aware of whatâ€™s going on with me and is 100% supportive. He told me to do everything I can to NOT get committed.  I honestly donâ€™t know how to do that. Iâ€™m in a REALLY bad place right now. We googled when suicide is committable and it doesnâ€™t look good. I took a (seemingly reputable) test and if Iâ€™m 100% honest, Iâ€™m screwed. High risk of suicide... 70% risk. And itâ€™s how it feels.

I actually do want help, but I canâ€™t just turn my kidâ€™s lives nor my husbandâ€™s life upside down to get it! How do I move forward? I canâ€™t just go to the hospital... I would literally lose everything. If Iâ€™m going to live... I would prefer to still have a house.
