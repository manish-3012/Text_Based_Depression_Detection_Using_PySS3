I'm a pedophile, trying to live a normal life, but as I've grown older I've become less and less attracted to women my own age, now at the point where I have no attraction at all towards appropriately aged women.I'm a male approaching 30, and have not been in a relationship for three years. I try meeting people, but the worrisome thing is I'm no longer attracted to women my age. Even when I do find myself physically attracted to a woman, it's because she has features which resonate with my attraction to children (flat chest, very small/thin, etc), which I then feel guilty about. 

I always thought that maybe my attraction would go away over the years (been this way since I hit puberty), but it seems that it's only getting worse. Even when masturbating, most porn actresses don't get me aroused at all. I've given up porn for the most part in favor of (legal) alternatives that more cater to my interests. I do not look at any illegal materials as I am ethically opposed to them. 

I'm worried that this will only continue to get worse, and in the research I've done I've found no hope of reversing or eliminating my desires. But my concerns for my future are: what if I do find a woman, and then at some point down the road, have a daughter with her? What if I never find a woman and my attraction to children deepens to the point where I eventually feel compelled to act on it? I simply don't see a way out of this, or even a way to improve it. I've gone to therapy for it for years and made no progress.

I feel like there's only one realistic solution to this problem that won't end up hurting anyone innocent.
