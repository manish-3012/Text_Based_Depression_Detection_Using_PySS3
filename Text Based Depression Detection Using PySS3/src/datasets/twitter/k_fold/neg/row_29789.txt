I don't want to go to hellFor the longest time, I have felt completely useless, stupid and like an absolute failure with no future. I can't do public speaking and I am a horrendous critical thinker and writer. I spend most of my time at home, trying to finish my master's thesis, helping out at the family restaurant, or working on my next medical school application after being rejected (for the 4th time). Honestly, I have no idea what I want to do. I am a mediocre researcher and an absolute shame to my field. I am embarrassed by the quality of my work. I am also not fun to be around and my friends have finally cut me loose. I am not invited to hang out, even when I make an effort to reach out. I see everyone else pass me by, while I stay stagnant and have no future prospects. Everything I touch turns to trash or I am too stupid to keep up. I am struggling to put my thesis together because I selected a flawed project, I have written the MCAT 5 times and have no idea what I want in life. While everyone else I know is employed and getting married, and having a good time, I'm alone stupid and a waste of life.

Honestly, I am just so tired of feeling like the stupidest person out there, unable to do anything right. I just want to die, but I do not have the guts to do it. Popping pills is too difficult, carbon monoxide is not a sure thing and a noose is too hard to do with my family at home. Also, as a devout Muslim, suicide means I go to hell. I want to get hit by a truck, get cancer or mugged and killed. I just want this done and over with. I don't want help, just to die.
