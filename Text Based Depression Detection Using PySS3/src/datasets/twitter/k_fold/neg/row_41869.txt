"Fragmented."That's what my therapist described me as.

&amp;#x200B;

No, it doesn't haunt me; no, it doesn't bother me. It actually soothes me, knowing that at least *something* is true amongst the billion different sides of me I "let" people see. I felt it in me, it was time I compiled so many years of fragments that I've kept hidden underneath my skin, it was time I let them finally exist. A feeling akin to the feeling within the dream, the dream of many broken shards of turquoise diamonds, filling my mouth as I'd promptly swallow the mass down: they'll tear my veins open -- I'll do it anyway.

I'm not sure I'm here to be helped. More than that, I enjoy venting. More than that, I enjoy writing. More than that... I feel like I always need *more than that*. I didn't notice much as a child, as I was busy noticing what was well hidden between the lines. I used to make it my hobby. They'd congratulate me on just how much I could notice at once. So I just went... and went... working detail first. Today it really fucks me over, though. My sense of perspective is lousy, and it brought bad anxiety from not foreseeing outcomes. Let's move on from talking about that. I've had my share.

Now, do I feel like suicide? 

Yes and no.

You see, Borderline Personality Disorder, as previously described by a good shrink I once visited, makes me think about suicide as a solution to basically everything. So SuicideWatch, to me, really just should be called "eyes". Jokes aside (excuse my rude coping mechanism), Suicide and I have been living under the same policies for a while now. I think of it as a flatmate. A really shitty one, but I'm the type to ignore it to the best of my human abilities until it's no longer possible so I will now shoot fire from my ass and-

Well. You get the picture. I store it, keep it all bottled up until I get fucked over by it. Let's move on from talking about that, too.

What the hell am I doing here, then?

I honestly... don't know. I can't do much, can I? I'm bored because I'm not getting high nor am I really admitting to my addiction. I'm hopeless because it's 3AM. I'm procrastinating a fucking cigarette. I'm angry at everything. I'm isolating. I haven't been taking care of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I need someone, after all.
