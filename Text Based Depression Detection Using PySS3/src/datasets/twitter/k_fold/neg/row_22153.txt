I don't think I can hang on any longer.I (38m) can't hang on anymore. 
Today has been rough. Possibly about as bad as it's been my entire adult life. And while I don't have it as bad as most people, I'm hanging on by a thread. Time and paycuts at work have things tight with covid going on. And years of depression and anxiety have really been making life hard lately however things have just gotten worse. My partner (common law) decided that we need to move due to some issues with a neighbor. I feel like it's not the best time with finances being tighter to move into a move expensive place. The years of her verbal, emotional and psychological abuse came to a head today when she let lose on me for "ruining her life" because I don't feel like it's a smart idea right now. We have a son who is 2 and a half and another on the way and she insists it's the only way to go. At the end of the day an argument turned into her going nuclear telling me how much she hated me. Yelling and swearing in front of our son, who's so innocent and such a wonderful little boy. He's terrified of her and can't stand to see it happening to me but no matter what she just kept pouring it on. 

I'm sitting with him here now spending some quality time on the couch watching his favorite show and considering this may be the last real time I spend with him. 

Her and I can't be in a relationship anymore but I don't have the famy friends or even financial means to leave. Which leaves me.with no other choice. My unborn child will never know me. And my little guy will not remember me in a few years. 

I know it's my time. I don't see any other way out of all of this and I just don't know how it's going to happen yet. My little boy is my entire life and my reason for getting up every day but I'm just not strong enough to do this anymore. 

So. I guess I'm not sure why I'm here. Some sort of advice I guess? Anything that keeps me going one more day? 

Sorry for the long post.
