Just fvcking kill meBack in October I was kicked out of a apartment because the couple I was living with were moving into a house. I had nowhere to go. I threw away so much shit, I'd never use. During that time, I had no income. Just barely getting by with a little help from dad here and there. But during that time I was so fucking depressed all the time. Sleeping so much, watching porn. Seeing a woman naked isn't the same anymore. Just like meh. But I was staying at my bands studio space. Even though I wasn't supposed too. I would find enough change to pick up peanut butter and bread. That's all I would unless my good friend came and picked me up. We would head to the movies and get free pop and popcorn because we knew the staff. So it was nice to eat something different for once. Plus it was nice to not be alone in a studio room with windows but they are covered for sound damping purposes.. so I would hardly see the light of day unless I went out which was rare during the day. I was lucky to enough to not get kicked out of my band, because I was scared I was. I've never been okay since i graduated high school. I thought of  college but my depression would only get worse because I know I would be made fun of. I don't know, I never went so that could be a lie.. 

But as time went on, I found a job. Then my friends needed a roommate, and I joined them. Everything was okay for awhile but since being isolated for like a month. I feel like I'm back in October again. With no money. No desire to be happy, alone here at the studio. Every fucking day. Sleeping on the couch. Dreaming of my funeral. What I would write to my friends and family. 

Do you ever close your eyes and feel a sensation on your temple? Sometimes I do, I imagine it's a gun being pressed against my head. I'm just waiting patiently for someone to pull that fucking trigger. Just take me out OF MY MISERY
