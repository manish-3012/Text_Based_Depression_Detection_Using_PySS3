I don't want to die but what if I do?I know my own death is mostly out of my control, but I have a specific plan for suicide, and I keep telling myself it's the perfect plan, and I imagine myself doing it: how I would carry it out, how it would feel, my roommates finding my dead body, or accidentally surviving and waking up in the hospital to my mom, having to explain it away as an accident. Then I think about my cat, and how it would hurt my friends, and how I really want to do things right instead of planning a suicide, but I'm so afraid I'm going to impulsively act on it someday, I feel like I have to reassure myself that I won't when I keep talking myself into it again. Am I safe??
