I'm readyThere's this sense of acceptance that comes with actually writing a note. I know how I'm gonna do it. I don't know when, but I imagine I'm not far off. I feel done and ready to go. I still want to write notes to some individuals, but there's the first note there ready, just in case.

I'm a little worried someone I know will find this and try to intervene. I don't know what I'd do if they did. I think one of my friends has this username, but I don't think they'll check it. I don't even know if they actually saw it. 

I'm just tired, and I feel worn out. I can't keep this up, and I think it's better if I go soon, rather than drag this out unnecessarily.

I see all my friends and family going about their life, not knowing how I feel. Drifting past. Gives me hope that they'll be able to get over this without much issue. I don't want to hurt people.

I wish I didn't have to die to make everything stop, but stopping everything is the only thing that can help me. I need to rest.
