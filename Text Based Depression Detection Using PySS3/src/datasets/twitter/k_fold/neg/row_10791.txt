I feel so alone. I just want someone to talk to.I moved a couple hundred miles away from home transferring colleges to play soccer. Since I've arrived I've been playing terribly, I sprained my ankle the third day of preseason now all of my teammates just look at me like I'm a waste of space. I thought my roommates would help me through this, considering we were close beforehand, but of course not. They refuse to keep the room tidy, they won't leave the room to be social, anything necessary for the room they refuse to help me pay for and instead waste their money on useless shit (our mini fridges needed a proper power strip,  they both bought crocs and video game accessories instead), lastly when I try to be helpful they just snap at me and call me a faggot. 

My mother and I have never had a good relationship so it's hard going to her with any of my problems. My girlfriend is great but also a whole new problem all by herself, because I just worry so much about her being back home, so I've just been internalizing everything. Keeping this bottled up fails me whenever a teammate calls me out or I mess up and I find myself fighting back tears. 

I feel like the world is against me, everytime I walk into my dorm I see this hook in the ceiling that I can easily see my lifeless body hanging from. Which becomes more and more tempting everyday, I want my roommates to walk in and see me dead knowing that the way they've treated me was on of the last straws.
