Getting worse and worse..So I made this thread 7 months ago. I described my problem with this girl. Now, 7 months after my thread, I still struggle with the days sometimes. Sometimes I get really sad and will not do anything but stay in my bed. The last week have been what I call for 'Hell Week'. Everytime I woke up, I was like: "F\*ck this sh\*t.. Life isn't worth living with these throughts you got. Go get the robe and end everything right now." A part of me is keeping my away from this, but my throughts about suicide etc. are getting worse and not funny to have.   


My head is not a good place for me. I don't know what this end with. Impossible it will be something good. I am so lost in myself, I don't know what to do anymore. I know that my reason to be depressed/sad is so dumb, but it doesn't change my mood or throughts...

In these 7 months, I have been searching alot on the internet for some help. I have read guides and tried alot to feel better. I have also learned something new about life by doing this. I don't know if this is normal and if it will pass with time. I just feel that 7 months with this mood is a long time. But yeah.. as I said, I am lost in myself right now.
