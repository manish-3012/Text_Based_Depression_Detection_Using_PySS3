TryingI've posted this on r/depression (https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5lvez2/utterly_defeated/) and didn't get any kind of response. I didn't really want to post here but I just want someone to at least pay attention to this.

It's 01:12am right now.

I haven't eaten in 2 days. I smoke two packs a day. The most sleep I've gotten in one night was 4 hours. I get stupid stoned every night. I don't care whether I lose my job after being unemployed for a year. I'm being pressured to live up to certain expectations. I sometimes drink a whole bottle on a week day just to see if that doesn't get me killed. I constantly imagine ways I could die from things i see on my way to work. I feel nothing yet I'm constantly terrified. I crave intimate contact but I always push those away that try and get close to me. I hate that it feels like people think I'm disgusting. Unattractive. No confidence. A burden. I saw a co-worker break down in tears today after hearing her father passed. I wished someone would cry like that for me.

Let me just say I have the job I've been wanting since i graduated in 2012. The people I work with are the best people I've worked with so far. I've made many friends the past 2 years. My artwork has started to become popular on social media. Financially I'm quite stable. I kissed the girl I've liked for a while on New Year's Eve.

Yet it seems there is no point to any of the good or the bad. Nothing matters. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing will save me.

It's time I did something about the pain, so that it's finally over. Whoever reads this, please don't bother to comment anything supportive or encouraging. Save your time on something more meaningful
