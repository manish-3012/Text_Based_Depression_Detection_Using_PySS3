Idk what to do.20, been depressed for over a decade. Managed to embarass myself again the other night and get too drunk, ended up my hurring myself again. Finally got myself a new job and in my final year of uni, weaning off Prozac to try something new, but I'm so full of self loathing, I just feel like I can't do this anymore. I don't want to attempt anything as my friends and family will probably think it's because I don't want to work or something though. Idk what the point of this post is, I'm just feeling hopeless.
