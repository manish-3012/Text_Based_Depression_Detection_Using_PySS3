Scared of my Suicidal ThoughtsI keep getting worse. All I need to do is control myself. But I know where to cut. I've practiced and I know the blades are sharp enough. I don't want to die, but I keep going further and further. I know that sometime in the next few days I'm going to try and kill myself. I have a plan to start TMS treatments. I want to do that. Maybe I'll get better. But I need help now. I need a hospital. I can't wait for the TMS to maybe make me better. But my parents can't afford a hospital again. So I'm just trying to hang on so I can do the TMS. But I don't think I'll be able to. I'm so scared that I'm going to let everyone down. That I'm going to ruin my other arm. But I can't go to a hospital when the next possible solution is right here. Why can't I be okay for just a little bit longer? Why can't I hold it together? I don't know what to do.
