I've always known this is how it endsI've known for as long as I could remember that one day I would kill myself i didn't know when but ever since I was a child I knew it was coming for most of my childhood i always figured it would happen when i was older i figured i would be like 50 or 60 and maybe older no idea what would cause it to need to be done but I've always known and honestly I cant keep going I'm 27 with no future and what really makes me sad is I'm undateable I've not had sex in 10years I dont even really car about that it's the human connection i so desperately crave but i know that not everyone wins in life but why can I not have a little win
