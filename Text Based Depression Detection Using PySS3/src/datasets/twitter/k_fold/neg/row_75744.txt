No idea where to turn, saw it coming for years, need adviceI'm 19, finished a year at a small college and while I was there became extremely paranoid (delusions, or voices which occurred during weed phase of 1st semester) with mood swings and out of body experiences that left me cowering in my room and everyone noticed and I cannot go back, it is currently 2:10am and my sleep schedule has completely turned around to avoid my family as much as possible. I used to be the golden daughter child but now my mother keeps insinuating that I should move out, my father for some reason really cares about me, I hate that he does, and I have self pitied and failed as much as possible because perfection was how I was raised to work towards and I avoid everything from fear since very young.

Its extremely confusing because my parents invest huge amounts of time helping me out, they just don't know how to parent well, I feel like a curse, a burden, a reminder of their issues, an extension of themselves. I feel dysfunctional and depressed beyond the capability to ever move on, and have had suicidal thoughts since middle school, I expected extreme terror at the idea of having absolutely no one who I genuinely care about and who supports me but now it is a dull roar and there is comfort in the realization that there is an impenetrable wall that separates me from the miniscule potential for a future, and that I could kill myself at any moment, there is nothing left because I dont know how to function and interact with people normally because I have been isolated since early childhood, its a huge mystery, don't care for people all that much and I don't fantasize about finding a genuine connection anymore. 

I did poorly in college and now have a shitty GPA, I need to somehow move out of my parents house very soon, I still get very very paranoid and scared of people (including parents, there is a distinct possibility my mother is trying to poison me), never have trusted anyone, but I'm 'only 19' and life could get better but I have absolutely no idea how it could happen, I don't think I could focus enough in college and work on research projects to get into grad school because of my continuously shitty mental health, feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel that I have always (always) walked through and it has become almost impossible to breath. But enough with the dramatics, how the fuck can I move out, change schools, stop my parents from sending me to this internship that lasts 1.5 months, interact with people when I want nothing more than to smoke weed and starve in the woods (not plan, not actively suicidal). I'll probably delete this in a few hours because I get really strong suspicions of conspiracy paranoid theories, and I hate getting responses because I guess on some deeper level I don't want to change, rather drag myself into the ground out of self hatred and hopelessness, I'm not going to become a pity sob disgusting piece of filth, alive and taking resources and cursing the illustrious family name, I WILL stop procrastinating and make a decision.
