IdkIdk what to do anymore. I have so many problems. I just had an emotional breakdown right before I was supposed to go to work. My mom is flipping shit at me. I think I just had some kind of stroke. My mom doesn't believe me. She's mad at me for crying. She always gets mad at me when I'm sad. Maybe sometimes I just want a hug. I don't want to be yelled at. 
I have depression and anxiety. General anxiety and social anxiety. I'm not on any meds and I'm not going to therapy anymore. I keep asking to go again but my mom won't get me another one. I'd drive but she won't let me get my license. I'm almost 18 btw. I want to leave this house for good but I have no friends to stay with. No one talks to me. I don't know what to do. Al I want is to be happy. That's all I've ever wanted. I don't want to live anymore but I don't want to kill myself, but sometimes I fee like I don't have a choice.
This has been going on for so long I'm just getting so sick of it.
I'm late for work. I don't think in going in today. I don't think I can handle it. I'm too afraid to call.
My life is so screwed.
Any advice?
