HereI don't know if this is permitted, but I just want to let people know that I'm here, that someone is here.  I know I don't mean much, but I'm a real person, and I care about you.  I've been through some shit, like everyone in this subreddit. I've tried to off myself on more than one occasion.  But, I've found what I needed to make me hang in there.  And if I can help someone else find that, I'd be very happy.  At the very least, if I can give you someone to talk to until you find the thing that makes you happy, I'll be here. 

If this post is against rules, I apologize.  If not, just know you're not alone. We're all here for you.
