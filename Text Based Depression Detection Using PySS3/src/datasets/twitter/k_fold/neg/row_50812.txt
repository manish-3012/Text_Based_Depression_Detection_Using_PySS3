I donâ€™t want to sleep at night because I donâ€™t want to see another day tomorrowEvery time Iâ€™m tired I always try and stay up because I feel like Iâ€™ve never done anything, Iâ€™ve never done enough during the day, I donâ€™t want to start the new day tomorrow because I feel like Iâ€™m so far behind I donâ€™t want to be another day behind on life. Everyone has their shit together and Iâ€™m so lost and confused Iâ€™m just burying myself deeper each day and I hate it.
