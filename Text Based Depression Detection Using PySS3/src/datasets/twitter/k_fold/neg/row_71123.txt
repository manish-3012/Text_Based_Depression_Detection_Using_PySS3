SolitudePeople often become suicidal because they are stressed.  Fight or flight.  Make them wait or distract them and the biochemical response will wane.  

I am entirely sober of that when I say I donâ€™t want to be here.  I donâ€™t want to be alive.  I have nothing to live for.  There is nothing I want.  I no longer have any aspirations.  I tried, I struggled, I did not succeed.  I alienated everyone, I chose the wrong paths, the damage is irreversible, and everything just is.  That is my closure.  My story is closed.  I have no interest in continuing.
