i just want it to endi've been depressed and kinda suicidal for about half my life, but now i'm also heartbroken, and i just want out. I can't even get myself to want to get better anymore, i just waste day after day trying to distract me from everything so i don't have any time to think, until i'm finally so tired that i can instantly fall asleep. Why can't i just be free to kill myself, why do other people have to care?
