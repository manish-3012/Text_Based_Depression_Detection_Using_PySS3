Whats the point anymoreHello.

I taking 20mg celexa per day. A few days ago I paid off all my debts so I now owe  nothing to anyone.

But I didn't become happy like I thought I would. I still feel like shit most days, or most of the time I'm numb from emotions, I really just don't care about anything anymore.

I used to take Zoloft 100mg a day and over 3 months I eventually came to the point of actively trying half assed attempts to kill myself with the light cord in the bathroom, and got pissed off that it didn't work so I took out my anger on the bedroom cupboard, one of those ikea ones with the glass mirror.

Blood from my hands everywhere. I smashed it all into pieces but didn't realise what I was doing until my wife came running in and pinned me down to stop me.

So anyway, I'm still emotion less and a few days ago I became stressed at work and while driving I got urges to drive myself into death. I was trying to see which would be the best brick wall or lamp post or something but I was really looking forward to playing some more animal crossing later on in the day so I just didn't do it I guess.

I feel like there's no escape. One of these days I'm gonna die, unless someone can help me.
