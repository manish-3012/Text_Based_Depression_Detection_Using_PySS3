It's not just a permanent solution to a temporary problemI am diagnosed with a personality disorder, I won't specify which. But the sources of all my problems to date has had to do with my personality disorder. Once a personality has formed, I'm 28 which means my brain has fully developed, there is no fix or change. I am going to be permanently like this, meaning my temporary problem will always be permanent. My life is worthless and empty like me, I stopped caring a long time ago. The only thing I can think these days is I want to die. Overall I feel nothing, but when I say it like a mantra I feel happiness flow out of me. All I want to do is die, and I won't change that based on some subreddit but I just want to be clear that this is the best choice for my situation.
