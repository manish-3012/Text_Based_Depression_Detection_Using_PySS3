i want to self harm againi want to cut so badly but i cant because i was supposed to not do that anymore

i usually strangle myself now as a form of self injury but it doesnt give you the same feeling

im so dissociated ive been so dissociated for so fucking long its like im in a delusion or illusion where everything is fucking fake and i hate when i tell specific people this and theyre like "lmao ME TOO XDDD" like fuck off you have no idea whats its like to feel like youre not fucking real and everything is a dream and every living moment is just complete disorientation like you have no fucking clue what it feels like to be constantly wondering if the people you see on a daily basis are even fucking there fuck off

i want to kill myself i want to kill myself so fucking bad but i cant even do that right now because unfortunately i care about my family and my brother already might kill himself and i dont want my mom to go through two so i'll have to move far away and cut contact so it would be easier for me 

i hope one day someone just shoots me in the head from behind and i dont even feel a thing, maybe a murder or an accident would be easier than a suicide
