Being rejected hurts a lot This is kinda long. Sorry. 


    
     I'm in high school. I have a semi-medium sized friend group, but I think they all just hate me. Before now, it's just been little subtleties I sometimes noticed  that could've meant nothing. But now one of my friends is having a party, and I was specifically not invited. They tried to whisper about it, but I still heard. I felt so crushed the whole day. On top of that, two of my closest friends are just completely shutting me out of our little subgroup. They didn't talk to me at all during class today even when I tried to talk to them. They seem so much closer to each other and I feel like an outcast. I wish it was easy for me to share affection so easily like they do.


     I think I'm just annoying. I guess I'd understand why everyone hates me. Even though it might be worse to have no friends period, I feel even more rejected like this because it's like they're just tolerating me, or even below that, secretly hating me and talking behind my back. When we all first became friends, we were so nice and we all hung out. I really felt like I was finally worth something to someone. I was stupid to think they cared about me. Putting all of my feelings into them was a dumb mistake. I crave for people's attention and approval, and they all just make me feel horrible about myself. 


     
     Considering suicide over things like this makes me feel even more childish and unloveable. I feel like a brat because I'm essentially upset that people don't like me. I wouldn't like me either, so I'm not sure why I'm blaming them. It just hurts to have it proven to me that I am extremely pathetic for continuing to be their friends. I couldn't ever be by myself because I'm that dependent. I wish I was well-loved, even by one friend. I feel that I have so much love to give, but I'm not good enough for anyone to want to do the same and love me just the same. 



Thanks for reading this.
