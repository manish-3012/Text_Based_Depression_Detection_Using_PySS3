Everything is just too hard.Iâ€™m so lost. Iâ€™m not myself anymore, long story short I was driving and had a medical emergency. Police pulled me over thinking I was drunk or high. Charged me with an owi. Was r drinking and urine screen came back positive with benzos, no surprise I take them everyday for anxiety. Iâ€™m a teacher, I lost my job because of this, not so much the owi but the child endangerment charge because my 5 month old daughter was in the car. All I ever wanted was to teach and help kids. Now Iâ€™m being investigated by DHS for child endangerment and possibly will have to do jail time if this doesnâ€™t get dismissed. I went to the hospital the morning after being arrested ( because they didnâ€™t take me to the ER)  and my blood Pressure was 77/32, which is super low. I was passing in and out of consciousness. The doctor said that low bp can cause dizziness, loss of consciousness and inability to speak normally. 
I had preeclampsia when I had my daughter so they put me on medication to lower my blood pressure. I guess it started to even out on its own and then add the medication on top of it, it got super low. The urine screen at the hospital didnâ€™t show any drugs in my system, it was taken about 10 hours after the one at the police station. I have a lawyer and heâ€™s trying to get it dismissed, but the county attorney wonâ€™t. 

I have never even gotten more than a speeding ticket and am such a rule follower. I was already battling bad PPD and then this happened. I feel like thereâ€™s no point in staying alive if Iâ€™m only going to cause more trouble for my family. I donâ€™t want to cause emotional damage to my baby girl, I love her so much. Iâ€™ve already written
My suicide letters. I just donâ€™t know how to end it. I guess Iâ€™m scared. But I also donâ€™t want to do it at home. I donâ€™t want my husband to have to find me. Please someone tell me that Iâ€™m not alone in feeling this way.
