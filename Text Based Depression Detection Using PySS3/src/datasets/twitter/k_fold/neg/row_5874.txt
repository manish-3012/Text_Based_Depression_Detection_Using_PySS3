Is suicide ever a correct awnser?I'm a 5th year Junior at a university. I won't have my undergrad for another two.

I have no friends, none, zero. At least none who I hang out with.

Recently I get some stimulation by trolling and pretending to be a trump supporter. Look at my history, I'm a piece of shit.

I have OCD, panic disorder, depression, ADHD and Asperger's. I'm mentally fucked. 

If I didnt have a girlfriend and family I would already be in the sweet void of silence. I won't do it because I don't want to ruin their lives too. But every day I imagine it.
