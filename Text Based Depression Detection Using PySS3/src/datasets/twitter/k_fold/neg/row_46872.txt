Real closeI have recently fucked up everything I used to value in my life.
I think about suicide all the time, have dreams about it all the time, and regularly have to refrain from crashing my car while going 100 on the freeway.
Clearly there are things holding me back (reasons I havenâ€™t done it yet). I have a few good friends left that I care about, and my brother &amp; sister, but there are so many more reasons I want to die than live.
Mostly I just donâ€™t have the energy or the desire to do anything in life anymore. I fucking hate waking up. And it doesnâ€™t help that this past year has been a fucking shitstorm for me.  A whole mess
