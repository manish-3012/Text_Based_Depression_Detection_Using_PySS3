whoâ€™s having it worse?sometimes i scroll through posts on my home page and see so many people going through stuff i canâ€™t even imagine myself going through. i know everyoneâ€™s story is different and everyone has their own battles but i canâ€™t help but think, if someone out there has it worse, then why should i rant about my problems. why should i seek help when i know there are people in worse situations than im in. sometimes i want to just rant on here about all the things that have caused me so much pain but then i remembered that my problems donâ€™t weigh as much as many other peopleâ€™s. i donâ€™t even know what the point of this post was. just something no one will see.
