I want to die but I can't do itI have nothing to live for; no friends, many enemies and I'm a disappointment to my family. I'm a social outcast without a future and I still can't bring myself to do it because of what a coward I am. I fantasise of people loving me and being famous for standing in the face of danger and being super confident with myself. However, I could never be this. I freeze at the thought of pain. I'm such a coward I can't even bring myself to give myself the pain I deserve. I've done stupid things only a coward would do. I've betrayed so many people without them knowing, I physically can't look anyone in the eye anymore. I'm a disappointment a coward and, most of all, a horrible person and I want to make it up to everyone by taking my own life but I can't. I hate everyone and everything and yet I can't leave it all.
