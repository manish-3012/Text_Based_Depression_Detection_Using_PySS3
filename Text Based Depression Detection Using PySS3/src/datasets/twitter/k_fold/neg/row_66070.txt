Advice on how to help someone who is suicidal, but does not want to not feel soHi. I have a friend who has frequent thoughts of suicide and talks about it often. She doesnâ€™t have any current plan but has attempted once before. She has a therapist and other friends and family. From our conversations, it seems like she wants to feel less depressed, but is not particularly motivated to plan for safety or recognize when she is spiraling. She does not use the safety plan that her therapist and she worked on. How can I help her? Is it pushy to keep asking her to refer to her plan every time she tells me about her thoughts? I am worried that she will escalate quickly. Iâ€™m so confused on how to help her since she doesnâ€™t want to die but also doesnâ€™t want to do any of the things that will keep her safe.
