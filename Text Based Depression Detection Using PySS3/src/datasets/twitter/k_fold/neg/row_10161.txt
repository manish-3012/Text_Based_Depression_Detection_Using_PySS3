Got â€˜EmEveryone is convinced iâ€™m doing well, nobody knows whatâ€™s about to happen. Iâ€™m also pushing everyone aside so no one will really be that upset. 

Hopefully this way my image in everyoneâ€™s mind isnâ€™t totally soiled. 

I even saw my brother in a different country, in person, and was able to give him what i believe to be one last hug. 

The day is approaching, closer and closer.
