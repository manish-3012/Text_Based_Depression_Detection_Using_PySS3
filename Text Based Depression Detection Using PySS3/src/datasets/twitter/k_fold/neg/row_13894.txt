How quickly do you go from normal to suicidal if you forget your medication? I'm crazy fast.I get scared to forget my pills sometimes, because of how fast I want to die. I forgot mine this morning and I immediately realized as I was coming home that I wanted to drive into a tree. All these ideas and impulses snapped in only 8 hours away from my normal pill time. How the fuck does that even work? I know I won't die tonight because I know when I remember to take my pill tomorrow it will be better, but holy shit I want to die so badly for almost no reason at all.
That's the funny thing about this depression. I know nothing is *really* that bad. I'm not a piece of shit, or even a failure. But I go Un-medicated for one day and all of a sudden I know I'm the worst person ever and I need to erase myself. 
Why did this have to be me?
