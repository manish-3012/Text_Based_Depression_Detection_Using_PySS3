I wish I could make everything in my life go away...I'm sick and tired of living. I'm only 13 years old. I'm failing my classes and I'm too lazy to do my work. I'm afraid of what people think of me, so I don't talk to people in school. I don't want to be hated. Recently, I've been thinking that everyone in my class hates me. A kid and his friend were joking about how his friend has to be partners with me, and the kid smirked. Of course, it wouldn't sound bad to you, or to them, but it really hurts to have someone not want to talk to you. 
I've been feeling depressed all year. The work piles up, and doesn't go away. I haven't told my parents yet, I'm afraid I'll upset them and I don't want to put them through the stress. I just want to kill myself, I think I'd either sit in warm water and use one of my razor blades to cut open my wrists, or hang myself. Nothing is getting better, I don't give a crap about anything in school. I don't even act scared when I know I failed a test and the teacher gives it back. An A and a D gets the same reaction from me. What should I do? I don't want to talk to my guidance counselor, they'd just tell my parents.
