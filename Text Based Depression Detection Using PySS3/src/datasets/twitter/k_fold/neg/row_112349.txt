Lets see if we can show them what it feels likeOkay so for those of you who've had a chance to enjoy the few poems ive posted i am happy you're here. Let me tell you all how you've saved my life. I just recently made my reddit account i spent all my life being ingnored and unseen and just a constant feeling of emptiness and regret and just lost all together but being here for 5 days whether you all took the time to comment or not you read my feelings and for a second a few ppl around the world felt my pain and maybe even connected with me. So i got an idea. I am going to take it a step further by starting a youtube channel and reading my poetry to the instrumentals i use to inspire them. Now in no way do i make beats or own any of the music used but i think maybe if you all could hear it exactly how i want it to be put out you would feel it even more than before and it might open the eyes of others who dont feel haunted by depression and self hate to kinda understand where we stand or how things feel from our perspective i truly hope this helps at least one person i do not have any videos yet just bought a camera ( 5minutes ago on amazon) so videos coming soon. The whole goal is to make ppl feel less alone in whatever situation they're in and to also help family members and loved ones get a chance to see what a disease you cant see physically can do to a person. So plz stop by LOSTSOULS9318 And subscribe early on youtube or just check back in next week and i will soon give you my inner thoughts out loud. I also hope that if this works out that those of you afraid to speak your own feelings can send me your poetry or last letters to be read to the audience and you can see the kinds of responses you get form supportive ppl all over the world just as lost as the next.
