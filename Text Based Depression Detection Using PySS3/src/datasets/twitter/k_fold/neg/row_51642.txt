I feel so lost, im just so tired.Hi everyone..i hope its okay if i just speak my mind for a bit. Im 19 years old, im from england, but i live here in sweden to study..when i was around 14 years old my obsessive compulsive disorder really came to the surface, by 15 i had been diagnosed with depression, ocd, and generalised anxiety disorder, since then i cannot remember a day when i havent been worrying or sad or upset about something, craving medication to take away or numb the anxiety and sadness. Now im here at university, somehow, god knows how i managed to scrape past school, and against the wishes of my family and therapist, i came here to Sweden..ive been here a year. i thought moving here would help me escape all my old problems, but they just followed me here. i have no real friends here, i only go to lectures, i spend so much time in my bedroom, doing nothing. even when i feel like ive recovered from one anxiety, another one comes along, now im freaking out that ive been sleep walking a few nights ago, and im worried ive sent a snapchat during sleepwalking, as well as browsing the internet, obviously i cant tell because of the nature of snapchat...ive upset and hurt myself so much more than anyone else ever has, why has this happened to me, what did i do to deserve this? ive had thoughts about suicide, but im too scared of death to even think about doing it, but life aint much better either..does it ever get better? im so tired.
