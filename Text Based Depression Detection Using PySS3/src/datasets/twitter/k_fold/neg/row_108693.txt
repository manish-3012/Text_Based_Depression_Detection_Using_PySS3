I cant take this anymore the girl I love is tearing me apartWe havenâ€™t talked in two years and I fucked up our friendship by telling her I love her but now she hates me and I miss her more than anything. I havenâ€™t been happy since I was friends with her and I think about her every moment of every day even though I try to distract myself. I hate myself for ruining our friendship and it hurts too much to live without her
