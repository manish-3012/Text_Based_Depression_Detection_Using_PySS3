i was readythis morning i woke up to a text from my ex saying her decision was final and we wouldnâ€™t be together. she meant the whole world to me. i thought i was her world. my heart hurt so fucking much i wouldnâ€™t wish it on anyone. i was ready. i showered for the first time in days, dressed nice,   hugged my brother, threw a handle of gin in my bag, and walked to the bank for cash. i texted around for benzos, yet no one had any on them. the plan was to go to the lake spot near my house, sit down, and take as much as i could stomach. no one had anything for me. i was angry and upset. i could feel myself wanting it more than anything but at the same time dreading the pain iâ€™d put everyone through. i didnâ€™t want to go, but i didnt want to go through the pain anymore. i donâ€™t know what to do. i donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
