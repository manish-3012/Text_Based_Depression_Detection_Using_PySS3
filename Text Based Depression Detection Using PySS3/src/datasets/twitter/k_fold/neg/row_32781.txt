Having a really bad daySo here I am again, I can't seem to just get out of this hole, this has been going on for years and I just can't beat it. I'm sitting at work crying because I'm so upset. My girlfriend has been distant with me lately and i'm afraid she doesn't love me anymore. I love her so much and don't want to lose her. I also really hate my job, and coming here makes me so much more depressed. It's like the days drag on for so long, but when I finally get to go home and have some peace, the time goes by so quick and i'm right back at work again. I want to do more with my  life, but I don't feel like I can, I just want to be happy, or I want an easy way out. I'm so tired of this.
