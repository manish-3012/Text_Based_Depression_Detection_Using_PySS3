Really desperately need helpI'm totally alone, I'm going to be homeless soon, everything I've worked for in my life is hopeless. I've already been to a hospital, they provided no treatment. I haven't seen a single friend in a month because I do t really have any anymore.

I can't keep doing this, but I have no where to turn to. HELP
