I'm at the end of my tether...I managed to purchase some KCN....I'm at work and can't stop crying. I'm a thirty year old failure at life. I have so few skills I can't even volunteer overseas.

I just want to end it, and I have the means...the fear of hell (I'm atheist) keeps me locked here...I guess you can't deprogram years of childhood indoctrination.

I'm at the end, I can't bear to see people try to help anymore, I don't want to go to school because I know I'll fail or quit just like everything else. All the men in my life have stolen, cheated and abused me.

I just want to opt out, why can't I just opt out???
