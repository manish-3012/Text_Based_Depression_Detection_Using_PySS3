Tonightâ€™s the night Iâ€™m going to be successful.Iâ€™ve made up my mind, tonight I will hang myself. After realizing Iâ€™m completely alone, I see no point in going on and suffering any further. Iâ€™ve written my suicide note and made a playlist for my funeral songs. 

Going on is pointless when I pray that I stop breathing every single day.
