What do I do if I don't want to live for money? I feel like the only escape from the system is suicide..I don't want to live a meaningless life, but I feel like I've been dealt bad cards. If I'm never going to going to find that state of happiness, then what's the point in living? 

Logically, why should I not kill myself?
