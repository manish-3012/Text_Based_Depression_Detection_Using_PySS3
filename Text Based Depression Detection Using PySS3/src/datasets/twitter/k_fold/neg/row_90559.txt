I don't know anymoreI don't know why I am like this. I think about suicide everyday and it is getting more often and louder. I searched on how to extract cyanide from apricot pits and helium bags and things that will get you a painless death. 

I don't think my life is hard. It is satisfactory even. I don't have any problem financially and I lived a good life. My parents are supportive though a lil bit conservative. I have a live that lots of people wanted.

Why do I want to die? It has been almost 7 years since this thought started and it never go away. I cried without reason and I don't think i am stressed because of studies and all. Covid doesn't really affect me, maybe it even makes me happier as my chance on dying is higher when i get it. I don't get the covid. Weird. I even tried to go out more and then tested for it. Negative. 

I am almost 20. I still have a lot of things waiting for me i know. People see me as a preety cheerful and chill person. I don't think they will expect me to commit suicide. 

Maybe after I'm done with college, i will do it? Maybe june. Maybe when I'm already gone back to my country. At least after I make sure my guinea pig is in a safe environment and adopted by a good person. Maybe he will be happier there than when he is with me.

I want to die. I don't know why. I just want to. Really really want to.

Good thing I'm afraid of pain haha.
