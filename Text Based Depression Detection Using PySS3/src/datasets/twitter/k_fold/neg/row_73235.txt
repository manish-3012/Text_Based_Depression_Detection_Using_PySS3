Is what I'm suffering from just apathy or...?I've recently just come across a thought in my head and the contemplation of it is leaving me rather confused... I used to be a really depressed guy (and actually suicidal) until I met a great group of friends who I saw everyday at college, yet at the same time I never really talked to then as much as I would've liked. I still had episodes where I fell back into my old self but overall I generally improved. Fast forward to a year after college finished and stuff has changed somewhat. We're all (20~ of us) in a group chat that is constantly talking and yet every interaction I have feels empty and unfulfilling. I never talk to anyone outside of the group chat and find myself unable to do so (anxiety mainly), which leads me to thinking more than I should.

Anyway, my problem is that I have just stopped caring. I still care about the wellbeing of my friends and family but I just literally don't care about myself. I lead a mundane life and literally just started thinking about how I want to die. But I'm not depressed like how I used to be so I don't understand why. Truth be told, I'm not thinking about committing suicide (Not yet, anyway) but I can't help but think about how I don't want to live. I think the general loneliness and everything else that goes on has just lead me to want to cut out the middle man and not waste my time on this planet doing nothing of worth. I'm not even upset, I literally just think that I'm wasting my time meandering along in life not doing anything and at the same time don't want to do anything to change it because of how worthless everything feels. I'm so confused, I don't even know what to think right now... So... Any advice? Am I just jaded before my time or what?

(Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit for this or if what I feel isn't worth talking about, just need to get this off my chest because bringing it up to someone in real life would feel wrong)
