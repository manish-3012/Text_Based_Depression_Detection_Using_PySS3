:(I want to be perfect,fit and beautiful. I hate myself for being ugly. I wish i could make a plastic surgery,but Iâ€™m not 18 years old or more. I just wanna kill myself, and this is not the only reason.I am scapegoat, bc I have problems to make friends, i am always aggressive.... its so hard to change yourself. I am still cutting myself. I am burden.
