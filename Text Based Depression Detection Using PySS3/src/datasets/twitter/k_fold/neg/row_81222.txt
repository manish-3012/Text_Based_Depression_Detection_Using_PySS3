I feel worthlessWhere to start...
Where to start...

I need help with my self-esteem as it horribly low. I've always hated the way I am and how I look but since I'm starting to reach the 26 with no dating experience it's starting to truly terrify me. I don't want to end up alone.

First off I'm a 5'2", skinnyfat male, that's balding and has a tiny dick. Not the type of guy girls swoone about. But that I can accept, people have to preferences, so have I. What I find so difficult about it is just the way the world seems to glorify everything what I'm not. Don't get me wrong I have job, I'm studying in the evening, but it's still not.

Why I have this, I don't know, but I probably think it's because of over-protective parents and bullying during childhood. Add to this that I wasted a lot of time playing videogames et voila, you have me. Thing is I just want to love myself, or at the very least accept how I am.

I want to exude confidence, but also assertiveness as I feel I'm too much of an pushover. But I just don't know how to start or what to do. It's so easy looking at popular media and seeing what people what and comparing myself with that. I just want to stop worrying about other peoples opinions and start living my own goddamn life.

I just don't know where to start and what I must do.
