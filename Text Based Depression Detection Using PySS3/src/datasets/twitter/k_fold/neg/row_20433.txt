Sometimes it seems nobody caresIs it just me, or did it seem like people used to give a shit? I understand that everyone's got lives to live and whatnot, but what I don't get is how people can regard suicidal thoughts and depression with the same indifference as the temperature of a room. In a way it's almost worse when people do care, because then you hear bullshit like, "Just be cheerful!" or "You're as happy as you decide to be!" Like people choose to be depressed. They think it's just some switch you can flip on or off, and they're ignorant of how hard you're actually trying. "Hey, I didn't lay in bed all day hating myself, can you give me some credit?" 

I don't know. I was hospitalized over a decade ago (I got in an accident, I didn't make an attempt at my life) and the nurses told me I had a prayer list of forty people or more. That made me feel good, people happy that I still existed. I know there are people that care about me, but it just feels so indescribably lonely sometimes. Like the only way for people to take you seriously is if you're about to do something to yourself. I never have and as far as I can tell I never will, but it sucks having these thoughts swimming in your head and no one giving a shit.
