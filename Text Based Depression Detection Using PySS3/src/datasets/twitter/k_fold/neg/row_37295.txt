Where to go when all hotlines are busy?I had a crap day. I don't know i want to sleep and have nightmares or stay awake and dread the next day. I los my badge i need to work and i'm too scared to admit i lost it. I want to die. Here are my reasons I want to die:

* The case with losing my badge
* The case with the reoccuring nightmares
* My idiot writing style and ocd to pu things in lists
* This depression that causes physical pain
* I have a degree in comp. sci. but everything's so competitive I go mad
* General lack of direcion in my life
* Suicide hotlines are constantly busy
* I feel like crap even when trying to implement "healthy" habits
* I'm a parasite to society

I want to die but I don't. Please make the anxiety end.
