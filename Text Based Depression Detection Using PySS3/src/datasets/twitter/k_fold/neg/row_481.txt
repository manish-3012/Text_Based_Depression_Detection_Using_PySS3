Dear reddit, after taking a look at my life I realized that I have no-one to talk to.and that I was instead the one others come to for solace and comfort so now that I need that, there are none who are willing to offer it.

I have nobody, not even the person who shares mutual love with me wishes to spend some time with me and at least hear me out now because of my mood.

Speaking of moods, I'm in a fairly dangerous one. Not for others, mind you, I don't believe in harming other people for no good reason. My mood is hazardous to my own health.

Most days I'm suicidal anyway but most days I have some level of hesitation or disinterest in death and serious issues with pain. Today I find myself quite lacking in caution, self-preservation instinct, and the ability to care whether or not I live or die.

On top of all this I have work in about 1 1/2 hours and I'm not even sure I can make it all the way there without dying spectacularly.


EDIT: Oh right, lest we forget, the biggest reason I can't talk to anyone is because they're all as messed up as I am and adding to their worries will only cause more of a headache for me and is exactly the same as adding to my own problems, especially if I decide to stick around. It's a crappy loop that screws me over time.
