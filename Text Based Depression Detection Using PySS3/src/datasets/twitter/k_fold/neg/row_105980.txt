Iâ€™m surprised I havenâ€™t killed myself yet...I donâ€™t want to be alive. But I havenâ€™t done it (suicide.) I donâ€™t know what to do. I keep thinking I will...but I donâ€™t. Iâ€™m scared? Almost do it. Iâ€™m being so reckless. Iâ€™m trying to die...but I canâ€™t take the pain. This is such torment. Help me die?
