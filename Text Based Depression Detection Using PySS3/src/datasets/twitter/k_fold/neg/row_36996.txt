I try, desperately...To make amends, to not hold grudges, to be the perfect person. I tried to ignore my foolish heart, but I am overwhelmed with this unshakable loneliness. And for every iota of light that dwells on me, I acknowledge that my shadow is greater, it casts of me a version greater than myself; it overtakes me. I am haunted by nightmares of you.
