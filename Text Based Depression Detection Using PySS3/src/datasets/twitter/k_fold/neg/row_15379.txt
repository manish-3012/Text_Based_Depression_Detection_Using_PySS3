wrote my suicide note, and am actually going through with it right now as I type this out.Hey guys, I thought I might just say thanks while I'm waiting for the end to come. It's been tough. I looked forward everyday to seeing each of your comments and posts. I'm sorry if I didn't get to you, or your heartfelt posts left me speechless. I'm sorry if I didn't leave anything for you. I loved this sub while it lasted. I am spending the last moments of my life typing this out, and playing a cherished childhood favourite game, Amplitude by Harmonix. I wish I could stop crying, but I can't, too happy, too tired to stop it, too sad to end my crying.

I'm ending my life right now, btw swallowing 250 tabs of Advil gets harder the more you swallow. It's like your body knows what's up and then says "nooo, I don't want anymore" but then you tell it to fuck off that you are in control and you swallow some more. 

good night all, and good luck in your endeavours no matter what they may be.
