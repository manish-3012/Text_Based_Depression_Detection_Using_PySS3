Why do I feel like I'm being used as a joke for someone's entertainment?Being told "tomorrow" for the fifth time in a row, makes me lose the little faith I had. I feel as if the only reason people still talk to me is for their own entertainment, or they want something from me. Feeling empty inside can no loner describe how I feel because when you feel empty, you still feel something at least. There is no reason to blow me off without ever mentioning why or even responding. I'm done and I don't know if I'll ever be back.
