Tonight is the endWell chaps, this is it. I've beel following this subreddit for almost a month now. Hoping I would find an answer here. But the only thing I found is that pain amd misery are universal. Probably no one will read this but I guess I wamt to leave my story written dowm before I go. I was sexually and physically abused for years, since I was a kid. I lost my best friend to suicide years ago, I now live alone after my father kicked me out for reaching for help a year ago. I'm in a foreign country, alone, and broke. I thought things may get better, that maybe I'll fimd someone that understood how I was feeling. But unfortunately it didn't happen. Tonight I will hang myself, I will do it un public, I want to at least get a petty revenge on all the people that ignored my cries for help. I know it's a pretty awful thing, but I wamt my parents to suffer knowing that it's their fault. Hopefully there isn't an afterlife, but if there is maybe I'll have the chance to see her again. Goodbye people, hope that you'll get better and make it for the rest of us that didn't.
