Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m going to end it Iâ€™ve practiced and I can tighten it enough. My last practice run my vision went black, I felt all the pressure run to my head like it was going to explode I couldnâ€™t hear. So now I am ready I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this, Iâ€™m not doing it for attention I just wanted some way to say goodbye
