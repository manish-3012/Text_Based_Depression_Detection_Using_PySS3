Fuck life I didnâ€™t ask to be born, not like thisIâ€™m so mad at life 
You know what? I hate how people falsely give you support but they donâ€™t care about you at all. I jist turned 18, got my driverâ€™s license yesteeday and all I feel is sadness. All my former classmates live their lives, they date, go out, have fun and all I do is sit home because Iâ€™m not worth being invited anywhere, my â€œfriendsâ€ are like we love you we donâ€™t want you to die bla bla bla but then when was the last time they asked me how Iâ€™m doing? Iâ€™m always the one that texts first, all I see are their ig posts about how they went somewhere with someone, also Iâ€™d like to have a boyfriend but Iâ€™m just pure ugly 
Iâ€™m so mad that people around me are happy (I know that, not just from ig posts) and Iâ€™m here and I feel like throwing up because crying is not enough to vent all the feelings inside me
