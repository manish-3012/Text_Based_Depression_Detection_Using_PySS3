And update from me... things are not better, but I have more hope, somehow.I posted this, about 2 months ago:

In short, my life is in a shit hole, and my only hope for my business was a contract I was then negotiating.

That negotiation failed. They are not choosing someone else, they are abandoning the project.

**My company is doomed.**

*My professional life is currently a complete failure.*

But the hope is that in the last 5 weeks, I have been applying to jobs, and I have 3 possible leads where I am in the final round of selection.

Sure, I have no way of knowing if I will get any of those 3 jobs (or any of those still in the first phase).

Apparently, my resume is better than I thought!

I did sprain my wrist... and my ankle... just moving a box 2 weeks ago of clothes to donate. My ankle is healing, my wrist isn't that much.

I did talk to tough as nail social worker. He thinks the job search is a step in the right direction. He thinks that getting job satisfaction could help me heal.

Don't know yet if he simply has nothing else to say, but I am hopeful for the near future.

On the flip side, I am starting to have some verbal problems. It might just be the stress of the job searching, or it might be the fronto-temporal dementia starting to settle in.

On the plus side, my child only has 2 years of high school left, so if I do get a new job, I should be properly there as a father until graduation, and hopefully, until after college.

But shit, it's hard, it's fucking hard. 

I had a business! A successful business! My health because of my fucking mom took a big chunk out of it, and now, I am almost begging for a job.

I hate that bitch. She stole my fucking life.
