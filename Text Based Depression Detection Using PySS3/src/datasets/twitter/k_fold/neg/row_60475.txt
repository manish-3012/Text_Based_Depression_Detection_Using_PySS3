34, pregnant, no job, in debts, father alcoholicI am 34 years old and I got the news I am pregnant. Added to that the father is an alcoholic who hasn't talked to me in 2 days and makes me responsible for his drinking and who gets mad at me everytime he is drunk.   I am in debts because I couldn't find a job yet, I don't have a college degree and my insurance wants around 1500 because I live in a country where you HAVE to be insuranced , even if you don't earn money.     My family is mad at me and wants borrowed money back (which i understand) . I just can't do it anymore. I am lost.    What should I do? Everyone in my life lets me down right now.
