I feel so broken down.So I don't know where to start, or what to say. Everyday is just such a struggle and I feel like life just gets harder and harder. I don't blame anyone else but myself. I have bad anxiety and depression and I've always just felt like I don't connect with anyone. I'm 22 and in the past year I've been through so much, and nothing seems to be getting better. I hate myself, and my choices, and my feelings. I want to be happy but I feel like I always stop myself from being happy. I know the simple answer is "just allow yourself to be happy" but it's not very easy for me. I try and sometimes it works, but more times than not it fails. The only reason I don't kill myself is because of my mother and family. I don't want them to suffer. But everyday, my past and addiction haunts me and my future and makes killing myself look more and more appealing.
