I was too pathetic to even pull the trigger. I don't know what's left.A few days ago, I sat in my room with a gun against my head, ready to do it. But instead of being a man, a just sat there crying, and eventually my parents stormed in. They're setting me up with some therapist shit, but I don't really care at this point.

To explain my background, I hate myself with a passion. I can't keep a job, I'm the only one in my entire family to not be accepted into college, and I'm super obese as a result from depression. I have a pretty heavy anxiety disorder, and take pills for it, but I still feel empty on a daily basis. I keep asking myself "is this what life is?" I yearn for the days where happiness was an emotion I felt. Most of my time is spent in my room looking at the ceiling. It's not like I have anything better to do. I have no friends or hobbys. At this point, I want to die with all my heart, but can't bring myself to do it. No amount of "you're a special and wonderful person" talks have changed that. And if I can't be happy, but can't end it, that means for the next 60 years I'm stuck in an endless cycle of depression until I die alone on the streets with no one to love me because I'm a waste of life that doesn't deserve love. Fuck life, fuck the world, and most importantly, fuck me.
