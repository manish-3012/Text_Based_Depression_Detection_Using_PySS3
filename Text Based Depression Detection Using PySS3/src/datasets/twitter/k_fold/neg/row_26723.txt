I want to try and fail suicide just so I know the pain so it can be a deterrenceI think about suicide constantly and I know I will never go through with it. I fear pain too much and I hate decisions that are absolute, from small things like deleting an image to ending it all.

I want to try something that will hurt so much that it will completely make me stop thinking about suicide because of pain.

And I hate it has come to that decision.

But I also fear that if I just let it be, I might say 'fuck it' one day and take the final decision...
