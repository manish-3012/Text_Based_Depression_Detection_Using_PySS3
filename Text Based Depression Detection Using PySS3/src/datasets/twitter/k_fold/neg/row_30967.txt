12 years depression.Suffer from depression for 12 years due to a series of bullied at a young age, mistreated, not.having a relationship with a woman, not having money to pay bills or buy things for myself, or Hatred against self. I am 28 yr old andI want to get bettter but my other me won't let me. In my darkest hour, suicidal is my number one priority. I cannot control that feeling. Anything can trigger my depression, seeing a happy couple holding hands, treat unfairly, or financial problems. So I'm asking a bunch of strangers for a solution to at least cure me from depression temporarily. I am in a ok state at the moment but it probably won't last long.
