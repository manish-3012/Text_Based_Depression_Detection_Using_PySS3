TonightI think I'm going to kill myself tonight when I get home from work. I have no desire to live to even see another day and I just can't do this anymore. 
I'm really sorry to anyone who will be hurt by this or who has ever been hurt by me. I truly wish I had never been born. And it won't make a.difference if I'm here or not, but it will end my suffering.
