Telling Counsellor about Suicidal ThoughtsSo I feel like I need to tell my counsellor about my suicidal thoughts, I have them every day, and I'm scared I might snap and do something soon. But I'm worried as to what will happen if I tell her? She has said previously that a conversation about suicide would lead to making an emergency plan and that everything would be under my control, but is this actually how it will go? I don't want my Mum knowing because she'll suffocate me (she cares so much, and I love her for it, but it wouldn't help), would I be able to stop that happening?

Anyone else's experiences would be great to know. Also I'm in the UK, so advice from over here would be especially welcome as I know the US system is different.
