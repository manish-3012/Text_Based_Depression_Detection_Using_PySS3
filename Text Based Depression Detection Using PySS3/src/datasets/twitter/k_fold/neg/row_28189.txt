She said, "Take care...always be happy with whatever you do"I'm so sad.  I have some friends, but not that many.  I haven't had a girlfriend in years.  More than anything else, I feel so lonely almost all the time.  I'm really depressed and I don't have a job because I'm a loser.  I just hate myself and the way I cause people I care about pain.

Anyway /sw/, a few months back I asked out this girl--except I didn't because I'm so socially awkward that I was unable to be clear with my intentions.  She brought this stuff up again last week and I guess I didn't react very well.  Anyway, now she says that she feels really uncomfortable around me and it looks like she doesn't want to be friends anymore.

She said:  "I didn't mean to hurt you. But when I talked to you about 'the email', you looked upset and uneasy. That made me feel more sorry and embarrassed.
I don't know how to apologize to you about my rudeness and what I should do in order not to hurt you any more.
I didn't want to lose our friendship, but I think I ruined our friendship. I am really sorry for that.
Take care...always be happy with whatever you do."

I'm so sad, and all I can do now is cry.
