I'm trapped in this hellhole.I'm legally an adult. I could move out. But I can't.

Realistically the economy has gone to shits here. Private property or resale is exorbitant and I would like to get my own place without crippling myself with debt. Government provided property is in such high demand, I have been trying for more than half a decade to get a flat unsuccessfully.

I'm stuck in this place with a crazy brother and parents who enable him every step of the way. He acts out and lashes out at me whenever he is in a bad mood. I am his freaking punching bag. And when I respond I am condemned to be just as bad or even worse than the crazy idiot because I SIMPLY REACTED.

My parents do nothing to discipline him and when they talk to him, he defends his idiotic inconsiderate actions and blames it on others who are "too sensitive". Who the fuck slams the door every time they leave or enter their room? A normal person would be more mindful after the door slammed the first time. He is provoking me into a fight and pushing my buttons with his every actions because he is looking for someone to vent his anger on.

All because he was unhappy we had a meal when he was not around. Lash out at her. Having work troubles. Lash out at her. Feeling tired? Lash out at her. Fuck this shit. I'm so tired of being at the receiving end of his shit behavior.

I am stuck in this hellhole with no way out. I want to get out of this place. But nothing is progressing. I cannot get a house. I cannot leave from the idiot. My parents do nothing to help me. I want to just end it all already. Death is the only way out. A permanent end to my permanent problems. It is not my problem what happens to them when I die. They made life a living hell for me, why should I care about the rest of lives when I am no longer around? I cannot take it anymore.
