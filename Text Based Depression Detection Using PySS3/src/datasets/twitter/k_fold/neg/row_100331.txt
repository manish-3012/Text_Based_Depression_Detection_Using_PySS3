10 hoursI have 10 hours to decide. I have an appointment with my new therapist in 10 hours, and i just don't feel like going through this whole cycle AGAIN. I either hang myself in the next few hours, or hope this therapist works out. I'm so fucking ready to die, but i keep getting this bullshit feeling that this new treatment will work. I have never been this close, if i had a gun or any other method that doesn't take preparation, i'd be dead already. I just don't want to hurt anymore.
