I'm having involuntary suicidal thoughts and I need to know if my therapist will lock me up if I tell her.I have had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. The first one I remember was when I was around four and i wanted to die but this was before I knew that it was possible to kill yourself. I was being treated for cancer at the time so I tried to just be as horrible of a child as i could so that maybe they would stop treatment and let me die naturally (obviously didn't work). I survived that but then through out elementary I saw movies and people die gruesomely and thought that was how I can die and would say things like "I'm going to hit myself on the head with a hammer." through out the rest of school I have had constant suicidal thoughts and images just pop in to my head and some plans that just come out of nowhere. They aren't triggered by anything. Even if everything is going well in my life I will still have my moments. I get by it through distracting myself but that is really hard to do. I want to have professional help for it but I'm scared to get locked up. The health care where I live is so bad. It will not help me at all to get called in. I just want to understand what is going on so I can fix it properly. I don't meed to be watch and I'm scared that she won't believe me. I've never told a therapist the full truth before. I've always lied about the fact that I "have a plan" because I didn't try to plan shit. I'll just be having a normal day and my brain will just wonder over to " I could do it like this." How do I get the help I need without getting locked up in my areas really shitty health care?
