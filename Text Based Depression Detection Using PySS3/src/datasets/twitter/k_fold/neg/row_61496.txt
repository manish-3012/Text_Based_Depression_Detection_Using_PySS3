I cant take the anxiety anymoreI cant do this anymore. I have too many fears holding me back. Im trying to face my fear of flying, like I did with buses and trains and it feels like too much. I havent slept and I have to be ready in the next 4 hours. My stupid sister was just screaming down the hall as I had finally calmed myself, screaming about more useless bullshit that doesnt matter. Im so angry at her, I asked her a thousand times to be kind to me for one fucking day, to just be calm so I can be calm and she fucking yelled and argued with someone at 11PM. I cant sleep im so angry, and im so worried I dont know if i can face my fears. Even with perfect conditions I dont know if I can do it.

I just want to end it all now. I fucking cant stand being so afraid anymore. Im not even afraid of crashing, im afraid of the sensation of speed and height and the small spaces, loud noises, lack of control. Its my worst nightmare. What the fuck am I supposed to do?????? I can barely step in elevators. I used to not be able to speak to people. I fucking hate how my life is dictated my fear.
