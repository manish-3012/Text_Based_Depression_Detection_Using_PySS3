Please help!Nobody will talk to me or listen to me, not until I say that I want to die. Now I have reached that point. I am not trying to hide the fact that I am making a "cry for help." I am quite blatantly, and honestly, doing it right now. I don't know what else to do.

Don't tell me to call a hotline, because none of the ones I tried want to listen to me. Please, somebody, just talk to me. Please.
