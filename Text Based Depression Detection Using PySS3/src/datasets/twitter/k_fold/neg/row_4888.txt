Iâ€™m completely aloneIâ€™ve been working so hard on my mental health, I really have. I stayed at a treatment facility for a month, took their pills, filled out their prescriptions, threw out my razors and belts, and even threw out my medication when the thoughts got too overbearing, hell, I even called the suicide prevention hotline number after calling out of work last minute on Friday because I couldnâ€™t handle anything. I talked to the operator for 4 hours, and it helped for 5 seconds. Here I am now, wide awake, in bed, with two feet of space separating me from my partner, a stranger to me now, the 1,000th night beside him, and every night Iâ€™m next to him I feel him inching further and further from me in his dreams. I havenâ€™t got friends, I tried using bumble to meet girls in the area but all anyone my age wants to do is get blackout drunk, and my failing health can not withstand that lifestyle. I am estranged from my family and have absolutely nobody to comfort me when it gets bad. I hate my job. I hate my trauma. My PTSD. My inability to voice my emotions to my partner, not like heâ€™d actually care, seeing as he told me the other night that heâ€™s losing passion for me. I donâ€™t even know what the purpose of any of this was, I just feel so fucking empty and worthless and I wish I hadnâ€™t thrown away all of my medication, belts and razors. Iâ€™m too tired to fix myself. Iâ€™m too tired to keep suffering. So what is it Iâ€™m supposed to do, when Iâ€™ve tried everything already? Moving to another state didnâ€™t help, therapy didnâ€™t help, medication didnâ€™t help, new job, hobbies, meditation, religion, positivity, love, kindness, nothing helps. Am I hopeless? Can I actually be saved?
