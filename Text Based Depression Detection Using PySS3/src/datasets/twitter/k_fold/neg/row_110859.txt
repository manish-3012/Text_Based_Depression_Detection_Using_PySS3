Feeling suicidal for essentially no reason... But seriously considering ending it tonight. I can't do this anymore. I'm hurting way too badly and I want it to end. And I cannot even think of one reason not to. Like legit the only thing stopping me is my cats. Which is pretty pathetic. I'll admit I get upset easily but I don't even know why I feel like this right know. I honestly can't figure it out and that's stressing me out and making things worse. And as much as I want this all to end I feel like I don't even deserve to die and I'm not even good enough for that. I just feel trapped. And I'm tired of feeling this way. I've been crying in agony for someone to either help me or end this already for the past 2 hours, hurting in the absolute worst ways, for essentially no reason. And this isn't the first time this has happened. For honestly as long as I can remember I've had thoughts of wanting to just end my life. Â And it's getting old. I just don't want to hurt like this anymore. I'm finally at the point where I'm seriously considering ending it. I just need one person to realize that I'm not okay and save me cause I honestly can't deal with this anymore. I'm too hurt and confused and alone and trapped.Â 

Sorry if this makes no sense, my mind is racing and my fingers can barely keep up... But with all of that finally said, I could really appreciate someone to talk to right now... Id feel a little more comfortable opening up in a PM but here is okay too I guess.
