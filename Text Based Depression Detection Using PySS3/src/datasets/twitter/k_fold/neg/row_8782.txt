Iâ€™ll try to hang on for 2 more years.I (17F) have been going through the hardest times of my life. Iâ€™ve struggled with extreme anxiety/panic attacks for about 5 years and depression for about 3. I always hoped that things would get better, but itâ€™s gotten worse. I keep losing more and more people/things that I love and at this point I basically have nothing. 

Every time I feel some form of happiness, my OCD (which includes my BDD as well) crawls up and takes it from me. I just want to feel normal again. I crave human interaction but it only leaves me feeling anxious and rejected. Iâ€™m starting to accept the feelings of loneliness, which gives me hope. I need to shake my dependence on other peopleâ€™s approval then maybe Iâ€™ll be able to survive. 

At this point, I feel completely empty and exhausted. However, I realize that Iâ€™m young and things could get better, even though I highly doubt they will. Because of this small shred of hope, Iâ€™ve decided that I will try to wait 2 years to see if things get better before taking my life. Maybe in this time Iâ€™ll become such a failure and empty shell that my family wonâ€™t even miss me or care that Iâ€™m gone. I donâ€™t want to cause them any pain, so this would be fine with me. 

Rant over. Thanks for reading.
