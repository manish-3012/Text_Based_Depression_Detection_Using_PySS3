I understand why people kill themselves. Having a bad night. The pain is almost unbearable. I'll start from the beginning. Molested until I was 10 by a neighbor, abandoned by my dad, ignored by my mother, cheated in by my husband and that leads me to the present. When my husband told me he had an affair I turned to one of his friends to try to understand. No I did not have a sexual relationship with this friend but were very close. Understandably I don't trust easily but he knew my history and I thought I could trust him. He needed help with his daughter while he was going through a divorce and I did. She now calls me mom. Well friend moved away and turns out he was just using me. Quit talking to me once he left. His daughter still talks to me,she is 13. Her mom was deemed unfit and her dad is an alcoholic whore who didn't even come home last night but didn't bother to tell her. She stayed up waiting for him and was scared when she woke up and he wasn't there. Here is the pain part. I can't do anything to help her. She is going to end up fucked up just like me and I'm a coward and don't want to be around to see it. I am tired of feeling like I am useless and have no control. I'm tired of hurting so yes I know why people kill themselves. Sometimes it's the better option when you think all you have is this pain for the rest of your life
