Am I being overly dramatic?I'm a 36 yo Male. I'm a combat veteran with severe PTSD and severe TBI my back was also broken in three places because of an EID in Baghdad. I am a wife that I love and who loves me. We also have children together. This, of course, is only a drop in the bucket of what defines a personally but it gives a rough lay out. To the important bit, I struggle with serious self hate and depression. It isn't a constant thing there's days I love being alive those days I'm usually out doing something, experiencing something. Then there are days when I would rather not be alive. I'm growing increasingly angry and hateful towards everyone, everyone suffers from my not so pleasant attitude and that makes me hate myself more. I'm feeling trapped and as if I'm stuck and not going anywhere. Lately I'm having more and more difficulty convincing myself I want to stick around for another day. I'm not sure I could ever follow through with the act of ending myself but again lately I'm struggling even more. And that's that. So, am I just being a whiny little drama queen? I want to be happy, I want to be positive and I want to make people smile, I love making people laugh and smile. I'm done ranting.
