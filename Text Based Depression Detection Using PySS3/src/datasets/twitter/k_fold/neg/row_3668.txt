wavesmy suicidal thoughts come in waves and theyâ€™re just hitting me rn

I work at a fast food restaurant, Iâ€™m currently hiding the fact that one of my coworkers is sleeping with a manager and heâ€™s already starting to show her favoritism and idk, itâ€™s weirdly contributing to the fact that I feel like everyone here hates me and now that he said some shit about wanting to train her to do my job I just want out. Iâ€™m a fucking college dropout, Iâ€™m a failure in my familyâ€™s eyes, whatâ€™s the point? All I have is my cats and even they would probably be happier with my roommate. I donâ€™t know. Just want to jump off a fucking bridge
