sexually abused tinnitus suffererI'm 29, never even kissed a girl.  I was sexually abused when I was 16 or so and now I have Tinnitus possibly forever, maybe from my job, which I may have to quit.  It's been going on two weeks or so.

I have carpal tunnel, neck/shoulder problems, and a chronic bruised tailbone, so it's difficult for me to sit or play video games.  Or stand and play video games.  If I go to a movie theater with my hands in my lap, my right rotor cuff gets a 6/10 pain for hours.

I've been having thoughts I've never had even in my darkest times.  I thought I was suicidal before but I've never been so close.

Every day I get through that I think I'm doing fairly well, I forget it all in the morning (or the middle of the night) and have a little bout of panic when I hear the ringing.  I only slept for an hour and a half and I feel like I'm going to be up the whole night.

Any Tinnitus sufferers out there?  Or anyone of course.  Thanks for reading.
