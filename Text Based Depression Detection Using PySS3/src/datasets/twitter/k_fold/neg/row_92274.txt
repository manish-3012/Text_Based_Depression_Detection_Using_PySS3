Cautionary TaleTried to post something real, open and honest but it wouldn't let me see anything unless I clicked on and off the rules and in the process of doing so time and time again I accidentally clicked back and deleted my entire post. 
This whole thing sums up why I'm so hell bent on death right now but no one saw it and whose going to take my word for it? 
Anyway, I took some pills. 
Washed em down with wine and I have a razor blade for good measure, let's see if this works!

Dunno why I'm posting this, cautionary tale maybe? 
I don't want to hear strangers telling me that they love me/things get better/I'm selfish. I think I'm just fed up of not having a voice, so right now - even if only for a minute - I want to be able to speak my mind, free of judgement or pity.
