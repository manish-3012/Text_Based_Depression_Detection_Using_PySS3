Why can't I just let go?What is it about existence that is so important? If every day is so painful and there's no way to change that, why can't I just opt out? What is it about giving up that is so awful you can't even say the word "suicide" without feeling that stigma in the air?

Why is it that I want to help every other suicidal person I see, and beg them to live, but I can't apply the same philosophy to myself?

Why can't I just...not be here? What's so bad about it?
