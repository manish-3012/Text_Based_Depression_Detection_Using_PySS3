What would happen?Im not necessarily suicidal. Maybe I am I donâ€™t know anymore. What if I did though? What would happen? What would change? Things linger in my head all the time just wondering,â€look at this person, how would my death influence them?â€. My mind wanders and I can control it but why would I? Honestly, it thinks by itself. The thing can make a suicide out of anything. I canâ€™t name the number of times I have sat in rooms and look and analyze and think of how many different ways I could kill myself in an instant with things just in the room. I would never do it but i gotta know, why does this happen? Is this everyone. I mean Iâ€™ve had a rough past but presently iâ€™m doing great, does my mind miss the worst of the worst days of my life, the stress and anxiety I lived with everyday? Any incite would be nice.
