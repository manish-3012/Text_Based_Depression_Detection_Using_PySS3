I have no purposeI've just turned 17 and I can't help having certain thoughts, it's like it'd be so much better if I just went and did it. I was diagnosed with depression and I talked to my mum but I also feel like I can't properly talk to her or anyone, it'd be too much of an burden on them, so I'm not going to bother anyone with such stupid fucking shit. My mum, as loving as she is and I love her to bits,  she always has to comment and let me know how much she dislikes something ( whether that be through words or her facial expression) - anytime I feel good about myself, she has to make a comment about something I have on, and that really fucking hurts. And other times I know she's probably just joking, but she calls me names that just stick, like calling me a fatass or expensive/leech but that's only because I've stopped working so she has to pay for things I might need. Im just real fucking tired, I don't have any goal or purpose, I can't imagine myself in the future at all. I'm supposed to graduate this year but I already know I'm going to fail year 12, I haven't done any assignments and I know I'm just disappointing.I'm just here, wasting space and becoming a massive inconvenience, I just want to bash my head in and claw my ribs out. Nothing look right and holy fuck. But I can't do anything yet, my brother and his girlfriend is moving out soon and I want to see that at least. Id be completely fine if I just fucking dropped dead.
Sorry for the long post, have a great night/day
