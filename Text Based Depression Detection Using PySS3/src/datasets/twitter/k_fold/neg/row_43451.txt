Pregnant, a toddler, and no support. Canâ€™t handle it anymoreHi there. 
Currently in the home stretch for my pregnancy, I have my toddler at home with me 5 days a week and my partner seems to only be of help when he feels like it, and Iâ€™m about to lose this battle. 

Heâ€™s my only support I have here and he treats my problems like theyâ€™re a joke. After a long long day dealing with my toddler, heâ€™s out drinking for a work function that he HAD to go to. 

I canâ€™t take this anymore. If this is what itâ€™ll be like when I have 2 under 2 to deal with, I donâ€™t want to be here
