Maybe I don't want to die, but I deserve to.Just using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Iâ€™m 19 years old and Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for a number of years now.

I guess they started when I was 7, I was forced by my mother to take swimming lessons (we lived near the sea; she just wanted me to be safe). At first my swimming instructor was very calm and relaxed and we got along but he soon became annoyed with my slow progress, it was then that he began to force me to change before and after a lesson in front of him as punishment. He used to make fun of me for how short I was, how small my penis was and just horrible things about how I looked. After doing this for a few times he one day cornered me in a private stall and raped me. He raped me several times before I finally convinced my parents to let me stop taking the lessons.
I never told anyone, I was so ashamed, so disgusted with myself. I thought that it was my fault, my fault for not learning how to swim quickly enough.

Now I feel so much guilt for never saying anything. I canâ€™t even begin to think how many children that man has abused since. Every one of them is my fault, if only I had the guts to tell someone what he did, I could have possibly stopped a lot of children from being abused.
This thought keeps me up at night, but unfortunately too much time has passed. That man (I can't even remember his first name) doesn't work at that swimming centre anymore, I never saw him after I quit. Also the swimming centre itself isnâ€™t even there anymore it was torn down about 2 years ago. There is no way that I can think of to find out what his name was.

I donâ€™t know if I can handle the guilt any more. I have caused so much grief in other peopleâ€™s lives. I think I deserve to die. Iâ€™m such a coward.
