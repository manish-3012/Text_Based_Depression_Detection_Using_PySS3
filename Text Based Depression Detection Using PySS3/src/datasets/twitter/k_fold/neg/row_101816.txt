I'm tired of tryingHowdy. I'm not here to bore you with the details, but honestly I'm so fucking tired of living. Every day it's the same thing: wake up, pretend to be happy, realize people don't actually care about me, fight with the parents (if I'm at home. When at uni I rarely talk to them but when the fights usually still happen), agonize over the girl that I happen to like that week, look up and just read whatever depressing shit I can, fap, go to bed, rinse and repeat.

My "friends" (see "people I sometimes hang around) don't give a damn, and whenever I try to bring up how unhappy I am they either change the subject, talk about their own problems, or just tell me to shut up. Trying to bring this up around my family is usually met with "you don't have anything to be unhappy about", and my brother always just says "too stop talking about weird stuff".

Obviously sometimes I do feel fine but the depression, fear, and isolation always comes back. It's always worse during the summer, when school is out and I'm forced to be alone in the house all day, not even being able to pretend I have someone that cares about me. This summer has been the worse I've had yet, and honestly it's taking willpower to not just down all the pills in the medicine cabinet or trying again to hang myself.

I honestly just don't know what to do. I'm afraid of dying, yet at the same time I'm just really, really fucking tired of living. I have hobbies, I try new things, I'm trying to get out more, but it feels like nothing ever matters, and no one ever cares about me.
