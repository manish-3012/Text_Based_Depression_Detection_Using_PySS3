Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?I have been considering this for years and trying to figure out the easiest most painless way to go.  Eventhough I know this isn't either of those, I think I probably have the guts to hang myself. Gun sefinitely...too cowardly. But now I've been thinking Carbon Monoxide. The whole running cae routine.  Does anyone know much about it. It seems like in most cases u read about it, the people become unconscious 1st and then suffocate from lack of oxygen. Itseems pretty ide since you would be knocked put for the scary parts. Pleaae tell me.what u know. Pros cons....how long does it take and is hooking a hose up to the exhaust of your car in the garage the best way to do it? Or is there more effective? Thanks all.
