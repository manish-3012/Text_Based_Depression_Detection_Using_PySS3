I think I'm fine and then my brain keeps coming back to it.I've been trying to get out of this depressive slump of sorts, and I think I've been doing better. I used to think a lot about killing myself and how to do it, but lately that has been fading away, and I'm starting to feel like I did before I got depressed. So I thought, "I'll get better and this won't happen again."

...but something just doesn't feel right, y'know? I could be acting and thinking just fine and then just for a few split seconds, I go back to my depressed, self-loathing way of thinking, and then return to my usual self. This has been only happening when I'm not doing something I'm passionate about/interested in. I've gotten lucky because I got sick enough not to go to high school yesterday, otherwise I probably would gotten back into that dark state of mind, no matter how much I would've kept telling myself that most of the people there are showing off how much in 'love' they are.

So my question is, is it still normal to have those dark moments pop out at random, just something that the human brain does, or should I go see the counselor about that?
