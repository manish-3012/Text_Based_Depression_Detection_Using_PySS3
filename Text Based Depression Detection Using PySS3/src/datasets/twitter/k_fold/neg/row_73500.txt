No escape.One of my friends killed himself this summer. I told myself I didn't want anyone to feel the way I felt over him so I had put away my own suicide thoughts. But it's been long enough where they are coming back. I understand why he did it. There comes a time when someone just feels too trapped and no escape. Those who don't feel the same way will never understand this type of pain.
