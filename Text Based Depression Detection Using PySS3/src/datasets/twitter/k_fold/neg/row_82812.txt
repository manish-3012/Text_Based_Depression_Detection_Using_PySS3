UPDATE: Leaving on vacation tomorrow, coming back bankrupt, ending up homeless within two months, starving to death about three weeks after that. [TL;DR: It was worse than I thought.](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1a7xi1/after_the_vacation_im_dead_broke_even_sooner_than/)

I think I'll give starvation a try.  Not like I have a whole lot of choice in the matter, granted, but $100 and whatever chump change I get from selling all my stuff isn't going to get me anywhere.  A shame it's starting to get warmer; I kinda wanted to starve to death in the winter.
