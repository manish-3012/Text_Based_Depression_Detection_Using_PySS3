I hate being here so much.Recently, Iâ€™ve been in a very lonely and dark place. Whatâ€™s on my mind right now is the fact that Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend, and feel like Iâ€™m incapable of love.

Thereâ€™s a chance that I might be decently attractive. Iâ€™m not sure. But Iâ€™ve had terrible social anxiety ever since the beginning of middle school. Iâ€™m now 22. And last year, I found out that Iâ€™m on the autism spectrum. 

I just donâ€™t know how to give myself the confidence to continue. As a guy, Iâ€™m aware that itâ€™s up to me if Iâ€™m going to have any dates in my future. But I just wish I didnâ€™t feel so goddamn autistic in social encounters. My lack of confidence often causes me to cry. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
