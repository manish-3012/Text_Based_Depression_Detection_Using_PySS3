Girlfriend has started acting erratic - I fear it's getting worseHi SW. I never thought I would be making a post here. In high school, one of my close friends started making comments jokingly about killing himself. At first we didn't take him seriously, so he started self-harming. I told the principal and after he confronted our friend about it, he promptly tried killing himself and failed to do so. I take jokes about suicide and the like very seriously now.


I'm now in my second semester of college, and I've been dating this girl for about two months now. Since we started dating and became closer and closer, I started keying in on changes in her behavior. She's stopped eating regularly, and typically seems sad. The only time she really acts like herself is when I spend the night at her apartment and we fool around.

She started making nonchalant comments about killing herself like a number of teens do in a non-serious manner. I told her the story about our friend, and how I take those types of jokes really seriously and that they bother me. She's continued to make them.


Last night was the real tipping point where I started to piece everything together. We were laying together at about 2AM, and she rolls over and starts crying. I try to comfort her - ask her what's wrong, if she needs anything, etc - she ignored me for about 30 minutes and then fell asleep. Today she told me she was sorry, and that she's "only going to get worse, so I should just dump her." She also told me to "find a nice girl to date who isn't a mental patient." 

These comments became more and more desperate - she started calling herself a burden and so forth. I was extremely worried and asked her over Skype (since I live 45 minutes away and can't be there with her tonight) if she was okay because of the comments she had been making. She became very defensive and told me she would never kill herself. She said that she "wasn't some pathetic creature" and "didn't need anyone to watch over her like a child". 


At this point I don't really know what to think. She constantly asks me if I really like her, and then demands to know why I like her, reminding me that she's just a "terrible girlfriend". Any time I upset her and apologize, she insists that I'm not in the wrong and that anything bad in our relationship is all her fault. I feel like I should be reaching out for help at this point, but if she really isn't suicidal she would be extremely upset with me for doing so.
