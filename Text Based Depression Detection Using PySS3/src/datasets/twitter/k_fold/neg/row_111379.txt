Going out the same day I came into this horrible world.Birthday is on the 18th, posting here so there is at least some type of written record. I have had it with everything good getting taken from me. The past 2 years have been a living hell. My world has fallen apart. I am now going to be 27 in 6 days and have nothing to show for it except a dark past. Gonna rant so if you're bored feel free to read.

I had a terrible childhood. That's how it usually starts right? I was always compared to my older brother. I was even told I was a mistake. Verbatim, my own mother said "You make me want to kill myself". My mom however, is the lesser of 2 evils. My father cheated on my mom and manipulated her. She eventually left the state to get away from him and their circle of friends belittling her. In that time, my father won custody of my brother and I. It was then, that life had truly turned for the worst. I was verbally abused consistently. To the point I ended up with a bad habit of not leaving my room. I was scared. I tried hard to avoid confrontation. He abandoned us one night, leaving the state. And claimed bankruptcy on the house. I was officially homeless. My brother was able to work things out with a girl he was dating. I, however, was screwed. I squatted for a few days before my neighbors took me in. I have been on my own since the age of 13. I pushed myself enough to complete high school. I was working with decent pay. At this point my mom moved back and at 18, I moved in with her in a 1 bedroom apartment. I was turned away by my own wealthy family in CT for a cosigner for college when I was told they would do so. They waited to tell me 2 days before I was supposed to go. That destroyed me. I had no future. I worked check to check like anyone else trying to make ends meet. Landed a good job with T-Mobile. Lost all that money though because of a girl I dated for 3 years took it all from me and broke my heart. Still, this happens to everyone I believe so I persevered. I couldn't cope with life. I was suicidal all those years since my father leaving. Severely depressed. Fast forward, ended up in rehab. I came out of it homeless. During my time in rehab we were evicted for hiding evidence to a murder scene (mothers ex-con bf). Most of my things were stolen. I couch-surfed for awhile. I found a girl who truly changed my life. I loved the previous ex enough to want to propose after those 3 years. I loved this girl even more within a few short months. It was surreal. That didn't last long though. She compared me to her best friend on a daily basis. This, for obvious reasons, tore me apart. I have been through this before and didn't want to with her. So we mutually ended things. After a few month she she still felt she had no feelings for him and was sure she still loved me so I decided to take it slow this time. I explained that I wanted it to happen naturally. I obviously still loved her to death I just didn't want to get hurt. Well the friend invited her to fly out to Washington to see him. She went. I trusted her enough at this point since we were working on things and things were smooth by this point. You can't have a relationship without trust right? Well, she fucked him numerous times and explained how she performed oral sex a few times as well. And magically had feelings for him. I tried committing suicide that night. I overdosed on all of my meds. Heavy stuff. Stomach got pumped but I lived. Damn. I tried again but a friend miraculously caught me and slapped me in the face. I moved to a roomie situation. This was the happiest I have ever been in my life. But I wasn't able to hold a job. The job I had wasn't paying me when they were supposed to. I ended up 2 months late and decided to skip town. Stupid idea I know. I burned bridges to the only people I felt happy with. During this time, a friend down the road was breeding pitbulls. I fell in love with the runt. He advised me she would have a lot of issues and was considerably smaller so nobody wanted her. I didn't have the money so I couldn't take her. He called a bit later telling me he would let me have her for 100$ knowing how much I wanted her. I sold some things and got enough to get her along with food and other necessities. I was offered a job in North Carolina. So I hit the road with her and didn't look back. I got screwed over by work AGAIN. They had me wait for 2 months before telling me they didn't need me. I was HIRED. So I was simply waiting for their store to open. (I was going to be assist manager). Any funds I managed to get were gone as that was all I had to live off of. I was living in a hotel with a friend down there I had met on an mmorpg. I got kicked out for having the dog because apparently she was a restricted breed. I had nowhere to go. Being resilient, I managed to get back to PA with a promise I would have a temp place til I got back on my feet. I got there the night before this past Thanksgiving. I was lied to. I stayed out in the freezing cold with my dog all night. I walked all the way back to my old neighbors house. They took me in to warm up and offered me a seat at the table for the holidays. I received a call from an old high school friend to stay there for a few days. He is now taking care of my dog. I miss her so much. I have nowhere to go. I am trying desperately to find work, but it keeps falling through. I have nothing. I am on an old donated laptop to apply for jobs, browse reddit etc. My puppy was the only hope I had left. She was my world. If it wasn't for her I would have offed myself sooner. She gave me reason to keep going. I have nowhere to go and I received a text saying I need to find her a new home a few days ago as it has been too long. She can't stay where I am staying as there are no pets allowed. I have an airbed, a few clothes and this laptop. So much struggle to end up nowhere. I give up. So in 6 days, I am going to commit suicide successfully. I know it is selfish. I know it's not morally right. But this world has broken me. I can't keep doing this. Everyday something bad happens. The few friends I have even joke about my terrible luck/life. It's pretty bad when friends can acknowledge it being that way. I don't tell people the extent of my issues because I wouldn't even believe myself if I was in there shoes. It is just too much. I don't get breaks. I don't get a chance. No matter how long I wait for "better days'. My world just remains idle in the darkness. I give up. I have lost my love. I lost it all. And now a puppy who meant the world to me is gone. I love you Kitana. I am sorry I could never manage to provide for us. I hate knowing when this happens, my social networks will more than likely be blown up. But where are those people when we're alive? Why won't anyone help? Thank you Jim for giving me a few days keeping warm and providing a good home for Kitana. You were the only one who truly helped. With that said, I am leaving my skype here if anyone wants to chat. I am comfortably numb. This isn't a rash decision. I am calm and logically know I have nothing to live for. So Chatting to fellow redditors could be entertaining in the meantime. Goodbye all.
