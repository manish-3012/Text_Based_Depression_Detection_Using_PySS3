I can't stand living this way please helpSorry if this is really long I'm have a tendency to write a lot.

Every moment of my life is painful. Im really ugly I have a messed up head,I'm unbelievably white, like paper white. I can't talk or walk properly I'm have a very skinny chest arms and legs but have a real fat belly and arse and big fucked up teeth

And that's just my appearance. The worst part is my brain I have mild aspergers ADHD schizophrenia and every second it feels like my brains about to explode and the feeling never stops

Up until I was 8 my mother and I were severely physically abused after he left I went to live with my aunty and cousins...they would always laugh,tease and mock me...they were much older than me and I had a lot of anger issues at the time and every time I'd stand up for myself  the boy one would beat me up


And since I was 13 I moved from house to house for (example I'd live with one of my aunties than another than my mums than back to my other aunties my older cousin...etc) the experience was more or less the same  there was always someone who'd laugh and pick on me after a while I was homeless for months when I came back to my auntie she sent me up to the children and adolescent phyic ward type place...I stayed there for weeks even the doctors couldn't help but laugh at me sometimes

When I came back I had a lot of anger towards everybody I said and did a lot of things I wish I hadn't. Now no-one in my family can stand being around me(not that they ever did) but now they basicly avoid and contact with me 

The only people I ever thought was my friends would only have me around as a joke to show everyone but they'd laugh behind my back like they'd go into the other room and laugh their heads of I was to stupid to notice

I've seen many phycologists and physiatrists but nothing helps

All I want is to kill myself but I'm to scared that what if there is a hell and existence would be worse than it currently is but I can't stand how my life is now. I'm sorry if this was too long to read I just needed to say something
