Please help me change my mind.My finals are going on, and there's only one more left. But I've been hanging on by a single thread this whole time. I kept telling myself to hold on, but I just can't anymore. 

I feel so lethargic and if I don't get two answers in a row, I get really upset. This feels really stupid, but I really can't hold on. I've seriously started considering suicide, and I've caught myself thinking about how I might go about it. 

Please, help me change my mind. After I got this idea of suicide, which has been with me for about a year now, I've been strangely calm. I don't want to hurt my family. I need help.
