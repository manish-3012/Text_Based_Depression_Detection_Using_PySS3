Struggling with thoughtsIâ€™ve attempted suicide twice. At 13 and 17. I seemed to have more guts then because Iâ€™m 23 now and I canâ€™t get the thoughts out of my head at all.

Iâ€™ve been through abuse my whole life. I was abused as a child by my family, physically, emotionally, sexually. I left my family home straight into a physically abusive relationship. Everything has left me mentally screwed and Iâ€™ve tried for the last 10 years to unscrew my brain and I canâ€™t.

Iâ€™m in love right now, I live with someone who is so kind to me and so loving and my brain canâ€™t handle it. Itâ€™s not that I think no one would care if I died, itâ€™s that I canâ€™t hack the pain of anymore loss. I feel constantly scared and paranoid that Iâ€™m going to lose this person. That theyâ€™ll realise how fucked up I am and leave. Itâ€™s making me want to die. If I sit and think about everything thatâ€™s happened in my life, it makes me want to die. I just want to feel nothing, think nothing, be nothing. I canâ€™t deal with how overwhelming my emotions and thoughts are anymore. I canâ€™t see myself ever having a normal attachment to somebody that isnâ€™t full of fear and anxiety about them hurting me. Iâ€™m just really exhausted.
