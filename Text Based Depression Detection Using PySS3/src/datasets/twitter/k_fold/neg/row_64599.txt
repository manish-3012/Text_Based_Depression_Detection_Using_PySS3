Given up hope, don't know what to doI am at uni, doing a course I like and want to pursue a career in. But I am struggling so much. In the 1st half of each semester I put a lot of effort in and I do really well. But by the 2nd half of the semester I 'burn out' and start falling behind and panicking a lot about my future. I am in the 2nd year of a 6 year course and I am already struggling. I already have about $20k in student debt.

A year ago I was so happy and motivated, focused on my goals. I have lost all of that now and feel so empty and already have a sense that I am a failure. I only have 1 friend at uni. I make such an effort to talk to new people (which is hard for me) and do things for them, yet it's like I don't even exist. I just have this huge feeling of worthlessness, like there is no point at all to my existence. Everything I do takes so much energy out of me, even something like getting out of bed, I no longer play football (soccer) anymore which I love and it has become unbelievably hard to focus when studying.

I've been thinking about suicide a lot knowing I'll be doing myself a favour. But I hate that I am thinking about it and know I shouldn't be. The only people I feel I can personally talk to are either my cousin &amp; her husband, but I don't want to bother them with my problems. The other person would be a friend of mine, but I feel like I would scare her away when I mention suicide, same with my cousin. What have you're interactions been like when talking to a friend, if you have? Should I go ahead and talk to one of them?
