My life is good. Can't shake the sadness.Sorry if this isn't the applicable sub for this. If asked, I will remove.


I'm happy, but im sad.

This may seem strange to several of you.

"You have no right to be sad, your life is good." you might say, but i really am sad.

I shouldnt be sad. But i am.

I have a good, loving wife; 2 beautiful children and a third one on the way that excites my as much as it scares me.

I have a great, high paying job that i love. I construct something out of nothing as a software developer. I have produced numerous software that help save lives every day. I truly am proud of my work. Although I shouldn't be sad, I am.

As a 27 year old i have achieved more then most will in their lifetime. I had a long "Bucket list" that is almost finished, only a handfull left to cross off. Yet, i cant shake the desolation.

I have a good loving happy family. I have good friends, good coworkers and even my neighbors are fantastic. Yet, i'm sad.

For the last 8 years of my life i have not had a single day that the "thought" has not come to my mind. Thoughts like: that building looks tall, there's some corrosive acid, that rope seems long enough, that knive looks sharp; thoughts that have no place in a happy soul's mind.

I'm afraid. Afraid of the feral beast my mind is. The fractious beast seems indecisive about what is and what should be. Afraid of it taking control, leading me to the nadir of my depression and acting accordingly.

I fear the worst. I fear being consumed by an abyss of misery and melancholy. Magnetized to the enticement of self damage.

I have raught out for professional help, only to return the same. Their approach doesn't seem to remedy my thoughts or guide my mind.

It seems that you are the ears that listen. The congregation that cares. 


Thank you for listening and forthmost, caring.
