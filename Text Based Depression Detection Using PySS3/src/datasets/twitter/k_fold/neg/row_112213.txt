I am too ugly to live.Iâ€™m so sick of this.  I have a big nose, big forehead, big everything and itâ€™s so hard to deal with.  People have told me they didnt date me because Iâ€™m ugly.  People have even told me Iâ€™m too ugly to go after.  Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™ve been in my fair share of relationships, but Iâ€™ve been rejected so many times just for being ugly and Iâ€™m sick of it.  

I am soon to leave home for college and before that I want to get a nose job to make me more confident before I leave, but none of the 758394858 retail jobs Iâ€™ve applied to got back to me.  Itâ€™s like the world wants me to be this way.

Iâ€™m not believing that looks donâ€™t matter bs.  I just want to look good, and thatâ€™s it.  Iâ€™m suicidal because of it.  Iâ€™m sick of living when I canâ€™t look good.
