Wish I had done it when I was brave enoughMy first encounter with depression occured when I was 15. At one point I devised a suicide plan and was very keen on following it through. Looking back, the only thing that kept me from actually doing it was the hope that things would get better given that I was so young and all. 
Five years later, I'm still bloody miserable and desperate for it all to end. The thing is, I'm also more aware of the permanence of the damage it would do to my loved ones. A friend lost her big sister to suicide not so long ago and I have never in my life witnessed someone suffer so much. I have a baby sister. I can't put her through that.
So now I'm stuck in this shithole of a life and really wish I had just gotten the job done back then when I was careless enough to do it
Fucking 
hell.
