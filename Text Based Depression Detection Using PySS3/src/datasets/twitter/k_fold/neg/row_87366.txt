Just not interested.My life is great. I'm a senior at a great school. I completed 4 years as a varsity athlete. I just left school on medical leave for substance abuse and depression. I've realized I have never done what makes me happy and I might just not ever do that. I had committed to killing myself but a couple lucky decision and being honest with my counselor led to me coming home from school. The thoughts followed me home, to my happy place. I have a great job. I've stopped all illegal drugs for my job. Alcohol used to make me happy but tonight I drank with a friend and after he went to bed I was in a state of mind where I would have been able to pull the trigger and shoot my brains out. I could probably guess the code on my dads gun safe and I thought about that tonight. Overall, I am just not interested in my life. I am successful but not happy, and when I think of what would make me happy it's either give up on everything and turn to drugs or kill myself. I'm seeing a therapist. I have been on medication and am going in soon to get new drugs. Is medication the only solution? I have no motivation. I just want some other opinions.
