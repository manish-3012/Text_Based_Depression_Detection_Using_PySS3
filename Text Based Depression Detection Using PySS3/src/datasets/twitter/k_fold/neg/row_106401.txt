Iâ€™m getting bored with life and I kind of like the idea of being ready to dieIv done most of the things I wanted to do by my senior year of high school. School is really easy now, I only have two classes a day and am usually out by 10:35 am. I have a decent car my parents let me use to drive back and forth to school, work, etc.

I saved up around $1,300 and bought my dream pc iv always wanted since I was a kid. Itâ€™s funny I did that, I donâ€™t even really play Xbox anymore much less games. I noticed I have no patience for people, and when I try to make some I get really annoyed, and anxious.

I donâ€™t really have friends since I stopped doing drugs about a year ago. Iâ€™m not interested in new people, I just donâ€™t have patience, Iâ€™m sorry. I took up swimming recently Iâ€™m improving at it. At least thatâ€™s what my coach says. Thatâ€™s been the only thing iv really cared at least a tiny bit about in weeks. Even then I donâ€™t really.

I dread work, I hate it. I cannot quit I need the money. Iâ€™m a cashier and I hate socializing with these people. Itâ€™s so forced. I would have liked to have gotten a different job, but as a teen the service industry is all you get.

These past couple months iv been eating so healthy I think Iâ€™m in the best shape iv ever been, never really cared about sports, but iv always cared about my figure. I donâ€™t know why because I havenâ€™t been emotionally attracted to women in over a year. I noticed Iâ€™m attracted to guys although not sexually, just emotionally. Iâ€™d rather date a guy, but have intercourse with a girl? Itâ€™s weird I guess. One of those teenage hormonal things, I donâ€™t really intend on figuring out.

Everythingâ€™s just kind of in front of me right now. I have everything iv wanted since freshman year. I always planned on going into the military, and I know I could ace the fitness scores. Iâ€™m just tired of waiting for it. I keep fantasizing about death. Back when I did it before I would just think of how much people would miss me, and that they would think of me. Now I just think of the blackness it would bring. 

Iâ€™d be done with everything, and everything done with me. This sounds really weird, but Iâ€™m sure this entire post does, but it comforts me in a way. Maybe this is a vent? I think Iâ€™m just tired of living.
