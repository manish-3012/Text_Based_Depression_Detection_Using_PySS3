I'll never be happy anyway.I have no skills. I hate people and they hate me. I have no friends. My family is basicly a group of roomates. I can't fucking do anything right. I cant improve on anything because all i focus on is how shit i am at it. I'll never be happy, so why drag my carcase through another year?
