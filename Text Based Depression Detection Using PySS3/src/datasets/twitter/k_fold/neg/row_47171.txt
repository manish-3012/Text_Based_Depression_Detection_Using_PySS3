Im going to kill myselfIm a burden, thats all i am. I dont matter, not even thr person i thought cared, cares about me. I have no one left to care. Im going to kill myself. No one would be sad, in fact, i think theyd act the opposite. I think people would be happy. Maybe ill blow my brains out, idk how but its going to happen.
