Fuck this worldThis world is fucking atrocious.  Corporations run everything, good people are getting fucked over every which way by greedy assholes, and whoever fights is stricken down back into their place.  The U.S. boasts that it's the best country in the world, and look how many people are living on the street in pain because they can't get health care!!  I've had it with this crap.  We're all going to die by their hand, so I'm just getting a head start.
