What took you the fear of dying?I had fear the whole time while i attempted suicide but after i got drunk and took all the pills.. the fear was gone. I think i felt absolutly nothing. I just smelled the air it was raining that day. Now that smell stucked with me. But now when im thinking about my attempt i feel respect for myself that i was brave enough to even do this..
