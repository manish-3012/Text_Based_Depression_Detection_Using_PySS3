suicide feels inevitablethe meds Iâ€™m on make me functional, Iâ€™m not at my lowest but not better. Even in the good moments, suicidal thoughts seem to call me back and remind me Iâ€™ll never be free. Itâ€™s a hold on me and maybe it wonâ€™t be in the near future, but one day I can say with confidence Iâ€™ll end my life and I think itâ€™ll be sooner rather than later
