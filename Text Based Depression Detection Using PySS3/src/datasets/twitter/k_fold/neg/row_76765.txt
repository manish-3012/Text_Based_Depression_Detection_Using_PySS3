No matter what I do, the drama in my life stays. Because I'm the problem.I don't know what's wrong with me. I just can't live a normal life. Every insecurity I have is something I can't even talk about cause the people around me will just judge me. The one person who I consider close is the same. If I speak my mind and ruin everything again I'm gonna kill myself. I don't know why she keeps coming back. I'm just as fucked up as I was when we ended it. Because of how different I am and because everybody says if you wanna talk about it you can but then gets offended by how I feel. I'm completely alone. I've concluded that I'm the problem, so I should remove myself.
