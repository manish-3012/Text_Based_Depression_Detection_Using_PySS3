If I had a reliable method, I'd be dead by now.I made a post on /r/transsupport a couple days ago, that was pretty much my last exertion of hope. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSupport/comments/3n399k/im_transgender_but_i_have_no_idea_how_to_proceed/) it is if anyone wants to see it.

I'm currently sitting among various discarded methods of suicide, having deemed every one of them too likely to fail for my liking. Fuck survival instinct, and fuck my body's ability to ignore my mental state.

Nothing I have is worth keeping. Nobody would even find out that I killed myself for at least a couple weeks, which to me just says how little I mean to anybody. All I wanted was to be a woman, which is pretty much impossible as far as I can see.

Best case scenario I end up with a shunned, discarded life, accepted only by the minority, forced to suffer discriminations I'm not capable of handling. If I can't even have that, then my entire life was just a waste. I've wanted it over for a long time, but that just proved even more how utterly worthless and cowardly I am.

I tried ignoring my feelings, but I know with absolute certainty that isn't possible. There are three possibilities: I continue in this miserable hellish existence, prolonging the misery needlessly, I go through with what I've always wanted, and become some sort of universal freak in the eyes of the majority, assuming I can even handle that, or I just end it now.

I doubt anyone would care. My previous friends dropped me, my family would be upset, sure, but it's not like I ever caused anything but hate. They'll get over it. The only other person who would even notice I was gone would be my pseudo-stalker, and why should that matter to *me.*

I can't get up the energy to do anything. I'm not capable of focusing on a task for more than a few minutes at a time, making the continuation of school impossible no matter what I do. My psychological problems make it nearly impossible for me to be stable on a day-to-day basis, let alone find a job or support myself.

I just don't have any hope left. There's nothing to gain from slowly wasting away, wondering what would be different if I had the strength or ability to pick up and change things. If there's some kind of afterlife, with some kind of deity, I fully intend to bitch that deity out for its unfairness and cruelty.

People have told me for years that "it gets better" but quite honestly, if I have to wait another ten years for it to "get better" I'd quite rather not. Hell would be better than this, and if it's true what the religious guys say about "infinite mercy" then forgive me for refusing to play this sick, twisted game.

I quit.
