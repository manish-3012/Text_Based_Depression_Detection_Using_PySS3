i'm not gonna keep trying foreveri've got nothing to live for, in six years not once i felt ok.

there's time? it can get better? i don't care.

i tried and failed.

maybe i didn't try hard or long enough, but i did what i felt i had to do, if it wasn't enough then it means i'm not meant to live this life.

how long am i supposed to wait, how long am i supposed to suffer, before i'm allowed to not feel this way?

at least it was comfortable when i was in school, but now i also have to work and earn money only to be able to afford to keep suffering? nice.

i was thinking about going homeless and die of starvation, but to be honest it scares me, like the other cheap suicide methods.

i don't consider myself a person anymore because i never developed a personality and i lost all my hobbies and interests, i can't function properly because the only thing my mind is able to handle is the thought of suicide, and i can't kill myself because the only methods i can afford now scares me.

i feel stuck.
