In need of help:I rarely if ever post stuff like this online. But if someone could give some advice or something. I have a very non chalant attitude right now towards death. If it happens to me I don't care. I am not ready to be an adult. I feel like a child. I am going to fail this year of high school and it's my fault funny enough. I don't want to commit suicide as I think it's Pussy shit but the thought of death is great. I don't plan on killing myself but it's definitely in my thoughts.  Advice please
