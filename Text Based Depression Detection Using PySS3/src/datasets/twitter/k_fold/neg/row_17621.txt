I'm done. I'm killing myself today.I've given it a day, a week, a month, I've given it six years and I'm sick of just waiting around hoping everything will go good because it won't and no one wants to admit it. I'm not wasting more time in this world asking for things to get better and having things get worse and worse. I'm sorry if I make people sad but I literally can't do this anymore. Nothing you do will fix anything. Just let me drown.
