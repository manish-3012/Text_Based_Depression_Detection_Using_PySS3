Nearly 30 years and Iâ€™m hoping for itIâ€™m a bit of a puss so taking direct action to do it isnâ€™t in the cards for me but Iâ€™m not avoiding any situation thatâ€™ll cause it.

I just canâ€™t seem to keep the will to keep going. Therapy, meds, self meds, positive thoughts. I canâ€™t seem to find the drive to keep going. Even with my son in the mix I canâ€™t find myself to keep pushing. I dont know what to do
