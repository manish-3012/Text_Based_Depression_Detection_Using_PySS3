PreparationsI'm not interested in being talked down. 

What are some ways to prepare financially for your own death? I'm going to talk to a lawyer tomorrow about ensuring my will is properly drawn up so the wife and kids get whatever life insurance or other things that they should be entitled to. I'm thinking about selling off the guitars and/or musical gear, computers I have so I can have to have a little extra cash on hand when I get my execution plan organized enough.

Is there anything else I should prepare? I just want to tie up any loose ends before I go.
