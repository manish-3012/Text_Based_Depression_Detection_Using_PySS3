Its 3 in the morning &amp; im on my bathroom floorI never stay awake this long. Iâ€™m usually the opposite, sleeping for way longer than I need to. But for whatever reason tonight is different. Iâ€™m in the bathroom of my studio apartment silently crying as not to wake my loving amazing husband who doesnâ€™t deserve to deal with me. Why canâ€™t I see how good my life is. I donâ€™t want to actively kill myself, but I wouldnâ€™t step away from oncoming traffic either. 
I really just want to hurt myself
