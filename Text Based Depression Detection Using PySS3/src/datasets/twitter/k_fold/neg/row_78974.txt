My Heart hurts.I always tried my best but it was never good enough. Not for Family, not for friends, not in love or anything else.

I never wanted to be things the way they are.
Donâ€™t you see.

I tried getting help, but never gotten any.
Itâ€™s been months since Iâ€™ve been trying. 
Never gotten any reply.

Iâ€™ve tried helping myself, but it just made me more lonely and cut open some deep old wounds.

I am so sorry.

My heart hurts.
