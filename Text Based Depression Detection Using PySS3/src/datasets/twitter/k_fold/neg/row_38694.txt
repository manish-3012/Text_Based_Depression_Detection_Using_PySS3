I don't think i can feel emotions right, and it's making me nuts.Yup it's me again, still thinking about dying. According to my parents, i was always a relatively happy child. But after the age of 11 or so, i started noticing something about my emotions. They are all just... off. And really hard to describe. Happiness is just... brief and almost unpleasant. Anger feels like an impulse to do something. Sadness is just like wanting to cry. But recently, i cannot seem to even get those reduced feelings. Everything that made me happy doesn't anymore. I've also tried new things, but those also dont make me feel any happiness. And i cannot reiterate how much i HATE. THIS. I just don't enjoy anything again. It's suffering. Just. Plain. Suffering. Torture even. The only thing i sort of enjoy is sleeping. And even that is getting old. I just don't want to do anything anymore. If anything, doing those old hobbies only serve as a distraction from the suffering. I just don't know what to do anymore. Also, sorry if this was hard to understand. English is not my native language, and describing my issue is really hard as well.
