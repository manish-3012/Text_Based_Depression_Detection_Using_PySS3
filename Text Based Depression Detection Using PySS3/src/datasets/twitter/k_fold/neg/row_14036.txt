I thought College would change my lifeAnd it did. I am now more depressed than I have ever been. 

When I got into my dream college, I thought it was a ticket out of the life I am currently living. But so far, all I've done is mess things up. I am essentially throwing my future away. I've done nothing but make mistakes. Today, I got yet another bad news about how much of a fuck-up I am, and at this point I don't even know how to confront it. I wish I could just walk away from it all.

A girl is finally showing interest in me, and I don't even know how to tell her that I'm terrified of liking her because I don't even know if I'm going to be here next year. 

I don't want anyone in my life to know what a big let down I am. They all have so much hope for me, and all I have to show for it is failure. I know I am blessed to have people like that in my life, and that not everyone can say the same, but this blessing feels like a curse when all I'll ever do is be a let down.
