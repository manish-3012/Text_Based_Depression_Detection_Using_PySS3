I'm thinking about committing suicide because of what I've done and I'm worried of consequences, should I just go ahead and kill myself ?I was depressed and so I made prank calls to a gas station. I said I was gonna light it up on fire and loot it and throw molotov cocktails into it to light it on fire. I am now worried that I'm going to jail for this. I did it twice. I was depressed and wasn't thinking correctly. Should I just go ahead and kill myself ?
