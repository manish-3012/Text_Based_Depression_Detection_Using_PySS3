I'm an angsty teen.Since I was about 7/8 I've known I was a boy despite being born a female. When I was 13 I tried realizing that by telling my mom. She threatened me. I was angsty enough just as a fat teen, my mom blamed reddit and my angst for making me "think I'm a tranny."

I'm 16 now. I've thought about putting a bullet in my head everyday since she started acting like my being trans is ruining her life. She doesn't even admit it anymore, she genuinely believed it just went away. I haven't told her, my dad, nor my brother. They all think I "learned from my mistakes" and poofed myself into a nice little straight girl.

I hate it. This is no life to live. I'm faking 24/7, and the more I fake the more they tell me I'm "being genuine." I didn't realize until recently that they don't say that because it's true, that say that cause what they want to believe is what they will believe, regardless of facts.

Ha. Facts. It always comes back to that with me. I started crying while writing this, so immediately my brain wanted to treat the world like some perfect binary reality. But I guess that's not what I'm talking about.

I don't know what to do. I think I love them, but it's so hard to look past the fact that they're the ones making me pretend to be someone else, someone I hate. I do love myself, but I hate the me I have to pretend to be.

I can't come out again or tell them any of this, either. It wouldn't be safe, but not telling them means the same things happen but at my hands. I finally stopped cutting, but I just bottle it all up and hurt myself in other ways.

No one really cares anyway, though, so I guess I should stop bothering whoever is bored enough to read this. 

P.s. I'm not gonna hurt myself any time soon. Just gonna wish I could.
