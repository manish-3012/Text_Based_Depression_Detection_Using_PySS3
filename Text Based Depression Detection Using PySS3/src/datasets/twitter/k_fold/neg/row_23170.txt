I never thought I'll do it but I can't take it anymoreI have been struggling for a long time. No one around me knows a thing. I am tired of being happy and cheerful in front of everyone.

The person who mattered the most in my life and the one I cared for the most told me that she doesn't care about me. She threw me out of her life after everything I have done.
