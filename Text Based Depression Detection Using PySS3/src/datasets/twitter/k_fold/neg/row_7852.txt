What are you supposed to do when you realize that the best is already behind you?The last time I was thoroughly happy, I was in early Freshman year of high school. It's been over five years. I will never regain that innocence. I will never regain the happiness I once felt because now I know the truth about the world and have enough experience to know that it will never be the same. I'll never have the friendships I used to have. Never have the hope I used to have, nor the optimism.
