Everyone just says not to.Had to break up with my ex boyfriend of 2 years who I loved to pieces but turned out to have a severe issue regarding sex (morality was effected), was my first relationship and have been in therapy now learning I was being sexually abused the whole time. So Iâ€™m dealing with a broken heart over the whole thing over someone who just did all this stuff to me and itâ€™s just so upsetting. 

Now Iâ€™m getting an apartment and going to school this fall and there is absolutely no light in my life at all. He was the light and it was all just wrong. 

The world just is a horrible place and donâ€™t trust anyone anymore. I donâ€™t ever want a relationship with someone ever again and I never want to learn about what true intimacy means.

Iâ€™ve been working on myself a lot with the school plans and apartment plans and itâ€™s just financial stress, I canâ€™t even smoke my electronic cigarette anymore because itâ€™s too expensive for me. I canâ€™t even eat food I like.
All I do is work and go to the ATM to take out money for therapy, doctors visits for medication, and more work. I barley sleep now and when I do I have nightmares, and I just am rushed around everywhere all the time. 

I canâ€™t even do my job correctly anymore because Iâ€™m under so much stress and have so much pain that I forget what Iâ€™m doing at the job Iâ€™ve worked for 2 years. I keep misplacing my things and forgetting things. 

My therapist wants me to go to outpatient but I canâ€™t because I donâ€™t have the money for that. This world is just messed up. Maybe itâ€™s supposed to be this way.
