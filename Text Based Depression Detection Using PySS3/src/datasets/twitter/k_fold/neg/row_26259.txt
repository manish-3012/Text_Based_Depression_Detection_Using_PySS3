Tonight may be the nightBeen trying to actually let my self pass out from a partial hanging this night, I get really dizzy and lightheaded and get scared and loosen it. Don't really know what totally triggered this, cause today was actually a pretty okay day. I think I'm just tired, and after 10 years I don't really see things getting better. I slowly cause all my relationships to crumble, and I just can't handle being left anymore. 

Wish I could tell someone I know without them calling the cops. I wrote everyone a note. I think fear might stop me but I'm planning on going through with it. Thanks everyone.
