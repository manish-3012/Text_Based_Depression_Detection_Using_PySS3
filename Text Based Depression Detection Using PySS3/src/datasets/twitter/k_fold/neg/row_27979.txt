I'll probably kill myself tomorrowI'm done with my life. No one gives a fuck and the ones who used to care (or at least I think they cared) are far from me because I isolated myself.

there's no reason for me to live anymore. I don't feel exactly ready to die but I don't want to wait

I should be studying and thinking about which university I want to go, instead I'm researching about ways to die. I'm wasting my life but there's nothing else I want to do.

I'm afraid I'll fail and be disabled or end up having an even worse life
