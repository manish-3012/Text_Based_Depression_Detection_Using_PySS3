1 year.Iâ€™ve been out of psych care for 1 year. 
And Iâ€™m well and coping with life. 

This is very exciting for me as I was bpd and self harmed and was suicidal for around 10 years. 

Itâ€™s so good to be free from it. For those feeling suicidal and rubbish. In a spiral that you just canâ€™t seem to get out of it is possible. 

Good luck out there
