I just wish I never existedIâ€™m a 19 year old with a chronic illness and I havenâ€™t been to a party or made any friends at all for many years. I just wish I never existed, never had any consciousness, never was born to be such a burden to everyone around me. Literally the one thing that has stopped me from making a proper full commitment attempt is my mum, but now she is justifiably mad at me so yeah idk
