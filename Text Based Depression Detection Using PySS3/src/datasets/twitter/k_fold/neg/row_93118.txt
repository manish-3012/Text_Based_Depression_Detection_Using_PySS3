A message for those who want to end it.Whenever one of you thinks of ending it ask yourself this:

But what about tomorrow? Do you know what it holds? There is always tomorrow, always a chance to change, a chance to drop everyone and everything and run away, a chance to MAKE tomorrow what you want it to be. Do you really want to throw away tomorrow? What if tomorrow you were able to find happiness. What if tomorrow you meet someone who accepts you for who you are. What if tomorrow there was a home for you where there wasnâ€™t one before. What if your luck turns around? Donâ€™t forget about tomorrow folks. There is always tomorrow.
