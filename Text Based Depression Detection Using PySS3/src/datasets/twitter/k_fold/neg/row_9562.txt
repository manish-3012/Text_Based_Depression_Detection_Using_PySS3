I'm ready to dieI apologize in advance if what I'm about to say is incoherent; I have ADD and I'm currently intoxicated by my Clonazepam. (Which was prescribed for Social Anxiety.) Anyway, as the title says, I've finally built-up the courage to attempt suicide. I've devised a plan and all that's left is to acquire the materials required to execute it.

I'm a loser - plain and simple. My severe dyscalulia prevents me from being able to complete any Math classes. I have tremendous difficulty connecting with other individuals. Maybe if I was more intelligent and socially adept, I would be able get somewhere. But I know my life won't amount to anything, so I'm just going to end my pathetic life.

It brings pain to my heart knowing that I'll hurt the few people who I associate with, but I can't bear it anymore. I feel hollow and dead all the time; I can't seem to ever feel alive. I'm consumed by darkness and the only light is suicide.
