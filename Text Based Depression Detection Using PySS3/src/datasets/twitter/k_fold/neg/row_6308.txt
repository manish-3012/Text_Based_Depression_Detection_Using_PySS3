Trying not to end itIâ€™ve tried to live with the mental shit stew in my brain and the only thing that Iâ€™ve found that works is alcohol. Iâ€™m writing this as Iâ€™m drunk on bourbon and it simultaneously makes me happier and sadder. Iâ€™m such a fuckup and nothing seems to go right. I didnâ€™t have any trauma in my life and my childhood was great, but it seems like Iâ€™ve become a ghost. I feel so detached from reality and I can barely function from day to day.
