I'm so disappointed in humanity that I would rather be dead than be called a human.So, first of all I'm white. I've been going on Twitter recently and all I see are how white people abused black people and that I'm worthless for being white. It's all I can think about. I've never been racist to anyone I try my best not to be but I feel horrible for just existing.   I know that Twitter and subreddits like r/Antihatecommunities are just bullshit but its really taken a toll on me.
