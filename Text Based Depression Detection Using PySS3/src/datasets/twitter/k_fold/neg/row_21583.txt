I'm bad at the game we call life and want to press the quit button.I honestly don't see a point in my life anymore, I'm 23 and for the past 5 years I've been trying to get into collage with no success. I'm living with my parents and they hate me to guts, especially my father who probably will throw me out of the house any day now.

 Both my parents expect too much from me and these expectation are weighing me down and they keep comparing me to my best friend, who now has finished collage with a international business degree and will soon get married, as much as I'm happy for him this just makes me depressed. Not only that but both of my younger siblings are out of the house and also in collage. I got fired a few months ago from my job as a mailman, I've lost contact with everyone I knew and barely spoke to anyone but my family since new years eve.

 I have no idea what to do with my life; no future plans, no dreams, no expectation, I don't know where I see myself in 5 year let alone next week, every decision I've made in life seems to be the wrong one. I feel like failure as a human being and I'm now considering doing society a favor and commit suicide, I'm not taking this lightly and thats why I'm here.
