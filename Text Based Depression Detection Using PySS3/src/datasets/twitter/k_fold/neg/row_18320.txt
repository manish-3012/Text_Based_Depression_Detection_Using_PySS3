Iâ€™ve been having negative thoughts about myself a lot, and itâ€™s reaching a point where I just want to die because that feels like the only option to make the hurting stop.Everyday, no matter what Iâ€™m doing, there will always be these negative thoughts in my head that just leave me unmotivated and depressed. It angers me because I canâ€™t find a reason as to what triggers these thoughts. They started three years ago after being in an emotionally/physically abusive and controlling relationship. At first I felt like I was stuck with him, and it caused me to lose all of my friends so I was alone and felt like I only had him(high school). After that relationship, I was just mistreated a lot and isolated from everyone until a few months ago where Iâ€™ve been doing a little bit better. Until recently, where Iâ€™ve been having some episodes of depression to the point where I keep scratching the same spot on my arm really hard (Iâ€™m too scared to actually cut myself with something else). I should be happy with what I have right now, but Iâ€™m so pathetic that I create more stress for the people in my life that are trying to help me. I just feel like this burden holding everyone back from being happy and that I donâ€™t deserve this â€œhappinessâ€, although it honestly feels fake and that Iâ€™m living life as if Iâ€™m some robot, or in a dream(does anyone else feel this way?). I canâ€™t find things that make me happy, itâ€™s just hurt all the time and I just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore.  Iâ€™m so scared of actually trying to kill myself again(Iâ€™ve tried to overdose two times back when I was in my graduating year of high school) but at this rate Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to do it all over again.
