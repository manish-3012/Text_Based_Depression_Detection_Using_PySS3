How to overcome the fear to fail killing meI have to admit that... I have a good life, good money, perfect family and education. I'm 26 and I have my life fix in terms of money but... I want to die

Not everything has to be bad to think in that choice you know that...

I want to die but I have fear of being alive and "vegetable" or disable for the rest of my life. Even a shot in the head painless is a not sure option to die

When I overcome that fear, I'll do it

Any tips to do it?
