Suicidal and LonelyI've been struggling with anxiety and depression for several years and have kept it to myself, but now im at the lowest I've ever been and i know i wont make it if i dont get help. I just dont find happiness in anything anymore, i hate myself, and im so lonely. My best friend whos the only one i really feel comfortable around moved away and i dont have anyone i could talk to without feeling guilty. Im struggling with college and money and relationships and im so overwhelmed, im at my limit. People always say to just hang in there because things will get better, but theyve gotten far worse. When im drunk i hate myself even more and ive attempted suicide twice while wasted. I used to be worried that id get blackout drunk and kill myself but now im not worried and have even started to plan for it. I think about suicide constantly. I feel so lost and alone and i just want it all to be over.
