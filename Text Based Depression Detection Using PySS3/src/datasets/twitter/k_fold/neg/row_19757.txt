Everyone loves to say "get help" but no one has anything to say when the "help" doesn't do anything to help.I've seen therapists, multiple doctors, tried more meds than I can count, and my life has only gotten worse. "Get help", "Reach out"... well I fucking did that, now what. I'm expected to exist in this indefinitely miserable state until I'm lucky enough that something kills me, such bullshit. I guess I'll abuse drugs/alcohol for as long as I can. Probably should have done that in the first place, would have saved me a lot of stress and anxiety. If it wasn't for my pets I wouldn't see tomorrow, not sure how long my pets will be able to delay the inevitable. Shit is just hopeless.
