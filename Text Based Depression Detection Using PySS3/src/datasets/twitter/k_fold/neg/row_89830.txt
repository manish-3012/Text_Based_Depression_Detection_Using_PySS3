About to be homeless in a cold placeMy lease at my current shithole housing situation is up at the end of December. I lost my one chance at a dream job (which would have saved my life even before COVID) before my start date due to COVID, and all my work experience was in a now dead industry. I somehow fucked up my unemployment application so now I owe thousands of dollars I donâ€™t have I back to the government, along with the many thousands of dollars in student loan debt set to snowball in January. I have preexisting medical conditions that make me a prime candidate for the strokes/heart damage symptoms if I actually catch the virus (which is likely once Iâ€™m homeless), and no family to house me but a temporary offer from a friend to crash on her couch for a bit. 

Every single one of the hundreds of jobs Iâ€™ve applied to has turned me down, and any easier/more accessible job in the service industry wouldnâ€™t  even remotely begin to pay off my mountain of debt. Iâ€™m exhausted. I think more and more itâ€™s time to slit them deep and bleed out. Better than freezing to death on a park bench next month, and better than slaving away at a wage that barely dents my debt. Iâ€™d just be staving off my future inability to retire, an early death of sorts anyway... Iâ€™m not usually a depressed person, but Iâ€™m at the end of my rope. Iâ€™ve truly got nothing to live for once this short time I have left sleeping on someone elseâ€™s broken mattress is up.
