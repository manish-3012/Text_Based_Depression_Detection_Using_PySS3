People would want me dead anywayVery brief background, and sorry for being vague on the details: I have a form of OCD that makes me scared of hurting kids. If people knew the sorts of things that went on in my head, most would think that the world would be a better place without me around. Context wouldn't make a fucking difference, it'd just be "how can you think that? You need a bullet" for most people.

I can't help being like this; there's nothing I want more than for these thoughts to be gone. But here we are, and I feel terrible about both the thoughts themselves and how I process them pretty much constantly. The worst part is that I can't talk to anyone openly about this. For a start, I don't have time or the sufficient self-worth to actually approach a health professional, and even if I did, I couldn't actually say what was really happening without risking undue drama if what I said was misinterpreted. 

So I guess it's time to draw a line. I really don't want to, but I just feel like I'm out of options. I really don't want to be alive anymore when all I have to look forward to is a dramatic crash and months of crippling anxiety and self-hatred any time I have the audacity to think that I have a future. Please talk me out of it.
