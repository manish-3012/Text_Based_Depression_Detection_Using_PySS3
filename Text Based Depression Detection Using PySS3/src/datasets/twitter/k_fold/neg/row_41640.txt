I'm going to kill myself once one of my cats diesIt's as simple as that. I'm tired. I'm tired of watching people leave and die. They're old and possibly on their last legs.

I promised myself this a while ago, but I got into a relationship. I had close friends. I forgot about it.

Now I won't forget. I'm going to kill myself once one of them dies. I'm not going to lie to myself twice
