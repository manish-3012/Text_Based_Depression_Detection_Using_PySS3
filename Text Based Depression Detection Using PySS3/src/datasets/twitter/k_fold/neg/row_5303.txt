Overwhelmed and LostI have a great wife, amazing friends, supportive family, yadda yadda yadda, but I feel awful regularly. At 29, I've dealt with this for longer than I can remember. Suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, and a general feeling that my world is slowly crashing around me run through my head, and they become self fulfilling. I shut myself away from my patient, caring wife and make her feel lonely and she deserves nothing of what I give her. It feels like I've trapped her in this shit life of mine and she can't get out for fear of me doing something foolish like end it all. I don't have plans, but I constantly think about death. I don't fear it. As some one who thinks about it as often as I do, I almost welcome it. A car crash or crazy fuck with an AK shooting up my place of work sound comforting.   

I've let my depression stop me from being a good person. My wife recently lost some one extremely close to her to cancer and during her grieving period I was distant and closed off. I can be an asshole a lot of the time, but as I look back on how I acted, I feel a sense of shame I have never felt before. I don't want to tell her about my suicidal thoughts, because I don't think she can handle losing some close to her so soon. I refrain from acting on my thoughts because the reality is that the people around me care so much that their lives would be seriously impacted. And I love them all so much that I couldn't do that to them. But I'm afraid that at some point I may reconsider and be selfish old me again. Seeking professional help is confusing, complicated, and downright expensive. 

One of these days I hope to get better.
