When all you can think of is suicide, is there anything i can do to do make them fadeI often (pretty much everyday) get suicidal thoughts, like really strong thoughts, makes me break down and want to think spontaneously to do something about it. The result would be heartbreaking on family, I've also thought about making my suicide an "accident" to lessen the pain on others but still get the result I so desperately want. I feel hopeless and useless day in day out. What's the point in living like this, I'm merely existing in this shitty world, I try my best with people it gets thrown back at me, academically speaking I'm not that great either, I scrape by in everything. How do I get thoughts to the back of my mind so I can at least think straight towards something, I'm on medication and have been through 2 different ones and I'm not noticing any difference. Thank you in advance for bothering to read my nonsense
