Thinking about suicide because I'm a virgin?I don't really know what I am posting this since it kinda sounds stupid ... I am currently a 19 year old kissless virgin and I'm thinking about suicide because I believe I don't deserve to live. I don't look that bad or anything its just that I don't talk to people that much. Almost everyone in my friend group gets laid and everything, and sometimes I get made fun of for being a virgin. That fact that I am a virgin makes me feel worthless, since no girl has ever been interested in me all. I don't have any confidence or self esteem. I dont really have any good qualities at all. I guess sometimes this feeling escalates and I come to suicide and ending my life because I don't believe I will ever find a girl that likes me. This probably comes up in my head four times per week. I really just don't know what to do and I remembered this subreddit.
