Because I can't get a hold of a gun or pillsI'm a former overachiever and recent college grad and school is all I've ever been good at. I'm insecure about everything from my body image, my intelligence, my social life, my finances, entering the field I studied in, and my home life sucks and my parents are making it damn clear they don't want me around. I have nowhere else to go and my crippling self doubt makes it damn near impossible to create any opportunities to look forward to. I've been wanting to not be alive for a while now, but this summer has been the first time I could actually visualize myself ending my own life, and I've recently developed a feasible plan. What's keeping me from buying antifreeze and chugging it on my next day off (other than my current bank account balance)?
