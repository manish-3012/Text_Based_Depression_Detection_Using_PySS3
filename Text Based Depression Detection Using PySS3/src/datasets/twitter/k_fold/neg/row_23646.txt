I'm scared.I honestly don't know why I feel like this today. Today was good. The last month or so has been good. This evening I've gone back to feeling randomly teary, stressed and panicky. I've spent half of this evening pulling my hair out, which really isn't good. I keep thinking about drinking a load of antihisthamine, it probably won't kill me, but the fact I keep thinking about it is scaring me. I probably won't get much sleep, but the longer I'm awake, the more likely I am to do it. I'm terrified.
