I can't even do this properly....The cuts on my arm stopped bleeding after a few minutes, and I'm too much of a coward to slit my throat. I don't even have a good reason to try to kill myself, just low self-esteem I guess. It's pathetic, really. I suppose I should go someplace they can keep an eye on me, but I dread my family's reaction; they were just angry at me last time, and after some drama lately I wouldn't be surprised if they just stopped talking to me altogether. I was suicidal less than 2 hours ago, and now I just want to go to bed, but I don't want to sleep because of recurring nightmares and sleep paralysis.... I'm completely useless, so weak physically I can barely help out around the house; I think the only reason they keep me around is for the rent money. Ah, well.
