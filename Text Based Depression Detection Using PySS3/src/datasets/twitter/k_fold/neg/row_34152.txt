My mother keeps telling me to just do itI broke down. Told. Her school overwhelms me. It's too much work. I miss abouf half of the time because I am too sick to attent, I get no accommodations and I am also. Dyslexic.
I get graded like a person who can read and write normally and is able to attent every class.
It's so much work. It's too much work. I can't do it. I am literally dying. Being crushed from it.
I see the amount and just shut down.
I wanted help. Comfort.
She told me to. Shut drop put and stop being a bitch about it. That she has it worse. Then she went on an hour kong rant about how I ruined her life.

If I don't get a university placement by june I will. Drop out of my healthcare and loose my meds and probably die of multiple organ failure because they cost 4600â‚¬ a month.
Bht I am failing hs.

Better tk just end it quick and painless imstesd kf lpng and drawn our.
J'd rather take a jump off a building than organ failure.

I am crying rm. Sory for the bed spelling.

I can't g3t help. My parents will call me a bitch. Teachers will tell my parents. I have no friends.

I can't anymore. I can't i can"t. Evry other day is a breakdown. This is too much stress. 3 exams a week, at least 3-4h homework a day and a ton of projects. Constant stress and fear.
And I have to teach myself because I can't go to school.

I can't sleep. Too much stress. I can't concentrate. Too much panick.
