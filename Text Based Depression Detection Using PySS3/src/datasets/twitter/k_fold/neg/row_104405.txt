god, what's wrong with me?I don't know what it is, but for some reason, I'm constantly stressed. I constantly feel like I'm in fight or flight mode and I just can't shake it. its been hell. I can't sleep. I can't focus. I can't do anything. I constantly feel like there's something wrong. I usually have my headphones on, and when I hear my mom make any sound from the other room I just get super panicky and stressed. if she closes the fridge I get the same feeling as if I heard a gunshot. you know the trial of the labyrinth of BOTW? there's this room in the bottom of it, where if you make too loud of a sound it'll wake up all of these guardians, and they'll attack you. I constantly feel like I'm in that room. I hate it. I didn't use to be like this. I wasn't always so fucking panicky. I hate it so much. I can't calm down. I can't do anything this is hell. it constantly feels like there's something bad behind my back but I can't turn around fast enough to catch it. I don't want to feel this way anymore. there hasn't been a day where I haven't thought about killing myself.  this is just too much for me to handle. I told my mom I was having "bad thoughts again" and for some reason, she went straight to "is it about hurting me or the dog???" wow gee that's so helpful. I know she knows I've been having suicidal thoughts so why would she go there? I don't want to keep feeling like this. I'm in my room right now but it doesn't feel like my room. I want to go home but I am home. god, I feel so insane. I hate it. I feel like everything out to get me. I feel like everything going to collapse on me. I don't want to be alive anymore. even when I try to relax I cant keep feeling this way. why were we all so happy when we were kids? what made us so ok?
