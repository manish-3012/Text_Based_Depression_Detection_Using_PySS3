This year has been the best year of my life but I keep falling back to just thinking about killing myselfI guess I just wanna be happy but I feel like 50% of the time i just wanna end it. I feel to embarrassed/scared to talk about cause I feel like I'm over reacting all the time. And while I dont think I'm gonna do it lately ive been getting just short of going in the motion. I think I have a problem but I dont know who to go to. A couple of my friends notice but I usually just say I'm fine or I'm tired. I just dont get it
