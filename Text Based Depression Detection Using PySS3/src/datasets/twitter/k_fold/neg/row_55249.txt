Tired of this garbage.Maybe you think this is a troll account but i don't fucking care, ill just vent anway...

I can't stand this subreddit. It makes me sick to my stomach and angry to read these comments. I'm tired of hearing "It will get better" "please don't do it" "think of your family"

I hate it because its complete bullshit. You are all fucking crazy for wanting to live in this world. You give half assed regurgitated garbage about life being meaningful.

I'm tired of this. I dont like life, and I dont like this society. In fact I have it pretty well off. an amazing support system and people who care. Therapy and medication. It doesn't matter because I just don't like life. I Don't like trying or working or caring for other people. This is the real reason for my depression and any amount of therapy and medication isn't going to help that fact.

It makes me so angry that im considered the one with the "brain disease " or im "Just not thinking clearly" you can all go fuck yourselves.

And it makes me angry that I can't just fucking quietly check out in a hospital bed surrounded by my family and girlfriend and go painlessly. No because you all want me to "be happy" and live life, because it challenges your fragile lives that someone might just genuinely not enjoy living.

So now i have to go fucking jump in front of a train by myself and alone just because you all re too fucking selfish to realize this.
