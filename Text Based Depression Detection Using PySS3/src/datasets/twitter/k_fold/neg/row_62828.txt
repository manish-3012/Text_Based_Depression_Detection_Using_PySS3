I'm ready to goI just feel ready. Long story short, I've made peace with my death. I've had a daydream "vision" of what my death looked like, and it frightened me. I left work early from how much it scared me. I spent the afternoon crying harder than I've ever cried before - almost as if I was pre-mourning my own loss.

But now I feel ready. I don't know how I'd do it, or when. I'm too afraid of pain, so that rules out a lot of methods. But I just know I'm ready 

My survival instinct is grasping at straws - I can feel it. "If I don't care about myself, then why not care about others? Is that not the calling in life for some people, anyway? Maintain my physical body only for the purpose of helping others?"

I fire back - "I'm sure others will get along fine without me. Besides, if anything, I'm an emotional drain on others. I'm too depressed all the time. There's no way I make good company."

I can't find a reason - any reason at all - for why my existence is valuable

My childhood consisted of my single parent telling me I don't matter. Maybe they were right. The damage caused early on has finally reached its breaking point

I'm currently living one minute at a time, but it's only because my physical body can still walk and talk and drive. If I'm unable to do any of those things soon, then I'll end everything right then and there. But for now, I just feel ready. I don't know what's holding me back. But I feel more at peace than I have in years. I don't know what I think I'm waiting for, if anything. Maybe it's just anticipation. Sort of like getting a flu shot - can't predict the exact millisecond the needle will penetrate, but you know it's soon, and you're physically and emotionally ready for it. I think that's where I am right now.
