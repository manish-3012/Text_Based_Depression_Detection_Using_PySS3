My mind fucks with me so much. I donâ€™t want to kill myself. I just feel nothing at all.Iâ€™m 20 years old.. Iâ€™m a college student fixing to go into my junior year at TAMU. Anyways I donâ€™t see the point of living this life. Whatâ€™s the point of getting a degree and working for the rest of my life just to fucking get old and die anyways. I just feel so fucking empty, I literally feel nothing. I have so much hate towards this so called God we all believe in, itâ€™s make no fucking sense for us to suffer here man.. Iâ€™m so done.  I actually feel guilty writing this on this page right now. I had it good growing up, my parents gave me literally everything. I guess I just need some support right now. Please...
