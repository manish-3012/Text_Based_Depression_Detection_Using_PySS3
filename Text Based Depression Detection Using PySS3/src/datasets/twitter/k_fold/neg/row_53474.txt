Was doing okay but I was just kidding myselfI moved to a new city for some reason or another. I don't even know the reason anymore. It wasn't for school because i dropped out. It wasn't for work because I'm working at a place that gives me anxiety every time I walk through the door. And it wasn't for any kind of relationship because my girlfriend broke up with me when I first moved 

If I hadn't have moved I would be on track for school, working at a job I enjoyed and would still be with my Ex. I miss her a lot. I thought I was doing okay but I'm crying for the first time in months. All this work for nothing.

It's below freezing right now. I could go for a drive and wrap myself around a pole. It's secluded enough where I live.

I turn 20 in week or two but I just don't think I can make it
