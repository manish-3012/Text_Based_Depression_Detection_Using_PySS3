please help me.I'm a teenage girl, and I live in Florida. Recently I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and was prescribed medicine (Zoloft). I never thought it'd get this far, I never thought my cutting would get to the point where I can't even wear shorts, or short sleeve shirts. I used to be a happy child, until I started growing up, and realizing things that had happened to me, that shouldn't have. I was molested by my father when I was 4, he was an alcoholic. I was also molested by another family member from the age of 5 to 7. Growing up, I had a very abusive childhood, my grandmother, the person who raised me was verbally, and physically abusive to me. My mother was always there for me, up until the age of 12. That's when everything went downhill, she started drinking more because of a failed relationship of 10 years that she had, and she took everything out on me. Every little thing I did seemed to piss her off, and she would just hit me until she got tired. That's when I started cutting. And that was the age that I had my first suicide attempt. I tried to overdose on pills, and consumed 2 bottles of blood pressure medicine that were my grandmas. Nothing happened. I stopped cutting for many years, and tried to push away my suicidal thoughts, and my sadness. 4 months ago, my mom started verbally abusing me again, but she hasn't hit me ever since she had DCF called on her. She's the one person I thought would be there for me, and I guess I thought wrong. I'm sitting here with my bloody wrists, thinking of whether or not I should go for the medicine cabinet again. Is it really my fault, that all these things have to happen to me? Am I really that worthless?
