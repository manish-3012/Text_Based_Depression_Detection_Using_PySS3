Just suicidal and need to talkI just want to die honestly. I'm 14F and just feeling like honestly nobody cares. My friends feel superficial and I feel like my mum is always picking fights over nothing (I'm a really non-confrontational person but you don't have her side of the story, it probably is me). I'm quite popular but honestly I don't think any of my friends really care. I told my (supposed) friend how I was feeling, he rang my house and my mum screamed at me. She just assumed it wasn't true I guess, maybe she didn't want to believe it. I get good grades and am on track to get A* in my upcoming physics GCSE. I used to have genuine philosophical conversations with adults but now all they care to talk about is schoolwork. Honestly, it just feels like living is more trouble than it's worth and I'm just looking to hear that it isn't. That's all, really. Sorry.
