itâ€™s my time.Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself so many times and I canâ€™t go through the exhaustion and pain of failing again. I need something quick and easy, preferably painless but Iâ€™m willing to do anything. How can I end this pain and suffering? Itâ€™s unbearable. Iâ€™ve been to hospitals, therapy, medicine and nothing works. Iâ€™m tired of living, tired of being a waste of space, tired of hurting others. How can I kill myself?
