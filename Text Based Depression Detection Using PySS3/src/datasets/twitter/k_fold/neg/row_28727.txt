All I want to do is die but I can never go fully through with itA few hours ago I tried to drown myself, but it was too painful and my lungs kept screaming for air. A few months ago I tied a noose and was going to hang myself but I couldnâ€™t do it and the noose was found. Every time something bad happens or when my depression gets to me Iâ€™m filled with regret that I didnâ€™t end it when I could. All I do anymore is cry and panic and get yelled at by my parents. My mother keeps saying sheâ€™ll get me help but she never does. I canâ€™t take this anymore, it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse, and Iâ€™m so, so hopeless.
