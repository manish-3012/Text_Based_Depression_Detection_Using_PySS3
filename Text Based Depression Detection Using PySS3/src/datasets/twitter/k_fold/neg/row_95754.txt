RantMy mother just told me that she and my father are thinking about throwing me out to go to an asylum (a place where people live together who can't live with their parents for whatever reason) This just gave me the rest. I didn't say anything and went into my dark room, staring out into the night city. Thinking about suicide. About ending this miserable existence. About slitting my wrist or maybe building an exit bag to suffocate peacefully. And now I decided to make a rant about my life on reddit.
My last year has been hell. I finished high school and was kind of happy for a while. Then things started going downhill, I started isolating myself because of my acne and I started smoking weed to distract myself, which made the isolation and social anxiety worse. (If you are struggling or feeling down, don't do drugs, it will not make anything better and probably just make things worse, only do drugs if you are happy and mentally healthy)
I had to start doing a mandatory job for my country (civil service) and things were going a bit better but I ended up getting fired after a few months over a stupid thing. Things went even further downhill from there, I completely isolated myself and rarely went outside my house anymore for half a year up till now. But I was completely in denial about my situation, I pretended everything was okay and that I was happy and I just did nothing and smoked weed and sat infront of my PC all day. My parents obviously think I'm a loser/failure, they are annoyed of me and I understand them. I can count the friends I have left on one hand and never even meet them. On top of that I have dealt with ADHD and bullying all throughout school. I am traumatised from the start. I suffer from several mental health issues: ADHD, social anxiety, depression (sometimes manic), paranoia, mild derealization and depersonalization and a generally distraught psyche, I feel like I'm going more insane each day. I can't sleep well and often have nightmares that show me my subconscious suffering and self loathing and fears. (I became more and more self aware and self analytical, which just made things even worse)
I am always tired and exhausted, my head always hurts and feels groggy to the point I want to smash it into concrete. Also I am extremely insecure about looking like im 14 or 15 when I'm almost 19, about my pale skin from staying inside all day, about my eye circles from never sleeping well, about my acne leftovers and about my hair and I am so insecure that I don't even want to go to the barber. And in 1-2 months I should start going to college, which I absolutely can't imagine happening at the moment. I really just want to get out of this weird existence, it would be so much easier, I hate that I have friends and family that would miss me, it's like you are trapped in this suffering through your loved ones. Also I have lost my faith in god over this past year, which has made everything so much worse. I became completely nihilistic. Why am I here? I'm just an intelligent monkey that randomly appeared in this universe, just to suffer. Why? Anyways, I just wanted to rant my heart out and am feeling better already. Maybe somebody can talk to me or leave me a comment, idk. Oh just a cherry on top: I had a crush in high school and she kinda liked me and we even got close one time when we were drunk, but nothing more happened. She now has a boyfriend and is happy while I am just thinking about that evening all the time in my isolated suffering. I am obviously still a virgin, didn't even have my first kiss, I am almost 19, WTF is wrong with me. Inside me I feel like I have this potential for love and sexuality, I feel like if I just had a girl and was normal/confident, we would be so happy together and I would give her all of my love and try to make her happy. I wish I could reset my life or just get a different one, because I love life itself, just not mine.
PS: Sorry for the unorganized rant and for my english, it's not my first language.
