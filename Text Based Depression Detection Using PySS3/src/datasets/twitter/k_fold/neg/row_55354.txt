No one would miss me. No one would know I'm gone.Sorry for being a bother, but I've posted here many times before, so all that info is in my profile if you're so inclined, but I wouldn't waste your time. Since then, I've been on constant medication and seeing therapists and my psychiatrist, even being admitted into an institution, but I still have this feeling gnawing away at my insides. This voice that keeps telling me to end it all, because no one would even notice. I've recently had this feeling that there is some one following me, and a couple of those times, they were legitimate. Not really sure what to do at this point. My original plan is to end it on my 18th birthday, which is the 31st of March. As that date gets closer, it makes all the more tempting.
