SomeoneI'm terrified. I'm actually terrified. Please I don't know if this is a cry for help or if I am going to but I have the urge to die. I have no doubt. I will kill myself. I need people, someone, anyone, distract me. Actually, that's a lot to ask and I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry to involve all of you, I need to delete this. I'm talking to myself now and the walls are spinning and everything is blue. I have no where else to go. I think I will. I think I might at least. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have done this. Please. I don't know what I'm asking for, just please.
