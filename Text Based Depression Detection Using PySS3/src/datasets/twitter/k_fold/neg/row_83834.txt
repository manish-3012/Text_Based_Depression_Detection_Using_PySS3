Things I'm going to tell my therapist the next time I start counselling-	Iâ€™m taking an antidepressant and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s working for me 


-	Sometimes I canâ€™t focus. This makes my anxiety out of control. During the year I could handle it because I was taking a reduced course load (BECAUSE OF MY STRESS AND ANXIETY. I HAD TO WITHDRAW FROM A CORE COURSE) so I had time to make up for days that I couldnâ€™t work. I had one of these days in the second week of the summer term, however, the circumstances were a little bit different. We had class for a minimum of eight hours a day, most of the time consecutively with no break for lunch, plus all of the homework and tests that come along with it. We were basically working two full time jobs. So, when I had a day that I couldnâ€™t work, it completely sent me over the edge in a way that I had never experienced before. I thought, maybe Iâ€™ll go to my room and cry it out. No. this did not work. I ended up sitting on the floor thinking about wanting to die in that moment, thinking about the knives that I had stashed away in my drawer. I wanted it all to end. After three days, I still hadnâ€™t come down from it. I was thinking about killing myself in ever class, any time I spent doing homework, lying in bed awake at night. This was not, and is not okay.


-	Sometimes I feel like I might be blowing things out of proportion. I feel like everyone experiences this and that I should just get over it, like my issues arenâ€™t worthy of seeing a medical professional. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m subconsciously using poor mental health and self worth as an excuse to drop a class that I think is hard or that Iâ€™m not doing well in, like somehow trying to justify it to myself. I donâ€™t know if I downplay things or if I actually have a problem


-	The biggest cause of insecurity and low self worth right now is underachieving in school. I feel like I destroyed anything good that I ever built up for myself by transferring schools. My average dropped &gt;30% from first year to second year (went from having a 3.9 GPA in first year engineering to having a 2.5 GPA), and I canâ€™t lower my standards any more than I already have and it bothers me so fucking much. My confidence is gone. I canâ€™t perform on tests. I canâ€™t tell anymore if I actually know my shit, or if Iâ€™m trying to lull myself into a false sense of preparedness, convincing myself that Iâ€™ve done enough, that I am enough, that I put in enough effort and work, or if Iâ€™m just bad at tests. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s my mental health thatâ€™s making it as difficult as it is to get through this with grades that Iâ€™m okay with, or if Iâ€™m actually just stupid and not capable of making it through this degree.


-	I feel trapped in my body. I donâ€™t want to do anything. Iâ€™m not motivated anymore to do anything because I feel like Iâ€™m not capable of it, and that Iâ€™m just going to fail anyway. I donâ€™t see a point. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m going to contribute anything to the world, or that Iâ€™m going to feel fulfilled with what Iâ€™m doing. All Iâ€™m going to do in this is end up with a job so that I can pay to live and thatâ€™s it. Thereâ€™s. no. fucking. Point. I donâ€™t want to die. I just want to not exist. I want to not feel trapped living this life, but I canâ€™t escape it.


-	Sleeping is my favourite time because I canâ€™t feel any of my anxiety or depression. When Iâ€™m asleep Iâ€™m not aware of any of this.
