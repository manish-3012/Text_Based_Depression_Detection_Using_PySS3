[Help]This more than likely will be automatically deleted but I just need to get it out. My boyfriend of 8 months gives absolutely no fucks about how I feel. He knows I'm suicidal but yet everything always has to be about him. No matter what I'm going through. He doesn't care. He always flips it to be about him. Every. Single. Time. No one in my family cares. Neither do my friends. I'm ready to end it all. I just need to figure out how to do it.
