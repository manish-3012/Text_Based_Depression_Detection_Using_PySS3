They say "ask for help" and "reach out, talk to people you're never alone" thats some bullshitIts like what the fuck they gonna say, "you are loved and appreciated" whatever they saying that because its the only natural thing they dont know what I feeling, they cant possibly know and if they did theyd just say "oh hang in there it gets better" bullshit
