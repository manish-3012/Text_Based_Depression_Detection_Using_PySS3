i feel like an imposterthe feeble mask that i wear to hid the oceans of inky black tears slowly chips apart and crumbles into pieces of sand. a spiderweb of cracks and fractures grace the ice cold disguise i hold in front of my disfigured face. cries of a wounded dog echo from my mouth late into the cold autumn air as i yearn for someone to tend to my bleeding wounds. a life that once was vibrant and as warm as a summer's day quickly turns distant as winter creeps closer. a dark withering mass begins to reach it slimy black tentacles towards my outstretched hands. its swirly bottomless eyes pull me into the neverending void of death. embarking on the next journey begins to be my only thoughts as i swim into those evil, yet inviting, snake eyes. the great unknown. the final destination. inner peace. a peaceful trip leaving behind undescribable pain and suffering of the mortal world seems too easy. an easy solution to all of this puny worlds insignificant problems. in the blink of an eye a trigger can be pulled, pills swallowed, leap taken, towards a hope for a better tomorrow, not a lurking figure creeping in the corner. so easy but why so hard? already living life in limbo. one death is not going to take notice in the grand plan. so why so take it? noose is half tied. chair ready to be placed. one simple little jump is all it could take to be freed from this plane of existence. tears at my funeral. weeping, sobbing, screeching. but why would those very same monsters be mournful when they stand over the bloated corpse that they pulled the trigger on? years of whispering, shouting, persiting, that i finally give in. the whole dang world will not end if i join the worms. these 16 long, painful years are only a drop in all time. that no one will remember my name in 100 years. my very existence a lie. rumors old as earth itself hang in the damp air. something tangible in the sea of consciousness. cold, smooth, not too heavy. hold the ticket to happiness up to my miserable head. one simple click. a shot breaks the silence. at last peace.

i am an imposter in my life

&amp;#x200B;

a world with only strife

&amp;#x200B;

i yearn to be set free

&amp;#x200B;

yet death it the only thing to help me
