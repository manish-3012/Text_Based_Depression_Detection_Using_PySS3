I dont want to be a part of life anymore.I'm really sad. I dont want to be a part of life any more and I'm tired of being forced to.   The fact that I'm  still alive just seems like a sick joke. Like how much longer do I have to be dragged through this shit. It doesnt even matter how much my life gets better, I still hate it and want to die. I hate people, and people always hate me. I'm not very good at life in general. I'm just tired of pretending to like being alive just so others dont worry about me. No matter how hard I try I cant find anything in life that makes it worth living. Anyone else feel like this?
