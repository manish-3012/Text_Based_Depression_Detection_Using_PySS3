I am very severely selective mute, I can speak to strangers, but not my own family. I don't know what to do anymore. [m/16]I am 16 and as a result of not receiving full attention as my Dad had to be looked after for the first 7 years of my life (Motor Neurone Disease)/not having a father figure etc, I developed a very bad selective mutism, where I cannot speak to my own family properly, and I can only do basic words and phrases, going beyond makes me feel like hell all over my body.


I live in the UK, so the doctors wont do anything and the mental health treatment is pretty much non existent, I haven't even been diagnosed because they don't care at all.

**but it gets worse**

My brother and sister never attempt to talk to me, I am an outcast, and I am pretty sure that they actually believe that I have severe autism or am retarded in some way, this is because they have never seen me speak to my own friends and strangers in a normal way (and it would kill me inside if they do, thats how SM works).

My mum cares about me, but doesn't realise the full extent, she has recently tried to help me by 'talking to me more like an adult', thanks.. I guess.. I mean I am 16 so it's about time. It doesn't help at all though, she doesn't understand my situation.

Before anybody suggests, no I **cannot write notes to them, it is a full on block on communication**.

This is probably my tenth or so cry for help on reddit, I am losing hope, I must keep going but I am losing hope. Can you imagine being silent inside your own house, being scared to talk around your OWN family, for 16 years and counting!? Just imagine, not being able to have a conversation with any of your family members, it's essentially like being an orphan, but worse in my opinion. Why? 

I cannot have friends over. They cannot be in the same house as me or any of my family, as the thought of my family hearing me talk normally kills me and I cannot do it in front of them.

One time my mum insisted I have a friend round for a weekend, so I did. It was quite horrible, sure it was fun when I locked the door and played games in the attic with him, but when I went down to eat at the table with me him and my mum, I sat in complete silence. Complete. Silence. And he was probably wondering what the fuck was going on, nope just completely normal for me.


**I need help**. But I don't know what to do. I really do not know what to do anymore. I am 16 and I am running out of time. I don't even know if this is curable, I don't even know if it is too late for me, for all I know it could be, I could live a life without talking to my own family, and to me, that is the worst thing that could happen, and I'm not sure if I could live with that. 


I don't know how to go on, SM has been the cause of my depression, and it is the one thing that is holding me back from curing my depression (I can't not be depressed and have selective mutism at the same time, it is not possible for me).


Please help me, in any way you can, I am broken.
