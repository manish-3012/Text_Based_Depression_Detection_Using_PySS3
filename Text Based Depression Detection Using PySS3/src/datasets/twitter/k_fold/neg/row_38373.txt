I tried to kill myself last nightI donâ€™t know if I should tell anyone or not. It wasnâ€™t anything serious or a serious attempt. I was more so doing it in the heat of the moment type thing, plus it was half assed since my mom was nearby at the time.  

I know if I tell someone theyâ€™ll freak out and the last thing I want is to end up back in the psych ward. I also know if I keep it in thatâ€™s risky and I might try again sometime ahhhh  

Iâ€™m honestly betting on it considering this an attempt and calling it a day; carrying on with my life and acting like nothing ever happened. Even though that means I might try again sometime. Good chances are Iâ€™ll tell someone eventually because Iâ€™ll feel bad for not sharing something so serious.
