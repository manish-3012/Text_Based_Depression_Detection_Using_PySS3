I need to stop procrastinating on killing myself.If you know me, I'm one of the greatest procrastinators of all time. I'm not kidding. I have been procrastinating throughout high school on every single test, project, quiz, and hw assignments. Even in college I literally wait until the last second to turn an assignment in when I should've started days ago. I mean it doesn't even stop there where I even procrastinate on the basic things in life that should be over in 2 minutes. What I don't understand about myself is why I'm procrastinating on ending it all. I've been depressed for a few years, and everytime I think about suicide I wonder why I didn't kill myself in the first place. A part of me feels like I should stay, and a part of me feels like I'm accomplishing nothing worthwhile. I hate being in this situation and I wish I could find closure.
