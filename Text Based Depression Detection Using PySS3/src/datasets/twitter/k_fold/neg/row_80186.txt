I am going to commit suicide, and it's my dad's fault.He calls me fat, verbally abused me / talk so much shit about me, and doesn't love and tells me how much he hates me. I am going to fucking kill myself, I don't even do anything wrong and he constantly yells at me.

I don't want to live anymore, and I hope he knows.
