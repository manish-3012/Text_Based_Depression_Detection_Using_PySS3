Maybe tomorrowSo fuck me. Well don't, gods been doing that pretty well lately(if there is one). Guess i should say my problems. So my biggest problem is that theres nothing for me to stay on this planet for, my family has completely crumbled, no one loves anyone, the only person I'm still happy with is my dad. But, last night he tried to OD. No one cared enough to drive down. I'm not old enough to drive and my dad was taken to the next town over so I have no way of getting to him. Everyone is blaming everyone for causing stress which may aswell be true.

Not only that but I know for a fact my "friends" don't give a shit what happens to me they were fine before highschool but now I'm just used a cesspool of jokes. "Money issues, appearance, intellect, ect" which are all valid points. I look like a homeless obese pedo so they hot a poimt there.

But even if none of this was happening i still don't have a reason to go on since there is nothing I want. Love is a fucking lie. Never been in love because I'm smart enough to realize that purposefully getting into a relationship that will just end with break up is fucking shitty anyway. Or maybe its because no one wants to date an obese pedo look-a-like.

I don't want anything. No jobs are in treating since its all been done before. I don't want money since I cant use it on anything because I don't like anything. 

I really don't see how I can turn this around. In fact I know I cant because the damage is done even if I do become better mentally the best living ill get is probably working at fast food.
