Could I actually be worth something?I can't really contribute to society. I'm a music education major, and while education is important, music isn't. It does nothing to further mankind into the future, it doesn't solve poverty or disease, it just sits there as a distraction from doing anything truly productive. Maybe I should just take a construction job or become a truck driver, and get out of the way for the real educators out there teaching STEM. 

Where did I go wrong?  I love science; I've wanted to be an astronaut forever. I thought I was good at math, but I just failed my last calculus test. I understand basic astronomy, but how is that gonna be helpful to anything here on Earth? There's even an argument to be made about the lack of importance of space exploration, and as much as I love space, how much does it really contribute to mankind? 

Everything I enjoy isn't important. Shouldn't I get out of the way and do something that matters, even if it isn't what I like? Should I just go even further and just end it all at that point? I know this stuff sounds like eugenics and I don't support that, but what do I really do? Cost money, food, time, resources and energy from the people I care about. Who needs that?
