anyone feel suicidal without the classic depression symptoms part?in short, I frequently have suicidal ideations throughout my day, but I generally don't really fit in the depression criteria. The closest thing I found to how I feel is maybe "high-functioning depression". I tried to get formally diagnosed instead of doing all this guesswork but my GP shamed me for "waiting so long (it's been maybe 8 years of my life experiencing this) to say anything" so I stopped trying to find help. Haven't tried since then because of some life stuff. I think I "got used to" living with my suicidal thoughts from day to day. Some things trigger the thought like an intrusive thought and it passes away, but then others can really make me become fixated on the fact that if I were dead, x thing wouldn't have happened. The latter drives me closer and closer to the edge. I don't really talk about it to anyone because I've convinced myself that if these thoughts are real, the only way to prove them is to actually do it. When I try to share my thoughts anyway, I start to forget how I truly feel and question if I'm just writing a narrative because well.. nothing feels real anymore (maybe dissociation?). think it comes from closing myself up for so many years, I mean it's making my head hurt to write and address about it right now.

anyway I just wanted to know if anyone could relate/understand, guess it would make me feel less alone since no one I've talked to ever did
