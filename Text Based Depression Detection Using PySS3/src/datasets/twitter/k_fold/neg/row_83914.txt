Die of cutting or Die of Starvation/ Black BloodBlack blood is a combination of two bloods.
Two different parents combined.

When black blood is spilled by the owner, it is pure and not considered evil or devilish or bad.
Mainly because it is of two strangers combined. Two different families in one. Which is impossible.

Black blood makes me comfortable because itâ€™s not my fault that I was born it was the agreement of two different people.
