i cant believe it came to thisfor the last 24 hours ive been contemplating if i should eat the 14 oxycodones sitting in my medicine cabinet.  My now ex fiance has broke up with me last week, it wasnt those things that was a long time coming, she called out of the blue and literally ended it i don't wanna go into to much detail but she basically said she had been unhappy for a while which i had no idea.  We have been together for 7 years would have been 8 years next month on the 29th.  i feel like my fucking heart was ripped from my insides and dropped at my feet, she left everything we had without even showing she cared, she was my life i mean that in the most literal way possible.  I dont see the point in ANYTHING anymore i never thought my heart would heart but the pain feels oh so fucking real.  Im having to fight the urge to eat all my pain pills, i just dont see the fucking point in living if i cant have the one person that makes me want to live and breathe...i just dont see the point anymore.........
