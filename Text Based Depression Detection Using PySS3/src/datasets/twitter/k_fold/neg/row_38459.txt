I feel like I missed out on my teenage yearsPlease I need help, I'm currently 17 years old but in two months I will be turning 18.

I can't stand the regret and feeling that I missed out on my teenage years, I never got to do all the fun stuff the normally goes with being young and having a a safety net, no friends or parties or dates or hanging out. Ifeel like I wasted all my time from ages 13 till now. I have very few good memories and I'm horrifies at the idea that i'll never get all those fun things

I'm so scared, please help.
