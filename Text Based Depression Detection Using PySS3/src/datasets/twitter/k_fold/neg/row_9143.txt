I think im feeling numb?hm..well it was my birthday a few days ago. and only three of my friends texted me happy birthday and I appreciated that.  well tried making plans for tonight and everyone ignored my texts. and honestly i dont care, i just feel numb at this point i dont feel pain i just feel empty to be honest..idk if thats a good thing?? or bad. but something i just noticed. last year was much more painful i was offered to be treated by a girl i was dating only for her to cancel last minute for to break up with me the week after reasons unknown still but that shouldn't matter ,but i tried making the best out of it and got drunk. this year i just dont feel like doing anything and i guess thats ok. I guess this is one of those stages maybe? of accepting things? idk my birthday has always been spent alone for about  6 years now, whatever
