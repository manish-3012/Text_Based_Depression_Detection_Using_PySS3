i have nothing left.i tried to improve my life by stopping drinking and benzos. 3 days in I had 2 seizures and spent a few days in the hospital. i fell and fucked my back up pretty bad when I had the second one. I wake up in agony every day. it hurts to walk. i cant afford to go to a doctor

ive  been sober 14 days and my life has gone downhill dramatically. I am being evicted in a few days. I have nowhere to go. My family hates me. They have a huge house but don't want me around. I got out of the hospital with a smile on my face. It's been soooo long since i've been surrounded by nice, smart people. the nurses were great. 




i've been a drunk for 3 years. i haven't worked, i've done nothing. my sister got pregnant and had to move back home, my dads wife left him, we're all broke. my sister doesn't want me around either. i went over there tonight and she called the cops, (second time in a week). they told me to leave or they'd arrest me. on my way out they pulled me over and gave me a $180 ticket for not fully stopping at a stop sign. I can't pay that either.

I try to talk to my dad, he says he doesn't care anymore, he wants to kill himself too. he's facing eviction. he's had it with me and my siblings. My sister encouraged me to kill myself. 

my entire family is against me. I don't have a friend in the world. I don't know what to do. 


arent I entitled to happiness? isn't everyone? why did my life turn out like this? how the fuck did this happen?

I can't live like this. I've got 2 days to make a decision and it's not looking good. I'm not going to be homeless. I'll be dead before that happens.
