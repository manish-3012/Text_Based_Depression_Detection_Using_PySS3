Itâ€™s been 10 years and I canâ€™t do it anymore.Iâ€™ve tried. I really have. For 10 years now. Iâ€™ve seen counsellors, psychologists, psychiatrists, pastors, have tried different antidepressants, went to school, tried to further my career, tried to make new friends and new connections, became more active, travelled more, journaled, taking up new hobbies, etc, etc, etc, etc. 

I have tried. I really have. But I am tired. I canâ€™t live with this pain anymore. 

People may see me as selfish for doing it, but itâ€™s selfish to expect me to live with this pain when I have tried for years. I have held on. I have tried to make things better. But when your depression is this severe, there is no cure. There is no fix. So am I really supposed to live in pain for how many more decades? No. Iâ€™m not living to see 2021. Iâ€™m done.
