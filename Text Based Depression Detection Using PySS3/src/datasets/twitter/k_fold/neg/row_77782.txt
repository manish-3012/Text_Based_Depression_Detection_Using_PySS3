Never had a girlfriend never got to know what loves feels like and I fucked my future upI don't think I can go any longer guys every day is misery for me I am so undesirable to women being ugly feels like I have no place in this world I would never have family I would have to live everyday in loneliness,I am 25 and my parents can no longer support me,when I was 19 I was going to college to try and make a career but I suffer from social anxiety I blushed whenever someone talked to me it was too much for me to handle I dropped out and became a shutin in my room.. the years flew by and now my parents say I am to old and have to support myself I am stuck working a shit job living paycheck to paycheck,,when I told my parents about my depression they didnt seem to give a shit!Lonely...depressed..social anxiety...no friends...never had a girlfriend...no future...no will to live
