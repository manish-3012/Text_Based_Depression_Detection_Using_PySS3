Didnt helpI finally got a job after about a year of trying because I thought having something to occupy me other than just sitting at home but it's done the complete opposite I went from having suicidal thoughts about 3 or 4 times a week to every single day every night to the point I want to turn my brain off I just dont think I'm really cut out to be alive theres no future for me
