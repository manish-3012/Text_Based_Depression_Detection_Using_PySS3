Feel like it's okay for me to die after recording this album.. (not going to post any links or names, not trying to promote anything)I've wanted to kill myself on and off for about 14 years and I finally feel like I will have some sort of legacy if I die when I release this album, I don't care if no one listens to it, that doesn't matter. There will at least be some kind of footprint left of me. I don't feel like I belong here, I don't fit in anywhere and rarely make new friends. Been living and working in a new city for over a year and still have no friends there (recently got fired too), things just seem pretty hopeless and pointless, meh.. nothing feels fun anymore. I'm tired of this stupid anxiety.
I think maybe I just had to write this as some kind of cathartic release, at least I hope so.
