you said, but they were lies...you said, I wouldn't be alone

that you'd never leave.

You said, one day we'd live together

far from my abusive, family.

you said, that you care

that I need to hold on.

you said, that one day I could get help,

therapist, psychiatrist, what ever i needed.

you said, that I could always talk to you

that if I needed it, you'd drop what ever for me.

&amp;nbsp;

you told me so many things. all of them lies... you were special to me, someone I could trust... someone who cared, when no one else cared... but...

i'm alone, I'm still here at home, you don't care, I can't "hold on" anymore, there's no help for me, you never respond to my messages, and your always busy... 

I... plan a trip into the woods... one way, only a rope in my pack... I... can't do this any longer
