Tired of being trashI grew up with abusive parents. My dad liked to hit me and touch me/take naked photos of me. He said because I was a girl, that I was property and he could do anything he wanted to me. My mother couldn't go a day without calling me worthless, stupid or ugly. I went to school with bruises and black eyes. They withheld food and medical care also. No one ever said or did anything to help me. I thought it was normal. My parents told me that if I behaved better, they wouldn't have to treat me badly. I wasn't a perfect kid, but I got straight A's and always did my chores. I even graduated high school with 9 hours of college credit. 

My mother first told me to kill myself when I was 4. She showed me a bottle of Tylenol and told me that if I took these pills that I would die and it would make her happy because I was the one who ruined her life. My dad found me on the floor that afternoon. 

When I was in elementary/middle school, Mom used to encourage me to run away or try to "accidentally" leave me in a store. In high school I was told that the only way she'd ever be proud of me was if I committed suicide. 

It's sort of a default reaction now that I'm an adult. "Oh well if things get bad I can always kill myself." 

Things have been really bad for the last year. My kids have refused to listen to me and ended up getting kicked out of school. My husband ignores me, unless it's to complain about me not doing something that he never told me to do. I'm ridiculed at work, and my boss does nothing about it. I have no friends, except my cat and I think she only likes me because I feed her. 

I'm tired of being treated like I'm trash. I just want the pain to be over.
