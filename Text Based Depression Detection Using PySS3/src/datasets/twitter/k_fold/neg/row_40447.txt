30 days.I think Iâ€™m going to give myself 30 days to have some meaningful positive change in life. 

If I donâ€™t make a dollar of income from my personal endeavors or escape this house by then, Iâ€™m going to take what little savings I have left and put it into making myself and others happy in the short term. Buy fun clothes and new gadgets instead of counting pennies hoping I can afford to survive on the streets come 2021. 

Iâ€™ll also start figuring out exactly where I want to go and how. Writing out my wishes and notes beyond just scribbles in a notebook. Maybe even buying the tickets to get to where I want to be in the end. 30 days before I make the next step.
