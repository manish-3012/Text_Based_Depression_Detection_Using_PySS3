I really don't want to go back to the hospital.I have difficulty expressing myself through text or in person. I've pretty much shut myself off from anything and everyone since before January and haven't been on any meds or therapy for over a year. Even when I am on treatment I think about suicide daily and get frustrated when I don't see any changes. Today my rent is due. I have the money but my landlord only accepts money orders. He seems to think it's the only secure way to make a payment. I can't seem to motivate myself to go to the bank and get it printed up. I'm going through all of my common arguments of why this is even worth the effort. I know it's a simple thing to do and I hate that I always have to somehow convince myself to do the simplest things. Part of me knows what I need to do but I just can't seem to find it in me to do it. Maybe posting this will help me to see how stupid I'm being and just pay the rent. I can try and deal with the other stuff if I can do that.
