Why should i live to be alone21 yo,6'5,320lb guy never had a gf,the only 2 friends i ever had used me.lost 150lbs and still going even though im going to look like im in a flying squirrel suit, without the money to change that.I quit school at 15 after taking alot of pills to end myself. woke up 3 days later in the icu cause i couldn't even do that right.my dad told me it would be better for everyone if i shoot myself.He used to beat the shit out of me every day when i was little,and it didn't stop till i was big enough to fight back.anyway i look at my outcome there is no way out. The only thing that keeps me calm is that i have that way out next to my bed.
