Dark PassengerFor as long as I can remember, I have had a dark passenger. Now this passenger is not like Dexter's and doesn't want to bring justice to the world... it just wants to take me out of it. I've never told anyone this before and have fought it for far, far too long, frankly, I'm sick of it. I contemplate ending it all at least once per day... and for the past month that number has increased substantially and I can never shake the thought anymore, it's always there pushing me closer and closer to the edge. Until recently I've had things to look forward too. I lost something very near to my heart and I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel any more. I know it's not smart to end things over a girl, but this wasn't just any girl. At any point in my life, if you asked me to describe the perfect girl for me... she was it; incredibly smart, stunningly beautiful, caring, athletic, great career path, amazing family and friends, tons of similar interests and most importantly... deep, big, blue eyes that would make me fall in love with her over again every time I looked in them. And now she's gone and I don't see any way to improve on perfection.

I have no reason to continue on... I'll graduate, get a mediocre job where I'll remain for the rest of my days because I am an unmotivated, lazy, underachieving piece of shit. I set goals too high and am constantly disappointed. I have had plenty of opportunity to excel, but am held back in every aspect due to my lack of self-esteem and confidence. I can't meet new friends because of this and my existing friends probably wouldn't even notice my absence.  I have no desires or passions in life, nothing to work towards... I'm just a big emotionless ball of mediocrity.

Well, I could go on, but itâ€™s not necessary. Thanks for reading Reddit. Itâ€™s been fun, but itâ€™s time to go. Goodbyeâ€¦
