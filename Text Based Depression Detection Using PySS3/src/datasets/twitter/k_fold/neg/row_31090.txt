Why are we so mean to each other?This subreddit has been one of the more powerful things I've ever encountered. The pure love here is truly inspiring. I just wish more of our society was like this--free of judgment, free of obligations, just trying to hold onto that supposedly precious thing called life. I love each and every one of you! 

Yet, the outside world is so surreal. After all the generations that have come before, we never seem to take to heart to treat each other with kindness. So much competition, so much stress. We are "advancing" at such a fast pace and don't know what the fuck we are doing. Spectacular wealth and spectacular poverty, all in the same world, divided by social constructions we have put up to essentially rationalize this massive disparity. Where is the love? Why is it not prevailing over the hate that seems to be permeating through us as a society? What the fuck are we doing?

I understand if this post is too negative to keep up. I will quickly take it down if others deem it to be for the best. I just wanted to get that stuff off my chest.
