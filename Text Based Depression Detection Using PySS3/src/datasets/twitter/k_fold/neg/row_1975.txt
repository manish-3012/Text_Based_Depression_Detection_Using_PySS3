Future.I cannot see into the future. I cannot see a life with me in it. When I think about the future and what it holds for me I just see hey black space. I really can't see what my future holds for me. it seems that no matter how much I think I've changed from the person I used to be I will never change enough and I will always be the person I hate so much. I just want someone to crash into me or for me to get hit by a stray bullet because when or if that happens I will not fight to stay here. I'll just let myself go.
