The only thing stopping me, are the loved ones that would be affected.I made a realization today, if I didn't have to worry about hurting my friends and family, I would have a bullet in my brain, no question.


I have severe anxiety and depression,


on the drugs (though the 7 or so I've tried haven't worked for a long time)


Work is 90% of my stress. I barely work over part time, and going to work is like voluntarily going to hell to make a laughable amount of money. (Not just this job, the idea of working makes me claustrophobic)

Never been this close to the line in the sand, and now it appears I am straddling it.

My support system no longer understands, and neither do I for that matter.

I suppose the next step is stronger drugs that will thin the spectrum of feeling in my life.
