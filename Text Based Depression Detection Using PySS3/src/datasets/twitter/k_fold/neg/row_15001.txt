I'm starting to think about suicide again after 2 years.The people I consider to be my closest friends haven't been very communicative with me recently. They're busy with model UN's, football and stuff, none of which im a part of. Save for one or two em, we all live in "Area X" which is where they have to come for hangouts and I've been getting excluded out of most of them. I won't even know they were here untill afterwards when I see pictures. Now these people are gonna be leaving for college in 2 months and I'm taking a gap year, so I'll be at home. Seeing how they're quite literally my whole life as I'm not close with my family, is it too much to ask for them to value our friendship a little more?

  


I just spent an hour crying about this and I'm starting to wish I was dead. Ik it's a sick train of thought but I really don't wanna go on living like this.
