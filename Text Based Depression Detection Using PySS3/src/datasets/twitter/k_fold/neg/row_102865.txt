Broken inside and out.Feeling old and broken. 36 is a couple weeks away. Fibromyalgia. Heart problems. Possible thyroid cancer. I strongly suspect I'm undiagnosed bipolar. I have fucked my marriage completely up. I have done things to hurt my spouse immensely, and I don't know that I can ever earn back their trust. Tears are running down my face and I still have this gnawing urge to hurt myself, as if the sight of my own blood would make things better. It's as though I have two selves. One is the nice, polite, caring version of me. The other is the alcoholic, angry, bitter, unfaithful me that seems to be winning out. To say that I'm angry with myself is an understatement. I despise who I am. I'm in pain every day, both physical and mental. I can't keep going.
