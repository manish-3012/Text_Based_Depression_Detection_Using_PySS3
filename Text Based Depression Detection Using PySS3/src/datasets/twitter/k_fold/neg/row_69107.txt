I am going to be careful and patient this time, cause I'm too too tired...If I attempt to kill myself again, I cannot afford to fail... It just cannot happen.

So while I would like to stop existing this very second, I will wait for months if I need to. Make a careful fool-proof plan to ensure nobody notices, no help can arrive, and that the methods is effective with the highest probability.

I will also slowly drop contact with my family and the few friends that I think might feel sad when I die. easier now as I live 7000 km away from my family, and of my only friends one is online and the others live so far away that the friendships are basically online during these Corona times.

But nope... no failing this time. I am writing this here so that if I forget about it at some point, I'll have this post to remind me hahaha
