Always have a planI tried last night. No thought went into it all I knew is I wanted to die. I locked myself in the bathroom and grabbed the first pill bottle I saw. I took them and then my boyfriend busted down the door. Turns out my dumbass took a bunch of antibiotics. Iâ€™m really pissed off thatâ€™s what I grabbed. The cops got called. My mom wanted to take me to the mental hospital... again. All Iâ€™ve been thinking this whole day is of a plan. I donâ€™t want to be here. Iâ€™ve hurt so many people and fucked up so much shit and I canâ€™t take it anymore. I just canâ€™t. I feel completely hopeless and lost. Next time there will be no mistakes.
