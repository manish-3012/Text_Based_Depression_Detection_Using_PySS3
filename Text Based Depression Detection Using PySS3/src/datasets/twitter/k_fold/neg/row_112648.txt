PointlessI want this hell to be over. I dont want to live anymore. Its a repeating pattern of shit and unhappiness. I also dont want to waste something great. something i might become. I want a family one day. A woman who loves me as much as i love her. This is too much. I cant help but wonder each day if there is really any point in waiting to see what happens. or if it will even be worth the wait. I have no hope for the future anymore.

I wish death was easier.
