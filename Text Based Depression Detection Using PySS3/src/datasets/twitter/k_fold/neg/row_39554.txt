I was diagnosed with several mental health disorders when I was 12, many of which are degenerative. I probably wonâ€™t make it to 50 and every day is questionable. Now I donâ€™t even know if I can make it another five years, or even five months.Itâ€™s frightening watching everything deteriorate so fast. It always felt like I had more time than I did. My memory is going so quick, I canâ€™t eat or sleep. I canâ€™t wake up, and I canâ€™t even pull it together to talk to people anymore. I used to be able to pretend everything was fine but after nearly 30 years the cracks are really starting to show. I have to keep cancelling plans and leaving people abruptly. I used to only have breakdowns once in a while, and then once a month, and now itâ€™s several times per day and the amount of time Iâ€™m actually okay is becoming rare. I canâ€™t tell people anything for obvious reasons so many people donâ€™t like me or think Iâ€™m weird. 

Iâ€™m unable to do so many things. I just want peace. Iâ€™ve struggled to accept this for several years and kept ignoring it and I canâ€™t ignore it anymore. I have so much less time than I thought and the time I have is running out so fast. 

Iâ€™m so detached from everyone and everything. No one knows anything about me at all. Most people have at least one or two people or a family or something but I have absolutely nothing at all. There is not a single person who has been in my life longer than two years, and the people I know now have only known me for a few months. Iâ€™ve always switched locations to get away from people. I never stay in one place too long because the more people know me the more theyâ€™ll catch on that things are not what they seem with me. 

I want to leave something behind but Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t have anything. Iâ€™m trying so hard to use my remaining time to leave behind something despite all of this. Iâ€™m working to clear debt. Iâ€™d like to leave behind some cash. There really isnâ€™t anyone to leave it behind. I havenâ€™t built up much of a legacy of any kind.
