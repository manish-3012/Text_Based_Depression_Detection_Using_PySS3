Whatâ€™s the point?Iâ€™m starting school again soon and itâ€™s getting me really low. Itâ€™s just like whatâ€™s the point? Really though whatâ€™s the point? Iâ€™m not going to get good grades because I lack motivation and canâ€™t focus. Iâ€™ve come to except that Iâ€™m the failure and I always have been. Iâ€™m never going to amount to anything and Iâ€™m going to get a shit job and lifeâ€™s going to be just as miserable. Sure there are good days and things to look forward to but are those few moments of joy worth all this? For what? To retire and die. No one will remember me and itâ€™s all just pointless. I donâ€™t want to die but I just donâ€™t see the point.
