i'm stucki feel like shit all the time. there are little breaks where i feel like maybe i might be getting better after all, but they always go away. pain is the default state i think. maybe i want too much. maybe everyone is allowed the same amount of happiness and i'm just unreasonable for wanting more. i feel stuck inside my body i hate it i want out my own skin and bones and flesh disgust me. and yet i'm a fucking coward who refuses to kill themself. the thought of my last breath leaving my lungs makes me happy, but i don't want to make it happen. i just want to disintegrate into nothing.
