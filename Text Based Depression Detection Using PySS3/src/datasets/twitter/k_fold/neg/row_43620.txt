I'm stuck.My depression and suicidal tendencies come and go in waves and I usually always pull myself up for a bit. But this time it has been over 2 months and it has been absolute hell. I truly considered grabbing a gun and ending it last night but I didn't cause I guess I'm too much of a pussy. I'm alone, I try and act happy in front of people I consider friends but all they do is berate me. I have no other avenues to get different friends and I am stuck in this constant hellish cycle of feeling alright then considering suicide. I've always been the butt end of jokes about being shot down by women and being just an annoying person in general which are being told by my those I consider friends, which just fuels this mindset. This probably isn't worth posting here but I had to, to get it off my chest and maybe a nice comment so I can see that someone might care...
