I don't have the words anymoreIt's so fucking exhausting to even breathe, let alone speak.

This year I got an abortion, got sent into lockdown for several months, my childhood cat died, I found out my boyfriend has a secret family, my home life is shit, we're trying to buy a house but there's so many roadblocks, and now I've just found out I have HPV and possibly cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope it fucking kills me.

I'm too chicken shit to kill myself. I'm just hoping that the mental/physical health problems I have will be enough to do me in. And soon.
