For those of you who are considering suicidePlease donâ€™t do it. Just donâ€™t. You have parents that love you so very much. The ones that gave you everything, the ones that made you who you are today. The ones who love you, the ones that take care of you, and the ones that make you happy. Your parents have raised you from the very beginning. When you were just born, your parents have always cared for you. Always. But once youâ€™re gone, your parents will no longer have the beautiful child that they have right now.
So go ahead. Go to your parents. And tell them that you love them. That you love them so dearly much. If youâ€™re feeling sad, depressed, or angry, just talk it out with your parents. They will understand. And if they donâ€™t, just try again, and again. If that doesnâ€™t work out, see a therapist. There is always one standing by to help you in these dark times. But, if youâ€™ve sadly lost a family member, or if your family abuses you and treats you awfully, try to get help. Get the help that you need. And also, think about your friends. Your friends will be devastated about the news of you passing away. So, you should talk it out with your friends.
