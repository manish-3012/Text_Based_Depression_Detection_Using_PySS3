I'm doing it tonight...I have nothing anymore... I lost my girlfriend entirely today... my step dad has been abusive through my life... I'm poor... my school sucks... I just have nobody... since January I used all my time on my girlfriend... I tried everything to make her stay... I was there for her whenever she needed... I told her to always contact me if she need someone to talk to... the last 3 weeks... she has been going hard at me ... telling me I don't care stuff like that... that I was never there for her... she broke up today... told me to leave her alone...

I can't take it anymore... my life has just been getting worse and worse... I've lost everything... the only family that mattered to me, dead... my friends gone... my girlfriend... gone... the one person that kept me sane... gone...

I just can't take the loneliness anymore... I can't take the mental abuse... I can't take being basically robbed by my parents whenever I have money... there is nothing positive... I have nothing...

I'm gonna do it tonight... I'm gonna grab my sister's scooter... tie myself to it and drive into the ocean...
