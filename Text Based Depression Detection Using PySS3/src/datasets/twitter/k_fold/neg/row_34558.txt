Here goes one more dayEveryday that passes by just convinces me more and more that things are going to go down hill even further. Its getting to the point where I can't stand anything, not even the people around me. I'm sitting in my infectious diseases small group and could not feel more distant from my classmates. Everyone seems to be engaged and actually enjoying learning this material. Meanwhile my own self-defeating thoughts won't stop consuming me. Everyone in medical school is so fake it makes me sick.
