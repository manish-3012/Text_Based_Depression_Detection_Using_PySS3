I fucking hate working. Everything is meaningless. I have no motivation and everyone keeps ignoring me.My brain is so fucked up that I canâ€™t derive joy out of most things. I try to be a good person but life constantly proves that nothing matters. Itâ€™s all so fucking stupid.

I hate working these goddamn meaningless jobs that only serve to ruin my day. New job already is off to a terrible start and I canâ€™t imagine itâ€™ll get better. 

I have constant irrational thoughts about many aspects of my life and it makes me want to puke. I will never know what itâ€™s like to be â€œnormalâ€ and it eats me up inside. How does it feel to not worry about everything, even things that donâ€™t make sense, but my brain convinces me are real?  

Nostalgia is not comforting. I remember parts of the past and only feel pain. 

I am fundamentally broken on many levels and I do not believe repair is possible. The only permanent fix is a bullet to the brain. 

Goodnight.
