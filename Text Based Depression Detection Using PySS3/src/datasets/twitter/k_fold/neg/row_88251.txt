When I tought things were getting better... they didn't.Posting this on my main account because I can't afford to give a fuck anymore. 

I've been struggling with depression for the last 6 months. I got my emotions confused and fucked up 2 of the best friendships I've ever had back in february. Have been alone since then. Tried killing myself 3 times, and failed every one of them. A month or so ago, one of those 2 friends talked to me again. My ex. She forgave me and told me everything is okay. I've been also seeing a Psychologist every now and then since April. Yesterday, I accidentally texted the other friend and... she responded. We've been talking and she is okay with me now. I finally tought things could get better. I would be out of this sad, destructive loophole. I tought wrong. My ex just texted me saying she thinks i'm a hypocrite,she regrets having ever forgiven me and she is disgusted just by the tought of me. She says she doesn't want to talk ever again and all this because I started talking with friend #2 again. This crushed me. I finally tought... I've found the end of the tunnel. I was finally feeling like a person again. But I tought wrong. As always. I've lost her all over again. And I can't stop crying because I hate myself and this is all my fault, and it has always been. Why can't I just die already? Why? What is wrong with suicide? No one would ever care if I was gone. I know no one would. Because I hurt everyone. Everyone I know goes away in the end. No one... No one would ever miss me if I was just gone. And that's the truth. It has always been.
