Well I'm done...I feel like my life needs to end... I try to do my best to impress my dad, which i feel he hates me because im a girl and i can't be like my brothers (plus im the only "living" girl on his side of the family the rest died). i feel like im a failure to my parents, my mom blamed me for her illnesses. she says im no help to her. i just get in the way when i try my best to help around the house. i think it would help them if i died. i dont think they would care. i realy dont have any frends who care about me. i want to die and i see no point in living no more.
