Trying more lorazepamMy last attempt, months ago, failed. Took 30mg lorazepam but the emergency services got to my house before they started working.

Taking double the amount now, and flushing it away with liquor (not on pic). If you don't hear from me, you know it succeeded. Bye Reddit.

Update:

Took all the pills but friend was suspicous and called emergency services. Had my stomach pumped ans currently on suicide watch. Going to hang myself next change I get, currently in a hospital where they take away all your strings/belts.
