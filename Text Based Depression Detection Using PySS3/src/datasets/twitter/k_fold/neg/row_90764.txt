My family wants me sickIf I start to get better, it intimidates my family. My mom will do things like not look at me and not talk to me as soon as I start getting friends or people outside of my life that understand me and feel sorry for me. If I get sober, my mom will start a fight and find a reason to stay at a hotel. I canâ€™t understand it. Itâ€™s like every time I start to do better, they want to sabotage me. Treat me like shit and get me to snap.
