Lost EverythingI'm 21, on a gap/work year to get a break from education, the past 4-6 weeks have been the worst of my life. Me and my girlfriend broke up, this was probably the most painful, we are still trying to be friends because there wasnt any drama, we just grew apart, but shes honestly always been the one constant in my life for the last couple of years and it's so hard. Shes still my best friend, but I can feel myself burdening her with all of my pain on top of hers. I'll always love her and want her to be happy.

I also lost my job a day or two later, and with that I lost all of the friends I had made whilst working there, the only couple of friends I have aside are so closed off emotionally that they dont really give me any opportunity to talk with.

This has all just put everything into perspective, my mother has battled depression for the best part of 25 years and I've seen her suffer and I dont want that for myself.

Just trying to reach out to anyone at all or a bit 9f reassurance/wise words would be deeply appreciated.

Thank you
