Body image issues push me towards suicideI hate my body. I hate myself because of my body. I am so uncomfortable in my skin and I feel like I am living inside of an ugly alien. I hate my face, my teeth, my hair, my pasty skin, my tiny boobs, my gangly limbs. My boyfriend had a crush on this girl early in our relationship with massive tits and a gorgeous curvy body. it makes me feel inadequate having the body of a child. im not enough for anyone. i want to kill myself because i canr stand living in this ugly body anymore. i have been hating my body for 2 years and i think i want to destroy it
