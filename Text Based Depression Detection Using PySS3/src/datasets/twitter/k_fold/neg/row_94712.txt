How to help someone suicidal?Hey! 
I don't know if this post can stay on this subreddit or not but here we go: one of my friends is suicidal and I am really tired of it (not like angry about it just tired that I am helpless). I am tired that I am worried about her all the time, that I have panic attacks when she doesn't reply to my texts/calls because I am worried sick that she did sth bad. And I am tired that I can't help her. I mean we discussed her problems several times. I suggested therapy many times or even taking meds. I have suicidal thoughts as well so I know how hard it can get but I am on therapy for a year and it helps me a lot. I just wish she'd consider therapy as well... but no, she doesn't want to hear about it. I wish she'd stop being stubborn about seeking professional help. So my question is: how can I help someone suicidal? I can't do this anymore. I don't want to lose her but I can't be her "guardian" all the time.
