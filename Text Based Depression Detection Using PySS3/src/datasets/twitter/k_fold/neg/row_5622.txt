He left a drawing before his suicideHey guys. I want to start off by saying that I did not know him personally but I heard he went through some traumatic events with his father that also involved his older sister. His mom called my friends mom and told her that her son (33 years old) killed himself on Monday night  by cutting his wrist. His mom told my friends mom he left a drawing on a table that he did. Sheâ€™s trying to figure out what it means. She didnâ€™t send her a picture of it but she told her how it looked like. I drew it out and my friends mom said itâ€™s like his mom described it to her. By any chance would you guys know what this means?
