Sometimes I want to kill myselfIn too scared of death. But I still think about it a lot. I try to be happy. But...

my bf has hurt me and betrayed me so many times in big ways.

I feel ugly and Iâ€™m getting uglier all the time 

I have PMDD, Iâ€™m always depressed in the back of my head, panic attacks. Traumatic events that haunt me. 

Canâ€™t talk to friends about it or they leave.

I canâ€™t hold down a job no matter how many times I try. Iâ€™m trying to find a new one and no luck, so Iâ€™m stuck on welfare.

I have apathy towards friendship now...been avoiding everyone except my family who are the only people I trust. 

I will delete soon but I have to get this out.
