Stuck in a continuous loopI hate my fucking life.  I have no friends, feel like a loser, too broke to try to do anything enjoyable.  I have zero motivation to live.  Only reason I can't kill myself is because it would make my mother and my brother sad.  It feels like I'm in a loop.  Pain and sadness builds up and I'm ready to die and I puss out.  I really miss my grandfather because he was the only person who I could talk to about all of this but he's dead.  I can't do anything right.  Only relief I have is cutting...
