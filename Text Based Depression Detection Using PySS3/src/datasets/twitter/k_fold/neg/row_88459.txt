I donâ€™t know if I want to kill myself, but Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m wanting to live anymore either.Iâ€™m too tired to list the details so Iâ€™ll answer questions about these things going on making me massively depressed:

* My father is essentially emotionally abusive to my mom and I, and all my life I wanted to please him/not disappoint him to avoid his judgment and words.
* He was raised in an abusive environment and is very possessive of me because his mom was.
* I have PTSD from a car accident, clinical depression since age 10, went undiagnosed for ADHD until I was 19, and have had a couple concussions.
* I was in a serious car accident at age 9 which has left me in pain constantly since then.
* Everyone in my family is in the medical field, either a doctor or a pharmacist or a nurse, so pills have been thrown at me since I can remember. Eventually this mentality lead me to self-medicating with Xanax, however I stopped that in May of last year. Sometimes I accidentally overdose with prescribed medications but weâ€™ll get into the reason for that in another bullet point.
* Iâ€™ve had to hide every crush Iâ€™ve had from my father. Iâ€™m 21. My father makes up situations in his head that never existed and gets mad at me for them, so the other day he told my mom that I said my boyfriend was a â€œspecial friendâ€ even after he found out we were dating. He was mad because my mom referred to my boyfriend as my boyfriend and not just his name, so I have no idea where he got the â€œspecial friendâ€ title when we had multiple conversations over Christmas of this year about how I need to be allowed to have a boyfriend at age 21. 
* I have MS and evidence of a stroke on an MRI. I think Iâ€™ve been misdiagnosed with the stroke thing because I have severe migraines that mimic strokes. Either way, my memory is absolute shit. Itâ€™s getting better now that my ADHD is being treated, but I sometimes forget that Iâ€™ve already taken medications and my boyfriend found me *almost* to the point of hypothermia after I doubled my ambien and passed out on a cold floor because I take it for night terrors (PTSD)
* I need an occipital decompression surgery due to a car accident giving me occipital neuralgia and leaving me in constant pain, but few doctors do that and I canâ€™t even have another MRI to ensure Iâ€™m a candidate for the surgery until February. Iâ€™m in so much pain that Iâ€™m willing to travel for this surgery so that I donâ€™t need as many meds. Iâ€™ve tried everything I can to be out of pain - steroid injections and infusions, prednisone, pain pills, physical therapy, massage, Botox... everything. This surgery is my last hope of reversing the damage done from all of the blows my neck has taken.
* I had a partial thyroidectomy in June due to a rapidly growing tumor. That tumor was literally ruining my quality of life, but it takes forever for the hormones to rebalance and my doctor wanted me to see if whatâ€™s left of my thyroid would compensate. So Iâ€™m going through an emotional roller coaster until everythingâ€™s back to normal. 
* The only grandparent that is kind of sane is now in a home for people that canâ€™t take care of themselves. She may have beat the shit out of me a few times but she was also gracious and would give anything for me. Iâ€™m the only grandchild she remembers because we have so many good memories together.
* I feel really bad that my best friend and boyfriend are here to keep me in check. I know they love me, but I donâ€™t want them to worry at all. I feel bad that they care so much. Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m â€œso independent itâ€™s offensiveâ€ and I need to let my boyfriend pay for things or open doors or let my best friend help me clean. 
* I grew up bullied until 8th grade. Kids would take pickles and roll them in dirt on the playground and throw them at me, calling me fat when I didnâ€™t gain the weight I was supposed to until college. Iâ€™ve always been skinny. 
* I was nearly raped at age 17 but fought back enough to stop him. I kept getting a bunch of sexual harassment basically since that age. Iâ€™m an easy target being small, but I somehow have a decent butt (yay, I have something going for me) despite the fact Iâ€™m in something like the 4th percentile for height for people that hit puberty at my age. I stopped growing at age 10, when I hit puberty, and never had any sort of growth spurt.
* My childhood best friend that I grew up with drowned when I was 14 (?) and I still wish she were alive. I still have notes she sent me when I was at camp.
* I was one of Larry Nassarâ€™s patients and even though I was not victimized, it leaves a very bad taste in my mouth that this man was so horrible to people I grew up with, essentially since my familyâ€™s in the medical field and I fought off someone trying to rape me. 

Sorry Iâ€™m on my soapbox here, but Iâ€™m legitimately worried Iâ€™m on the way to another downward spiral. I attempted suicide in middle school but failed and I NEVER want to get to that point again. I used to be much more self-aware and know my depression, but lately I have lost that quality.
