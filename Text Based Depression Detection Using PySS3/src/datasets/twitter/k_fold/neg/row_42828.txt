Can anyone please give me a good reason why I shouldn't end it all?Because I can't think of one. 

"It's a o op permanent solution to a temporary problem" is not a good reason - you don't know that it's temporary and I'd rather not take the risk.

"It's selfish" is not a good reason - it's just as selfish to want someone to live a life of pain and misery just because you don't want them to die.

"There are people who are suffering worse" is not a good reason - that doesn't make the pain hurt less or make the feelings go away. It just adds guilt on top of everything else.

"It's the coward's way out" is not a good reason - some of us are okay being cowards.

What else you got?
