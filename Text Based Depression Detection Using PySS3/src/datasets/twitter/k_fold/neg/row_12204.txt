Having New Thoughts that Scare Meso basically i've been suicidal for 12 years (over half my life) but never really attempted it. I used to look at my apartment window (where i was living when i first became suicidal) and wonder if the 5 story fall would be enough, but figured that i'd probably just break my legs or w.e

Always, one of the major thoughts that stopped me from wanting to go further than think about it was how much pain it would cause those who care about me.

Now, that thought excites me...... And i'm scared. I just did my usual routine of thinking about my death, and how it might play out after they find my body, and usually the imagination of tears, and trauma and years of counselling and therapy after dealing with my death, usually all that shit makes me feel sad and idk but now im just excited. Like fuck them i hope they are fucking traumatized for life. It's not like I'll have to deal with it lmao. So my family and friends, and all those cunts who saw i was hurting and teased me more, they'll have to deal with it. Finally I'll get one up on them. Fucking take me down a peg when I'm dead m8.


I don't want to be in pain, but the one thing that has kept me 'sane(alive)' was that I always put others before myself. I wasn't worth hurting others. If my actions put someone else behind, even if it was in my best interest for my own progression and development, I would sacrifice my own happiness and success for whoever was struggling.

But recently, I felt like that shifted. I'm sick of giving up things for other people. I don't want to have porous boundaries anymore. 

But the only thing I can think about now is how not having porous boundaries is actually putting me more at risk of doing something I've been fighting (or romancing, take your pick) for years.
