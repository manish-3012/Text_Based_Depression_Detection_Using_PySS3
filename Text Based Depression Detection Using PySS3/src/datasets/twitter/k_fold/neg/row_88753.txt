Thereâ€™s something incredibly wrong with me.Throwaway because I have someone following me on my other account and donâ€™t want him seeing this.

I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me, but itâ€™s becoming more and more prevalent. I think itâ€™s kinda been a thing since I was little, both my younger brother and I had really bad anger issues and would beat the shit out of each other, then our parents would hit us for hitting each other. We grew out of that when I was like 11, but from there I started having these fantasies of getting jumped. Or just in general getting beaten up, around that time I started inflicting pain on myself. Not in ways other people could find out about, Iâ€™d take ice cubes and squeeze them in my hand until they melted, slapped rubber bands on my wrist. That kinda thing. I sorta assumed I just had some masochist thing, but then it shifted and I had fantasies about hurting other people. Rather thatâ€™d be jumping other people, killing family members, classmates and other homicidal thoughts which Iâ€™m not going to talk about further. Itâ€™s been scaring me. And Iâ€™ll try to make myself feel better because if I was going to hurt someone, I wouldnâ€™t be afraid of it. But Jeffery Dahmer was disturbed by it too, and that didnâ€™t stop him. Sometimes I just get so angry. It can be a small thing, or just someone I dislike doing something that annoys me and I just wanna fucking hit them. This past year or so Iâ€™ve started verbally snapping at people. I donâ€™t seem to have control over it, it just comes out and people rightfully get pissed at me. Thankfully I havenâ€™t physically hurt anyone (aside from myself) since maybe 12. I donâ€™t think itâ€™d be safe for the people around me if I were to stay alive. Iâ€™ve had urges that only get stronger, and Iâ€™m snapping at people in a way I canâ€™t control. Itâ€™s only going to get worse from here and If I hurt someone or follow through with some of the shit going around in my head I donâ€™t think iâ€™d be okay with myself again.
