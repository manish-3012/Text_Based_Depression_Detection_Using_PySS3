Iâ€™ve been suicidal for years please read and respond to this post I need help.Iâ€™m 32 only been with one woman. Iâ€™m fat, not very huge down low and Iâ€™m near the end of caring anymore. I use to use my family as a reason to end it all but itâ€™s not working anymore. I have a female friend Iâ€™ve been in love with for almost 10 years and I see her go thru abusive relationships and sheâ€™s always needing me to lift her up. I admitted to her years ago how much I love her she knows how much I do but sheâ€™s not attracted to me in that way. It kills me knowing that, she had a 2 year old son that I help watch when she needs it and I lover her son. I want to be with her but she doesnâ€™t want me but sheâ€™ll never refuse my help. She calls me her best friend and when we hangout most of the time sheâ€™s just texting other guys while weâ€™re supposed to be hanging out. It kills me im just over it all. Iâ€™ve already admitted myself into an hospital for suicidal thoughts over her and my life. I really donâ€™t know where to turn at this point. Only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because Iâ€™m too much of a coward to end my life. I wish for my death every day and it doesnâ€™t come. Iâ€™m just a lost soul.
