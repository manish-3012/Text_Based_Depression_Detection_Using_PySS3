Thinking about it, thinking of how to do itNot sure how, it's been on my mind heavily for the past few days. I thought of different places in my house of hanging myself, overdosing on pills, or save up for a G22 and end it in a second. I really would choose the glock option but it's to expensive. I hate that I exist, I'm a waste, I'm useless and  I can hardly cope in school. I hate that if I try the hanging option or pill option I could fuck it up and survive. The glock I can not feel a thing, no regret, no sadness as everything dissapears.
