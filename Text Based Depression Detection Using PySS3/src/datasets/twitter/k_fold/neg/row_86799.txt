it's taking a lot of me to not kill myselffor the past year I've been working towards cracking an exam that took place ten days back. and it was my dream to crack this test and get into my dream college. the result was announced on my birthday. 
i did not make it through( i know. best birthday ever) and a friend of mine who did prepare for a separate entrance for the same college, got in. i feel like im drowning in guilt and self pity because a) he made it through and instead of being happy im resentful towards him, knowing it's not his fault. and i hate myself for it. i should be happy for him and not bitter, we're best friends.
to be fair though, he didnt even bother asking for my result.
and i felt as though i really deserved a chance to at least be interviewed by the panel selecting candidates for admission. I've had nightmares for a whole year about this and currently while im trying really hard to stop crying, i cant. 
b) i feel like a failure. i know im a failure. and that's all. i want to kill myself. im considering options right now. i really am i don't know how im resisting the urge to not do it. im trying to talk myself out of it. i didn't know where else to go. i don't want to cry anymore and it hurts a lot knowing i did so much and yet failed at it. I've heard every generic thing under the sun telling me this isn't the end of the world. i know it isn't. i know it won't matter ten years down the line. but i don't know what will be happening in my life ten years down the line. i don't see myself succeeding in anything i do. any thing. and why do i have to rely on the future to make things better? why can't my present be even 1% okay? 
i don't see the point of it. i really don't. i want to get hit by a vehicle.



anyway, it's taking a lot of me to not kill myself. i don't want to disappoint everyone, again. i dont know how much longer i want to hold up, but im really really trying.
