You don't really need to reply, I just need to vent to a third party.So this has been the worst year of my life as of yet. My grades have dropped from straight As and Bs to mostly Cs, and my dad thinks it's his fault. I can tell he thinks he's failed as a parent, but he still holds a lot of resentment towards me, so I can't talk to him about it. I've been cheating and lying my ass off all year, and the consequences of this are finally catching up to me. Needless to say, I'm not very prepared. I've planned my suicide a few times every day for the past week, but I haven't done it for fear of the pain I'll endure or the pain my loved ones will endure. Ever since I developed depression, I've been eating less and less healthy in the hopes that I'll die soon of a heart attack or diabetes. I know it's selfish to take myself away from the ones who have given themselves to me, but I just feel so overwhelmed. Every other waking moment in my life is filled with self-hatred or self-pity or some sort of amalgamation of the two, and I just can't handle it. I want to die in a way that seems an accident, so that perhaps my family won't think it's their fault, and will just chalk it up to another one of my stupid misgivings. I do not weigh an unhealthy amount, nor is my BMI anywhere over normal, but I am so out of shape that getting out of a seat makes my heart beat faster. I really just want the pain and the fatigue to end. I'm lost and I don't know what to do. Is anyone in a similar position? Does anyone have any advice? I'm thinking about just overdosing on painkillers to get it over with, but I'm still wary of the emotional damage to my loved ones.
