I feel like I'm not good enough to achieve my goalsI graduated college over 3 years ago now but I'm still working the same minimum wage job I got to pay the bills after college. I feel like this is all my life will ever amount to be. I sincerely believe that I'm just not good enough to obtain any greater success than what I currently have: Which is my current job and still living at home with my parents. 

I just give up. I don't know how I can believe life can get any better than this so I'm just going to end it all tonight. After everyone in my house goes to bed, I'm going to go into my car in the garage, turn it on and let the fumes kill me. I'll be long dead before anyone wakes up and tries to stop me.
