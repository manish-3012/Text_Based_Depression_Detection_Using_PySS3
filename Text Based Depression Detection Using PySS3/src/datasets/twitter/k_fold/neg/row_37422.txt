I'm so sick of everythingI hate living here, i hate doing this.  I want to leave this house so bad and all they say is 'well you'll have to wait' but i can't wait I need to leave i have to get away from this stupid place 
5 more years, i slowly carve the days into my wall.  5 more years of this hell.  
And im sick of the stupid online world.  
How can someone be so harsh on a 13 year old? 
Fat bitch, whore, overweight cosplayer, childish, a slut, a bad person.  
'You can't do that', 'don't say that', 'who asked' , 'nobody cares how you feel'.  
I spend all my time trying to help and make people happy but it's never enough.  
Don't give me the 'people care about you' cause i dont give a shit.  Im sick of wasting my energy on people, and groups that don't care but i dont want to be a bad person... 
Tomorrow when i damage my spine and  get hospitalized, none of it will matter.  I'll be surrounded by people who care and want to help me.  
Dont try to tell me to ask my friends for help.  Last time, she snitched on me.
