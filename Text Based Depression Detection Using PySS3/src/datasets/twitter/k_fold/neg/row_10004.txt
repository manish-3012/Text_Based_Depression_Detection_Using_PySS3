Fuck trying so hardBeen out of my own home for a year with court being postponed over and over. Rarely see my kids. Their mother is a fucking fat lazy slob cunt loser. I'm Still Paying mortgage and rent. Now they want me to go to rehab to maybe have charges reduced. No guarantees I won't get time for attempted suicide by cop. Still employed by the same company because it was a off the wall dumb shit moment. With Insurance would still cost me 2k for rehab. Which I don't have. The only thing that makes me feel bad about suicide is my kids. Fuck insurance. Fuck whore mothers. Fuck everyone. There are more stars in the universe then grains of sand on earth. No One is special. We all die alone. No one chose to be here.
