Despite leading a relatively nice life I think about suicide dailyIâ€™m mid-thirties, good job, nice car, nice family. I would say Iâ€™m fairly attractive. I guess Iâ€™m not your typical suicidal person.

I do have some big ups-and-downs in my life like anybody else, sometimes they are manageable and sometimes I sit and think of different ways to kill myself. 8 years ago after a heavy night of drinking and heartache I wrote a suicide note and got a knife to cut my wrists but I didnâ€™t go through with it.

Recently Iâ€™ve been thinking about driving somewhere remote and leaving the engine on, feeding the fumes back into the car. I feel guilty because there are so many people out there who canâ€™t catch a break but soldier on, and hereâ€™s me thinking of ending it constantly. 

I suspect I may have bi-polar or something similar but Iâ€™ve never been to see anybody about it.

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting this. I guess I canâ€™t talk to anybody about it in real life. Iâ€™m not feeling suicidal right this moment but it comes and goes.
