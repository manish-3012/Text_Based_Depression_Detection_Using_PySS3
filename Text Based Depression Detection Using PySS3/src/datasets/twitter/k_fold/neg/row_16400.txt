What's the reason to live when you're useless?I can't study, I can't get a job, I can't do anything. I'm a parasite. I know I should "try harder", but it's no use. I don't know what else to do other than just curl up and die once and for all. Every day is a constant reminder that I should be dead and not living like a parasite.

I don't even know why I'm posting here, nobody can help me. Guess I'm just venting until the inevitable happens.
