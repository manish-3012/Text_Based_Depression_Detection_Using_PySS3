I feel like suicide is the only way out.No one fucking cares about my problems. Not even my friends or family. It seems like I always get abandoned at the lowest points in my life. I have showed nothing but legitimate compassion towards people, and everyone treats me like the lowest shit ever to walk the face of the earth. I feel like even God himself hates me. I am fucking tired of living. I donâ€™t think there is any chance of my life improving. I fucking hate the entire human race, including myself. In my 15 years of living I have seen nothing but pure cruelty in the fucking hellhole we call humanity. You open your heart and they mock your very decency.
