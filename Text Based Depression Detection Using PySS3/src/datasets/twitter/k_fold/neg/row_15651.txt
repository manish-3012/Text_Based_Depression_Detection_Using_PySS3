I'm already dead inside!I was suicidal before now I am more than ready to call it quits. I was scheduled to go on a vacation on Tuesday to NYC. I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life a few hours before it was time to leave to the Airport. I almost managed to leave, but was frozen, and could not get myself to leave the house. I was looking forward to the trip before I decided that I did not deserve a vacation.

Fuck my life. I cannot even force myself to enjoy a vacation like a normal person. I have to end my existence this weekend.
