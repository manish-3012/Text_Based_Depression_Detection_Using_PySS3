my last weekwell this week is gonna be my last week. officially 7 days left. all this year has been is bad choices and i really have fucked myself over. i skipped the whole semester of school and my parents will find out in 7 days. also i got court in 17 days for an accident where they are blaming it on me so now we gotta pay for everything. and my license is getting suspended. i really just fucked up a lot and iâ€™m to pussy to deal with it. iâ€™d rather live happy for the next 7 days then live miserable for a while after they find out and all this court stuff happens. so iâ€™ve created a bucket list of stuff i wanna get done. also ps donâ€™t try to convince me not to im not gonna listen. iâ€™m happy with my choice. iâ€™m only 16 years old but iâ€™ve just been unhappy for to long and my life is just heading in a bad direction. i feel like if i continue it itâ€™ll just get worse. also iâ€™ll probably just kill my self by overdosing if yâ€™all were wondering.
