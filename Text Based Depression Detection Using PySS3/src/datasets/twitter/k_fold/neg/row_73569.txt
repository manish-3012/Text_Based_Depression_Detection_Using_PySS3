I don't have anyone to turn toEvery day is so extremely painful. I want to kill myself tonight but I'm worried I'll just wake up tomorrow (or worse, in the ward). I went to call my mum but she has my number blocked. The pain greatly outweighs all reasons to live (there are nearly none anyway).

I don't know what the point of this shit is. I guess I just want to think about it a little more before I go through with it, because rushing it will mean a greater chance of failure.

I'm just fucking shit, fucking trash, useless garbage. Hopefully they can fit my fucking fat piece of shit body into the cremator.
