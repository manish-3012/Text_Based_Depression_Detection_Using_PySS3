Sometimes It Just Doesn't Get BetterI think this will officially be my first post on Reddit in the four-year history of this account and unfortunately probably my last. Its winter time here in Chicago and although I lost my apartment family has taken me in (not without drama mind you). Over the last few months, I've lost hope that I was will have a decent future, that I will ever be financially secure, or have deep connections to family and friends. I've had depression kitty on my back since I was a teenager and over the years she has only gotten heavier. I don't think I can keep carrying on, but its even worse I don't want too. I've only ever toyed with the idea of suicide but now its the only thing I can think about.
