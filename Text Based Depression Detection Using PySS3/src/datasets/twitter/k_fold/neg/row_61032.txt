I'm back again.. SorrySigh. 
I'm feeling incredibly invalidated. 
My girlfriend has done some horrible things lately and is ignoring me. 
Work is stressful, and so is school life. 

I can't handle it all, and I'd rather not live.

I can't sleep, there's a sharp pain in my chest, and it's pounding. My head hurts, and I can't breathe. My body feels weak. 

For the first time, I took a knife to my wrist last night. 

I just want to sleep, and never wake up. What's the point of living in pain, where everything you do is rejected.
