Can someone give me the details?So, I have had suicidal thoughts at least once a day for many years.
I've had therapy for several years, have been to a psychiatrist for a while and have had several different treatments/madication. 

My options are ending very soon. This seems like the most sensible option for a lot of people.

I am a coward/lazy and am looking for the easiest method. My choice so far is by train. However I don't know what are the odds of surviving this way and would like to know as I don't really want to fail. How effective is the average train in Europe?

Sometimes I wish we had American gun laws :)

Edit: Thank you in advance.
