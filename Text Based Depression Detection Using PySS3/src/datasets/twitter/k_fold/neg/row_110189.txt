next Wednesdaymy boyfriend bought me a train ticket â€œhome.â€ Itâ€™ll be a nine hour ride and a two hour drive.

That place, a little bitty rural area where everyone is either incestuous or racist. Where it take 15 minutes to get to the nearest Walmart.

Iâ€™m just ready. Iâ€™ve always been too scared. Wanting it but too afraid of what might happen or if it might hurt. Iâ€™m not afraid anymore.

My stepdad is addicted to painkillers. Hereâ€™s so hoping heâ€™ll have some.
