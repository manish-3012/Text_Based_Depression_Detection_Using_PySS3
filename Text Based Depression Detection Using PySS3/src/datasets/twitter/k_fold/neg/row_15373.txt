I set a suicide date, but it's far awayI guess I better explain myself. I've never posted on here before, but I need to get this off my chest.

I've had extreme anxiety ever since I was 8 years old. I can't even go out of the house by myself without having panic attacks. I always seem to also be in some new sort of physical pain or discomfort. 

This year I have also gotten tinnitus, which for those who may not know, is a constant ringing in my ears that drives me mad. I have tried many ways to help myself over the past 9 years, including therapy, but it hasn't worked.

Because of this, I know I will never be able to live on my own as an adult. People asking what colleges I plan on going to etc makes me just feel depressed because I know I can't.  

I don't want to be a burden. I know I take up a lot of time, energy, and money from people who care for me. I don't offer anything useful in return. I can't rely on them forever. It's not fair to them.

That's why I've decided I'm going to kill myself the day before my 18th birthday, which is in 1 year. I'm not going to say what it is but I'm sure my suicide method will work, I've done a lot of research. I've been thinking about this for half a year now with a rational mind and I'm sure it is the best option.

I don't know why I'm posting all this, I guess I just wanted to vent.
