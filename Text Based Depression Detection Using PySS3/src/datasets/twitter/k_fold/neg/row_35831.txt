Please Take Away My Dreams and Hopes.It hurts too much to have Dreams that I cannot ever achieve. It's only a few years past the idealism of youth, I realized I've never had a chance in the first place. Limitations in ability, opportunity, family, resources, poverty, and now lack of energy means I might never even finish my art. I don't want to shame, disappointment, and anguish. I was fed false dreams, and I deluded myself thinking I had a chance. I was never a contender. The fight was rigged from before even the start. Our hopes and dreams are just impossibly dangled in front of us so that we work the mouse wheels that power the engine of capitalism. It's so cruel of them to let us smell the cheese without so much as a nibble. 

If I could be an unthinking unconscious philosophical zombie and not be aware of my circumstances it would be okay. If  I die that would be okay too. I cannot fight anymore. Lay me to rest. Let me lie and die dreaming...
