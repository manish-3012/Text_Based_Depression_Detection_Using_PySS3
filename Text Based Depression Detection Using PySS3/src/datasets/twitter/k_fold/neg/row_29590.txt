i will be gone by the time september is over.that's my plan. I was supposed to be gone in January, you can look back through my post history and see that I took a fuck ton of overdoses and various other attempts, spent two months on a psych ward to be discharged back into the community. I wish people would respect my choice, my life is in my hands and I know it's selfish but if I wish to die, I should be able to make that choice. I'm not fed up with life or anything I genuinely just don't feel like it's for me, I just don't belong here, simple as that really. I've written my note and a plan is starting to fall into place. I'll be gone by September because that's the start of the new academic year, I've come this far and I've had so many attempts, I'm certain this is what I want. I don't have any dreams or ambitions, I've tried for years to think up a future and try and believe in it enough to make my loved ones feel reassured but I genuinely just can't keep wasting resources for people who are desperate for a future. I just wish to be at rest. I'm hoping I'll leave this world a tiny bit better than I came into it but I'm just not supposed to be here. thank you to anyone who cared to read all of that.
