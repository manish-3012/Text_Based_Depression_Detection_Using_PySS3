I'll do it unless I have a good reason not to.I'm alone, I have no future, and it's painful just to keep living. Why shouldn't I do it? I have no good reason not to. 

My medication doesn't work anymore. My mom drives me crazy and it makes me want to kill myself every day. I can't stand being yelled at, being told I have no friends, being blamed for everything. I hate it when she yells at my sisters for doing nothing wrong. I can't even stand it when she's mean to my dog. She thinks I'm useless and I agree. I can't even tell her I'm depressed because she just will say that it's because I can't play games or whatever. That's not true. I'm so lonely. 

But she's right, for the most part. The best friends I have are on the Internet and I can't even talk with them when I need them. I want to die. I'm too lonely.
