Life isn't really worth it.I really don't know what to do. I have an IQ of 158 I had As in all my IGSCE and A Level Exams. I was on track to get into Cambridge or Oxford, but then I got sick. I went into a coma for four months and missed two years of school. right now I'm failing. i might die any day so why not now? I have absolutely no friends, i tried everything. 
I have a successful sister and a successful brother and father. I don't want to be the kid that ruins it for the family. I don't know what happened with my life. I often wish i can go to sleep and not wake up. I live with a jobless abusive mother who is only taking advantage of my dad's wealth. 
I know that I am still smart I got a 2400 on my SAT and a 34 on my ACT, i published 3 research papers, but I'm failing at school, i only work on what i enjoy and lately the list has been decreasing dramatically. i wish i can talk to someone. i wish i can get a girlfriend. i wish i can have friends.
