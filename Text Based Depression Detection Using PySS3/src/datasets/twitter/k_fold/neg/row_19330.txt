Everyday and every night .Iâ€™m tired .  My bf passed away 3 months ago.   

 I had already been diagnosed with depression and anxiety before I met him . After I met him it was all still there , but I wanted to be better. I didnâ€™t think about killing myself every day. Sure I had my days still where Iâ€™d breakdown crying . But he was there . He was there to help me to remind me why I was alive , or at least  why I was still alive . 

Iâ€™ve been sober from alcohol from over 2 yrs ... and I felt like he was my gift for doing so good . 
 
I had been staying over basically everyday and 7 months in he asked me to just move in already . I relocated my job so that I was closer to his place . 

Now heâ€™s gone . Someone who loved life , who didnâ€™t think like me . He loved being alive . But yet heâ€™s dead . The worst part is I feel like itâ€™s all my fault and I donâ€™t care anymore how many people want to tell me itâ€™s not . It shouldâ€™ve been me . 

Now all Iâ€™ve thought about since heâ€™s been gone is how Iâ€™m going to end it already . I miss him . Now Iâ€™m alone . With just his things . His pictures . His clothes . I feel like everyone has moved on and Iâ€™m stuck . Iâ€™m here waiting for him but I know heâ€™s not coming so I donâ€™t want to be here anymore .  

Iâ€™m just tired .
