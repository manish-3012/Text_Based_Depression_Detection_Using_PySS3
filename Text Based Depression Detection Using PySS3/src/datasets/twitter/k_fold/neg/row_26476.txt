I'll see you all on the other sideAfter months of pain over and over again, I've made the decision to take my own life, this is my decision, I take full responsibility for the pain that I will bring to my family. This would be no one's fault but mine. I don't need anyone to help me, my depression has won the battle. I'm sorry to all that I have disappointed and hope that they can just move on with their lives, I'm tired of letting everybody down. I guess technically this is my suicide letter, but who cares really, right? I've never really been happy. My life is my own, so it's not wrong to take what is mine. I hate putting everyone else down with how I act. I know that it's over, every body has to die sometime but I just have to end it now. I don't want to bother anyone with my problems, since they are my own, and my actions have consequences, I have to make up for what I've done, I hate being a burden to my family, so it's best that it ends this way. I'm falling apart. My life is a nightmare, I can't keep trying over and over again. Life is really a role of that only the strong can live in, and I'm not strong enough to keep reliving the same pain over and over again. If anyone has read this all the way through, I just want you to know that it means a lot that someone could actually give a crap about something I wrote. I'll finally be free from my pain.
