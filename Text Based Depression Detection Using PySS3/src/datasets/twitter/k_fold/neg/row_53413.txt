I literally feel invisibleI feel like I have everything wrong with me mentally. I don't know how to not look at stuff and see a possible way of ending it, it's been how my mind has worked for ages. I know how I'd want to go, and Im beginning to think it might be time soon. I'm just a drain on resources. Just wanted to tell anyone, I've got no real friends left, so this seemed like the logical place to write.
