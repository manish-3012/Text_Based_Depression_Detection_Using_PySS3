Im just gonna keep posting until I stop feeling this wayI'm scared, I'm spiralling out of control. When pushed up against a wall I default to just deciding there's no recovering from these circumstances and I should just die. I don't trust that part of me, I know writing helps ground me. 

Holy fuck this would be a whole lot easier if i was dead though
