Becoming more real thoughtsI have struggled with depression since high school. My uncle took his life when I was a senior and since then it only worsened. I'm 27 now and I think I'm finally getting to a real point where suicide is an option. 

I cant talk to anyone outside of the internet. They would freak out and restrain me to a ward somewhere forever essentially killing me in every way besides physical. 

I'm on the verge of being homeless. Cant pay rent, car wont run. Cant find a new job due to car. Phone is about to be shut off. Family has all moved away and none of them are doing great either. 

I just feel empty. I dont know how I got here or what im supposed to do. Everything went downhill so fast. Every option ends up in the same place. I genuinely feel like I'm tired of being so emotionally tired.
