My friend told me that telling her about my attempt was " emotional manipulation"Last night I was having a bad time, a nice panic attack after bring told I'm being let go. I reached out to a friend and asked her to talk, something to just get my mind off things for a few moments, let the brain breath. She was annoyed and said we can text but as I was texting her she got more and more annoyed that I wasn't talking about anything "important", I couldn't keep it in very well and started breaking down about what I was going through and she just sort of, brushed it aside. Since she wasn't responding I started getting more and more emotive and fantastical I'm my words because I didn't think they were even being read.

She was, and before I get torn apart by comments yes, I know that I was wrong to get so emotional about it and start talking hyperbolicly, I was falling apart and I didn't k ow what i was saying till I read it back later on

I don't know what to do and she's got it I'm her head that I made up the panic attack to just lose it on her. I don't know what to do but I want out.  I want my friend back, I want to be understood. I'm trying so hard, seeing a therapist regularly but I needed her to talk just once and it was too much I guess. Maybe. I was asking for too much I was being extreme maybe. I don't know how to fix this and I'm so deeply alone now. Another "friend" said I'm not alone and tried to compare what she went.through to what's going on but I don't see them as similar. I'm so empty and I just want out, is that so bad?
