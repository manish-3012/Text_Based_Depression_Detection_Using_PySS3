I deserve to die and I canâ€™t wait until I have the guts to kill myself tonightLife is not worth it. Being alive is constant suffering. It feels like being suffocated slowly but it never ends, nothing actually ever stops and youâ€™re just struggling to breathe the whole time waiting for it to stop. I just want it to stop.
