Literally fucked up my entire life in the span of 3 months...I think itâ€™s just time. Some shit happened over the weekend and I think itâ€™s pretty much the universe telling me to do it. I feel like a shitty person. Nothing is going right in life, Iâ€™m embarrassed and ashamed of so many things. Iâ€™m formulating my plan right now, making sure I donâ€™t have any loose ends.
