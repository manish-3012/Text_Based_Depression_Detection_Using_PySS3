suicidal thoughts over a year.i can't get them out of my head. it's like my brain is searching for escape. i'm not clinically depressed. i've been to therapists. i'm smart and independent, and a bunch of other positive things, so people don't really question how i feel. or think anything is serious. since i seem ok. which is fine? or good?

but i'm lonely. and i live with these thoughts. i keep trying to practice good things. but the thoughts come back. and it is especially triggered when someone blatantly doesn't care about me. which, as you can guess, just happened to me. awful feeling.

sometimes i convince myself i'm doing this to myself.

i worry about myself. and about others. i really want to be able to move on and acquire a steady relationship, good friends...a good life. i feel like no one around me is available or interested. i could go on and on. i'm just gonna stop here and go to bed.

on the outside i've got my shit together. people are attracted to me, from all walks of life. but i am afraid to share with them my negative thoughts. i am afraid of letting those wonderful people in. i don't want to push away the good ones.
