Iâ€™m exhaustedEvery time I try to sleep I think of my ex which keeps me awake, makes me sad, makes me feel lonely, and promotes suicidal thoughts. Which come by themselves by the way. I have had suicidal thoughts everyday for years. I wish I died 3 and a half years ago. I want death so badly but I donâ€™t have the balls to kill myself. I guess I should just muster up the courage and go for it. I havenâ€™t been able to do anything successfully since high school and Iâ€™m insufferable to be around thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™ll ever find a SO. I have no meaning and no purpose in life. Iâ€™m sick and tired of being sick and tired. I canâ€™t even sleep. Even if I manage to catch some Zs I have sleep apnea so Iâ€™m gunna wake up just as tired as I fell asleep. Either that or I have to sleep with a breathing machine. My life is fucking terrible. I want cancer. I want any terminal illness. I want to get in a fatal car crash. I want anything to take my life away. Please for the love of god make the pain stop.
