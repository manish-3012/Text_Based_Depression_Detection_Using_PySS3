Am I simply just too lazy to live? Am I just too lazy for life? I don't study, I don't complete assignments, I don't have friends, I barely eat, I barely take care of myself. Are some of us just not cut out for life? The thing is, I was diagnosed with depression but I don't really feel sad. I'm too lazy to live. I don't want to work, and I don't have a dream job because I dont dream of labor. I don't want a family in the future, I don't care if I get married. I'm in college &amp; barely maintaining my terrible GPA. I literally cannot do anything, I'm actually brain dead. Maybe I'm disabled? Why can't I do anything in life?  I have no desire kill myself, but is that what I'm supposed to do?
