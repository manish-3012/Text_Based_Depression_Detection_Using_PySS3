no one would carei really donâ€™t think anyone would care if i died. sure, theyâ€™d be sad for a little while, but eventually their world would keep turning without me in it. 

iâ€™m just so tired. no, tired isnâ€™t big enough. iâ€™m just so exhausted. completely worn out. iâ€™m just eternally digging this hole thatâ€™s 100% labor and 0% payoff. 

everything i touch crumbles and itâ€™s all my fault. iâ€™d love it if i could just fall asleep and never wake up.
