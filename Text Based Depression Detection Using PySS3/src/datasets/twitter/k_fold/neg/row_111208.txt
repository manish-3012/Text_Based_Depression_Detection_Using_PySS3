Donâ€™t suicide, live suicidal.*If u ever decided to suicide, donâ€™t.
Go buy a gun, and go rob a bank, or a market, if u didnâ€™t get caught uâ€™ll be kinda rich, if u were about to get caught kill urself. #life_hack

I will quote for you Nietzsche:
The secret of realizing the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment of existence is: to live dangerously! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships out into uncharted seas! Live in conflict with your equals and with yourselves! Be robbers and ravagers as soon as you ca not be rulers and owners, you men of knowledge! The time will soon past when you could be content to live concealed int he woods like timid deer!
