Too much wrongMy job is boring as he'll so all I do is think depressing thoughts.

None of my friends want to see me or activaley prevent it or even talk to me.

I think about my ex far too much and it makes me feel like a pathetic lunatic.

I get drunk and send creepy messages to random people who hardly care if I exist.

I'll be stuck at home with my parents forever and never do anything with my life.

And sometimes things are positive and I feel like I'm better, but inevitably I crash like this forever putting me in the same spot. That is far more miserable.
