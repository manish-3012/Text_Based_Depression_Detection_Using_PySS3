I'm Not OK... Haven't Been OK For Years...I don't know why I'm doing this. I hardly matter anyway, and it's not like talking to people online means much of anything compared to having someone to talk to in real life. I have no one except the people I talk to online. I've had days where I want to die. Too many days. I don't value my life. I don't value myself. I hardly think much of myself at all. I'm nobody.

I've distanced myself from everyone because of something that happened years ago in high school. Yeah, it was a relationship that turned sour before it ever had the chance to become something. She dumped me and became a lesbian. I isolated myself to the point that I never sat at a lunch table to eat, but rather on the floor against a wall. I don't think anyone will ever want me. I'm ugly, fat, and uninteresting. I feel like my life is meaningless compared to others, and my problems are nothing compared to what others have had to face.

I don't know what to do anymore. I've talked to a therapist before, but I could only do so a select number of times due to the service being provided by my university. Almost nothing came of it. I still have no self-confidence... It gets worse when I play games as I rage by insulting myself and saying that I'm garbage, unworthy to be a teammate/opponent, etc... I'm a mess, and I don't want pills... Please, I'm lost and scared and depressed...
