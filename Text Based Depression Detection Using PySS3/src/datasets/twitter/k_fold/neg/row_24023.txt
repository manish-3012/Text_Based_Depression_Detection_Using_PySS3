NooseTied a noose out of a computer cord and am just holding it in a tight grip around my neck while I lie in bed. It feels comforting, but Iâ€™m so scared that this is the end for me. I just want to die.
Im off my antidepressants, doctors orders (for reasons) and Iâ€™ve had a lot of feelings recently. And I have a lot of good friends and Iâ€™ve had a really good time in life, but it all feels like itâ€™s been leaning up to a sort of â€œlast mealâ€. A last good time. Iâ€™ve dropped out of school courses, Iâ€™m a lot less stressed, I have good friends and family that care, and I feel like itâ€™s been setting up a good scenario for me to die in. I feel like itâ€™s the end for me
