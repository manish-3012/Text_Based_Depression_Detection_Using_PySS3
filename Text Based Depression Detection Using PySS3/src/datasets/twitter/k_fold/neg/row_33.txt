I need to know a good pistolIâ€™m shopping online for pistols right now. Tonightâ€™s been rough. 

I have no clue about guns whatsoever but Iâ€™ve been depressed for years now and Iâ€™m growing weary. 

So basically Iâ€™m hoping someone can point me in the right direction of a good pistol that can end me without just maiming me.

I have no idea. Money is no object at this point.

Any help is appreciated!
