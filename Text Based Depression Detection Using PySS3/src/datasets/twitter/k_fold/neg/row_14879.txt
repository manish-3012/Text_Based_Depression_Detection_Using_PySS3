Just a goodbye to some good peopleI am incredibly sorry to anyone who is going to read this and know that I will no longer be here soon. I do not want to make anyone worry about my well being or health, I just want every single person to forget about me so that I can peacefully die without hurting anyone and get out of this fucking place.

I am a bad person. That's okay. I probably deserve to be feeling this way because of the way I act sometimes. I am no ones priority, but that's how it's supposed to be. There are people that care about me in my life. I care about them as well, i'd literally do anything to make sure they're ok. But it doesn't matter if they care about me or not, they will be better off without me. There are many reasons why I have decided to do this, some being how I am a shit human being and how I will never be in a romantic relationship with anyone, even though that is all that I wish for at this point. Thats it. Equally returned love. But I can't have that, I deserve to not have it anyway.

I just wanted to write this to say goodbye. I'm sure all of you are good people and please never go the same route that I am going down, even though it's hypocritical for me to say. I love all of you, even though you will forget about this in a couple hours, I love you all. Thank you for everything.
