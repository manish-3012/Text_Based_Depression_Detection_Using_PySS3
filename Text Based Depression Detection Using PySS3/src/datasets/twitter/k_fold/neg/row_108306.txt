I'm 14 and I have a couple of problems. HelpI am a 14 years old boy and I'd like some help with a couple of problems I currently have in my life:

- I am often happy, I am often smiling and laughing, this always happens when I am with my friends, but happiness doesn't seem enough and it feels so common, something that we've set as our main goal to our life just feels so common and uninteresting, it just doesn't feel enough. I also am very pessimistic and perfectionist (Im working on being less perfectionist so that's good) and because of that, plus what I have already explained about how happiness feels, life doesn't seem worth it, I can see myself suiciding within 10-12 years.

- It's not only that happiness feels pretty common and not enough, also, many things in life don't make me feel anything, for example, a beautiful landscape or a blue sky, forest, a jungle, galaxies, stars, whatever, they just don't seem beautiful for me, if someone offered a homeless man to stay in  his house, food, etc it doesnt seem beautiful for me, maybe here someone leaves a comment telling me things that other people would consider beautiful, idk, compliments or whatever, but still it won't make me feel anything.

- I am extremely unmotivated for school, and it's not because of bullying or something along the lines, I just couldn't care less about what I'm being teached (except maths), and I consistently get good grades, I've never failed a subject in my life and people tell me that I'm pretty smart. All the time spent in class just seems lime a waste of time considering the amount of knowledge and information that is actually going to stay when you leave school (I'm not even talking about the application that info will have in our lives...)

Thank you if you have read my whole post and I hope you can help me
