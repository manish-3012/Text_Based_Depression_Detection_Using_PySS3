Constantly tormented by severe OCD and I just want the pain to stop.It takes me 3-4 hours to take a shower. It takes me 5-6 hours to use the toilet and wash my hands. No matter how much I wash, I never feel fully clean. I only stop washing because I'm too exhausted to do it any more. I'm constantly terrified that I'll touch something that will require me to wash my hands afterwards. My entire life revolves around abject terror of the bathroom and of bodily fluids, including my own. Trying to wash my hands results in screaming, crying, and frantically begging for someone to make it stop.

I wish someone would hold me and tell me that it's okay, that I'm okay, that even if I do get a little bit of bodily fluids on my possessions, it's not that big a deal and certainly doesn't mean that those possessions are ruined forever. I wish someone would take the pain away. I wish I'd had the courage to end myself when I had the chance. Now all I can do is pray that God will kill me in my sleep. This is a total nightmare. I don't think even the worst person in the world deserves to suffer like this.
