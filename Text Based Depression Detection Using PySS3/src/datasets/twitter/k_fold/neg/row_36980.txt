Thinking of ending it in February.I'm done. I've lived a life of 23 years and every moment has been nothing but bullshit. From the earliest I can remember, everything's always been shit. Supposedly we never had any money, but my mother could always afford to get herself expensive treats, clothes or go stay in expensive hotels while I was left to 'watch the house'. The house that was decrepit and worthless, filled with fucking roaches and garbage. But I never complained. There was probably a good reason for it all, I thought. It'll all get better, I thought. And now here I am.

I have reached the absolute limit of what I can withstand. Even small luxuries like having a shit computer and the internet can't make this ongoing bullshit any better. I don't qualify for any jobs because I have no experience, I have minimal education, and I rarely have any clothes that are actually presentable. I want out of this house with this fucking bitch, but I can't. I'm trapped. So I'm done. I don't see any way for this to work out.

I don't even know why I'm making this post, really. I guess I just want something to do. Or, maybe I just wanted to voice my complaints. Whatever it is, it's out there.
