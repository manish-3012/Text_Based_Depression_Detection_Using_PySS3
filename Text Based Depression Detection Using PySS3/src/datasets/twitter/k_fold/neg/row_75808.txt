some thoughtsi'm tired of fighting. i'm tired of dragging myself around pretending to be happy, just so the people i love won't be hurt. i know it's selfish, but i just want to rest. if i could press a button to end it all, i wouldn't hesitate. i'm not afraid to die. i just want to press a button and enjoy the silence.

it's kinda pathetic. i can't even handle the bare minimum of existing. even then, i'm not strong enough to end things myself. every day is just another 24 hours of wishing for a freak accident to take care of things for me.
