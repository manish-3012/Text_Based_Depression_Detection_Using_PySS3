HiI have been suicidal before I even understood or knew of the word.

I think because of this I have become less vocal about it.

I'm so good at naturally hiding it. No one seems to take notice. 

I could openly say it in a non-joking manner and it would soon be forgotten. 

I don't want attention. I just wanted help.

The only person in my life I readily inform will start going off about their struggles. 

I'm grown tired of this. 

My life has been shit since day one. 

Probably before as my mom said she wanted to abort me but didn't have the money.

I wish I could send back old bills to her.

If it wasn't for my dog I wouldn't be here. 

I'm considering just rehoming him. He's a good boy, someone better will take better care of him.

I have been thinking of my options a lot recently. 

Things are hard. I hate everything.

I have no one.

It's only me and my dog at this point.
