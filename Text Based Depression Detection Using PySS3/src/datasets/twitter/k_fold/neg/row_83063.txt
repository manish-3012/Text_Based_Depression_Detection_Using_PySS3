Honestly, why the fuck shouldn't I?It's not like I'm doing much with my life. I'm barely passing my classes, I don't have a job (didn't have one even before this pandemic), I'm lazy, I'm stupid... I could keep going. Even if, by some miracle, I manage to get through college, I'm not gonna *do* anything with my degree. I'm just gonna sit in my childhood bedroom, leeching up my parent's money as I don't even try to do anything with my life. And yeah, sure, *maybe* my family and **one surviving friend** (and honestly, not sure how long that's gonna last) would be sad for a week or two, but they'd quickly get over it. Not only that, but they'd realize that their lives are better without me in them. Without me taking their focus. Without me robbing them of their free time. Without me draining them of funds. Without me clinging to their ankles and dragging them down. 

For once in my shitty life, I'm not just thinking of myself. I'm thinking about someone else. I'm putting someone else's life before my own. They'd all live better lives. What happens to me doesn't matter.
