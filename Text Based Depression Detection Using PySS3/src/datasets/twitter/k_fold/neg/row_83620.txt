I'm ending it tonightHi again.


I finally gathered the courage to end it for good. I don't see why I should bother going through all the shit people give me every day. I'm so sick of all the pain and anxiety I've been feeling for way too long. I always try so fucking hard to make it through, I try so hard to fix my life, but each time someone just casually comes and fucking destroys it. People either try to avoid me or they shit all over me. I don't even know what's worse anymore. I have no motivation, no will to live because I'm constantly uncomfortable and hurt, and nothing brings me peace.
