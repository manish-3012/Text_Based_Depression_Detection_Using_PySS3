For those who are down... maybe you can relateIâ€™ve been down. As dark as I can imagine. Waking up in paralyzing fear not sure if Iâ€™m may be  dreaming. I didnâ€™t know what I was afraid of but it felt like everything. I was afraid to turn my head, to raise my arm, just paralyzed. Iâ€™d sit in bed scared, negative thoughts racing through my head. It would go on for days, weeks, months. Iâ€™d look outside the window at the trees, they appeared fake almost plastic nothing was beautiful. Not one single happy thought could penetrate this concrete wall that encased my brain. I fight every second just trying to keep my head above the water. Driving to work, daydreaming of crashing, listening to my family, their voices are unrecognizable as if they are ghosts just there to taunt me. I keep on going. One morning I wake up and I can feel it. There is a crack in the concrete, the restriction on my mind has lessened ever so slightly. Itâ€™s a thought, just one simple thought. Of maybe a chance of there being hope. I hold onto this thought for dear life. This one thought is keeping me going. Weeks go by and with each day there is a new ray of light that somehow and someway is managing to pierce through the thick fog that clouds my mind.  One more happy thought and the fog breaks. Iâ€™m driving as this is happening and it feels as though shock waves are ripping through my body and as if I had just breathed for the first time I donâ€™t know what else to do but scream because I cannot contain the emotions coming out of me that had been trapped. I ride this wave for as long as I can but it only lasts so long until I hit another slope. The cycle repeats itself. Iâ€™m stuck. Idk how many more fights I have left in me.
