Is it wrong to not want to go to therapy?I went to a counselor when I was in high school and I regret wasting my time. Although I know my counselor meant well and that he was genuinely trying to help me, I personally just donâ€™t want to help myself. I just want to purchase a gun and go blow my brains out in the forest.

I have also called the suicide hotline and texted to the suicide textline numerous times throughout the past 6 years. This time, I have decided that I do not want to seek help anymore and I am just letting my suicidal thoughts consume my life. 

My life from 14 years old to 20 years old has not changed at all when it comes to my mental state. I am still horribly depressed on the inside and I believe that I will continue to be miserable with myself if I donâ€™t end my life. Having a loving relationship, a successful career, or even just having friends will never take away my desire to kill myself. Even if people enjoy my company and like me for who I am I still want to end my life.
