Iâ€™m lostI got heartbroken. I made an impulsive decision and Iâ€™m being asked to move out by June 20th. (Well within their right to do so). I feel numb and think - why not just leave right now. She wonâ€™t be back from Texas until a week or so from now. She wonâ€™t even care why would she. I will get rid of all my stuff. He doesnâ€™t even text back anymore so no need to tell anyone. I can just leave right now and do it. All I do is lay in bed anyway. My life revolves around him - now thereâ€™s nothing. I donâ€™t even have enough or make enough to pay for more than the rent I do right now anyway. Everythingâ€™s shit. I lost everything. I just donâ€™t care anymore. Who does? Nothing matters. I thought weâ€™d be together forever. Itâ€™s all my fault. Maybe if I just wasnâ€™t me things wouldâ€™ve been better.
