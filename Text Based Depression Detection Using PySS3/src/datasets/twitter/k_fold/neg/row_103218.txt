Help?I feel really suicidal, I struggle with depression and anxiety (I think itâ€™s something more than that, I donâ€™t know what, but thatâ€™s what the doctors diagnosed me as). Ive taken 3 different meds, none of which have worked. Iâ€™ve got two essays due next month and a dissertation to complete, I havenâ€™t started any of them so theyâ€™ll be terrible, and my grades which I care so much about will be ruined. Iâ€™ve self harmed all my life and have been clean for a few months, but the urge right now is unreal - this time not NSSI, but with suicidal intent. I have no idea what to do, I donâ€™t want to kill myself because it would upset the people around me, but I do want to do it because it would relieve me of my existence, I wouldnâ€™t have to live with my depression any more. I really think I should be hospitalised so I can get proper help rather than 6 weeks of bullshit NHS talking therapy (where the therapist said I was making it all up for attention and said I should go on a spa retreat???). But I know they wonâ€™t hospitalise me because of the â€œdoubtâ€ (upsetting people), so itâ€™s all just useless. I wish I had to guts to go through with it right now.
