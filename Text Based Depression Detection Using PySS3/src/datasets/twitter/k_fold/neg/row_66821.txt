Iâ€™m waiting for my mother to passAs long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve been depressed. Thereâ€™s plenty in my life to be happy about. Plenty. And I try to focus on the good despite the tremendous negatives. It doesnâ€™t work. At this point Iâ€™m going on 18 years of fighting this. Iâ€™m 30 now. And I just canâ€™t deal with anymore of this. I donâ€™t come off as a depressed person, and maybe thatâ€™s because Iâ€™ve never told anyone. But I just canâ€™t imagine despite all I have to be grateful for and all the love, that I still feel this way, it wonâ€™t change. 
At this point, my moms health is declining. She has some sort of cancer. Breathing problems. Can barely walk. Sheâ€™s the person I care about most in those world. I think when she passes I will finally have the courage to end myself. I know what itâ€™s like to lose people, siblings, my father, and many friends. My biggest deterrent is that Iâ€™ll leave my remaining loved ones and friends with more of that pain. But I canâ€™t imagine another year of this. Or another decade. I figure when my mom goes. So will I. And Iâ€™m sorry for that but Iâ€™ve held out long enough and itâ€™s insurmountable. I donâ€™t want my mom to be in pain like she is and I donâ€™t want to be in this state anymore. Iâ€™m really sorry.
