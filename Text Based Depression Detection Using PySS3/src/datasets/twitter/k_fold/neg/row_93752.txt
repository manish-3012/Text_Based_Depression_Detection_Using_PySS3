Everything is f i n eEverything is fine. I'm waiting for a massive amount of edibles to kick in. I'm watching the office. My boyfriend is worried for me because I'm acting weird and don't really know what to do. But I'm fine. This will pass.

I'm just an attention whore because that's what people with BPD are, attention whores. We cut and self harm and have eating disorders and try to kill ourselves for attention. That's all we are, attention whores.

I'm "too sensitive" according to my friends, because I cry at the drop of a hat or get sad because I think everyone hates me (for no real reason).

I haven't spoken to my dad in months. But ahh, fuck it, I'm only doing it because I enjoy making those around me miserable. He's not a narcissistic and abusive asshole, I am.

I haven't spoken to my grandmother in months even though she's dying of cancer because it just hurts too much. Oh, because I'm the one in pain here. 

I haven't gotten a single positive response from any of the housing options so I have somewhere to live with my boyfriend when he moves here. But maybe I should try harder.

I've worked every day since June 10th and won't get a day off until the 13th of July.

I can't stop binging food and gaining weight. I've literally gained 50lbs since January. I'm avoiding mirrors, photos and checking the scale because of it. But it's my choice, I could just stop eating if I wanted. I just don't want to. 

Whatever. Edibles are working now. I'm forgetting what I'm writing. So I guess I'm fine.
