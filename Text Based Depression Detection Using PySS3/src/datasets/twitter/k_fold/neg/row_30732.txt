I can't sleep, being alone for me is hellI can't sleep, it's affecting my thinking... being in constant emotional pain and being exhausted means I can't think clearly, I can't work, don't have a reason to enjoy life anymore.... I can't function as a person. I got a Dr appointment but not until next week to get some new meds, don't know if they will help.

I wish I could find a woman somewhat like me, poor, good sense of humor, someone to go through the hell that is life together with, or at least a girl that could understand and had the patience to deal with me. I have very little to offer, but I'm lucky that I have Social Security for my mental illness otherwise I'd been dead a while ago. Any desperate women out there looking for a sugar daddy to make bad decisions with? I'm quite the catch for a middle-aged guy whose been cripplingly depressed his whole life....

I'm going in fucking sane, and I don't want to, I've been through psychosis before, and I really don't want to go back there again. Last time I was in the psych ward it was a week, this time it'll be a month.... maybe I get some of that carfentanyl that's all the rage these days.
