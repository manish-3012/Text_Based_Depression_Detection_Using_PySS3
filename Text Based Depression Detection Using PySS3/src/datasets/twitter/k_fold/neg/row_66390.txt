My SO is suicidal need helpThrow away account

So quick context. My SO and I and living in different countries. This situation probably end in a couple of months.

They have told me in 2 other occasions that they have issues and we have talked about getting professional help. they have tried talking so a specilist and pills in the past.

The other day they told the only reason not to do it is me, as you imagine this is heavy on me. We have agreed that they is going to try again to seek professional help, still I want to help, what can I do?

Excuse me if this is hard to understand English is not my first language
