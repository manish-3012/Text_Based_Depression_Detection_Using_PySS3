I just can't take this misery anymoreI feel so in deep shit and pain, I feel like worst than this is impossible. I feel like doing something that isn't right. Well my problems started when I accepted to start a life in a different country, with my uncle, well my uncle kicked me out of his apartment, so I found a place in the worst dorm you could imagine, I have a chamber that is smaller than the average bathroom, with the pieces of the roof falling on my head, with public toilets that the animals I live with, don't even flush after they shit, and a lot of things that bother me but would be a waste to write them. My health is fucked, I did 2 surgeries and I still have the health problem, I have terrible back pain that makes my life miserable, I have hives, and still battle acne, my throat aches like hell from snoring and I am still battling depression. My family treats my like shit, and my uncle abuses me verbally and emotionally, because of his frustrations, plus my parents are divorced. All that I have are my friends that are all far away from me, they live in other EU states.
I have to pass an exam in a language that I don't really understand. And regarding my dating life it is a fucking mess, even though I am not needy or I don't show my problems. I see all those girls somethimes looking at me in the eyes and I feel that I will never be with them, it is horrible.
I know everything could be worse and I should be positive but fuck this shit I am contemplating suicide
