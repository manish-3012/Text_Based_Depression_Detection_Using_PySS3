Leave a note?I've been unhappy since I was a child and as the years go on there are more and more responsibilities and it seems pointless. None of what's happening brings me any joy or feeling of being content. I can't maintain romantic relationships and since my last one I've put on 25 lbs of weight from drinking. 

I destroyed my knee by misstepping while drunk and the hospital billed me $1000 dollars for just being there after. No care. No diagnosis. Just a bill. 

So I can't walk and I'm sure if I get surgery it'll be another several thousand I don't have. I can't work and even if I could I make nothing. I am in a black hole of personal and family issues that pile up more and more as the months go on. 

My only question is should I leave a note to my family. I'm 22 and it just seems like it's the right thing to do. I'm getting very close to finally being done but idk if I should leave one as it might upset them.
