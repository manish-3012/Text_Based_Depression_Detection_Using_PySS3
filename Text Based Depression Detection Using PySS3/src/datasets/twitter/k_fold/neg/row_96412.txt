Here's what I don't get...1) Universal advise is "if things get bad, reach out for help. Okay, fine.

2) So you do that. But guess what? When you're really far down, that can be a Herculean act of courage, strength, trust, and hope... thins that quite obviously in very short supply. Doing so is very fucking draining.

3) This shit is scary, yo! You want to die, yes, but since you've reached out, obviously you're clinging to *some* hope. You're confused. You're scared. You're conflicted. You're angry. You don't want to die, but think you will. You don't know what to do. You equally *do* and *don't* want to talk about it. If given the slightest chance, you WILL run from from the conversation, and claim everything is "fine."

4) You cannot continuously muster the strength to ask for help again and again and again. 

5) The conversation always, ALWAYS, ends with "I'm here if you need me."

FUCK THAT NOISE!!!

No, Goddamnit! What was just established is: **I'm** HERE. And I need you! 

How fucking hard is it to shoulder a bit of burden of effort and reach out to the person you supposedly care about and want to help? Perhaps showing that not only are you "here for them" (implying they have to come to you), but that they are worth the effort to go to **where they are** might be kinda really fucking nice.

And for fuck's sake! No! They're not "fine." Obviously you shouldn't force it out of them... but don't just fucking cave in and retreat just 'cuz their first response is "I'm fine." If you're not even willing to ask twice, how the hell are they going to trust you're actually willing to listen in the first place? And did you ever think that maybe starting those conversations is FUCKING HARD AS SHIT so maybe **you** being the instigator, asking questions, easing it out of them might be nice?

What I don't get is why people even bother saying "I'm here if you need me." Bullshit! You are putting forth the bare minimum effort necessary to not feel like an asshole, but really, you'd rather not get involved.
