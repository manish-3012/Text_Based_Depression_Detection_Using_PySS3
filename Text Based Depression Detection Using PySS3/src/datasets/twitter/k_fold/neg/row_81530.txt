Something is brewing within.Iâ€™ve been reading though a lot of these posts and donâ€™t identify with many of the issues people have. Iâ€™m healthy, stable life and nothing to really be sad about and not depressed as far as I can tell. However more and more I sit alone and get a sudden thought of how it wouldnâ€™t be so bad to no longer be alive. Iâ€™m trying to process this and understand if itâ€™s a normal occurrence with others, or the start of something deeper. Anyone share this experience?
