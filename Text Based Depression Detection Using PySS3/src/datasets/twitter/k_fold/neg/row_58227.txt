Being suicidal is not a choicePeople just seems to think that if you choice "not wanting to die" you stop being suicidal immediately, YOU THINK IF IT WAS THAT SIMPLE I WOULDN'T WISH TO DIE?! I CAN'T FUCKING CONTROL IT, YOU JUST DON'T GO AND SAY "oh this is a good day to be suicidal" THE THOUGHT JUST COMES AND RUINS MY ENTIRE DAY if it was that simple to stop I don't think anyone would be here in this subreddit
