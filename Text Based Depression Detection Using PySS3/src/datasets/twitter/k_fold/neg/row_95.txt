can't shake the suicidal ideationi've struggled on and off with depression for my whole adolescence, and have managed to cope the last 6 years without medication and the last 3 without therapy. it's been important to me to give off the air of being well-adjusted. i'm a good student at a good university, with good friends and good hobbies. 

still, i've never been able to completely move on from thinking about suicide: in the best of times, it's distant and amusing-to-think-about, in the worst it's a seriously-considered recourse. i just can't seem to feel fulfilled by any of my relationships, any of my accomplishments. even though i imagine by most accounts i'd be considered a happy, sociable, well-liked person, i feel like i just want to tie up my responsibilities, distribute my things, and get lost. almost unconsciously, i imagine the feeling of the barrel of a gun on the roof of my mouth, or what it would feel like to jump off a bridge or jump into traffic. 

it's totally humiliating.
