How I wrecked everything, built it back up, and still want to die.Itâ€™s been over a year and I still canâ€™t forgive myself for fucking it all up.

I was getting my degree in clinical psych. Over the course of one year I got kicked off of a research project I cared a lot about, lost my job as a clinician at a treatment clinic, and got kicked out of my last practicum 2 months before I was set to graduate. 
I tried to kill myself then, but I didnâ€™t succeed.

Now fast forward a year and a half.

I graduated with a masters degree in general psych. Iâ€™m not even proud. Iâ€™m sort of glad COVID cancelled my graduation because I just want no part of it. 

Iâ€™m working as a research assistant at a hospital- it doesnâ€™t pay much and I donâ€™t get much recognition at my level. Iâ€™m just kind of a yes-woman to someone with more knowledge and money than me. Itâ€™s an entry level position with no future.

I thought it would get better, but it still looks as dim as ever. I wish Iâ€™d die of a heart attack. Iâ€™ll never be successful like I wanted to be. Iâ€™ve tried losing 25 pounds, becoming a leader in my church group, everything that might make me feel worthwhile again but I just donâ€™t. l pray that God will just end me but he doesnâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to be here.
