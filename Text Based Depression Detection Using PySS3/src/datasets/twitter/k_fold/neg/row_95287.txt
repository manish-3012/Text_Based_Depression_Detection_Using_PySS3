I want to end it all, but I have so much to live for.I feel like my insides are about to explode. It's a mixed mania episode. There are bugs crawling under my skin. I just want to scream and break everything. I've never felt this crazy in my entire life. I have so much to life for. I'm going back to school in January. I have my husband who supports me 100%. I just need to make it through this episode.
