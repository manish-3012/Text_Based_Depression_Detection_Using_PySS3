scared of loosing my relationship and everyone i lovei swear i can never do anything right. im always pissing everyone off. i should just kill myself so no one has to deal with me anymore no one wants my ugly fat ass. im scared my bf will find someone better and skinnier and not fucking crazy. someone who has their shit together. i cannot fucking take this anymore, im so sad and stressed nothing will ever get better.
