Rope available in garage, but too scared to use it.Also I wouldn't know where to do it that'd hold my weight, nor how to tie the thing.  If I really wanted to do it, wouldn't I find a way around these obstacles?  So basically if I can't bring myself to attempt anything, then I'm in no real danger.  Not worth a crisis line's time, probably not worth posting here, certainly not worth reaching out to a friend.  But I do go through this debate often (wanting to wither and die, kill myself for freedom/relief/spite...then getting too scared or having a panic attack).  I'm feeling quite fuzzy and heavy...not sure what to do as this is probably not normal.  These feelings have mostly started last summer with a birth control change.  I've since went from nuvaring to implanon...implanon is better, but I'm still getting these feelings.  Not to mention environmental factors that may play a role, but would take forever to type up.
