I feel trappedThis time last year I was severely depressed, since then nothing has changed apart from the fact that I lost my job due to covid, my girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me so I had to move back to my mums and now I can never see my 2 dogs again, they are 90% of the reason why I haven't already jumped infront of a train. My little brother is turning the same age i was when my mums ex husband would beat me so its bringing on alot of those memories being around him again because I'm at home. The worst part is I cant even bring myself to end my life because i feel to guilty leaving my mum and brother behind to deal with the same pain I'm feeling now. I hate myself every day. Anytime my eyes open I just wish they fucking hadn't. I took 7 tramadol tablets a few nights ago thinking it would just let me drift into nothingness but all it did was make me vomit and sleep naked on the bathroom floor. I understand why people commit mass shootings and bombings now although I never would I can relate to the human condition that wants to inflict its own pain onto others. Fuck my life
