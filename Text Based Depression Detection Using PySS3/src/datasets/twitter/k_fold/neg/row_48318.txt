Am I worth that much as people say I am??i turn a blind eye to what is good, but I focus on what Is bad.

why can't I be normal? why can't I see what I am doing to myself is bad, and I should stop telling myself the truth..

I need to start lying to myself, and  if I pretend long enough.. maybe I'll be normal like everyone else..

but I have tried for the longest time to fix myself on my own. And wanna know how far I've gotten? I've gone backwards.. I'm worse from when I started to try to fix my mental health.. 



My brother.. I can't go to him, he'll not believe me and just make a joke out of it, I can't trust my sister, she wouldn't understand, she has tuned into a different version of my brother. She can't be trusted anymore, my mom has her own problems that I can't help her with, and I feel responsible for that, because she has an extra mouth to feed every single damn day.


I can't remember a day without me hating myself, I can't live on life quiet and alone.. I have done most things I wanted done.. so all that is left for me to do-... is to die.. I mean, nobody cares enough to take what I say seriously! so what is the point on being here...?
