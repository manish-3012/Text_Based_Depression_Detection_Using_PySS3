Apart of me wishes I didnâ€™t have any friends or family, so that I wouldnâ€™t have to devastate them with my suicide.I feel so stuck. Like thereâ€™s nothing I can do. If I kill myself it will ruin my brothers life, and I think it would possibly drive *him* to suicide. Weâ€™ve talked about it before, and I think as soon as one of us dies, the other will shortly after. 

 My mother would never *ever* get over it. 

Itâ€™s so fucking stupid. If I kill myself I very well could be wiping out my entire family in one moment. But what am I supposed to do? Just keep on living? Is that my only option here?

I have a progressive terminal disease, and life is *literally* going to keep getting worse and worse, until I eventually end up in the hospital on life support. I want to end it on my own terms, I donâ€™t want to die a slow painful death surrounded by people in a hospital bed, barely even able to breathe. 

But I have to just keep going. Iâ€™m on antidepressants, and weâ€™ve upped the dosage but after about a month they seem to stop just working. Itâ€™s as if thereâ€™s just nothing I can do but just keep wasting away. 

I feel so stuck.
