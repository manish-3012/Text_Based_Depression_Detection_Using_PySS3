Suicidal. Struggling with guilt, though.I'm a romantically lonely guy. Always have been. Virgin in my 30s, etc. etc. Usually I didn't let it get me too down. I went on with life. I had a pretty sad life but, honestly, in many ways it's gotten better lately.

But last year my armor was stripped off. All the rationalizations, all the ability to be happy without someone. An incredible woman came into my life. I met her online. She already had a boyfriend she'd been living with but she was fed up. We were about a thousand miles apart but, no big. I was going to move to be with her.

For ten months she promised me the world. Amazing sex ( in great detail. ) We had crazy phone sex. I'm a virgin so it was pretty exciting. I've seen her naked ( and getting naked pictures of someone that are *just for you* is pretty awesome if you're not used to it. )

Plus I love her. I mean being promised sex when you're a virgin is a big thing, trust me, but even if I had been mister pussyslayer beforehand I just love her for who she is. She used to go on an on about having my babies and how much she loved me.

Time wore on. She was too afraid to change, too afraid to leave the relationship she was in. Now we barely talk. There's some talk about us getting together in the future after some financial stuff that's holding her down is out of the way, but I'm not sure if I should take it seriously.

I'm so lonely, so physically and emotionally lonely and I don't know how to meet anyone else. My attempts to date since then have all failed because I have no idea what I'm doing. 

I don't know a way out. She made me forget how to be happy alone. She changed everything. Now I want things and need things I never wanted or needed before, and I'm afraid. 

I want to kill myself but, if she ever found out I know she'd blame herself and it's not really her fault. She's just not wanting to leave the man she's with because they have years of history and she'd lose most of her other friends, etc. It's not her fault I'm bad with other women and not that good looking.

But I'm so lonely, and just tired. I try to put a brave face on it but I'm falling apart, and fast. I know in my state I could go buy a shotgun today and just go somewhere quiet and end it. It's fairly likely to work. I've done the research.

I can't even cry. I can't feel anything anymore. I'm legitimately worried that, if I let my mind drift, I won't be around in twelve hours. But I don't want to have that stigma on top of everything else so I don't want to seek help in person.

I'm so close to the end, though.
