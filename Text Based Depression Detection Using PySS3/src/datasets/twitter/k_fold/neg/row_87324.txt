I'm fucking sick of being the weird guy and the failure.I'm the weird guy. I'm terrible with people. I'm shy. I'm awkward. When people consider inviting me out they likely go "are you sure you wanna invite armchairplane?" Why? Because I always fuck up. I always do something embarrassing or inappropriate or w.e. 

Also I'm the fucking failure. I failed out of college several times. I fail at exercising and eating right and being healthy. I work as a fucking pizza delivery driver, the stereotypical college dropout job (with a fucking douchebag manager and co-workers I couldn't care less about).

I'm sick of all this shit. The only thing stopping me from suffocating myself on a bit of helium is that it would kill my parents if I did. If it fucking weren't for them I'd do it today. Fuck.
