Fuck this placeIâ€™ve been suicidal ever since I was 11. Iâ€™ve dealt with anxiety since first grade. I fucked my education up in high school because ADD and now my first year in college I have to take online. Yesterday was the first day of zoom classes and let me tell you no amount of adderall will be able to help me through this shit show. Every single class has 10+ assignments due each week. Even though it was only the first day it was the cherry on top of the 2020 Sunday. This really just pushed me over the edge. Iâ€™ve planned how I would do it and where. Iâ€™m trying to stay strong and I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold.
