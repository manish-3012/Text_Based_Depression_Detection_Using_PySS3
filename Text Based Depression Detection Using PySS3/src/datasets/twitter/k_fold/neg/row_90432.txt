So this is my storyI just want my story out there. I've lurked about this sub for the last three months and you seem rather genuine. It's hard to pick a start. I'm nearing 30 one year ago I tried opening my own business I borrowed from my mothers retirement to open it, in the months I was out of business. I didn't realize that my lease was personally guaranteed and it was a 5 year lease, so now they are suing me. I ended up filing bankruptcy at the time I had just secured a job so I filled 13 meaning I make payments but keep my stuff, well come back to this. it had been almost 10 years since I had even had a date and I think that did some damage being and feeling alone that long, but I met a girl she was cute, nerdy, and single. We dated and I feel for her hard, but at month 3 she suddenly didn't feel the same, and worse than dump she friend-zoned me. I still had to see her 2-3 times a week, she became part of my limited friend circle. I told myself I'd win her back and that's how made it through. She dumped me two weeks before I was sued and filled bankruptcy two weeks later I was asked to resign because business was slow. And now I find out she had immediately hooked up with her high school crush. I decided I can't be around her any more, I have to give up my activities that I started so I wouldn't be shut in because I refuse to make my friends choose and I'm not sure I'd win. Somehow I'm the asshole for not wanting to be around her anymore. 

I've had the thoughts for awhile, but never as strong as this. I can see how I'm burning bridges leaving me with no outs. I can't get a job, I've lost my friends, I'm about to lose bankruptcy protection which means I lose everything I own, and I don't think I can handle the shame anymore. Thanks for listening.
