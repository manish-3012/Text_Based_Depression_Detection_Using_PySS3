Why do I feel this way when I have nothing to worry about?I have had depression and eating disorder since I was 16. Now I'm 33 (female). Life seemed good and easy at times in my 20s until my depression and suicidal thoughts hit me. I have a degree, established my life in a foreign country, somewhat decent career and a very caring boyfriend. Last summer my depression got worse due to stress at my new job. I could not stop crying all day and night, and extreme anxiety hit me every time I tried to get myself out of the door. I wanted to disappear and blamed myself for being so weak. Eventually, I resigned from the job. I had to. For the last 5 months, I did nothing. Thankfully I had savings and my bf supported me. He says there was nothing to worry about, just get better. After NY, I decided to start applying for jobs again. I got interviews and one of them is at the final stage. I should be happy. Life will be good again. But last 2 days my old thoughts are back. I want to disappear. I can't get out of my bed. I feel like a failure. My suicidal thoughts feel real this time. I don't know what is wrong with me. How can I live my life like this that every time I get a bit better I get a kick back?

I know I will not have answers by posting this here but I just wanted to let it out.

Apologies as english is not my first language.
