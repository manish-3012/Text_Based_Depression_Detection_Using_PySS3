This subreddit is making me feel sadAs the title says, I've noticed that for some time now whenever I visit this subreddit and see posts of people confessing about their suicidal thoughts/schedules etc makes me feel kinda sad even when I'm in a good mood. Now you maybe asking me why I joined this group in the first place but I've been struggling with depression for the last 4 years of my life and while I had some good progressions over time it just never went away completely. The bad thoughts, the painful amount of sadness, the voice that keeps telling you you're worthless and that nobody likes you, suicidal fantasies etc and I felt like if I saw people struggling more than I do I'd feel bad about them and maybe reconsider about my own thoughts and feelings but in the end I just end up getting all the negative feelings again even if time passes and I start feeling okay, it just never leaves me completely, it's always there peeking at my mind and whenever something happens it just comes back to me. I'm tired of this and I'm not going to let it get to me anymore so I'm just going to leave all the groups talking about depression memes, suicide and stuff and I'll see if I have any progression at all. Not a big deal but I think if I start with small steps like this one, I might be able to pull through someday :D

Note: not sure if this is the right place to post but I just felt the need to share my thoughts
