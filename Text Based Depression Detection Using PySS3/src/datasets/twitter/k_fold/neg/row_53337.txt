Failing 3 classes, no future, no relationship skills... why should I stay?I absolutely hate myself, little things set me off. 

I'm failing 3 classes the worst being math, my future is nonexistent and if I do continue living my life is just going to be depending on others. So why bother? I'm trying so hard to care and nothing is working and I just really want to die and not deal with anything anymore.
