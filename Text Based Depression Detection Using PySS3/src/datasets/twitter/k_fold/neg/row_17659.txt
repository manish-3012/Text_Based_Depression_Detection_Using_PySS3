I don't get it at allNo one cares about me. No one wants me in their life. All my friends have families now and don't have time to see me. My ex doesn't want to speak to me at all, she absolutely hates me. I keep losing family. The family I have doesn't involve me in anything. I've been depressed for at least a decade now. I'm only 30. A third of my life I've been depressed. 

Why does everyone keep telling me it gets better. The meds helped stabilize me to where I don't have horrible meltdowns anymore but if I don't have anyone in my life, if I'm just a ghost, then why do people tell me to not kill myself.

None of them care, they don't invite me anywhere. Most of them hate me. It's cruel. If they knew how much I was suffering inbmy head, they would understand why I need to do this.

I'll do better for a few months and then these thoughts come back.bit doesn't go away. I can't have a family like this and who would want to raise a family with me. Why would anyone ever love me. I'm just a garbage piece of shit. I wish I pulled the trigger when I had the chance. I would never have to worry about any of this again.

Now I'm here, alone with no one. I know no one really cares. I just want out of this fucking world.
