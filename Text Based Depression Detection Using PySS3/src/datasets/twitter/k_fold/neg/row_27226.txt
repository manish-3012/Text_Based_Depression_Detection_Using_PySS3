I think I am going to kill myself next weekI don't really know why I'm posting anymore. I am currently in a school trip I am 16 years old and a guy as soon as I get back I will figure out how to just end it. I haven't had a happy day for over 3 years. My psychiatrist doesn't help either. I am not good at anything, (literally) despite playing judo and guitar for over 9 years I still get beaten by people who have trained for 1-2 years. I don't have passion for anything anymore, only 1 friend(she also has depression) we are thinking of doing it together. Also one of my only other friends gets me envious since he is better at everything than me... He gets really good grades, I have a 2.4 GPA, he is smart I am not smart in any subject, he is good looking, I have never even kissed a girl. He always hooks up with the girls I like even though he knows. The one thing I thought I was good at was Pull ups, I could about 15 non stop, I have been training every fucking day for the past 4 years, every time I go through my door I would do pull ups(I have got a bar on my door). Today we were doing them, he did twice as me with perfect I mean perfect technique, while mine was sloppy... he doesn't even train pull ups. I know I am not supposed to do this to show off or even do it for other people, but it really sucks when you suck at everything you do. Thanks for reading
