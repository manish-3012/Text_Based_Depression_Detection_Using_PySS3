Just getting some things off my chestI'm just trying to get some things off my chest, but it's a little more serious to just post any where else. I've had the big sad for a while, amongst other things. So last night I invite my buds over to drink, and about 4 bottles in and a few hours latter I figure the best way to check out is to drinking self to death. Its dumb, I know, but at the time I figured it was the alcohol or the tylenol, ind I've heard that tylenol is one terrible way to go. So I start drinking more, and more. Well at some point my mindset was to just finish it, at all costs, and I think my friends realized this and tried to cut me off. I dont remember what all happened, but i do remember at some point it got physical and I hurt my friends, I choked one out and got in a fight with the other two. Well I woke up today about an hour ago and all I can think about is how I hurt those that were trying to protect me so I could end it, and it makes me sad, I betrayed myself and my friends, and they where almost not able to stop me. I for one my whole life have told myself I will never fight those closest to me, it sounds even dumber than what I said before, but me and my buds are some rough housing bastards, and I've always said I would never hurt them. But now I find myself hurting them, the ones who care about me, just so I can end my life. And it's all I can think about now, how I always just end up hurting people for my own selfish needs, It's kind of making things worse. I dont want any one reading this thinking I'm going to kill myself right now, but the time may come one day, just I know as long as my family are alive I sont want them to have to see me die, or dead. Drunk me just figured nothing else mattered so why not now. Sorry if this all sounds wacky but I just had to tell some one, afterall its easier to tell people things like this that you will never meet or hear. I just had to get this off my chest, and I've never told any one things like this before.
