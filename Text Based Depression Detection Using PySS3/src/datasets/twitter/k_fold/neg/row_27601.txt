Why can't suicide be accepted and easier?I hate this anti suicide culture. All I want is a quick way out and you tell me I'm selfish. Fuck this world. For the record: no one fucking cares about me mate and I don't give a fuck about anyone else. I have no family or anyone so it won't even hurt anyone around me. I'm all for people killing themselves. Stub your toe and you want to die? Dumped by gf and want to die? Fine by me. I don't care. All reasons to suicide are valid IMO.

Here's what sucks about the world:

Wage slave for the rest of your life
People are fake and greedy
Wage slave for the rest of your life
People suck
Wage slave for the rest of your life
Some disease is probably going to fuck you up eventually
You die anyway
People suck
Wage slave for the rest of your life
Humanity can't work together so we're all going extinct soon via global warming
I can go on and on

This world would be much better without society and having to do a shitty job forever, but even then life still sucks. It's mediocre. I see it for what it is. I get it, there's fun and happy moments. But those moments are fleeting. 

I hate how other people dictate my life. Look, I can't afford a gun, or N, or cyanide. I suck at tying ropes. I don't want to jump because it will traumatize others. Drowning seems like a good idea, but I'm not too sure how I'll ever get far away without a boat.

What kinda fucking options are left? Am I seriously forced to jump? Shit even that's not guaranteed to kill you though. I mean I'll take my shot but...

I will try practicing a rope later but... God fucking damn it. Can't I get something, idk, reliable?

Fuck humans man. Fuck life. Why couldn't the universe exist without me? I don't wanna live in this shitty universe. I'm not fucking impressed with any of it. Stars, galaxies, brains, gods. I don't give a fuck. It's all underwhelming and frankly bothersome.

Ao free o c jkckfkfkkdjjrjdkfieisnckwkdkfk2osnlckek yes I'm frustrated. Ima go cut and drink beer. If I can't kill myself then I'll take joy in killing myself slowly. But hangovers really, really suck :(. Cancer is good though. So whatever.
