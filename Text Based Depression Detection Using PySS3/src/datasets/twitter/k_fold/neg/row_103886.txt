I don't think I can carry on... anymore. I am 14 years of age. I just so happen to be living at the worst possible time. My father has mentally abused me longer than I can remember. My mother was my only hope. In 2017, she passed away due to a heart attack and I fell into a deep depression. And ever since, my father has treated me like an animal. I feel as though I am losing my sanity, yet I am unsure. Now, I have no friends or anybody I can necessarily talk to about this problem. I don't want to live any longer, not if i am going to be treated like an animal all my life. I need a solution, but there are barely any options due to my age and the pandemic. Please, I need help.
