lost hopei'm 20yo and live with my parents who are emotionally and verbally abusive. it's summer, i have a job without enough hours, and i'm learning how to read again after a horrible car accident and concussion. i got out of this stupid town, then i got sexually assaulted 3 times and addicted to heroin. 10 months sober next week. i just...my parents don't trust me at all, my ptsd tells me i'm not human, none of my friends will even reply to my texts, i'm in constant pain from my accident. i feel like i'll never get better. some days i think about leaving, but where would i go? i have a friend in texas (i'm in california) and my plan (if i can survive long enough) is to buy a car, pack it, and move in with him until i can manage on my own. idk if i'm ranting or looking for an answer. all i think about is dying.
