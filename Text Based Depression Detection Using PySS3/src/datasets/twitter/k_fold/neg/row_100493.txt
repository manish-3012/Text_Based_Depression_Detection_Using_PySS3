It always hurtsI feel like Iâ€™m running out of ways to cope with my suicidal thoughts. I donâ€™t really know where to go from here. Iâ€™ve suffered from anxiety since I was little, and struggled with eating disorders and self harm as a child through age 16 but after two hospitalizations I got my shit together.

Iâ€™m a therapist now. And once I finish grad school Iâ€™ll be a clinical psychologist. And id like to think Iâ€™m good at my job, thanks to the feedback Iâ€™ve gotten from my patients, and their families. It makes me feel so stupid and pathetic that I canâ€™t help myself. I was okay for a long time up until a few months ago. My fiancÃ© has struggled with his own mental health for years but never sought treatment, but a few months ago he threatened to kill me during a psychotic break. I had to call and have him hospitalized for awhile. Heâ€™s been back for a few months, on and off his meds. Heâ€™s making life more unbearable than itâ€™s been for as long as I can remember. His doctors all expect me to handle his treatment, medication etc because of my career and educational background but itâ€™s just causing chaos in the home. He doesnâ€™t accept his schizophrenia diagnosis. He doesnâ€™t want help. Heâ€™ll say he wants to get better then tell you heâ€™s playing everyone just for the sake of it. Heâ€™s putting us thousands in debt. And demands I do everything. Between working full time, school full time, and managing his care full time I feel like Iâ€™m drowning. My mental health is worse than itâ€™s been in years. 

I know Iâ€™m having these thoughts and Iâ€™m trying to take my own advice and reach out for help but nobody takes it seriously. Iâ€™ve contacted the national suicide prevention hotline four times in 24 hours and every single time Iâ€™ve waited over an hour and even when Iâ€™m connected nobody has actually picked up so I just sit there begging someone to answer, sobbing. I started seeing a therapist for my own sanity after the fiancÃ© came back but I rarely get to see her because of my intense schedule. My parents are juggling their own depression with my sisterâ€™s bipolar disorder and with me being the glue keeping them together I cannot go to them about this. My fiancÃ© just assumes Iâ€™m angry and blows up at me any time he catches me hiding out in our house crying to myself. When I try to talk to him he starts yelling about how I need to calm down. I tried 7 cups too but the listeners literally never respond. 

Iâ€™m trying to cope in healthy ways. Yoga, running. Itâ€™s not working, I cut myself today for the first time in such a long time expecting to feel relief and I didnâ€™t. Iâ€™m trying so hard to just find ways to keep going. Iâ€™ve posted a lot about my situation with him in the caregiver and schizophrenia subgroups and people are like just leave? But thatâ€™s the problem. I canâ€™t. After he threatened my life I consulted the police, victims advocacy groups and attorneys to see if I could get a restraining order or protective order. They said no. Until he physically hurts me they will not do anything. And if I kick him out apparently I could get in trouble for removing him from his place of residence while heâ€™s in treatment. He would have to willingly leave. Iâ€™ve begged him to go. He has family across the country from before he moved out here. Iâ€™ve told him if he doesnâ€™t want treatment, to be here whatever it may be to just go home. He wonâ€™t. He gets angry and verbally aggressive. This is my home. Itâ€™s in my name. I pay all the bills. I canâ€™t just abandon my home either. Iâ€™m really beginning to feel like suicide is my only way out.
