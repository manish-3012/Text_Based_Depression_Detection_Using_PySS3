A friend of mine is getting obsessed about killing people before killing himselfOk so this post follows [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8guspf/friend_feels_like_hes_seen_it_all_and_its_not/).

Long story short, my friend who has been feeling suicidal and has attempted suicide already is willing to go through a last ditch effort at happiness. Except it's by killing people. He is convinced he is just not fitted for society and what doesn't work for society might work for him so he might as well just try and kill people because maybe it might make him happy and otherwise he'll just kill himself anyway so it doesn't really matter to him what happens next.

Obviously, I tried to reason with him by trying to understand how he'd come up with such an idea and how doing that is any different than trying to reach happiness by doing literally anything else but I feel like not only I am not being very convincing but I am essentially shifting my speech to "just kill yourself instead".

I really don't know how to deal with him anymore and it's getting really bad.
