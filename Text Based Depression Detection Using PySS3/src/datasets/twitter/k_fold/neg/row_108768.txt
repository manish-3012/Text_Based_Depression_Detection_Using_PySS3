I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m still aliveI have a chronic illness called cyclic vomiting syndrome. Imagine feeling nauseated 95% of days and throwing up 30% of them. Actually you canâ€™t imagine it because I know I couldnâ€™t until it happened to me. It can strike at any time and my anxiety is crazy worrying that Iâ€™ll just start another episode at the worst time. My teeth are wearing away from the vomiting. I am agoraphobic, because if I were to leave the house I might end up uncontrollably puking and passing out while stuck somewhere that isnâ€™t my home.

There is no cure. My body has given up on me. 

I had such big dreams for my life. I was going to be a playwright. Now I can barely focus to write because the nausea is so intense. Iâ€™ve tried many anti-emetic medications but nothing has worked.

Iâ€™ve been going through the alt.suicide.holiday file on methods and Iâ€™m thinking of tossing myself off a cliff near my house (it is sufficiently high, 12 stories) Thatâ€™d finish things pretty quickly.

I can still read so Iâ€™ve been reading. Thatâ€™s the only thing that keeps me going because Iâ€™m very lonely and my anxiety is torturous. All I can do is try to distract from it.
