I feel stuckMy girlfriend died by suicide 9 weeks ago.  I struggle every day, attempting to make sense of it all, including why I'm sticking around.  I feel horrible for saying it, but I'm really frustrated because I'm only staying alive because I have children and I don't want to be anymore.  Don't get me wrong, I love my kids unconditionally, but I don't love life anymore.  Everything is a labor, I just feel exhusted by the idea of living...and yet, I'm guilted into suffering thru for them.  While I accept that's my responsibility, my mind continues pull at me to just end it.  Why do other people get to be douche bags and kill themselves, leaving behind children, yet I'm not allowed to.  I'm perpetually told, "you just have to be strong."  Which I hate hearing...and I ruminate on the idea that this life doesn't matter, so even if I did, it really wouldn't matter.  I mean, what does it matter some guy 300 years ago killed himself?  I understand others would feel the pain I do now and I don't want that, but what I do want is my girlfriend back at best (which isnt going to happen) or my pain to end (immediately).  How much pain is enough to justify it?  Part of me says, "No amount, it's not an opition because of my children," but part of me says, "It's my life and my choice!"  However, when i think about my girlfriend, while that's true, it still hurts and I still have trouble not internalizing that rejection.  I know I'm rambling, but I got tired of doing it all alone in my head tonight...so please offer some advice or prospective and help me find a way out of this trap.  I know there is no way I can continue to endure this struggle.  I need some sort of resolution...and therapy, groups, friends, work, personal interests, and anything in-between, I'm already actively doing, yet it's all a labor.  Nothing provides releif.
