Fallen on hard times, need help.I don't know what else to do. There's no one left to turn to._x000D__x000D_I'm 23 years old, married, 2 kids. I love my family, I tolerate my job and appreciate that it keeps my family fed, and I don't drink or do drugs heavily anymore._x000D__x000D_Despite all of this, I'm crushed under the realization that I don't belong in this body. I look in the mirror and see a male, not what I feel I should see. I'm disgusted with my body, I'm disgusted with my...anatomy, and I'm disgusted by the fact that I'm stuck with this fucking testosterone poisoning._x000D__x000D_I tried to come out to my wife. She flat out said if I pursue HRT (hormone replacement therapy) or GRS (gender reassignment surgery), we are getting a divorce, and I will never see my kids again. _x000D__x000D_I've never felt so alone. I cling to my kids, since they're the only people keeping me alive, but I can't help but hate myself for being dishonest with them about who I am, even if they can't understand what's going on._x000D__x000D_I feel like the only way out is to end this suffering, and save my wife and kids the drama. I'd see myself dead before I lost them, but I can't keep lying to myself. I'm in a bad way, and all the pieces are coming together. _x000D__x000D_I know it sounds like I'm looking for attention, but I could really use someone to talk to.
