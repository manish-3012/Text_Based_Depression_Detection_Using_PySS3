Utter heartbreak and failure... Why shouldnt I kill myself?Im a 30 year old bisexual man. Last July the love of my life and partner broke up with me and Ive been in utter sadness. I knew he would move on without me and it would kill me inside. Today he invited me over for what I thought would be a nice morning get together at his new place. Within one minute of being there I noticed the picture of him and his new partner on the shelf and a nearby decoration said "family". I played it cool for about 15 seconds and then told him I dream about him every single night and wake up said about him every single day and couldnt take being in their new love nest. I have no job at the moment and had to move back in with my parents after he kicked me out last year. I lost the love of my life and my little family and I dont care about making money or moving forward anymore. What is the point of living like this....
