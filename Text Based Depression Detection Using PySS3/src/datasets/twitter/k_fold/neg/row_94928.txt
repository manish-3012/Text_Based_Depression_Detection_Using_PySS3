I want it all to endI can't do anything to make my parents happy. I try my hardest for them but it never seems to be enough. They ask me why I don't have motivation and why I just want to lay in bed all day. I try to explain it to them but they don't understand what it is like to be depressed. One of my best friends recently had a suicide attempt. I want to follow in her footsteps. The bottle of advil in my drawer tempts me every day.
