I'm not needed.No one in this world would ever need my existence, and they don't now. I try my best at everything and fail every time or get told it was a waste or that it didn't matter. I try my best to make people like me and they just, don't. Mostly everyone hates me or ignores me or downright just doesn't think I exist.

I don't know what to do. I know that if I didn't exist people would be a ton happier, but that's about it. I have tried to make people happy and they just, don't, can't. No one can be happy with anything I do.

I'm not dead because I fear what happens if I fail. Because I feel like people guilt me into not going and make me panic I might go to the prison like place they send you to, the place I fear the absolute most. I get tricked or guilted by people that say they care and then just outright leave and never speak to me again.

And it's my fault. Everything is my fault.
