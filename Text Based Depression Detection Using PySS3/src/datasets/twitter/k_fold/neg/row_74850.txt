late night rantingI'm so tired of being stuck between wanting to live and wanting to die. I'd much rather prefer to be 100% sure of suicide or be invested enough in life to give a shit. The middle ground bullshit is tearing me apart. On the one hand, I feel like I'm wasting my life being depressed and withdrawn, but on the other I find no interest in being a part of this world. I feel like I live in some dystopian sci-fi novel where all the people want to keep me alive for this machine to run. There's people with terminal illnesses who are denied physician assisted suicide because, hey, life has to be protected at all costs, right? Even if it's absolute shit, right? I don't even have any life-threatening physical ailments so I feel like shit saying some of this, but it's honestly how I feel. As long as I have this fucking diseased fucked up brain I'll never be happy. I hate that the fucking 1-800 whatever the fuck number is the first line of defense for everything, and it's run by a bunch of barely trained idiots. Yet, the way everyone touts it you would thinks it's the greatest fucking thing in the goddamn world. Give me a break.
