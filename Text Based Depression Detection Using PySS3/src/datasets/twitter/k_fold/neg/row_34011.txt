I'm hoping the loneliness will actually kill me30yr old female. No support system, the only people in my life basically told me in polite ways that I'm a day ruining burden when I share how I'm feeling. I've been in lockdown since March and I've never felt so hopeless before. 

I feel truly awful for saying this but even when I was with my abusive, raping pos ex husband I wasn't feeling this hopeless... I have my own place, I'm lucky in that. But I would give anything to not have to deal with the social isolation. 

I've been thinking about suicide more and more since lockdown started, daily I go over different ways I could do it, the one thing holding me back is that there's no foolproof way to do it. 

I keep reading studies on how isolation can increase risk of heart failure, and given the physical pain I'm in I get a little hopeful that I'll just slip away and the people I care about can get on with their lives. 

I just want to feel like someone really cares, instead of just saying it, I want a reason to live as badly as I want something that will take me out for good.
