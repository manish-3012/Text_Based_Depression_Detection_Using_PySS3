Just too lonely.I have friends. Just I'm not close to any of them. I'm not close to anyone. There's no one I really talk to daily. I just don't feel that connection with anyone.

I've been seeing someone for two years and they never ask how my day went. After all this time they still don't want me. Still not good enough to them.

I was never good enough for anyone. And it seems like no ones good enough for me. 

I have days where I sit around alone doing nothing. I know one of these days I'm just going to get fed up. Every photo I see of friends or people with their families hurts me. Why was I never allowed to have love.

I keep on thinking about what I'd do. How I'd do it, who I'd give my belongings to, who I'd write letters to, or if I'd even write letters at all. 

All I wanted was to be loved. To experience love. I just know one day I'll end up like my mom, with a husband who hurts me, and our kids will end up being as sad and messed up as I am. 

What's the point if I will never have what I've always wanted. No one will ever love or care for me. By living im just prolonging my sadness. I'm scared but I want to do it. I really believe there is nothing in this world for me besides pain.. I really believe everyone will just continue to use me and push me to the side. I will never be loved. If I was lovable I would've experienced it by now. But I'm not. 

I just don't see the point in staying. People will miss me, but that's natural guilt. I'm not a big part of anyone's life except for my mom who let my das hurt me and who always chose him over me. She just cares now because he's gone.

The only amount of love I experience is fake and selfish. 

Everything my dad said about me was right. And it will continue to be. I'm worthless, unlovable and a waste of space. I just inconvenience everyone by being in their life. 

I want to start preparing for this. But I don't know where to begin.
