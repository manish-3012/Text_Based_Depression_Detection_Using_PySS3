Heartbroken... idk what else to put hereSo Iâ€™ve had a huge crush on a girl I work with for almost 2 years now.  I know nothing can never happen between us... it sucks but I accept it.  Sheâ€™s struggled with cutting and depression since she was a kid.  When I met her, she was in a mentally abusive relationship.  All Iâ€™ve ever wanted was for her to be happy.  I wanted to be the one that makes her happy

Well now sheâ€™s gotten better while Iâ€™ve slipped back into depression and cutting.  Iâ€™ve also increased my drinking... a lot.  Iâ€™m more scared that Iâ€™ve unintentionally driven her away because I resemble how she used to be.  She told me itâ€™s hurting her and that seeing the cuts on me messes with her in a bad way.   

When she told me that, I made the decision to drastically cut down on my drinking and not cut myself anymore.  I told her that I never ever intended to hurt her.  She basically blew it off.  I seriously think Iâ€™ve lost what little relationship Iâ€™ve had with her and all I wanna do is slash my wrists and die...
