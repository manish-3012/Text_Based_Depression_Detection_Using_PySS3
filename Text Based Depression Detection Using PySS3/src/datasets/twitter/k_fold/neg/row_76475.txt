The only thing keeping me alive is my pets.Hi. Iâ€™m 22. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts and urges for 10 years. I tired to hang myself less than a year ago. Obviously it didnâ€™t work. I very much so feel like I want to end my life. Iâ€™m a very damaged person and I donâ€™t think any good can come of me being around. I have severe depression, anxiety, and ptsd. I have been abused. My mother has cancer. My grandfather just had a stroke. I just found at two days ago my grandmother might also have cancer. 

Iâ€™ve made a lot of really bad mistakes. I used to be a really bad person. Iâ€™ve changed my ways and made right with the people Iâ€™ve hurt. But I still donâ€™t know how to forgive myself. 

I feel like Iâ€™m too fucked up to really be a person anymore. I go to therapy. I take antidepressants. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized 4 times. I just donâ€™t really think I deserve or need to be alive right now. 

I have two rabbits that are my world. Lately theyâ€™ve been keeping me alive, but I think Iâ€™ve found people that could care for them. Iâ€™m not sure what to do.
