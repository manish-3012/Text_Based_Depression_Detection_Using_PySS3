today made it feel realI walked and got my high school diploma yesterday. My father didnâ€™t show. My ex blocked immediately after i told him congratulations. And i didnâ€™t feel any better after being handed the piece of paper and wearing my cap and gown. Even though in quarantine i lost ~45 pounds, i still hate my body and the mental hospital just made everything worse. iâ€™m tired of crying but it feels like only a small group of people care about me and they cannot see me struggle. I donâ€™t feel like i accomplished anything, i just feel like i shouldnâ€™t have lived this long
