Sleeping pillsJust got a 100 count sleeping pill bottle, I know I'm not going to take all of them but I'm taking a decent amount. Everything hurts. Every breath feels like I'm inhaling push pins, my chest feels so heavy it hurts my ribs, my head hurts, my stomach hurts, everything hurts. I know OD isn't super effective but it's all I got. "Worst" case scenario is I die, and while I'm scared of what the afterlife really is like I'm scared of living more. I deserve the hurt but am being selfish and taking the cowards way out and wanting to end it all. I can't keep doing this. Any and all hope I had for my future is gone, my present does nothing but bring pain and make my future look even bleaker, my past has molded me into the broken desheveled person I am today. If I die, I die. End of story. If I don't I can go from there and base future decisions on it. I can't keep being told to fix what I don't know is broken, I can't keep causing pain, I can't keep feeling broken and empty. I can laugh at a dumb video or something but it feels wrong. I can't keep pretending to act happy when talking to people. I can't continue to fuck up one of the only things to ever bring me happiness. I can't continue to make people hate me. I can't continue being a reminder. I can't continue doing this. This is my sorry to everyone I've ever hurt, I hope it's enough
