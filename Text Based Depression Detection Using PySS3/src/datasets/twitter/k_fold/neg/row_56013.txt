I don't understand why suicide is so frowned upon.I'm a 23 year old female and I've been suicidal for all of my adult life and the majority of my adolescence. It's not that my life is terrible or that I've lost someone that I care about, I just truly don't want to be here. I do not want to be a part of society and I feel it's unfair that I've been thrown into this life and am expected to live it just because I was born. I do not find joy in things or people and I haven't for most of my life. I do not make real connections with people. I don't really care about anything. I fear that everyday of the rest of my life is going to be like this: empty and quite frankly, pointless. Why continue on? For the few people I haven't shoved out of my life? Why am I the selfish one for wanting to leave this god forsaken planet? Aren't they selfish for wanting to keep me here even though I'm miserable? 
I don't really want any, "oh everything will get better one day, you'll see. Just keep trucking" because its not really like that for me. I don't think it's a mindset or a mood. It's my personality. I hate life.. I hate society and their bullshit rules and pretty much every person I've ever encountered. Why stay? 
Does anyone else feel this way? Just completely apathetic about life and what happens? 
Because every time I tell someone any of this, they act like I'm crazy for not loving life with a burning passion and proceed to hide all the knives so I can't off myself when they're not looking.
