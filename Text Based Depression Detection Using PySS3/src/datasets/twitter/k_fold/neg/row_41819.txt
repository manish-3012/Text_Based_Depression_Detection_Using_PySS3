I feel so lonely and dumbWhat's the point of even trying
No one will change no matter how hard I try
My own family said they'd kill people like me
I won't be able to move on. The guilt is already eating me up alive. I'm so tired, I dont have any strength left. What's even the point. What's wrong with me? Why I cant just be like all people around me. Why I can't just be a loving daughter to my family. They sacrificed so much for me and yet I'm going to stab them in the  back? Why I can't just believe whatever they say and keep living that way. But it hurts so much. But what if I ran away? I will be so alone. I know I won't be able to handle that along with the guilt.
I tried to keep dark thoughts away with some crazy and irrational hope for years. But I know it will never happen. Things won't change. 
I'd better be dead already. I'm so tired, lost and heartbroken.
I don't have anything left in me to keep trying or get out. It's like they chewed on my soul and just let it rot. But it's also my fault. Why everything is wrong with me.
