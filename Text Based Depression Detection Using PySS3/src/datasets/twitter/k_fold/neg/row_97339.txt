Here are some things I have tried to do to alleviate my depression. I am out of ideas. I am looking for suggestions.I have been to four different psychiatrists over six years. None of them thought medication would work, but we've tried it anyway. I have tried three different medications with no noticeable effect.

I tried reading "Feeling Good", but I couldn't get through it -- it seemed to be obviously absurd.

I sometimes call the suicide hotline, but often nobody picks up. I guess it routes me locally, and my local center doesn't have enough money or people to man the phones. That's what they told me once when they did pick up.

I don't have health insurance right now, because I can't hold down a job.

I used to drink and smoke pot once or twice a week, but that didn't seem to have much effect on my depression. I don't drink or smoke anymore.

I'm not religious.

I have a lot of trouble leaving the house without having a panic attack.

I'm out of contact with most of my friends and family because I'm embarrassed about my situation and I don't want them to find out.

**edit:** I always find it ironic when someone calls suicide "a permanent solution to a temporary problem". For many people, the problem that precipitates suicide is long-term, not temporary.

**edit 2:** Has anyone here tried electroconvulsive therapy? I haven't, but I would happily experience large amounts of memory loss if I could feel better.
