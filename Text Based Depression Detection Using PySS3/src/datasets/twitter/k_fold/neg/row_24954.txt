Turned away by a suicide chat roomI often go to the same suicide hotline when I feel low because I no longer feel comfortable talking to people close to me, this was the third time speaking to this hotline and they said I should see help and there's nothing they can do 

Whilst I understand why they said this to me I now feel completely rejected and have no idea who to turn to in the short term 

I guess this is just a another attempt at short term help
