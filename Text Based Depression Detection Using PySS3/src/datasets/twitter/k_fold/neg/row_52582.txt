I am a idiot (Trigger Warning: Self Harm)A year ago I actually had a relationship...guess who was the fucking moron who ruined it....Me

I harmed myself a couple minutes ago, the worst part was that I was almost 1 month clean...and I didn't feel much pain...even though it should have.

I don't want to be jealous or have envy but god...I fucked up by not going to Prom. It was all my fault, I was the one who ruined it. She has moved on and has someone new. And I have no one, we are still good friends. But I will have the regret of ruining a relationship for the rest of my life until my death. 

This is also just a cherry on top, also having 14 job rejections doesn't help either.

It's all my fault, I wish I could physically punch my past self into bettering myself.
