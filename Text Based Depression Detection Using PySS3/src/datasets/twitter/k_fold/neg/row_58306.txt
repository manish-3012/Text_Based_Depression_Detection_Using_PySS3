Why am i different from the next guy?I've probably put alot of thought into this, but what honestly does it matter if i were to die right here and now? Everyone gets over things after time so why would it matter in about 10 years when im not going to be talked about, cared about, or even thought about? Ive never gotten the reason why people care so much over a single life or even the "potential" someone like me has. I dont see why people would go out of their way to help one dissapointing life. I mean, there are others out there with more redeeming qualities than I so why me?

It's probably not healthy, but ever since i found about my brothers weapon in my moms room, ive been thinking about the possibilities and it just seems not well with me. Ive even thought about notes to write for my brother to not feel bad about why not to feel bad because ut was hus weapon. I just really hope this is a phase or even just a thing i could hopefully never go through, even as much i do want to die. Honestly, the only way i see out is myself and no other way(like natural cause, events, ect).

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this though
