Two days in at uni, my boyfriend breaks up with me, after thirty minutes of dissociative behaviour I found a noose made from an extension cordSome of you may have seen [this post I made a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9hy5q8/im_terrified_university_will_push_me_over_the_edge/?st=JMHFR113&amp;sh=79ea61f6) - I mentioned I was scared of losing my boyfriend, and last night that came true.   

Iâ€™m so angry. He knows I have been suicidal, he knows Iâ€™m in an alien environment with no support network - and he does this. He ruins me and breaks me.   

I found myself with a noose around my neck I made from an extension cord - I had written suicide notes. I donâ€™t know what to do, I feel so lost.
