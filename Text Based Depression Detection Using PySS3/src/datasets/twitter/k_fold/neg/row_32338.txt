I just donâ€™t know what to do anymoreIâ€™ve never posted on here... itâ€™s just, i feel so lonely and I truly think that iâ€™m not gonna make it through.
Iâ€™m 20F, and last night I overheard my parents talking shit about me and my life in general. they said really hurtful stuff, letâ€™s just say that iâ€™m not what they wanted as a daughter. 
A year ago or so I was diagnosed with moderate depression and... they didnâ€™t do shit. Am I wrong for expecting them to help me? since then everything has just gotten worse. I used to have friends but turns out no one likes to be friends with the dude who is always sad and wants to sleep all day...
Iâ€™ve been thinking about how iâ€™m gonna end my life but... iâ€™m scared of not doing it right the first time. Iâ€™ve thought about taking all my anti-epileptic meds but I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s going to work. Iâ€™ve thought about idk, going to a motel and end it there, so that nobody from my family has to find me. 
I donâ€™t want to exist, I donâ€™t want to feel anymore.
