I can't motivate myself to put in any effortOne of my biggest fears is being a failure and I'm scared that it's bound to happen. I was a gifted kid and that took its toll. I just can't study now that I'm academically higher and suddenly not the best. I just can't put in any effort, my mindset is basically 'it's better to be terrible by my own choice than mediocre despite trying.'
I can't remember a time when I wasn't suicidal and I just discovered this subreddit and thought posting here is worth a try. 
I feel that if I take my own life, it's going to affect people less than me becoming an absolute burden to them..
