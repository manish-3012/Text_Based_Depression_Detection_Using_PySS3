I feel like I only live for others and not for meI no longer get any joy out of life. I'm stuck in an unfulfilling relationship with person I do love, but ultimately doesn't make me happy and I'm realizing I had weak standards that ignored my desires.  I've been through too much to easily open up to others.  I tried talk therapy, it just felt invasive and patronizing. I was detained in the psych ward for merely saying suicidal thoughts and it was a dehumanizing experience with a disgusting lack of empathy and lots of dangerous ignorance.  I don't have the drive to succeed in my field. If I had enough 'f'-- you' money I could maybe be happy not having to work or having to deal with people, but I just find this world lonely no matter what.  I'm either too stupid for the people I want to be around, or too easily agitated with those I can hang with.  Plus I feel like I'm surrounded by people who do just want me dead and are too cowardly to outright say it.  Every day is just some form of all work and no play, even if I'm doing really fun things. I have injuries that doctors can't fix, or don't know how to help me manage, so I'm always in pain.  I just dont see the point anymore.
