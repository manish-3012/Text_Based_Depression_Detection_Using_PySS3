What people canâ€™t seem to understand.They just donâ€™t get it, they donâ€™t understand that itâ€™s not up to us. â€œWhy canâ€™t you just be normal?â€ One of lifeâ€™s biggest tragedies is the method in which most people go (those who want to live die, and those that want to die â€œliveâ€). I donâ€™t want to die...Iâ€™d rather just be gone. If there was a service that allowed me to opt out of birth knowing what I know now...Iâ€™d have hung my self with the umbilical chord. My mind is in a constant state of struggle between dying now, or dying later. Iâ€™m obsessed with the final destination movies as itâ€™s mostly just a bunch of what I want to happen to me. 

Iâ€™ve put my time in life, what the fuck are you waiting for? At this point Iâ€™m starting to wonder if I CAN die. Iâ€™ve wanted it so long, done so many things that should have killed me...nothing. Iâ€™m infantry in the army (a dangerous job) and I volunteer to go to Afghanistan and Iâ€™m NOT careful at all there...come home without a scratch. I start climbing communication towers, nothing. I joined the airborne and straight up jump into the darkness hoping just once my chute wonâ€™t open and my kidâ€™s dad will have died a hero, and theyâ€™d be taken care of...nothing. 

Well Iâ€™m here to taunt you death...fuck you pussy, you wonâ€™t do it.
