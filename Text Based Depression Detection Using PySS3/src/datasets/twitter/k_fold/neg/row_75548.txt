Going to jumpI'm rapid cycling bipolar II. Im so tired of people telling me to get over it. Its literally a chemical imbalance in the brain. Imagine someone saying to you "oh not that cancer thing again. Dude just take it like a man and stop bitching about it. No wonder you have cancer." Or my favorite thing is when they say that "oh just think happy thoughts and feel better! :)" well, gee, I never thought of just feeling better. I'll do that right now! But I digress. I've decided it's best that, instead of feeling the highest of highs (look up the description for bipolar mania symptoms. Its not really a "happy" feeling) amd the lowest of lows (look up bipolar depression symptoms, its not really just a "sad" feeling) for the rest of my life, why not just stop now? I'm going to a local 4 story parking garage tomorrow and jump. I've tried help to no avail and tried opening up but got insulted and laughed at and made fun of by my "friends". I'm thinking about burning myself so there's no mess for the people who peel me off. I just wanted to say goodbye. And I love every single one of you.

P.S. No, I don't have friends. No, can't talk to parents. No, I live alone. No, therapy doesn't help.
