Hahahahahaha please ignore meI'm never gonna be a real person. I feel incapable of feeling joy. Even when something good happens to me... It never lasts. I'm wasting my words on strangers on the internet... I'll never be capable of relationships and love. No friendship... Nothing. Everything I have is fake... My job is the only good thing in my life. And I have no one to trust and it's my fault because I drive away everyone who could possibly help me. I'm too broken to trust that things are gonna work out. Everyone just tells me to get a therapist. But that's the one thing I can't do. Spill all my pathetic crap to some doctor who's just going to tell me to drink more water and try breathing? Bullshit. I've been in the mental health system and it's all bullshit. No one knows how to help anyone. I'm not going to get anywhere better than this. I have to resign myself to failure for the rest of my life. It's my fault. If I had just had the energy to push it all aside long enough to live for others... But no. No one understands. I'm done. I'm done. Please don't read this. I'm just a fuck up.
