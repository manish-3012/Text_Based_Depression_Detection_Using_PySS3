I can't stop thinking about my eyesThis is going to get lost in the sea and I know others have more pressing issues than I do but I can't talk to anybody in my life about this and I guess just posting anonymously since nobody in my personal life knows of my reddit account
I might be going blind
Ive always had bad eyes. I recently went in to my eye doctor due to double vision, trouble focusing, floaters, spots have been getting worse. I'm 22 and in a year my prescription has gone up almost 200 points. I'm 22 and I want to get into social work I've been going to college for 4 years. I'm in a dead end job, I've been diagnosed schizotypal and I've always struggled with suicidal thoughts and ideation from a young age. 
I thought I was getting better but this year and it's only May has been getting worse. My car is as old as I am and I can't afford to buy a new one I kept shoveling money into it. I'm in a dead end job I'm alone 6 hours away from my friends and family. I've been isolated for years. I don't know what I'm going to do if I go blind or deemed legally blind. I have an appointment with an opthmaolgist Friday but Im spiraling and I know I am
. Everyone in my life I've talked to about this keeps telling me it can be so much worse and I know it can. My parents keep pressing me if I'm drug addict and I'm this way because I don't have a schedule nobody is listening to me I just want somebody to fucking get where I'm coming from or understand how terrified I am. I'm fucking terrified and I'm to my limit. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is due to my parents already losing a child, my niece, and the money my parents have spent on me through out the years. Suicide is selfish but I feel mine would be worse because I don't have a reason to be suicidal. I just want it to be over.
