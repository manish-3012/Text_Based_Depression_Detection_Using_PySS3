Have lost the will to live, strangely in calm tho. Haven't eaten or drank anything in three days besides a glass of water onceMy parents beat me physically for the first time after their usual emotional abuse and I couldn't bare it anymore, I said some nasty things and I've been in my room since. I've lost the will for living after all this time. Decided not to drink or eat until at the very least they show the slightest sympathy. Been in my room for almost three days, only drank a glass of water once. I feel weak and more tired than usual, but strangely in calm.

They haven't knocked on my door to even check out if I was ok, they told my sister they didn't wanted to speak to me either. Imagine knowing your son hasn't eaten anything in three days and thinking they still must protect their fragile ego in some way. I don't ask for love or support, I've been unlucky and had neither of those things. But they want me dead and they've proved it. If I somehow survive this and get a job I will remember this on their tomb. They're monster and they deserve the hell they believe in.
