So much anxiety - will I ever find a happy relationship? plz help!!Okay, I've had this horrible unable-to-function SA (social anxiety) thing most of my life. I've never been able to shake it. Now it's getting worse to the point I've been in suicidal depression for 2 weeks.

I went to college for 5 years and had roommates and went out weekly to party and force myself around people. I lived with my girlfriend for a year in a tiny house and constantly forced myself around her family (she then cheated on me behind my back with two other guys and her mom pulled me aside one day with sorrow in her heart and said she was just taking advantage of me.) I'm back living with parents but have no friends, I can barely go anywhere or do anything because the fear of being seen and horribly icky awkward tense fearful feelings that arise totally out of my control whenever I'm being seen. I can't even talk to my parents, my body starts squirming all uncomfortably and I feel rigid and tense and awful like I have to run away or get angry and Irritable. I can't look anyone in the eyes for more than like a second.

I don't know HOW to stop this, or WHY its occurred most of my life. I just want an SO so badly and friends but I can barely talk to anyone so to make it stop I have to just hide in my room and want to end my life.

As I've said, all the years and years of pushing through these difficult social situations has only left me stressed and more embarrassed and the same problems which haven't gotten better honest to God.

So the comfort zone thing just didn't work....

How can I provide or protect for my SO? I'm just over this. Now from all the stress and anxiety I'm like losing my hair and appearance slightly... so now that's hitting my confidence even more.

At this point I just don't see any life path for me but A) Suicide, or B) Moving to nature where there's like no people with my cat or something to run an Internet business. Great life, huh?
