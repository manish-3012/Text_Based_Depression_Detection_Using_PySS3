Just finished writing my suicide note.It's almost a serene feeling. I know people will
care when I'm gone. I have a few friends, a family, it doesn't matter though. I don't know who I am, everything I do in life I just imitate what I see, what I'm supposed to do. Just gonna have a few drinks, smoke one more cig, and slip this knot over my head and just go. I tried this a few days ago and failed bad, I won't make the same mistake. Peace out.
