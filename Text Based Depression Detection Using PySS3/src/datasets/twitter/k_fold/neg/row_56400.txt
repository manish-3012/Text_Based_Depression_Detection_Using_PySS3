Feeling in distressSo yeah, today I was about swallow two pill containers, ended up throwing them in the trash, most of my childhood Iâ€™ve been made fun of, for what seem an undiagnosed autism or asperger, and now my entire journeys are passed trying to prove myself Iâ€™m not as ugly as I think, asking strangers, friends, family if Iâ€™m ugly, because I frankly know deep inside me that Iâ€™m not ugly, but I just canâ€™t stop thinking about this, and if my life is just gonna be full of rejection and loneliness, because if thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m going to go through, Iâ€™d rather avoid it, than end up alone, with no one to talk to
