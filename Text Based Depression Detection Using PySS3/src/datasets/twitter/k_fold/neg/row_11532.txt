I don't know what to do...Eating both antipsychotics and antidepressants but they still don't help much. Getting more and more depressed... Want to kill myself. Hurts my head, hurts my heart... No one cares, and life can't give more happy moments... I miss the past and some people from there. Miss it all. Stuck in somewhere there. Currently its almost just pain, torturing... I don't know what to do.

I have lost friends, home, health, reputation... and broke my heart multiple times. Family don't care that much they would be side of me. They watch me, not in the eyes, and say things that isn't right. Like they don't remember what they have done too, they lie. It hurts even more. Am I really only one who has done bad choices? Hope my heart will stop beating or I get finally enough courage to hang myself once again and do it correctly. It will take me from here. Way to escape middle of this mess.

I wanted to change. I wanted to proof to be better than what people think about me. But can't. Feels wrong to keep fighting for myself, and I think I don't have much energy left... Every day its keep getting worse. Tried to prevent some things, they will still happen and what price...  I probably will lose myself too soon...
