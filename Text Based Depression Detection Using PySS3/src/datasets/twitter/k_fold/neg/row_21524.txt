Iâ€™m boredIâ€™m 17. In November Iâ€™ll be 18. Since 2014 Iâ€™ve been saying that I wont reach that age and i think i wont be able. Iâ€™m bored. I donâ€™t have a bad life, my family loves me and my friends care a lot about me to the point im the emotional support of most. but Iâ€™m bored. This feeling wonâ€™t get away. I am sick, bored of living. I know I wont be famous, or rich, or have what I want so thereâ€™s literally nothing that can keep me alive. And Iâ€™m bored of having to do the same things all over again. Since little, Iâ€™ve wanted to be someone, to get people to know me. But at the end in just some random guy on the internet, and if I die, nothing will happen. Iâ€™ve reached the point where I do not care about my family nor my friends. And dont get me wrong; im quite a positive person and a happy one: Im laughing most of the time and my situation not a â€˜happy but sad on the insideâ€™. Life just bores me and thatâ€™s it. I dont know what to do and im stuck in this dumb loop. Jeez.
