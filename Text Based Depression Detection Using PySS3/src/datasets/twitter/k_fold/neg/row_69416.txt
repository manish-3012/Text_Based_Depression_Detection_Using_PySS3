I'm donethis weekend marks 2 years of me being depressed and I can't handle it anymore. my parents have known for a year and a half and have made little to no progress in giving a crap or learning how to deal with it, all my friends have deserted me, I can't seem to make any new friends. I think I've finally reached the end of my rope.
