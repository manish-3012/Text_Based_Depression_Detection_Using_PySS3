What do you do when life has no meaning?I don't understand why I should do anything.

I don't have anything which makes me better than anyone else so how could I go beyond a life I'll hate doing? Anyone who cares about me will only mourn temporarily. They'll get over it in days, months, or years.

I'm weak bodied, weak minded, and since I'm even bothering to post this, weak willed.

What's the point in doing anything or nothing if I'll just hate what I do either way?
