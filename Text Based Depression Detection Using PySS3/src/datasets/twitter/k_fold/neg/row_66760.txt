I planned to kill myself today.I know that this is probably the most pathetic post you're going to find here, but whatever. So, I've bought a rope and I planned to try to hang myself today after school. Unfortunately, my parents have found the rope. So when they saw that I was in awful mood in the morning, they decided that it'll be better if we go to a doctor. I've attempted suicide earlier and I got into a hospital because of it, so now I'm taking antidepressants and talking to a doctor every so often. And honestly, it doesn't help all that much. They actually only gave me much more stress and I felt only worse afterwards, but I can't even kill myself without a suspicion now. I could probably at Monday, tho. I might actually try, if I won't chicken out. But for now all what I can say is that it's not possible to even kill myself nowadays. Great. I don't know what to do with my life, I don't see a point in suffering through it, there's nothing but problems ahead. Sometimes I'm thinking how normal people even feel. You know, those ones who don't hate themselves and don't tell themselves that they should die and life is pointless. I'm feeling pathetic because I can't even properly harm myself. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry for typing this. Have a nice day.
