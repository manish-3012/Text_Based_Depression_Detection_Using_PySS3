Will someone please talk to me? I just tried to use the crisis text line and it won't work on my phone.I'm so upset. This is the first time I've had suicidal thoughts and self harm ideation in almost 8 weeks. I decided to text 741741 and what do you know, it doesn't work with republic wireless. And I just deleted my Facebook last week so I can't use that option. I found a different online chatline, but when I clicked on the link it said they were offline because all their chats are full. I feel like the world is telling me to kill myself. I'm trying so hard to be okay and to not self harm right now, so I decided to just choke myself with a belt until I felt like I was going to lose consciousness about five times. I just want things to be over.
