I'm UnlovableSeriously, I just know it. I've always felt like a loser and a disgusting creature who can't be loved. No one likes me because I always look sad/angry/threatening and I have no idea how to talk to people. I went from anorexia to binge eating and I've wrecked my education and I feel like everyone in my family is judging me and if I go to them, even the nice ones, I'll just be blamed for how I feel. I've always felt stupid and incompetent and worthless and pathetic and like no takes me seriously or cares. Everyone has their own shit/interesting stuff to enjoy and that's fine. They deserve happiness because they're not messed up and undesirable. I on the other hand don't feel like I deserve anything good. Yet at the same time I want a mother - a different mother - to hold me and love me for who I am. I don't know how I feel anymore. Everything is just foggy. I hate this. How do I stop
