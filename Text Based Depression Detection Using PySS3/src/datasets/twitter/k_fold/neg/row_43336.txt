I think i just tried to hang myselfI don't know what happen. I've been depressed, anxious, and stressed for months now. Today in particular, I've been extremely down, it's way worse today. 

Anyway, i don't know why I did it, it's like i was acting on an impulse, i didn't think about it at all, it was just happening and i wasn't stopping it. 

Just out of nowhere, i grabbed a phone charger, it was one of those super long, 6ft phone cables. I tied a shitty noose, went into my closet, looped the end around some weights on my top shelf and tied it, and then i put the noose end on and just lowered myself and relaxed. While i was choking, i decided i didn't want to do it anymore, and I tried to stand up and I couldn't. My heart was beating so fast and my legs were shaky. I finally got a grip and stood up and took that noose off. I walked out of my closet like nothing happened
