I feel left out of a normal lifeI hate hearing about my friends doing something without me. I'm never texted first. I'm noones first option. Ever. I hate not having anyone that cares. I hate that no one would be affected if I just left. I hate being alive. I hate feeling tired all the time. I hate that I need drugs to feel happy. I hate my awful grades. I hate that I'm awkward. I hate that I'm anxious. I hate myself. I want to end my life.
