I haven't killed myself. I have a different idea. I'll live on the street.People try to help and I get overwhelmed or they don't help at all. I do everything wrong without trying. I really have no future to worry about. I really have no idea where to post this as all of the other places I could have asked are so strict about asking a simple question. I'm tired of trying to get people to understand.. I'm tired of trying to get away from her because it's my responsibility since I'm an adult.. I'm tired of trying to get a large variety of jobs that nobody will give me even though I'm perfectly capable of working.. Oh well, their loss.. (after i said that, i realized that i made a pun. so no pun intended.) So I need some information/advice, etc.. I want to know how someone can be homeless and survive as a homeless person and just be alone and not care about anything.. to just live on the streets.. this includes in all the weather, all of the time, every day.. I need this to happen indefinitely, preferably until the last day of my life whenever that is.. Please, just help me figure this out.. When I walk up and down the streets, I just don't give a damn any more... I don't want to give a damn again about all of these things... How do I survive living on the streets?
