I really need to talk to someone.I am at the cusp of breaking down. I don't have anyone to talk to right now and it's really scary. I have the number of a suicide helpline number at my fingertip but I don't have what it takes to call. Plus, I dunno what will happen especially in my country.

Some info: I am home quarantined and my state is in almost lockdown. I was sent home from college unexpectedly due to the outbreak while I was in the process of losing all my friends. At home, I have huge boundary issues with my mom and I'm not going to be able to talk to my dad.

I have had one close call before and I am really scared right now. I *NEED* to talk to someone right now.
