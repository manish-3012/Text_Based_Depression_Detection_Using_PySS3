Am I being too blunt?(22F)



Iâ€™ve known Caroline(27F) for two years. She used to be an addict and in and out of rehab for years. She used to do heroin and drink every day of the week. She works part time and has a trust fund to support her sheâ€™s 27 years old. She started smoking weed again at first I didnâ€™t comment but during the summer she quit her job because it was too stressful and doing nothing but smoking. I tried to show my concern then but she shifted blame saying Iâ€™m cheap about gas money and donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m talking about. That was around my birthday and she ignored me on my birthday. 




Caroline told me she'd not going to AA anymore because it's a â€Christian cultâ€ I just said something like talk to other people about it and see their opinion and she got all defensive and was like â€i don't need others opinions only me and my therapist make that call I've been hundreds of meetings I don't relate I'm not a real alcholicâ€ 

I was just trying to say maybe try different meetings or see what other people think but I didn't disagree like â€oh no you need to go to meetingsâ€ because I know that's not always the answer. It's hard to know what to say because sometimes I feel crazy like â€am I being rudeâ€ because she says I'm blunt but I feel I try to be sensitive to other people 


now she's all mad and ignoring me. she drank back in July and was like â€that wasn't a relaspeâ€And saying stuff like she's not a real alcoholic because she didn't black out.


Idk do I sound like I was being too judgemental idk how to handle that? Why is she so mad at me? Am I being too blunt?

tl;Dr: My friend with addiction problems told me she's not going to AA anymore. I tried to discuss other options and I'm concerned cause she's been smoking weed and drank in July. She got angry at what I said and is now ignoring me.
