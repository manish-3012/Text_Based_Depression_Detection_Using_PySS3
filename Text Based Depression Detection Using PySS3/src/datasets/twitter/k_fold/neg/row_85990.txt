I get it. I finally understand.The divorce was hard, putting the cat down was tough, and finding out my girlfriend was married crushed me. But when my brother took his life, that was it. He showed me that it's doable. His demons took over, and he couldn't beat them. The loneliness of rejection, the feeling of being a failure, and his sense of constant disappointment. 
I understand it now, I know the sense of desperation he felt. There's so much anger inside me, for everything I've tried and failed. Nothing has made sense in so long. My heart is empty, my life is empty. There is no hope, no happiness, nothing for me. Every morning is a struggle to get up, and every night hurts worse than the last. Exhausted from pretending I'm okay, all i can do slump into bed and break down. There's a noose in the attic. It used to be just rope, but now i see it for what it is. It's a healer, it's freedom. Without knowing, I hung it there to heal all my pain. That is exactly what it's going to do. There is no heaven, there is no hell. If God existed, he would have taken pity on me long ago. I never fit into this world, maybe in the next life.
