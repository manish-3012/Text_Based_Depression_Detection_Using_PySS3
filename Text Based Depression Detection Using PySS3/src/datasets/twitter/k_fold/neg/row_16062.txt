People who have attempted suicide, afterwards what was the best thing someone done for you/said to you?A friend of mine that I havenâ€™t spoken to in a few months attempted suicide last night. I want him to know that I care and am here for him but at the same time I donâ€™t want to intrude and for it to look like Iâ€™m just trying to find out what happened or anything of that sort. 

I really do want to handle it in the best way possible, so for those who have any sort of experience with the aftermath of a suicide attempt, what was something memorable that someone said/done for you that you really appreciated?
