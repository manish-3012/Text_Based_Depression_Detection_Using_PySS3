this may soud ridiculousI'm 14, Male and this shit just actually doesn't matter. My life alredy has gone through a lot of shit. Not just recently. Like, my whole life is made of suffering and some small periods of happiness, but i just don't want to wait my whole life to know that i can be happy someday. I want to end my existence but i don't have the strength to kill myself. I wish everything suddenly became ok, but now i know that my friend is hanging out with the girl i like. I just don't want to bother anyone with my existence anymore, being just a dead weight.

You guys doesn't need to "help" me or whatever. This might be the day that everything is going to get better, or the day i just got even deeper into my probably fake depression
