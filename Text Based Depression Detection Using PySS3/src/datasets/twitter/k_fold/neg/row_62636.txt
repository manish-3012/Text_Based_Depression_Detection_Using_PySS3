ConfusionI think about death and suicide every day, and have been for the past year almost. Yet not once have I ever thought I would actually act on those thoughts. I wrote a half assed note a month ago and planned on hanging myself but never did. I still have the note and means of hanging myself. And I still want to do it. I just don't know if I ever will do it. I don't know if I'm actually a threat to myself. How do you know if you are?
