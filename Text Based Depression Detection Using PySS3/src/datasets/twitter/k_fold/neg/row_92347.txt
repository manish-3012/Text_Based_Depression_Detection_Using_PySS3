Need Help with Long Distance Friend Dealing with LonelinessHello reddit

I'm not certain whether this post belongs here. However, I need some advice/resources/assistance/anything

This summer, we have had to physically distance ourselves as we moved to different countries to prepare for university. Over summer vacation, I've made attempts to contact A through social media but have not received any responses. 

Today, weeks after I last contacted A, A finally replied to my message with information I still don't know how to properly interpret. 

To keep things short, I was sent a few passages detailing A's ongoing battle with loneliness since moving abroad. A described recent experiences with alienation, homesickness, insomnia, and crying. 

I don't know how to respond. I'm not in a qualified position to give proper consolation. I don't know what to do. 

Sorry for the late submission and horrendous grammar. I was sent this message at midnight and don't know how to respond without worsening the incident.
