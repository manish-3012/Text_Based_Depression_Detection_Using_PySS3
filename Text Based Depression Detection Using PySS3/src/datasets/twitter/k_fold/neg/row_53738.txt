I donâ€™t know why!27 y/o female. I live a regular life nothing interesting. My life isnâ€™t sad or anything tragic. I just want to disappear. I donâ€™t want to feel anymore. I just want to live in peace. I wish I never was born, but these are just words. I would never kill myself. I would rather live miserably than to hurt my family or just die of something other than suicide. 

I want to be able to say this out loud but canâ€™t so might as well write it here.
