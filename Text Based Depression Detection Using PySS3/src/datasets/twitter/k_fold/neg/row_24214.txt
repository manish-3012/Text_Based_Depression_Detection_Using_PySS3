Nothing lefthey yâ€™all first post here on my burner account. ah well here it goes. Iâ€™m 22, f and Iâ€™m pretty done with life. Iâ€™m going to kill myself this month. 

1. I had great academic success at the beginning of college, now Iâ€™m barely scraping by, I never show up to class and Iâ€™m going to fail again. Iâ€™ve been at my local community college for 4 years almost. 

2. Unemployed because the psych hospital I used to work at got shut down due to lack of funding. Iâ€™m a social major and helping mentally ill people is truly my passion. I love connecting with people and that was taken away from me. 

3. Havenâ€™t been able to find a job. I donâ€™t know what it is but Iâ€™ve literally applied to over 200 jobs in the last few months. Nothing. No follow up. No interviews. Etc. 

4. Debt. Who isnâ€™t in debt? Seriously Iâ€™m fucked and have so much fucking debt to pay off that Iâ€™ll never be able to do. 

5. Dead-end career field... social work, mental health and social services are so disgustingly underfunded I know Iâ€™m never going to get a job that makes me happy and pays well. Iâ€™m not even trying to be rich. Iâ€™m literally just wanting to be able to afford a 2 bedroom house and my bills. 

6. Relationship.. well Iâ€™m engaged to my fiancÃ©. Weâ€™ve been on and off for 5 years or so (by our own choice) and now weâ€™re moved in and engaged. I feel suffocated. This is the only sex experience with a guy that Iâ€™ve had in my life that has been consensual and now Iâ€™m wanting to get out and explore and be more open with my sexuality. It feels dead end. 

7. Overweight.. who isnâ€™t overweight? Lol. Yeah Iâ€™m a fatass fuck who is too addicted to sugar to diet. Iâ€™m at the highest weight in my entire life at 386 lbs. 

8. Job promise that didnâ€™t work out. I applied for a residential care assistant at a mental health facility that deals with women and children that have been affected with addiction. I had an amazing interview, passed my background check and my drug test as well. They said that once I get my case work hours they would start me on full time as a case manager at a good salary. I was so fucking happy!! Then they called me and told me â€œwe found someone else who will work for a dollar less than what you requestedâ€. I was crushed!! I told them that itâ€™s no problem and that Iâ€™ll work for $10 an hour instead of $11. Well, nope, the new lady was already starting and got on as a case worker and RCA. fuck me right. 

Basically I plan to kill myself sometime this month. Everything is eating my alive. Medication doesnâ€™t help. Nothing helps. No one. My fucking soul is empty and I feel absolutely nothing. I plan to slit my wrists in the bathroom and bleed out. Iâ€™ve struggled for this for so long and Iâ€™m done. 

Should I make a will for my loved ones? I donâ€™t have anything super expensive or really valuable but eh, why not?
