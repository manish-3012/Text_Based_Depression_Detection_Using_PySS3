Sick of this.I'm sick and tired of this cruel world.
I'm now in the last year of highschool, and I feel like shit nowadays. I recently broke up with my girlfriend because she lives quite far away. Probably the greatest mistake in my life so far.. I miss her so much. When I was in elementary school, I used to be with loads of people. We were a group that used to hang out every day. In middle school, I couldn't really make any friends the first year. Later, I found a guy that have the same interests as me, and we became dear friends; so I managed fine the rest of middle school, except for the feeling of being an outcast. I occasionally compare myself to my two brothers that are some years older than me. The excelled at anything they did in school; in comparison to them, I am nothing. I got nothing else that average and some above average grades. My brothers excelled at being social too. I'm quite social myself, except for the fact that I walk around always believing that people are talking behind my back. I often feel ignored and unwanted by people that I tend to socialize with. This year I've had 3 girlfriends. I broke up with 2 of them because of distance, and I got ditched by the third one. She left me for another guy.
I seem to only have luck in finding girlfriends that lives far away.. And the relationships rarely lasts more than 3 months.
Now that I am in the last year of high school, I feel the weight of schoolwork and social shit very heavy on my head. I can't take it anymore. I'm sick and tired of being ignored, unwanted, having bad grades compared to my brothers, and being an outcast (At my school, I am an outcast. Got a few close friends, but the rest of the people dislike me and look down upon me..) I can't keep an interest long enough to be good at it, and I am bad at almost everything.
In times such as these, I often consider ending it all. It's all just so miserable.
