Might kill my self soonIâ€™m 14 having issues with school, school makes me feel bad and I just canâ€™t get over that sick feeling. Everyone hates me, my friends stopped talking to me and my dad always calls me names. I just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression for half my life, I got diagnosed with it when I was 7 years old. Lately all Iâ€™ve been thinking of is killing myself. I think I might just drink bleach and go to sleep. My parents hate me and my friends hate me. I got nothing to live for at this point
