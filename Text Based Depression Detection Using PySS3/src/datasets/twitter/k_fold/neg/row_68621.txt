lost the girl of my dreams, love of my lifeI'm 27, she's 30. I was with the girl of my dreams for two years after having a crush on her for ten. I started a business during my time with her and it didn't do well. I had stress from the business, from home/family, from every angle. She was a few years older and I felt that I would now be holding her back since I had to start from scratch. She was against it, but I forced the break up because I wanted her happiness and in my mind, she'd be happier without me.
This was 7 months ago. We still talked everyday. I realized I made a huge mistake by letting her go and begged her for another chance a few days ago. She's talking to someone else now, told me to move on, said she doesn't have feelings for me, and we can never work.
I don't blame her. I just regret losing the love of my life. She was my first and only everything..
I tried to be strong the last seven months. I tried telling myself I can live without her, but I can't. I've missed her every single day.. Is there any chance that she will ever come back?

i've known her for literally half of my life. 13 years. we always talked, all the time. i don't really know life without her. i don't want a life without her. i always assumed that we'd be together. even after i broke up with her, i always assumed that somehow we'd be together. but she says she's happy now. she's at a happy point in life, she says. i guess that's what i wanted when i initially broke up with her right? her happiness? i just didn't know it would destroy me like this

i'm so lost without her.. i don't wanna be here..
