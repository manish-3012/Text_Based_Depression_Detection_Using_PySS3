I want to die but I feel like I don't have the right to be suicidal because there's nothing wrong with my lifeI want to die but I feel guilty about it. There's nothing wrong in my life, I feel like I'm being ungrateful. I'm suffering so much but it's only because of my own mental illness. I'm anxious and depressed but nothing in my life is wrong. I feel like I don't have the right to be upset. Maybe I'm just being a little b1tch who can't deal with the slightest inconvenience but I can't control how I feel. Everything feels wrong, I'm so overwhelmed. I can't do this, it's all too much, I just want everything to stop. I don't want to be here. There's just no point to my life. I'm a horrible human being and I wish I could give the 13 years of my life to someone who deserves it. So many wonderful people die so young so why do I get to have 13+ years when all I do is sit around in a pool of self inflicted suffering. So many people have it so much worse than me and mange to stay optimistic but I can't handle my life as a privileged little middle class white girl living in an area where my identity as a lesbian isn't a problem. I want to off myself but I can't even do that because I'm too much of a coward to use a knife. I wish I had a gun, that'd make it easy
