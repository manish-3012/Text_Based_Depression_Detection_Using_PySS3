No one to talk toIm probably going to post here a lot more just to vent. Don't feel like you have to read. 

Last night I sat in the dark shower with a blade to my wrist for 20min and at first I just wanted to touch my wrist with the blade - it wasn't a suicide attempt. But as I sat there like that, I started shaking and pressing the blade harder into my skin, bc i really wanted to do it. 

Im supposed to be enacting my "safety plan" when I feel like this but... 

I just cant bring myself to seriously talk to anyone about this. 

And im afraid if I tell my husband or therapist then I'll be sent back to the hospital. I really, really dont want that.
