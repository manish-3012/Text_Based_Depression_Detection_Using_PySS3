I want to be alive but living is too painful.Everyday is a fucking torture I have never thought possible. And I don't think I deserve it.
The unnecessary of my suffering is driving me mad. I want to end this, I can't escape the pain. Maybe death will help?
I can do it. I am strong enough but the longing for happiness still there. I want to experience it and I can't. 
Maybe I still have hope but I hate it, because it's a lie that my brain puts together to survive. It's just a animal instinct that I need to overcome. I need to put myself in control over fear and insincts
