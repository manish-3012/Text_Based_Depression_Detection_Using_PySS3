Why am I still hereI've dealt with addiction for about four years now I've been battling depression for almost 6 years but I've been afraid to get help. Idk why I am still on this earth and it seems that every few months I get serious depression and suicidal thoughts. I don't know what to do and even things that generally made me happy in the past don't make me feel any different anymore. I've tried to set myself on a straight path but every time I let myself down and relapse. I don't want to hurt anyone else so I just keep to myself and don't even go out anymore but I'm not sure how much longer I can go on like this.
