I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™ve been busy talking a friend out of suicide for months, it worked sometimes, worked a little less other times. But now he says he has made his mind up, he asked the doctor to get euthanasia and if they donâ€™t let him heâ€™s just going to do it himself. He tried this before and they didnâ€™t let him, and every attempt he fails. But I just want to help him so bad and I just donâ€™t know how to try to get him to stay alive, or if itâ€™s even the right thing to do. He has the absolute worst life and history I can imagine and it just keeps getting worse and worse. Heâ€™s an addict, has no home, his parents are dead, his legal guardians are the worst people imaginable and heâ€™s like an abuse magnet. And heâ€™s fucking sixteen years old. SIXTEEN??????? He refuses to live with me and my mom is also quite hesitant about it and rehab doesnâ€™t work for him. And I just wish I could tell him itâ€™ll all get better, but I donâ€™t know if it will. And I am just panicking so much. Iâ€™m probably selfish for wanting to keep him here, and Iâ€™m in such a huge moral dilemma about it because is it the right thing to try to keep him alive? And if I tried, how the FUCK am I going to do that??? God I just want him to stay here and hug him until the world crumbles around us. I love him so much and I just have no idea what to do or what to tell him
