I want to end my lifeHey it's my first post on reddit, I guess I want someone to know how I'm feeling and I don't care who it is. I'm not sure if I even want to get better, I just want to die. I don't want to live if it's the same day over and over. I can't remember the last time I was happy or if I was ever happy at all. I don't really see the point in anything. Sometimes I think I'm already dead, I might as well be.
