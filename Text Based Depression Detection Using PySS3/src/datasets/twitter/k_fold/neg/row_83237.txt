I love you guys on this subreddit y'all made me feel less alone...and take care ...I will be gone foreverI love you all....y'all get the idea of how much life with  depression sucks
Y'all understand what is it like to have a heavy soul while no one understood me and my issues 
Sometimes family sucks 
Sometimes everyone just sucks towards you

This is it ....give me your goodbyes because I won't last long
