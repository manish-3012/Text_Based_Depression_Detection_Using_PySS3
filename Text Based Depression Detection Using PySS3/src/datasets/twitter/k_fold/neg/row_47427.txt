Maybe I need to go back on Zoloft, Iâ€™m so depressed you donâ€™t understand.Why did I stop it just why am I a fuck up. 

I just dry heaved over the toilet because I am literally sick to my stomach due to being depressed. Someone help. I just want to be happy.

I have a bunch of Zoloft from last year when I was taking the drug but I stopped for some reason, maybe because I thought I donâ€™t need it. 

Iâ€™m afraid to die and I donâ€™t want to but I donâ€™t want to go on.
