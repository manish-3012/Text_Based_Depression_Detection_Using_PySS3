Thinking about killing myself makes me kind of happy.I feel so broken. I donâ€™t think anyone will ever love me. Iâ€™m so fucking hideous. My legs hurt like hell constantly and I none of my friends actually message me. Life just seems hopeless. I wish I wasnâ€™t such a failure. Suicide seems to be my only way out.
