I just want a friendI hope this belongs here if not I'm sorry...Does anyone have any tips for getting a friend for someone who can't leave their room? I guess over the internet is the only option but I don't know where I would find somebody on the web that kind of understands me. I never had a single friend and my parents want me dead already (and yes they really said that for those of you who don't believe me, I have to hear it all the time). I just want to feel what it's like to have a friend before I go. That's the only thing that makes it hard for me to go, to die lonely, without anyone caring about you. I kind of want to die, knowing that there is somebody that is going to miss me  at least a bit. I so desperately want a friend but I'm incredibly shy (severe social anxiety and angoraphobia). Any help is welcome â™¡
