Don't know how to fix myselfSo after staring at this submit page for a good hour, wondering what to say, i'll just say whats on my mind since im about to go to a party in 30.

I'm sad. very, very sad. that's a given, since i'm here, but I don't know what i can do to get better. my girlfriend of 3 years (off and on for first year) broke up with me and that kinda set things in motion. I had/have a shitty job, my family likes my ex more than me, i keep trying to do things that'll occupy my mind from this soul crushing, mind numbing, physically exhausting depression but everything kind of just, sucks. everything i love now disinterests me, or bores me; or even worse, makes me sad. all of the people i turn to for help are sad themselves; I know if i cant handle anymore sadness in my life how can they. I feel im coming closer and closer to my edge and im losing grasp of the things i think can help.

I just want to not feel so damn alone in this world. to stop feeling like everyones out to get me, and that people do care. but everytime and anytime i get comfortable with myself and the people that do show interest/care in me and my life it crumbles.

I'm feeling so damn lost and sad every day, and hoping "this is the lowest my life will ever get. Theres no way i can disappoint myself anymore" and then it does.

Sorry if i'm just trailing off, but I dont know what to say anymore. thanks for reading if you made it this far
