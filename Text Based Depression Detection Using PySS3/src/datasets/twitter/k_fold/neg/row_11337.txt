I am I piece of shit and I dont deserve to be hereWrote on r/anxiety earlier and felt not listened. Felt judged and like Im being "cruel" maybe I am. Maybe Im a piece of shit and I should kill myself. No one needs me here anyway. That paired with the constant vertigo I had for the last 3 weeks making me almost unable to do anything and no one finding what I have. Im gonna die anyway so why not now. It'll all be over and everyone will finally feel relived
