Why didnt I die?Last week my roommates took my vodka and I got really angry at them and went banging on his door. He called me violent but I'm so on edge that alcohol and pills have been my rock

This week I got the news that my grandfather has had another stroke 
Everything is so overwhelming 

And my heart still aches over a lost love 

Wednesday I took 40 sleeping pills 
I wish I had the alcohol to combine with them. Maybe I'd be dead now 

Now I feel the temptation of taking the rest of my meds and hoping I overdose. It feels like a thrill to chase. I just want it all to be over. Living is exhausting and repetitive. Dying seems exciting.
