I can't get over anything.I've been experiencing really suicidal thoughts since I was seven, in my teenage years it's only gotten worse, and after the annoying curse of puberty began to fade nothing got better.

Around fourth grade, I fell in love with a kid who tricked me into thinking he was my friend, he bullied me and abused me and I had no power over him because his uncle worked in the school.
Fifth grade, I came back to him because of my stupid attachment issues, and I let it slide into a relationship by accident. We did things together, it was an amazing time but I fell into the same bullying trap, but it was worse because he'd spread the information and he'd tell people about my kinks and my guilty pleasures and everyone still mocks me for it.

Nobody dares to listen to me, and everyone trusts what the adults hear from the guy because he told them I was doing things like spreading rumors but he was the one doing it instead.
I can't handle living a life where you aren't respected, cared for and nobody seems to want to hear your side of the story. I can't love people anymore, I can't trust anyone ever because I'm so scared it's going to end in something worse. 
I have diabetes, and full access to insulin and I don't know whatever it is that keeps me from ingesting it and just killing myself. I want to do it, but I feel like maybe there's someone here who can help me get through some of it.

So... advice?
