feeling really trapped right nowi just realised i will almost certaintly fail this school year because of a language class i barely got through last year not knowing anything and i dont think the miracle of me passing it will happen 2 times in a row, so im propably going to kill myself at the end of this school year because no fucking way am i losing a year of my life to school, and even if i would pass it i think during vacation i would finally realise just how miserable and not worth it life is and just kill myself anyway, no matter what happens i will kill myself, so whats the point of caring about anything at this point. anyways hope someone reads this, bye
