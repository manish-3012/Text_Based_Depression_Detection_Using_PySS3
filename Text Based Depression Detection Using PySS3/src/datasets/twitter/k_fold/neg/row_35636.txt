Can someone help me please?I don't know how to reach out for help anymore.
In the past i have had my accounts banned because of the sheer desperation and graphic content of my rants.
Ok, i got it, i have to calm down and politely ask for help, even when doing so takes all of my might to accomplish.

And now i am doing so. Please for the love of God. Dont tell me that everything will be ok, nor that i "hang there" or "don't give up" or "keep pushing"

Just no. Please just no. Stop.

If you really, really want to help, land me on an online job. Thats all i need. My depression steams from the fact i cant even feed myself, let alone buy medicine, and also not being even visible to the opposite sex because of that.

My hopes of finding love and having a "interesting life" are long gone. I am dead inside already. Just help me to feed myself, for my own company is the only thing i truly will ever have.

If i already lost it all, at least help me to not lose the only thing that i barely have: myself.
