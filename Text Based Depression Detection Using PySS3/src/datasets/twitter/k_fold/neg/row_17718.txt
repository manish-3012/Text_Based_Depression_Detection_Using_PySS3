What to do in your last hours of life?Quick note: Throughout the last couple of years, there have been too many harmful experiences in my life, which made me really suicidal at the beginning of 2019 ("really" = I think about suicide every day). I've been living in a constant cycle consisting of 2 phases: 1) I don't think about my problems and I "manage" 2) I have a mental breakdown and suicidal tendencies. Nothing makes me happy or satisfied. 2 months ago I thought that I can give myself the last chance and confessed feelings to one special person - first, she said that she reciprocates my feelings, however, 2 days ago, she stated that every romantic interaction she had with me was not honest and she was just trying to not lose me. The perspective of being with her was the only thing keeping me alive. Now I have nothing. I can't imagine myself in the future, I don't see a point of doing anything besides killing myself tomorrow. I even cannot take my parents into account at this point. The pain is just too strong.

So, my question is - what can you do in your last hours of life? I don't have any errands to run, I just want to calm down a little bit. Any recommendations?
