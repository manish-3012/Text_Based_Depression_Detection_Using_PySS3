Dark thoughtsIâ€™ve been mentally writing a suicide note and deciding who all of my stuff would go to.... Iâ€™m like 98% sure I wonâ€™t but it just seems so much better. Iâ€™ve thought about it and fantasized about it for 15 years. I canâ€™t pull myself out of this funk. I take it out on those around me. I trust no one. I feel like Iâ€™ll never amount to anything and whenever I feel the urge to want to write or do something creative I become paralyzed with insecurities and how Iâ€™d be a failure because what else in life have I ever done right? I hate being fine one day and then the next day feeling numb and unimportant. I want to believe my 10 year old fantasy that I was put on earth for a reason but more so lately, Iâ€™ve just lost that feeling and it makes the fantasy more appealing. And I donâ€™t talk to anyone about this because I donâ€™t know who would understand this or whoâ€™d want this unloaded onto them or to burden them with fear. I wish I was never born. I kind of wish I didnâ€™t wake up after being roofied and knocked out for 2 days and my memory being fucked up. Iâ€™m tired of never making anyone happy, including myself. I feel like I canâ€™t stop disappointing everyone around me. That Iâ€™m nothing. That no one cares. I have felt this for so long and just bottle it up because it makes me less vulnerable to others and myself.
