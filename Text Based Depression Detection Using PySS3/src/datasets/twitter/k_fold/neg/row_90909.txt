I Am the Only Obstacle to my Own HappinessI have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a child. I remember perching on the sill of my third story window, already feeling doomed as a mere fifth grader, trying so hard to convince my legs to do what the rest of me so badly wanted to do. I thought that I was useless, looking ahead I saw nothing but hardship. I wanted to end it all before it got really bad. I guess I still feel the same way today.

I remember sitting in the classroom in highschool, wanting to smash through the windows out onto the field below, gouging and tearing myself with the shards of glass. I imagined my mutilated half-dead corpse dragging itself down the hallway, bringing my inner monologue out into the open in everybody's faces, making them all rethink the judgements they placed on me, replacing their supposed disdain with pity.


It wasn't until college that it escalated from thoughts. Empowered by my increased ability to have critical thoughts, it unfortunately only served to discourage me. I attempted suicide twice. The first time I purchased a rope, and set up a space in my room to hang myself. After some tests, I realized that the rope was not rated for my weight, and did not want to risk any injuries that might affect my ability to climb a step ladder and try again. Honestly, I feel like this event was more posturing than anything. I was feeling super dark, but was really just making sure I had everything I needed for when I decided it was time.

The second time was definitely for real. It was a long day of failing classes, being treated like meat at work, and coming home to an empty apartment. I had broken up with my girlfriend of four years just weeks prior. Actually, she left me, citing my unstable emotions, and quickness to anger and frustration. God was she right, when I got through the door I went on a fucking rampage. I was throwing things, rolling around the floor in hysteria, I couldn't handle the weight of it all as my tantrum reached a fever pitch. I grabbed my dog's old leash from the closet, and strung it over the bannister. It hurt so fucking much, I had never had anything squeeze my neck so tightly in my life. I felt in a moment that panicked fight-or-flight response kicking in. Fighting my body's will to live, I closed my eyes and tried to meditate to keep myself from panicking further.

Then came a knock at the front door, just feet away. It was almost like my brain was looking for any excuse to move on from this terrible moment. I struggled back up to my feet to answer it. It was a friend of mine, she invited me to leave and go hang out. I looked back at the leash, still hanging from the bannister. I walked out and closed the door. She noted the marks on my neck, I joked them off. I decided not to tell anybody I had done this.



I went to the doctor the next day, told them that I had been heavily considering suicide, but not that I had tried to kill myself. I was diagnosed with depression, and started the long journey to find the right drugs to keep the bad thoughts at bay. Months of therapy and a few trials later, I was feeling more stable and was able to put those thoughts to rest for a while. So I thought.


Today, I find myself in a position where my life is as perfect as it could be right now. I am living with the love of my life, who was at a time my best friend, and even on our worst days, I fall asleep feeling lucky. We just got our first apartment together, and I got offered a new job paying almost twice as much as what I was making before, so we are now making way more than what we are budgeting for, and are flourishing.

I am eating well, living well, and to top it all off I will be inheriting a large sum of money this summer, enough that I can make up for failing to save any money for the last 10 years of my working life.



At this point, I am still unhappy. As of today, even though my thoughts are less violent, I feel like I want to die now more than ever. Not because I feel like I am useless, or like I am hopeless, or because this world and the people in it are cruel. I want to die because I am unstable, and I am all that is holding my life together. I know that when I break and it all finally falls apart and I am left with nothing, it will be a direct result of my own actions, and my own inability to rise to the occasion. I don't want that, I am trying so hard to fight it. I am taking my medication, and talking about my feelings, and trying to relish in my successes, but I find that even now I am frustrated and angry all the time. It's like it's all getting out of hand, and I just want to end it all before the dream ends and the real nightmare begins.

I want to tell my partner, but they lost a parent to suicide, and I do not want to put them in a position where they feel like they might lose another person. I have never talked to anybody about this before. Just reading this whole thing back I can literally see myself breaking down in my writing, like I'm losing my mind right now over the course of a single train of thought.

What am I supposed to do? I cannot trust myself or anything. This is just how it is for me, every day going through a life that any normal person would kill for, and easily be able to get through. I just don't have it, and I don't think I ever will. What is actually wrong with me?
