I OD'd yesterday....Yea so not nearly enough to kill me but I had to go to the hospital. And now I'm back at home it's so awkward with my family. They took away "all" my sharps but missed the stashed ones. But they took away my pens so like I can't even write down my feelings to cope it's not the same on a phone.

The first responders told my parents about my SH on my arm but didn't mention my thighs so that's kinda awkward. They think I bearly cut. They'd be so ashamed if they saw my thighs lol. How do they think I'm ment to cope without drawing, writing and walking. I have no privacy, I can't be left alone although I did almost try again but they came back before I did.

I guess this is rant because why is no one angry or upset I know I'm being ungrateful but I did something stupif on my parents wedding anniversary and yet they haven't complained that I ruined there day. I don't deserve this love and support I'm such a failure.

I just want this torture and constant pain to go and I know everyone's gonna be sad if I go but it's hard and I can't take it much more. When I left the hospital I stood on the edge of a bridge and I really wanted to jump but my step mum was there trying to get me an appointment for help on the phone and idk I don't deserve this. I'm too weak. I can't cope.

Yea so ungrateful pathetic human here that wishes they were just alittle stronger to follow through.
