i hope iâ€™m not alive tmri wish i wonâ€™t  wake up tmr or maybe i finally wake up from this nightmare but most likely this is reality a shitty reality but a reality nonetheless my ma and sis found out abt my wrist they didnâ€™t care when it didnâ€™t inconvenience them but now it does apparently they said weâ€™re gonna have talk tmr but why a mother that makes me feel like shit a sis who left me to be in a house alone with her knowing she does so why goddamnit i hope tmr never comes if it does it better present me with death
