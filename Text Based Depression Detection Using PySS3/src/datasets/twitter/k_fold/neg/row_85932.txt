My dog is gone and I'm considering ending it all.My dog vanished November 14th around 3 am (she has to get up early to go to work) when he was let outside by my mom to use the bathroom and he never came back to the front door. It's obvious a coyote got him and I just keep thinking if I was awake I could've stopped it. Now I just keep having these thoughts about my poor boy being carried off while being terrified and scared before the painful end came. Even though it isn't my fault the grief and guilt is too much and I feel only death is the way to stop these feelings.
