Probably going through with it tonightI think im going to go to sleep in a car that's on in a garage. It's a 2009 Corrola and I was wondering will the car produce enough carbon monoxide to kill me in like 5-6 hours? I tried to get help and I kept pushing through, but more roadblocks keep stopping me and i'm not strong willed enough to keep overcoming the stuff going on around me. I'm just looking for an answer to help make me finally feel happy with no more stress or struggles to deal with. Thank you in advance!
