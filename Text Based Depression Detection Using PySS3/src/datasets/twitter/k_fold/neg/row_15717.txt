While I'm upMy whole life has been an uphill battle. Abusive parents, particularly rough military deployments, poverty, etc. A few decades in and I'm pretty worn down. In the past month, though, things have finally turned around. In fact, it's probably the best it's ever been.

Despite this, I have an extreme feeling things are about to get worse than they've ever been. I had a complete mental breakdown a two weeks ago today where I couldn't move. I've spent so long struggling with PTSD and I'm kind of feeling like I'm going to enjoy one last weekend and then end it. I want to go out on top before I sink back down to where I've always been. I want to end with a victory rather than waiting for it all to come crashing down and ending it then. I'm sure this seems odd but it's what I think I'm ready for. 

Maybe I won't. I don't know. I've come extremely close several times in the past year but haven't. Now just feels right, though. Anyways, you're all great people and I wish you the best. Stay kind.
