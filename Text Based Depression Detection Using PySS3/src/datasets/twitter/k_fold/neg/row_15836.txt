Thinking about tying something around my neck in bed.This seems like the most peaceful way to go honestly. Actually hanging myself seems to painful shooting myself would be to gruesome for someone to find my body. But laying in bed with the air conditioner on watching tv while slowly going unconscious seems almost peaceful.
