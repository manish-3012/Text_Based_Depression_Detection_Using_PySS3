About to graduate with a major I hate and still having suicidal thoughts.I still feel suicidal, although not as bad as earlier in the year. Being about to graduate with a degree in math, which I hate now, I feel that I'm going to be stuck with a job that I'll hate. I always told myself that I'd rather die than have a career/long term job that I hate. I have hobbies and other things that I love, but I know because I'm going to be working soon, I won't have time to really develop my skills for the hobbies.

I don't want just some boring life, at a 9 - 5 job that I hate, living only for the weekends and the couple of hours that I'll have for reading and writing. I'd rather die than live like that. It seems too hard to go back and get another degree in something that I actually like, and even if I could, I would probably just end up hating that degree too. I have no idea what to do, and it makes me furious. So many people seem to have found their passion and have found jobs in it. I, on the other hand, am in a major, while practical, doesn't offer any interest for me. I want to study mythology and ancient cultures, one of the few things that math has nothing to do with.

So here I am, about to be stuck with a degree in an area I hate, and will have to find a job soon that I'll also hate. It seems that I'm stuck in the path I swore I would never be in, and all I can think about is how I would rather die than continue to be stuck in it.
