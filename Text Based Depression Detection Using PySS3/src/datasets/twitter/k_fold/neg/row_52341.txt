My last year here.This is it. This is the year that I die.

It will be merciful more than anything for me to kill myself, but god it hurts so much. I desperately want there to be another way, because I do not want to cause pain to those I love.

But I could feel it. I've felt it since I was a teenager, and first became depressed: I'm not going to make it to 30. This is the end of my life. I was very close to ending it last year, but somehow I pulled through. It was my last chance, I told myself, to try to find a reason to live for myself, not for those I love. My life has improved, and I am not experiencing a depressive episode, but dread becoming ill again. And I will. It's been 15 years now. I go into this with complete clarity and rationality. This is the time to do it, when it will inflict the least damage.



I just need someone to tell. Please don't try to talk me out of this. Speaking into a vacuum is fine. Its just the act of speaking itself that will make this a little less lonely.
