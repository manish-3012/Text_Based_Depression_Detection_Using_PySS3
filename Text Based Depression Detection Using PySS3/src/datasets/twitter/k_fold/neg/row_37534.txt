This is the 3rd time I've tried to hang myself.I'm starting to be able to take the strangling for longer periods of time. This time I got light headed and started gagging and was coughing when I stood back on the chair. I wonder if I'll be able to do it or am I going to change my mind every time. 

I don't recognize myself anymore. When I look myself in the mirror I can't make out details or describe myself. I don't feel real and I feel like I shouldn't be alive.
