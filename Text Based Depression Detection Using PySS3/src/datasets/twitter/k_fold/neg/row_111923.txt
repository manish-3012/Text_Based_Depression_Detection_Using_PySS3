How to Distract Myself?Firstly, yes i know i should probably consider a hospital visit, but currently an in patient stay is not financially possible for me.

When I'm in the rougher patches of depression I usually jump into this planning mode where I try to decide how to commit suicide, it's pretty all consuming and if I have more than three minutes of idle time I find myself wrapped up in thoughts about hurting myself that I can't seem to push away. Does anyone have some tips of things I could do to distract myself, at least for a small reprieve? I've tried listening to music, watching tv, going for a run, and making art but nothing has worked so far.
