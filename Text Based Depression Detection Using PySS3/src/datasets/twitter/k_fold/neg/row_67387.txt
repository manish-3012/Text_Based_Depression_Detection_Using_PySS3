AlmostI was in the middle of cutting myself when my friend came over. He asked if he could come hang, then asked if I was suicidal. He asked me when I was planning killing myself, and i realized it was tonight. Earlier I had gone to Home Dept and picked up a pack of razor blades. I was blissful because I had snapped. Nothing got to me bc I had officially decided to kill myself. I was happy that nothing mattered. I bought my death for a little over 2 dollars, along with bananas, grapes, chicken and even a succulent.

So I told him tonight. I told him about the blades. Now Im on my friends' suicide watch. Staying at a friend's tonight. They told me if I refused, theyd stay over at my place.

I feel terrible. I am just thinking about cutting myself. All activity seems careful. I dont feel welcome as a friend, but restrained as a sufferer. Of course my friends dont want me to die. Thatd cause them discomfort. It means nothing.
Im just tired of it all. I was ready. I was ready.
