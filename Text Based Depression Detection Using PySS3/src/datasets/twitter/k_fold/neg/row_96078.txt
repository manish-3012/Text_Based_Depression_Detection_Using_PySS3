What am I supposed to do when nobody listensI don't understand. I'm a full grown adult and I feel like I'm a toddler running under everyones feet and everybody just wants me out of the way.  I try to lean on my friends only about stuff that really upsets me and never ever about anything as extreme as this, but it just seems like everybody is steadily growing quieter and quieter in my direction. Like Im a ghost. It makes me feel like I'm insane. It makes me question if I even exist, if nobody will even bother to speak to me. I guess I'm just not even worthy of their time. I wonder why I even continue to try.
