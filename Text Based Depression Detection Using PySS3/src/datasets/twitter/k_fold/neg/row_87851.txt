Messed up, now my suicidal obsessions are back.So I got drunk with a friend of mine and we ended up fooling around. It was pretty tame but we did screw a little, and though I didnt ejaculate, i was an idiot and didn't use protection. 

Well that shits left me fucked up. Ive gone 40+ hours without sleep, and all I can think about is how I should of killed myself long before this moment.

It  was a lot of fun and she taught me some cool shit, but it just feels wrong that it happened, and the no condom thing has me freaking out. Im in control enough right now to get to a hospital if I start going down further, but Im just hoping and can maintain that. I don't know how anyone can really help me here, but this one of those times where I'm really struggling and I just have to put these thoughts somewhere where someone may understand...

Edit: my suicidal ideations/ obsessions had been coming back alot recently because of stress. This situation really just made it worse.
