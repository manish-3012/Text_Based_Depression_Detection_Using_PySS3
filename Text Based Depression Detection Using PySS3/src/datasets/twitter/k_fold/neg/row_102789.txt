My friend is on the verge of killing himself and i have no idea how to help him I've been good friends with him for almost 8 years, a couple of years ago one of his parents died and after that he gained weight, when he was borderline obese he started losing weight but these last two months hes been starving himself and a couple of days ago he was hospitalized because he didn't drink any water or eat anything. Before that, he'd often tell that "He can survive 48 hours on 350 calories". Today he said that when he'll get home he will hang himself. I haven't spoken to him since he went to the hospital. Everything i know now my mom told me. Im scared that if i talk to him hell feel even worse
