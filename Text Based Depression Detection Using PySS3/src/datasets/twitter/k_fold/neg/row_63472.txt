Nothing helps. Staying alive is just inviting more abuse.I love my brothers. I love my friends. I donâ€™t want to hurt them.


But my mother doesnâ€™t love me and Iâ€™ve lost most of my family for speaking out about my fatherâ€™s abuse. Iâ€™ve been sexually assaulted more times than I want to count, including a really violent rape that will never stop affecting me. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m capable of a relationship or sex at this point. I also know that at twenty-two, if I stay alive, it will happen again.


Iâ€™ve been put on a year long waiting list for therapy for PTSD, and they say they have to discharge me if I am having flashbacks about more than one event. I already am, but I suppose Iâ€™m just supposed to lie.


Two years ago I was diagnosed with a life changing condition and put on drugs that degrade my emotional health and cognitive functioning. If I stop taking them, I might well die anyway. 


I donâ€™t want to live, but I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. I donâ€™t want to be a burden on the people I love when I know that things will likely not get easier. I canâ€™t ask them for help anymore. I know it wonâ€™t solve anything, and then Iâ€™ll feel guilty for opening up. I donâ€™t remember what itâ€™s like to not fight off suicidal plans all the time. 


Iâ€™ve tried everything.
