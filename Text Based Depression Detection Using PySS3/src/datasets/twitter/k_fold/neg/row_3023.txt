Did anyone else have a voice in their head that told them to stop?A year ago I reached for the gun. It wasn't loaded, but I was very serious about loading it. A voice in my head said "this life is yours". It wasn't a loud voice, it was almost like my internal one only it just came up unbidden, I wasn't thinking about *not* killing myself then.

It actually worked for a while, what or whoever said that to me. I didn't think about picking it up again... but now I've got a date set for when I'm checking out. I'm sorta scared the voice will come back and stop me yet I kind of want it to come back. Even if it was just my subconscious mind, I felt wanted. I don't know what to make of it.
