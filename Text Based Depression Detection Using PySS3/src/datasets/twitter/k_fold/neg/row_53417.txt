Talked to/texted a suicide hotline, called my parents, called a friend, canâ€™t bring myself to get helpI feel let down by everyone and donâ€™t know how to directly ask someone for help. My dad told me to grow up and get a hold of myself, my friend got into an argument with me and the last thing he said to me was to suck a dick before hanging up and said I choose to be offended after feeling hurt about a poorly planned racial slur that I normally wouldnâ€™t have gotten upset about. Suicide hotline is always â€œdo you need help getting a 5150 or noâ€ and I cannot afford the amount of help I need and I hate that everything is so black and white itâ€™s either continue living or fucking die and Iâ€™m stuck in this shit grey area of trying to ask for help and spending a fortune convincing myself that Iâ€™m getting better.

I have a fuckton of medical problems, one of which my rheumatologist confirmed is something that could be eligible for assisted suicide if my psychiatrist or one other physician signs off on and I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m living the life Iâ€™d want to live before I go if itâ€™s assisted, Iâ€™m so depressed that Iâ€™m like â€œwhatâ€™s the point of going that route if I can just do it for free and be smart about it fucking idiotâ€
