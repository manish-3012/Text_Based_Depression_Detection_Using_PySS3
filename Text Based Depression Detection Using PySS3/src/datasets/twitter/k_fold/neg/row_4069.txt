Positive thinking doesnâ€™t workLife has been nonstop horrific depression and anxiety for nearly 4 months. My life is going nowhere. Iâ€™ve got defaulted school loans. My parents are suffering because they co-signed. My life is literally meaningless. Even getting up to go to get something to drink is such a goddamn chore. Iâ€™m 24 and my parents love me so much but at the same time theyâ€™re so sorry for me. My boyfriend of nearly 5 years is such a sweetheart but goddamn he will not fucking help with any of this. Heâ€™s there for me but he wonâ€™t get a decent paying job. Heâ€™s 6 years older than me! What do I have to look forward to? Iâ€™m not fit to be a mom. Iâ€™m not fit for this world. Iâ€™m too tender. Iâ€™m unsuccessful. I manipulate people into being my friends and for what?

Oh, and my tax return is $9. Iâ€™m negative on my bank account. My car is going to stop working any day now. Every day is so hard. 

Itâ€™s just so fucking hard. I have all these reasons to live apparently, but Iâ€™m constantly failing.
