Everythingâ€™s bullshitIâ€™m so fucking over this. Everything. Being alive. I feel like Iâ€™m being held hostage in my own body. Thereâ€™s  n o t h i n g  to live for so why do I have to pretend like i care about life anymore? Iâ€™ve been given chance after chance to turn things around and make things better. And I burn through every single one like Iâ€™m trying to beat my high score for how-quickly-can-I-sabotage-myself-this-time? Iâ€™m out of chances. Iâ€™m out of options and itâ€™s my own fault because I do it to myself. 

Itâ€™s not a matter of if, itâ€™s when. Because I WILL kill myself the first chance i get, if nothing else gets to me first. Iâ€™m constantly going back and forth, trying to figure out if itâ€™s more selfish for me to kill myself now and get it out of the way for my family, or stay alive and keep slowly draining their time, money and emotions. They give and they give because they donâ€™t want to believe that Iâ€™m really this fucking worthless, and I just suck it in like a black hole. 

Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that I have to wait until my mother and sibling die before I can kill myself. Itâ€™s hard to think about because I want them to live long, happy lives, but I want to get out of here as soon as I can. I just feel so bad for them because they really believe that I have the potential to have any kind of life worth living- to be any kind of person worth taking up space. Itâ€™s sad to watch them lie to themselves, desperately trying to believe that I have some kind of value. 

I havenâ€™t been emotional about the thought of suicide in years. Iâ€™m just waiting it out. Iâ€™ve lost all interest in being alive, and apparently I stopped trying to live a long time ago. I never want to hurt the people I love, but sometimes I wish I could just do something to make them hate me so that I could run off and kill myself without anyone noticing.
