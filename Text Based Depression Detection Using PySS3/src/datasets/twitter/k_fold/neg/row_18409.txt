I Think Iâ€™m DoneHad a very rough start to college, Iâ€™m studying computer programming, everything is online due to coronavirus and due to a power surge my computer short circuited and was out for repairs for weeks. For some reason something like this happening even with proof is not enough to be able to complete assignments for even partial credit. Which I understand. But Iâ€™m still failing all my classes, which fucking sucks so bad

My parents also ended up taking a large portion of my student loan money because Iâ€™m a fucking pushover and my parents are the only people I rely on but they are so greedy when it comes to money.
I canâ€™t afford to pay rent this month and Iâ€™m just so ready to give up

Iâ€™m sorry to my wonderful boyfriend and my best friend. Iâ€™m sorry I wonâ€™t get to wish you a happy birthday this month 
Iâ€™m just so tired
