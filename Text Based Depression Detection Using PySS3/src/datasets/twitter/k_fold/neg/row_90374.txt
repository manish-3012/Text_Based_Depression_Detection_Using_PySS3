I feel like an empty shellI can't do this anymore. I'm such a failure, I feel like I mess up everything and everyone one, like I poison people who are close to me by being depressed. I don't dare to look in a mirror anymore because I can't recognise the face looking back. I don't feel like I'm alive, I'm just like a robot, wake up, brush my teeth, go to school, go to work, go home, sleep and repeat. I just don't see a point in existing anymore, I bet no one would even really notice if I was gone and if they did, so what? They'd get over it anyway, continue their lives. 

Who am I kidding, no one would give a shit.
