I don't know what to do?? I don't have someone to talk to and I just want to let it all out??Hi, I really don't know how this whole thing works out. I just created this account as a throwaway one even though I don't really use reddit lol. To be honest, I just found this subreddit as I searched the word 'suicide'. I want to clear things out that I've never been diagnosed by a medical professional with depression, neither have I ever been in touch with a medical professional. The thing is, I've been really down lately and life has been dealing me with shit lately. I've been struggling with my own mental health which I will get to in a moment. I guess I'll cut this thing on segments and hope that you won't find me really weird.   
The first section would be;  


**My Story**

So, I live in the Philippines and I'm a male. I've had a really shitty childhood because of a bad environment. My parents, athough they are still arranging for an annulment, have been split since my childhood and this was most likely because of my father's personality. My father is an alcoholic, manipulative and cheater. He has three wives (one of which doesn't even know about the other one, and yes, she does know about my mother and my sister) . Because of the split, my mother had to work 6 days of the week and would only often visit during the Sunday's, sometimes she won't even come home. I was left with my sister, a maid, and my grandfather. Now, my grandfather who is now deceased, always gave me a punishment every single time of every single day and he would only do so when my mother is not around. (I don't really know why he did it,, I guess I was the only one he could express the anger on my father to.) and my third maid (yes, we had a lot) would also abuse me and take me to a gambling den. I became rebellious and would only cause trouble, which in turn made my grandfather hate me more and more as time passes on. It only changed when my father decided to step in my life at the age of 9 and I told him about the abuse my mother's side has caused me... So he decided to move me with my aunt and he would also pay for my education and everything. Now, it might seem as if my father is a good person but as I've told you, he is really manipulative... More on that later... Now life with my aunt and grandma (from my father side) really went like what it was like with my mother's side with the difference of they never became physical to me. They would verbally abuse me and would always tell me that what I feel doesn't matter. It made what I was at that point in time worse and if it wasn't for a friend who saw me standing on the side of the condominiums rooftop I would have never been here. As a quick side note though,  I'm really glad that now as I've grown up my aunt and grandma has changed their hearts, although my grandma has passed away, my aunt really cares about me this days and I love her. After all this mess, there is one thing in my whole side and a lot of people suffer this that I can't let go and this is the issue with mental health. My family doesn't care for my mental health and this just got worse during the whole COVID-19 situation. 

**What's happening?**  


Quick side note: There was this time when I was grieving over the loss of my grandmother on my father's side and my father was the one who caused my lovely grandmother's death. My grandmother was set for a therapy after she was stricken by stroke but a day before my father decided to tease my grandma about how she was going to die which angered my grandma and in turn made here lose it and get attacked by a brain aneurysm. I was really upset with my father but things turned on the day before my grandma's burial. My father had arrived that day and was just making things worse for a grieving son. I finally snapped after he verbally abused me for not preparing stuff such as clothings, gadgets, and etc. LIKE DUDE YOU FUCKING KILLED MY GRANDMA WHO HAD TO DO YOUR FUCKING ROLE AS A FATHER FOR YOU AND NOW YOU'RE INSULTING ME FOR NOT PREPARING STUFF AS IF I HAD HOPED FOR MY GRANDMA TO DIE YOU STUPID FUCKING TWAT. I HAD PLANS OF PAYING BACK TO MY GRANDMA AFTER HER YEARS OF TAKING CARE OF ME AND YOU RUINED IT.   


Anyways, things got heated and I never apologized to my father and so did he. This will become relevant later.  


Well , my father decided to stay with my aunt and I as a way to access his work easier. The bummer is he got locked here with me during the quarantine and because of this he truly revealed what kind of a monster he was.. He was really toxic to me and never respected me as a son because of the previously stated story.. He sees me as a baby, a stupid person who doesn't respect him. My father has a really toxic trait of a nice guy,, he will do something good, in this case pay for my acads, as a way for me to respect him. I am basically his Trust Fund, his life insurance...  and he thinks that I should respect him no matter what treatment he gives to me. He has done this to everyone and it is I who has broken the stigma. I didn't follow their tracks and because of that almost everyone in my family thinks that I am just a rebellious son who doesn't understand my father's hard work. But that's just dumb. If my father didn't leave us, cheat on my mother and became a good father then this would have never happened. If only he had finished studying as an engineer and didn't back out then he would have never became such an oppressed worker. If only he had thinked about his actions... This of course made us a conflicting pair.   


There was one time where he was trying to invade my privacy through reading my stuff and when I got pissed he answered, "You take that privacy bullshit way too much" to which I responded, "Yah? Well in that case can I read your texts with Jane? (Jane is her mistress and Jane and my mother's side has accepted her as a part of the family so this wasn't supposed to be really offensive to him because umm duh?) " and he got pissed.. Which resulted on him physically hurting me..  


Things get worse as the day's go by, especially today as my father became really toxic to me again and my girlfriend and I are having a fight.. I've ben really struggling these days and I dying has been a daily option nowadays.. But I think I'll keep on fighting.. but if I do lose... I love you all :&gt; Thank you for reading
