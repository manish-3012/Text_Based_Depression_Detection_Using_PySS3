The worst part is, I did it to myselfI grew up under a narcissistic dad that made me believe that I was fundamentally a loser and unsociable because of my anger, which I then internalized. In middle school I retreated permanently into my room and the internet, first through video games. I found a crew of 30-something year old creeps that provided me the attention I was missing, but the sick, perverted, sexualized kind. I wasnâ€™t the only one they found. 

These guys were in my shitty flip phone and I would talk to them rather than my parents. Out of this perverse atmosphere I had sex with another mentally fucked up guy (not that much older though). This is around the time, 14/15 where I started going on tumblr and found an unending supply of sexual attention. This went on for about 3/4 years.. and by then I had retreated thoroughly from any chance of friendship or normal human contact. I ran away to a different state for college. 2 years I didnâ€™t see my family. 21 years old, and only recently did I tell them anything of consequence.

I saw my hometown, the friends I grew up with, teachers and people I knew, and it warmed my heart that home was still here. I met up with my grade school friends and saw people I mentally cast away accept me without question. 

It hurts so bad that it was all in my head and I robbed myself of my formative years. I feel like I grew up crooked and the chances of having a normal social life are nominal. Suicide scares me less and less every day.
