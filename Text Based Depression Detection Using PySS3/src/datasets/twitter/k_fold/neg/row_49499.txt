Life feels like a ton of work with very little payoff.I'm only 16 and I already feel done. There's just no point anyway. I used to think I was depressed because I just sat at home all day. Now that I'm actually doing things life just seems like having to do a bunch of shit I don't want to do and never getting what I really want. I don't think it matters what I do. I almost never feel happy because I'm so depressed and have such a bad attitude and I'm too lazy and unmotivated to even do anything about it.
