Some thoughts about the ethics of suicideThere are so many pills that I have to take in order to function on a daily basis. Even with those, I still feel like complete garbage on an emotional level. It just helps me to get through each day, but thatâ€™s all it is - getting through.

I was thinking about how people can choose not be kept alive on life support, and can have DNRs if theyâ€™re chronically ill.

Why donâ€™t we have the same for mental illness? I think it might be because mental illnesses are expected to be treatable, which is odd to me because theyâ€™re some of the most chronic conditions that you can have.

If Iâ€™m essentially being kept alive by my meds, why canâ€™t I take myself off them and allow myself to deteriorate mentally? Shouldnâ€™t that be my right as a human being? I know this might be an unfair comparison, but itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve been thinking about.

I just want a choice. I didnâ€™t choose to feel this badly every day. I want some sense of control and an escape from this constant pain.
