I went to bed yesterday praying I don't wake upWell, that didn't happen

The worst part is, there are so many people, useful members of society, talented and gifted, who just pass away like that

Meanwhile me, who hasn't done anything productive and who just wastes oxygen is here to stay, because I'm too big of a pussy to actually do something


The world is so, so fucking unfair. There are so many other people who deserve all I've got, and I'm just wasting it away. The guilt I feel is immeasurable
