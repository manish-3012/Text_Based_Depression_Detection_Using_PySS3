I don't want to be here anymore.I contribute nothing to life. I'm a waste. I'm never going to achieve anything remarkable. I feel numb and it's getting worse and worse. I've been looking up how to buy barbiturates online. I've been thinking about taking all my Prozac and quetiapine(serequel) in one go. I'm at someone's house just now so I probably don't have enough. 
I know this is incredibly selfish. I don't really see anyway out. I always feel not good enough. I just want to end it.
