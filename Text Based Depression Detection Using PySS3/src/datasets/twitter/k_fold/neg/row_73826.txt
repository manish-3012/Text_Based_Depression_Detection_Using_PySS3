i want to diei was raped last november. life hasnâ€™t gotten any better. ive been depressed for a good 6 years, but everything is worse now. i have been unhappy for a long time. i have everything i need, yet nothing makes me happy. my ex made me happy but it ended. my rapist was my best friend and he raped me. then disappeared. therapy isnâ€™t doing anything for me. im very unhappy. every day i see news with sexual assault in them. when its not movies its tv. i cant run away from rape. people around me know what happened but nothing helps. i dont trust men, im scared of them. its not fair because i really want to date again, but i canâ€™t trust them. nobody wants to fix someone else.  im 20. my best years are gone. he took everything i had left. i have no proof to take him to police. if i did and nothing came of it i think i would actually die of stress. if something happened i think i would also die of stress. i dont want people to doubt me or question me. its not fair, i didnt ask for this. i care about people. i dont know why he did this to me. i live in pain. my soul is damaged. i want to die. my anxiety is bad. he ruined me. i no longer feel beautiful or confident. im really tired
