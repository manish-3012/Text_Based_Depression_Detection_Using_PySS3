Suicide prevention messaging system made me feel more alone then everI'm in uni far from home. There have been several things bringing me down such as home/family issues, relationship issues, friendships, university shit, and a dash of heartbreak on top. 

Well I've honestly been going back and forth about what I want to do as far as whether or not I want to end it or not. I didn't want to call a suicide hotline or whatever because I just wasn't at that point yet so I opted to do the online chatting thing associated with it. 

After waiting for about an hour to get through to someone it was finally my turn and I just started going and telling this person all the things starting with one of the categories above. Well I didn't really get everything out there and the person I talked to just said that maybe I should consider counseling and sent me link info. After that they asked if there was anything else they could help with..... So feeling defeated and unheard I said no and closed the incognito tab. I felt worse than I had before, and now I just feel especially helpless because not even the fucking helplines set up for this shit will fucking hear me. 

I feel sad and empty and stuck in so many ways and I'm just tired of it.
