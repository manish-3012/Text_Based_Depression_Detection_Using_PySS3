People tell me to think positively yet they make me do otherwiseI have been severely depressed and suicidal for months. You'd think that friends would be there for you, but they will leave you pretty easily. I do not even ask for advice yet still they give me advice. The only thing I want is support in the form of listening. Still, they tell me to do this and that, to think positively about life and they always try to guilt-trip me by telling me how I will hurt them if I kill myself. They rather have me suffer to protect themselves. What's worse is that they say they care, but they do not show it. Instead, they just get angry at me for not following up their unwanted advice. In reality, I've already tried or am trying what they are suggesting. Though just because I want to get some things off my chest they will tell me I'm stuck and not doing anything. It might seem easy from their perspective, but they have no idea how bad depression can be. Right now, all my friends have pretty much abandoned me except for the ones who I did not bother with my troubles. I have even said I am thinking of killing myself soon because I wanted to be honest with them. Now I have not heard from them in 6 days. Not one person who knows of my problems has contacted me. They rather let me die than help me. I can already imagine their shock when I'm actually dead and they'll be saying: "I wish I could've been there for him". Easy to say after the damage has been done. Honestly, this world, at least the Western world, is filled with selfish people. Sometimes I stop thinking about how I am not good enough for this world. Instead, I start to think I am too good for this world and all these selfish people do not deserve me.
