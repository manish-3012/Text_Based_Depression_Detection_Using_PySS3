I was so damn closeWednesday I was in manic mood, decided that no one cares about me and my impulse control went out the window.

So I took about 60 5mg Valium, all of the paxel and buspar that I had left. So around 200 pills in total. 

I woke up 10 hours later in an ambulance transferring me to a different hospital. 

As of today I was declared medically stable, and they're trying to find me a bed in a mental health hospital. 

I was so happy when I was unconscious, I was with my dad. I felt so free and there wasn't a worry in my head.

Right now I'm being watched 24/7 I wish I didn't wake up. 

The only thing I remember from those ten hours is them intubating me. I was so close, I almost won. 

Everything I try to do I fail. Why can't people understand that I don't want to be here anymore. It's hurting me more being alive than it would hurt my loved ones if I died.

Then today my husband called me and told me that my ESA dog (Bruce) was hit by a car...then a half an hour later he tells me that Bruce died. I love that dog so much, he was even here with me for a few days. My husband is to upset to drive here for us to be together and I can't leave this fucking room.
