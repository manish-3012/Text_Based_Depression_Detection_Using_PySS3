A little bit of positiveFor the last 8 years, I was so depressed, that I couldnâ€™t keep a job, dropped out of school, kicked out of the military, and became homeless. 

I started shooting meth, then dealing, then prison. 

The one thing that got me through was not just asking for help, but listening. Even if itâ€™s from a stranger. 

My worst day ever, might be someoneâ€™s best day. There is never a way to judge sadness.
