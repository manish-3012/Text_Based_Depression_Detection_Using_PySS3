What is the point?I can't think of any reason to keep going.. I'm trying to, I'm really trying to, but I can't think of a single thing. This isn't going to get better, it's way too fucking late for that. They ruined any chance I had.. It's just going to keep getting worse and worse. There's no reason for me to wake up tomorrow and I don't want to. No one is going to miss me. No is going to care.
