I think I am going to end my life... Reddit, what keeps you happy? [xPost from AskReddit]Over the past 3 years I have become increasingly depressed, and home-bound (social anxiety.) I see no meaning or purpose in my life. I haven't experienced any real pleasure in ages. In fact, I do not even know what makes me happy anymore. I haven't laughed out loud in years. Food doesn't interest me. I sometimes yearn to go live in a foreign land, but then I think I can't survive there.


I am 27, and live in a developing country. I know I might have a really skewed perception of the world. I believe everybody is bad, mean, dirty and just out to make money. I am educated, but I think I will not fit into the culture of a developed country even if I immigrate (things like table manners, parties, drinks, events are alien to me.) So, the best way out, seems to be to get out of the world itself.


If you guys can tell me what makes you happy, what helps you get out of bed every morning, maybe it will help. You are the only ones I can ask, as I rarely interact with any people IRL, and I have no facebook or twitter friends.
