It's won.The psychologist I see seems like she's almost given up on me. Every strategy, every suggestion, it goes unnoticed because I am so utterly pathetic in the way I stand against my mental illness. I've finally let it win. It's won. It's survived a cocktail of medications, it's survived therapy. It's won. I'm so tired. So exhausted... Can I rest now? I've tried so hard... I don't want to keep trying anymore.
