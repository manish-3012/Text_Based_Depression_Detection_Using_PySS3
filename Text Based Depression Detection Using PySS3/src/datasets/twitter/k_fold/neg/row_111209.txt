I can't keep this up.I had to take Friday off work because my co-workers despise me so much I couldn't take their hostility and undermining behavior anymore. All weekend I tried to fight off the dread of having to go in again on Monday. I have to go back today and I'm lying here trying to think of how I could get into a horrific accident to get away from these people. Everything in my life is shit and people think just because the job pays decently I should just suck it up and be happy.
