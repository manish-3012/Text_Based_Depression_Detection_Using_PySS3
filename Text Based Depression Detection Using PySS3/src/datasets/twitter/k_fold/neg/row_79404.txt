Can anyone please talk to me? Nobody around me wants to talk.I cant make any decisions in my life. I always try to do something that can fix all these problems in my life but i always fail!!.  my parents dont help me at all , i dont have any friends to talk to and these suicidal thoughts are driving me crazy. Like whenever am facing a problem the only solution comes up in my mind is to kill myself , its like am forced to do that. I used to talk to some people but now everyone around me is always discouraging me. People around me ignore me all the time!
