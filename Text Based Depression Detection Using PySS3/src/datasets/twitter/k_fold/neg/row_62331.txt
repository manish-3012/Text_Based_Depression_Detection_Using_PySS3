Getting help is impossibleI understand that Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where Iâ€™m going to need a sufficient diagnosis and treatment for whatever mental illness is making me behave this way. However, I am a student who relies on their parents for money and bringing up going to therapy with them is out of the question. I live in the UK and the cheapest being around Â£125 for a 1 hour consultation is impossible to cover with my monthly allowance. My uniâ€™s counseling is complete bullshit as far as Iâ€™ve heard. It seems to me that the only way to get help is to do something extreme, such as a suicide attempt. I canâ€™t continue living this way so honestly itâ€™s a win-win situation â€” either I get help or I donâ€™t have to deal with it.
