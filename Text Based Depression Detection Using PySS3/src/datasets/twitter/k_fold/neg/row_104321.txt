I've lost the will to liveMy life has been hell for ten years since I was a child. Now I'm an adult and it's still horrible. For years I've been trying make my life better but it's one road block after another. At this point even if things changes I'm so tried I don't see how I'll ever really be happy. Life is too hard and living has become pointless. I just want it all to end.
