I feel like something really bad is going to happen to me soon, and my cats feel it toofor a few weeks now, I feel this feeling, weight, it feels like I'm going to die, I don't know how to explain, I don't know if it's because my crises got worse and I'm just thinking about bad things, I tried suicide not long ago and worrying about everything, I'm afraid, I normally wouldn't be afraid of death, but you know, this feeling is being really bad, my two cats got closer to me these days, they watch me all the time and lie down with me, it may seem crazy but I think they feel it too :(  my anxiety and insomnia are attacked, i don't know what to do
