Bedbugs FMLThink I might have just gotten myself evicted for reporting bedbugs.  Exterminator is going to bankrupt me. I should just dye the carpet red if I find a notice on my door after that.  Been through too much and if they evict me and my dad I'll just whack open my arms and start doing jumpingjacks.
