Iâ€™ve tried again and again and itâ€™s just pointlessFor years itâ€™s been a cycle. I feel like shit, I try to kill myself, I get better, life is fantastic, and something horrible happens and I feel like shit again. I have no one, I pushed my boyfriend away and mistreated him, and my own mother thinks Iâ€™m disgusting for it. Iâ€™m a waste of space and I leech off of other people. My life is pointless, all I do is radiate negativity and allow my own naivety to convince me thereâ€™ll be better days. I have no one to tell this to in real life, so I guess Iâ€™ll just say it here.
