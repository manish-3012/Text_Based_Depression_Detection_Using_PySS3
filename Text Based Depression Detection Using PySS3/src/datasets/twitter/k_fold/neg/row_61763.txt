I feel like a fakeI have OCD and major depression. The thing I obsess over the most happens to be killing myself. I work in the psychiatric ward of a hospital. I spend all day hanging out with people at the lowest point of their lives, and talking them through it. I know so many coping mechanisms, understand how depression and anxiety can cripple you but you have to work through it to become a stronger person tomorrow. But I honestly just can't. I have all the answers in front of me, and I tell them to patients every day; but I can't take my own advice. I've been dealing with this for about 15 years now, and I'm just too tired to care anymore.
