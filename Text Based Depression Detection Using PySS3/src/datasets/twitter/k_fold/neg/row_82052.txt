I can't do this anymore.I've been feeling this way for so long and I don't know what to do anymore. I've been suffering alone for so long now, and now that I finally told some people how I feel it just confirmed my beliefs. They don't give a fuck. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to be numb again I don't want to feel this way anymore. I have no one to turn to anymore and I can't do this. I can't breath.. I want to die right now so much. I'm fucking stuck and no matter what I do I'll have to live with these issues forever. I don't know what to do with myself.
