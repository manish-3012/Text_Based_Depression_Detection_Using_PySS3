this is the endi've been thinking about suicide for years, but i was never  close as i am now.

i was never happy, since the day i was born.

I endured a lot of pain in silence, i never share what i'm thinking about because nobody will ever understand me.

I was always that creepy person with creepy thoughts, but nobody will really know what i've been through until the day the will find out about this post.

At 4 years old, i was with my grandparents, and that's the time  when everthing changed.

I don't quite remember what happend exactly, but those momemnts i'll never forget them.

I've been hiding this secret for my whole life, and now i'm almost 22 and literraly nobody knows it besides those 3.

My whole life was failure, i disapointed and lost every single person i knew, even tough i'm always trying to help people, make them happy but i forgot my own happiness.

This will be my last words, i'm begging pardon for every person i hurt even if it wasn't intenionnaly, please don't judge this decision, it's really hard for me but i just can't leave anymore this way.

I'll do it tomorrow, and i let my thoughts here for my family so they can at least know what's i've been thinkin the whole time
