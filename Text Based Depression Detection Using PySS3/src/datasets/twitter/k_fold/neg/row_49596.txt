I can't do this anymore.I'm sitting here with anixety.   


I keep thinking about taking my life, which I do everyday. I was outside last night again and was probably home around 3 am. I went to the bridge and sat on it for a while then went home. Two police car passed by me on the way home and I was nervous they would recognize me since they know who I am now because of the attempts I've made this year. I did accidently met them one time on the way to the bridge this year and they had to pull me from the railing. So I get nervous I would meet them and they would know who I am. When I just walked outside I saw a police car that had stopped at a bus stop because of some another car they had stopped and I just looked in general and one of the police looked at me for some minute and I think I recognized him from another time and I kinda panicked and hoped he wouldn't see who I was. Sometimes I keep an eye out for the police and sometimes I don't.   


Anyhow, I'm here thinking of going to the train station later on or the bridge.   
Nothing is helping and no one understands how close I am to doing this.   
I have "help" but they don't understand and their "help" isn't to any help at all. It's only been about waiting and waiting. Telling me to try to do something else or just trying to withstand the impulses or thoughts.  


I was to the psychiatric hospital during tuesday night but the doctor and nurse I met was crappy. the doctor sometimes didn't understand what I said because of the langauge. I told her a few times that I don't have any medications and later on the internet she had written that I \*HAVE\* Theralen at home but I don't. Frustrating.
