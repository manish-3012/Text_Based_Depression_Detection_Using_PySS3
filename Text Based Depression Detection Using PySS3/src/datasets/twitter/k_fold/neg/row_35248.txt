Rate my life/10? Let's see. I'm 19 years old. I haven't had a friend since about grade 3. I've had 5 conversations since January 1st 2011. 5. 4 with the members of my family who I can't stand and 1 with a psychiatrist who didn't help/couldn't careless. I am currently in school in a shitty program with terrible classes that I don't like. I don't know what I like and I can't find it. I'm incredibly unmotivated all the time for school. I can't go out in public because of my crippling anxiety (taking the bus? LOL). Oh and before you say, well someone cares, I could literally die right now, and NO ONE would know for the next month and a half until my super comes knocking that I haven't paid my rent. Never even come close to getting a girlfriend. I'm ugly as hell (slender but ugly). I am literally losing the ability to hold a conversation. I can't get a job (and have never held a job) at any point (I'm studying) because of my crippling social anxiety.

Last year, I lived in on-campus housing with a ton of students my age. Now, I go to class, and still? I'm the only person who sits alone. I mean, I blame myself. I know I didn't put any effort in to making friends (I can't get past the anxiety and terribly out of practice social skills)

So let's play find a good part of my life then?
