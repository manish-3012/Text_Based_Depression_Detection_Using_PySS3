He saved meI was in metro station, hadn't any recent worries in my life or problems. Waiting for train to come, I was thinking that I must jump. I felt very sad at that moment, don't know why. I was hearing a voice that said to not do it. I knew he was running in my direction. I heard him. I closed my eyes and I let myself falling. At the last moment he did catch my hand and pulled me in his direction. Train was there, he saved me. Strange fact, the man who saved me was a girl, a very beautiful one. We watched in silence for a half a minute, then I left. She followed me and I started crying. She said that I must see someone for help and she offered to go with me. I don't know what to do, why is a stranger carrying for me so much? Did you ever experienced something like this before?
