making excusesI hate myself for coming up with reasons why I shouldn't kill myself. not really why I shouldn't kill myself but why I can't attempt right now. if I had the fucking guts I probably could have done it by now, but I'm scared to attempt because I might get caught and I don't want to be hospitalized again.
