I gave myself an end dateI've been someone who has been depressed for a long time. I don't tell many people as the few I do tell either don't believe me as I'm able to play happy or tell me that my life is good enough that I don't deserve to call myself depressed and say there are other people out there that have it worse. They aren't wrong. However I've gotten to the point where I just don't want to be alive anymore. I don't think there is really anything after death and quite frankly I don't care. However I don't know exactly how I want to go. AFAIK there isn't one nice clean method. I've given myself a little over 4 months to plan how I want to go though sometimes I don't think I'm going to make it that long. 

I'm also afraid of how the people in my life will react. Obviously I know some will be sad and some will be angry and I do feel for them, but ultimately I think everyone would be better without me. I just hope that there is a way for them to understand that this is what I really wanted and to forgive me for any pain I cause. 

I wish there was a way to let them understand that this wasn't an easy decision to come to and that it is the decision that I want more than anything else.
