EnoughI donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here. Maybe because, Iâ€™m all honesty, I want someone I know too find me and talk. But that doesnâ€™t make a whole lot of sense because at the same time, Iâ€™m tired of talking. I hate explaining this to people so often that I can now see their eyes start to glaze over. Clearly, Iâ€™m not getting better. Hell, itâ€™s been over 12 years since this whole battle started, and Iâ€™m completely sick of fighting. Maybe that makes me a coward, but fuck it; my white flag is raised. I have plenty of pills ready, and Iâ€™ll have several hours to myself at home in about 3 days. Hereâ€™s hoping 60 will be enough to do the trick, but I have a backup plan if that fails, so whatever. Thereâ€™s so much other stuff Id like to say.. but quite honestly I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m worth the character count.
