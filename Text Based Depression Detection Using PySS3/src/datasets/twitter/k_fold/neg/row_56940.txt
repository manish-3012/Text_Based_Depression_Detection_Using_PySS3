I Have everything so why do I want to leave it behind? Nothing in my life is difficult I have a nice job,  I got into the college I wanted, my family loves me. But I feel like no one truly knows me. When I'm alone it feels like all I can think about is how laborious living on feels. Nothing is difficult really it's just boring everything feels like a waste of time as if I could be doing something more important but there isn't anything that doesn't feel that way. Even now I'm writing this instead of doing assignments for a classes. All my life I've coasted by with minimal effort getting Ds and Cs hearing teachers say "He's so intelligent but he just doesn't try hard enough" What else are they supposed to say your son's stupid.  I don't know how much longer I can stand just the constant sense of inadequacy and boredom being where I am. What do I do ?
