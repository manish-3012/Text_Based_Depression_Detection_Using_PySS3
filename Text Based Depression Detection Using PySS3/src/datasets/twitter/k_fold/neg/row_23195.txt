I'm not even sad anymore; I just feel like I'm already deadI don't care about anything; I live to sleep, and I haven't dreamed in years. I sleep upwards of 12 hours each night and when I wake up I force myself to shut my eyes and try to drift back into oblivion. When I can't sleep anymore, I go outside and I smoke cigarettes and drink coffee until I feel something shifting through these posts, and then I contemplate why I am so goddamn weak, and why I don't care that I'm weak. The younger me would beat this guy up, because he is unrecognizable. I just want to feel something besides nothing.
