Iâ€™m doneIm 18. Iâ€™m too mentally ill to work. I donâ€™t think anyone understands that. I have orientation for my new job tomorrow and Iâ€™m thinking about leaving tonight, driving to a bridge and jumping off. Iâ€™ve tried to get disability before but I didnâ€™t qualify. Life is literal hell even when Iâ€™m doing nothing and in the comfort of my home. When I say I am too mentally ill for work I am not exaggerating. I guess death is my only option. If not that then I will probably be homeless because I am leaving home either way. Goodbye guys and thanks to everyone in this subreddit for talking to me when I needed it most. :)
