It would've been so easy so why didn't I?when I get really bad, I go for a drive. Blast music and try to clear my head and get myself together. But this time, I could see images of my self crashing into a ditch or a tree. It was so real and I wish I would have. I have no one to talk to about this, actually I have no one. period. 

so I'm just trying to sleep away most of my days and try to get through the next few days.
