I'm going to suicide in the following weeks, help meHello reddit,

I'm drunk while writing this, so sorry for miswritings. I'm a successful guy at university, age 20, suffering depression, skin picking, alcohol and lately tobacco. I'm taking antidepressents and seeing a psychiatrist, however never sad anything when they asked about suicide. I'm done with it, even though I'm social, I can never find a girlfriend. And dont give the "you will have one and laugh at this, I have seen many people not having any at all. I'm done with people saying I'm already social and find someone. Most of my friends have someone and I never did. 

I dont believe and find life meaningless. I'm already successful, yet nothing goes good. I always had similar thoughts, however lately I cannot stop them. I already fight with skin picking, artefacta dermatitis, and my legs are full of scars I did. Every time someone asks me the scars, I die more inside and say they are allergies. 

Nearly all of my friends nearly all of the time have a sweetheart, yet regardless of how much I try, I can't even date anyone. I have many close friends, yet I dont have any friend that I can we are closest friends. I'm done with everything this life can offer, it will never be better.

Antidepressants, not that powerful ones, seemed nice when they started effecting, but now they seem useless. My psyc postponed my therapy since I wont be at my uni town for the next month, and she doesnt want it to end in half. 

Every where I look says suicide is bad, but I hate these taboos. Why not end it if I believe there is nothing after the life, why not end the suffering at once. I hate the headaches of loneliness, for I have many friends, none I can find at the time I need them most. 

:( I dont when I will do it, but it gets closer every single day, and I fear the date I will do it.
