Iâ€™m going to die. It doesnâ€™t matter, because I hate every single one of you.*Iâ€™m going to die. It doesnâ€™t matter, because I hate every single one of you.* 

If you all died I wouldnâ€™t give a fuck. If I saw one of you get hit by a truck or a cement mixer and your guts and mushy innards got all over the street and you had to be cleaned off the street with a powerhose I wouldnâ€™t give a single fuck, I would just sit there and watch eagerly, and probably go get mcdonalds right after, with lots and lots of yummy sauce

Iâ€™ve been depressed, pretty much ever since Iâ€™ve been alive, or able to have coherent thoughts. I donâ€™t remember much about my childhood. I try not to think about it. 

*They say there is people a certain kind of people a certain kind of stupid cunt people that donâ€™t* 

I just remember being constantly unhappy, constantly worrying about things that I shouldnâ€™t have worried about *they donâ€™t no one does know they donâ€™t* I never cared about important things like school or my future or having fun or sports or feelings or relationships or anything like that. The truth is Iâ€™ve only ever cared about myself, not out of aspirations or goals or dreams or any bullshit like that, but out of fear *and I hate them I hate them all because well the truth is I can never be one of them I never can be I never have been and I never will be I donâ€™t want to live my life on the fringe any more I donâ€™t want to live like this the best years of your life of my life college the four best years of your life what horseshit what incompatible horseshit* 

I hate the world. Itâ€™s a shitty vile place. It was fine when animals ruled it, then at least it was fair, it was honest, it was self-sustaining. Then one animal got smart and decided to rule all over the other animals. People think theyâ€™re gods, and they act like it, but theyâ€™re still people, deep down. Yeah. Thatâ€™s right. You guys are my so-called friends, and I hate every single one of you for your failures, your pathetic pointless existences, the same way I hate myself. Every single one of you is an expendable leech, sucking and sucking at the worldâ€™s teat, eating up all the food, the resources, the money, the everything and just shitting it out, plop plop plop, into the toilet. Like the animals you are *and yeah I thought this would calm me down and I was right, this is calming me down, Iâ€™m letting some of it out, just a small amount, peanuts really at this point but I am so not calm and so not Just so not. I want to be not* 

Part of me wants there to be a nuclear war so the world as we know it can be choked out of existence. So all of you self-loving jerkoffs, you self-righteous cock-sucking roaches can be flushed down the shitter, into the abyss with all the other shit. Then the earth would join the cluster of dead rocks spinning in space, smacking into the other dead rocks, and everything will be honest and right again. Like nature *that way I can die and they can live in their stupid little bubbles and hate me, and I can hate them and the mutual hatred will be beautiful and self-sustaining, and then my bones and everything will rot and I will be forgotten, and nothing will matter to me anymore and the damned world can keep turning. Its so hard to kill yourself though. These cocksucking animal bastard motherfucker cocksucker cunts scum-suckers of shit out the sewer cockroach taints made it so FUCKING hard*

I donâ€™t really emote anymore. I feel alienated from my peers and my so-called friends and can never be really intimate with anyone. I donâ€™t even care. 

Knowing humanity in general, you all will make this about yourselves, because *Hanging is the only option I have and even it is so gross and unpleasant. I just want to take a pill or something and drift away, but no, society doesnâ€™t like that its bad for business bad for economy against god and jesus and all the holy angels so I will be forced to find a suitable tree and break my fucking neck in half with the force of a thick rope and my own bodyweight and if I fail I could have brain damage wake up drooling people in white stooping condescending relearning to read and write no worse retard dead bag of flesh bloated visceral kept alive against nature* There will be the initial shock, the crying, the feeling of loss that comes with an absent mental fixture. Nothing more than a visceral reaction to the resulting darkness when a lightbulb goes out. But lightbulbs are replaceable. You can buy a shit ton of them, and you never have to worry, every time one goes out, you screw another in and itâ€™s like nothing even happened. People looking for light will find light and *Today I look around and I see nothing worth liking, not people but fat bags of flesh that sit around and barely do anything and I just canâ€™t take it. Iâ€™m feeling urges like violent urges, I would never do anything* 

Iâ€™ll bet youâ€™ll be thinking, why. Why didnâ€™t he ask for help, I would have helped him, I would have called the government on him so they could drag him into a cell for three days strapped to a table while some well-meaning fuck with a degree can poke and prod my stupid stupid brain, and then let me go with 500k bill. 

I suppose I must be crazy. You all will read this, and think â€˜heâ€™s crazyâ€™ but my fantasies are becoming more and harder and worse like I keep thinking about getting into a fight into a confrontation and what I would do or say but at the same time I know that itâ€™s a crazy lie, and I know that I canâ€™t do or say anything. And that ultimately, I really donâ€™t hate these people, I hate myself but no, I donâ€™t think I am. I think Iâ€™ve been mostly the same my entire life, and I think that there isnâ€™t much of a line between crazy and sane anyway. Some people will clutch their sanity and never let go of it. I was willing to let it go so I guess I did. But the big thing is, I understand, mostly, how reality works. I understand why people do things I canâ€™t stop I sometimes walk through the bad neighborhoods at night and I feel so stressed and my heart is pounding and all I can think about is the cityâ€™s serial stabber and I feel like I must at least be somewhat sane if I donâ€™t want to get stabbed, but still Iâ€™m concerned something is going to slip through the cracks and Iâ€™m going to do something and fuck myself over, perhaps spectacularly 

I just donâ€™t want any part in it anymore. I canâ€™t participate in society, so I shall go to the other extreme. Different strokes for different folks.

Or youâ€™ll be thinking that you should have known, that maybe there could have been some way of stopping me. But no. There is no way. I have poison in my veins and arsenic in my gut and toxic gas steaming out my mouth. Iâ€™m broken, I was born broken and now I will die, fittingly, with my neck broken. 

They say everyone dies two deaths. The first is your literal death, the second is the last time your name is ever spoken, or the last time you are ever talked about, or thought about, or remembered. Please. For me. Make my second death happen as close to my first as possible.
