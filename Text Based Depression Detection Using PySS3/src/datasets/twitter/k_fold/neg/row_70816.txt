I have absolutely nothing to live forLike the title says, I just feel as if there is nothing to live for. The only thing I even care about anymore is watching my Broncos play... and what the fuck is that? Football? Some meaningless game that entertains me for 3 hours a week? 

I don't have anything else. All my friends are gone, my last girlfriend used me, and then left me in the cold with a gaping hole where my heart was. I have no desire to look for another girlfriend, yet I'm lonely as fuck. I just have no will anymore what so ever. 

I honestly just want to curl up, go to sleep, and never wake up again. Just end it right here and now before anymore pain.
