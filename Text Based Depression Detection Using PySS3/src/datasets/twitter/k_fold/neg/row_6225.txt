What, why, how, and whenMental health has been evaluated, treated, and reevaluated. Medication does nothing but make me numb to the things around me. It doesn't last long.  My one and only baby was a stillborn at 38 weeks. That's literally weeks away from being born. I've been dead inside ever since. Absolutely nothing makes the pain go away. I've tried.  I researched and came up with a plan. I will take a drill and make a few holes around the catalytic converter. I will make a playlist and roll up the windows inside of the garage. I will put danger notices on the outside of the garage door.  This is my 3rd try. First, was my sister in laws gun. A pink sparkly thing I felt weird holding. I called the hotline and they tracked me. I went to the hospital and I was treated like an animal. The second time I got sleeping pills, but had a change of heart and took 2 weeks to try and be happy. This time is different. I'm calm, totally ready, and actually relieved that it will be over very soon.
