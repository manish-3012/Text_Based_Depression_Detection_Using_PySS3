I've given upI hope I'm not bothering anyone, but I just want to share my feelings. I have gone through some rough times past couple years and I feel like I'm now totally done. I can't go on any further and I think of suicide many times a day. I don't wanna do it. I know it's the worst solution and it will hurt my relatives, but I can't just go on. It's too much. 

My parents' alcohol problems have showed up, dad has attacked me 3 times, I've gone through 17 years of emotional abuse at home and  13 years of bullying from kindergarten to last days of primary school (7-15). My other relatives have been turned against me and the list goes on...

*Please* help, I need solutions quickly. I can stall it, but I'd wish to get some new ideas from here or I won't make it
