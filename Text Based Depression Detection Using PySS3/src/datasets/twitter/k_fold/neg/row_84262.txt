I know I need help, butHas the NSPL actually helped anyone here? I'm worried and afraid, and I've seen some people post here about responses, or lack-there-of, that they have received when they called or chatted. I'm afraid that if I receive the same that I will never seek help again and eventually (maybe sooner rather than later) end my life. 


So, please: have they helped, or is it more trouble than it's worth?
