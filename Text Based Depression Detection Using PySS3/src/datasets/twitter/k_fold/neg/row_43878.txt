Why am I so scared of everything?I'm scared of talking to people, I'm scared to start doing things I have to do, I'm scared to show anyone any of my problems or emotions, I'm scared of the future, I'm scared of my parents, even though long I grew out of the age where they were hitting me. I'm scared of going to a Therapist to see whats wrong with me. I'm scared of killing myself, even though I have nothing to live for. I'm just wasting my parents' money and failing at everything. I want to die. But I'm too scared to actually go through with it..

I wish I could just leave. I wish I could do anything.. Why can't I just be like everyone else?
