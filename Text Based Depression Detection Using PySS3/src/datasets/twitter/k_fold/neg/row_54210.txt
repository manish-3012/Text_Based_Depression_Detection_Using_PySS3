So this is permanence...I am woman, age 27, I have the desire to kill myself. Most of the day I am in my room, getting high, listening to music. With no life, no friends, no family to talk to, no work, ended up in a deep depression. A depression that's becoming to hard. To hard to fight. As if life has catched me in, and I am way far behind. A dark cloud is hanging over me. I see myself as if I look through the eyes of a completely different person. A person that see other people having a great time and having fun. Something I can't experience. I can't experience fun. The only thing that I feel is emptyness. Everynight I lay in bed and think about killing myself, being dead. I want to die. I want to die. I hate myself and I want to die. Nothing seems to matter anymore... Existence... Dead seems such a relieve, quiet, rest, for eternity.. that's all I want. Life is to hard.. I have the feeling I am losing control.
