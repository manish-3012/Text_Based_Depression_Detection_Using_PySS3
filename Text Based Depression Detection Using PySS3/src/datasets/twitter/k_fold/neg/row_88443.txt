I just want to take a break from being alive for awhileThereâ€™s just so much going on and I need some time off. Therapist told me I may have OCD and all that has done is make me think I DEFINITELY have it and just made things worse. Iâ€™m scared to talk to my parents about anything thatâ€™s going on and I lost my number one person for support and I just feel so alone.
