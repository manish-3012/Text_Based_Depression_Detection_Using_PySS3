I'm in a lot of pain. I don't want to die. I just don't want to be in pain.I've tried twice to end my life, and obviously failed. Twice these attempts were predicated by romantic losses. Betrayals. This time it's so much worse. There was no ultimate betrayal, besides the understandable after effect of my wife having feelings for someone else prior to the end of our marriage. I've tried to "get over" the loss of my wife. She was my best friend and the most intelligent, kind, motivated, generous person that I've ever met. I was such a terrible partner from the beginning. And I have no idea how or why she stuck with me. She loved me at a time. But that time passed. The guilt of what I did to hurt her, what I did to lose that love (to have withheld it from her) it's literally killing me. I mean I can feel myself dying each day. I'm a monster.
