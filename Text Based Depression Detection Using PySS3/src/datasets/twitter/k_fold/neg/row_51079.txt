Acnelast year I started having problems with my appearance, I had a lot of acne and that made me think about suicide a couple of times, now I don't have acne but the fucking scars are all over  my face. My friends usually joke about that, and say that I look like freddy Krueger or deadpool, I started wearing a hoodie to hide it but now I don't even go outside, I'm 15 and I suck at school,  and I don't know what to do with my life. I only see 1 option.
