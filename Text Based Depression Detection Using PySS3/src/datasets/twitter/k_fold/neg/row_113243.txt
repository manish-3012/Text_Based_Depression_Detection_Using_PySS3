Iâ€™m ready to die, but my sister canâ€™t let meIâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself for years. If I do, my sister will surely have a mental break and likely kill herself as well. Itâ€™s literally the only reason Iâ€™m alive. The hard part is that, because sheâ€™s the only person I care about and the only person I can trust, I have no one else to talk to about my suicidal fantasies. They scare the shit out of her because she knows Iâ€™ll do it so I canâ€™t even vent to her. I really wish she would just get like zapped in the brain and erase all memory of me. Yesterday I thought about how good it would feel to walk to the bathroom at work and shotgun my head off. Today I thought about how easily I could just jump in front of a subway. I want to fucking die god fucking damn it.
