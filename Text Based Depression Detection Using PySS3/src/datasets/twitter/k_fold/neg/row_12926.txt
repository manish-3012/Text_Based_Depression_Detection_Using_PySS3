Why did he have to commit suicide.A few years ago my ex committed suicide. I think about him often, and I think about the event often. 
Iâ€™ve been 5150d before, and I donâ€™t ever want to go back to a mental health hospital. Iâ€™m not meaning anything bad about those facilities, they just arenâ€™t for me. (Although I did really enjoy doing group there).
Currently Iâ€™m in a loving relationship and we have a newborn daughter. 

Currently as Iâ€™m typing this is around 2am, 2:38 is when he took his life years ago. 
Every October 3rd I tell myself this is the year I wonâ€™t cry. 
But around 11pm I started thinking of him, and how heâ€™s really gone forever and he is now nothing.
Iâ€™m not scared of death, I work at a mortuary, and so does my current significant other, so itâ€™s not the fear of death that is making me anxious, itâ€™s just the fact that he is literally nothing. 
Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m ranting, Iâ€™m just in a panic state of mind right now.
His suicide really sticks with me and I donâ€™t know how to move past it. 
And when I fixate on his suicide I also fixate on my feelings of wanting to just be done with. 
I love my daughter so much, but I have a looming feeling she will be better off without me. 
I donâ€™t want her to think Iâ€™m crazy when she grows up. 
I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m crazy, I just feel like my mind is traumatized. 
I feel like I have nobody to talk to about the death of my Steven. 
Iâ€™m sorry for ranting, Iâ€™m just feeling really manic and Iâ€™m in a dark place tonight.
