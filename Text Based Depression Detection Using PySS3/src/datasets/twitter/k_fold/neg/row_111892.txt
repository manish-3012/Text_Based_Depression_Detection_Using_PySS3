If I could sleep forever I would.I was 16, high school. At that moment I was a good student, had amazing grades and was socially average. I had lots of dreams, learning photography, another music instrument, go to med school.
By that moment I realized shit was getting though, I had never put any effort in school and still ace the tests. Then I thought "well from now on it seems I'll have to study to get into med school" and then this thought came to me: "Life will get more complicated, less enjoyable, you won't have vacations, you will sleep less, you won't have time for your hobbies" etc etc. From that moment on I felt hopeless, I talked to people about this and they agreed with me "yes life gets tougher" but they also said "but you get freedom, you get to be yourself, you get the benefits and consequences". I mainly wanted to play videogames to forget about life, went to parties to drink for the same reason (the social part was just a bonus for me). As I approached my last high-school year I became very anxious, I was in the last enjoyable year of this part of my life, every day I just had to make something out of it, if I didn't I felt like I was wasting my best days and those would never come back.

A month after I finished highschool I tried to suicide by poisoning myself but failed. I got into med-school but I hated it, I would never sleep, had to study all day, I hated my classmates as most of them were competitive jerks that would do anything to have better grades than you. Plus I felt like it wasn't filling my intellectual demands, I was just memorizing information, I wanted science or something. At that point I struggled for the meaning of life, my life had no meaning and what I was learning didn't solve anything. At that point people started telling me that I had the profile of a scientist, that I could find fulfillment by research and discovering something. That idea felt much more meaningful than just being an MD so in my first year in college I switched to get a degree in molecular biology and go for an academic career. For 2 or 3 years everything felt quite right, I still had this idea that the future wouldn't be nearly as good but this college years had their charm.
When I was close to getting my degree everything started to look grim once again. The scientist career felt like a mistake, not only there were very few jobs available but the money was also miserable. By that time I thought "well when I was 16 I was right, life from now on sucks". 

From that moment on 90% of the mornings I wake up I wish I just had died in my sleep. I don't look forward to anything in the future. I don't like going out much since I live on a tight budget. 95% of the parties I've went in the last 4 years I just wanted to leave after the first hour. And to get together with my old friends is just a chore since everyone is so busy on their late twenties. My everyday is terrible, even the weekends when I don't have to wake up early I feel miserable. Probably the thing I enjoy the most is going to bed and to sleep, I just wish I didn't have to wake up again. If I could sleep forever I would. I think a lot about suicide but after my failed attempt I'm too scared to fail once again.

I'm in my late twenties, I'm supposed to be enjoying life, doing whatever people my age do, yet I prefer to spend my time alone at the computer, everything else feels like a chore. Practically I spend the day longing for the time I have to go to bed again. Watching series and playing videogames keep me occupied until I can sleep again (I don't enjoy them much but at least I can pause or stop whenever I want to do something else or have to sleep). I don't enjoy food, just eat not to be hungry. I don't enjoy going anywhere and I only do it if I need to (like buying supplies). I don't enjoy sports, I only bike to transport myself. I don't have faith in society or people anymore. I don't feel like this world has anything to offer me, I've seen enough to know this is not my place. My mind is broken, I don't belong here, I don't have dreams or motivations, I don't expect anything to get better because it won't, I don't expect to find any meaning because there is not.
