It all started in the 4th gradeIt all started when my friends left me and I got bullied by them. The next year in the 5th grade new bullies showed up and I started getting depressed. In the 6th grade I only could cry. In the 7th I developed suicidal thoughts that same year the whole school laughed at me for crying in the cafeteria. In the 8th I started cutting and attempted suicide multiple times and I learned I was bisexual. That same year I thought I met "the one" but my friend asked her out first and lied to me about them being together after they broke up. My friend committed suicide and all I can think is I caused it. In the ninth I moved schools and new bullies appeared. I was put into classes I couldn't keep up in and I failed all my classes. That's when I started to cry during class and I would uncontrollably eat. Now I'm here hopeless, worthless, useless, and without someone who cares. I hope tonight is the night.
