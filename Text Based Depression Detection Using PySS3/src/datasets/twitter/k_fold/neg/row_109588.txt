I didn't want to be here when life was good and now it's all gone to sh*t!54 years old.  Depressed for 30+ years. Lost husband 7 years ago to cancer.  Lost dog 3 months ago to cancer.  Now lost job.  Looking back to when I was married, I was still depressed and didn't really want to be here but the reality is that during that period life was reasonably good.  There were times when I briefly enjoyed myself.  Now, I'm sat alone in a chair in a cold room (heating broken and don't want to spend the money to fix it), using alcohol to take the edge off the mental pain and pouring out my anguish to strangers on the internet.  

Never been one to make a lot of friends or socialize to any degree but that's ok, I enjoy my own company.  However, now there is nothing to make me want to go on.   Scared of the only option really available to me (overdose) as it has a very poor success rate and I really don't want to fail and end up in hospital which will take up the limited funds I have left (plus more probably).  

Have an appointment with my PCP tomorrow to discuss high blood pressure.  The reality is that it remains high because I haven't taken the prescribed medication for a couple of years.  Not that I will admit that of course.  Going off to google to find out what makes blood pressure higher....hopefully that will do the trick.
