Need adviceHello, I'd like to ask for advice if I should kill myself. My life goes worse and worse because i'm sick. I have urinal system problems and have to pee every like 30 minutes so life became literally unliveable. Also nobody helped- urologist, psychiatrist, psychologist... and nothing will... Maybe if I'd had some years to rest i'd heal or atleast get allowance, but my mom registred me to go to university this year and I know it would be impossible for me. Also other people doesn't understand how shit it is and think that's not a big problem. So my life become hell and I wanna end it. I'm done.
