What is a good logical point of living?What is the point of living?

Religion? Screw that, makes no sense. Living to serve a greater selfish being that created us to "worship him". He is almighty why does he play games? what is trying to prove to him self if he knows all by creating us? Nothing.

Relationships? Everyone lives to use others, no matter what you say. Everyone lookout for themselves only!. By looking good, by thinking they served a good deed for "god", By doing their "job". Lets say you meet someone random talk to them figure out they have a problem and solve it and never talk to them again. They will squeeze you, they will use you, they will keep you around to solve future problems.

What is the point of working for money to just live. because why live? what do you want from life. what will is the end result. Do you just live mindlessly ? following life expectations? Go to school, Go to college, get a job then what? what exactly did you accomplish from that.

I don't have a hard life. My life is probably the easiest in anyone's head? yet i dont want it. 

I graduated high school top 5. i had no enjoyment mostly all my life. I went to school to finish it and get it over with. 

I got a full ride scholarship to any university that would accept me and i get a monthly living salary of 3000~ by doing nothing. All that from the scholarship.

I don't base things off emotions, i base them off logic. I never get mad. I accept what happens because i dont see a reason to cry over spelt milk. I think about where to get the rag to clean the milk up.

I spent 2 months in a mental hospital. because they thought my way of thinking was wrong. I really want to know who decides what right and whats wrong. I did nothing to other people, yet they forced me to stay there. costed me 1000$ just for a 20min Ambulance ride which was not necessary. No one actually cared in the hospital they were just doing their "job". They are people paid to care.
They think i am all better now, because i acted that way.
I still cut my self just because i want to.

I look at people and see only idiots doing things without a purpose. doing things without reason. doing things for no good reason.
