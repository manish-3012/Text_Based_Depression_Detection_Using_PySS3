SpiralingIâ€™m so emotionally and mentally drained. Either itâ€™s focusing on school work or my phone. I have nothing in this world. I am so detached from reality and completely lonely. No one has ever wanted to me except for my family. I want to feel so bad but I have nothing. I would let anyone use me at this point. Being in the closet is so tiresome and I would do anything to be normal. I am growing to hate this world more and more. Thoughts of self harm havenâ€™t left me. I canâ€™t see my therapist for another week and half and I feel like such a joke. I didnâ€™t know life could feel this dreadful and solitary. I donâ€™t feel OK in my own skin. Just having really terrible thoughts.
