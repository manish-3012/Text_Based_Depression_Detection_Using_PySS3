Why bother?I am a teen mother. I constantly get called every name you can think of for getting pregnant so young. I can't go to church anymore because everyone won't stop saying rude things about me, and I can't take their judgmental glares anymore. I dropped out of college because I couldn't afford it and it was too hard being a single parent. I have a crappy job, and I currently live with my mom and am sleeping on her couch. She hates me and I know it's only a matter of time until she kicks me out. And then I will be on the street. And nobody will care. I have no one. Except my daughter. And I feel like having such a piece of shit for a mom is dragging her down. I really don't feel like being here anymore, and I don't see the point in anything.
