A failure at school and life.I'm too stupid to go to college. I'm not even meeting my highschool requirements to get into one in the first place. If I don't get into college then there's no point in living since every good job requires a degree. Not to mention my family will hate me and probably disown me. It be easier if I just jumped off a bridge and took the  burden off everyone's shoulders.
