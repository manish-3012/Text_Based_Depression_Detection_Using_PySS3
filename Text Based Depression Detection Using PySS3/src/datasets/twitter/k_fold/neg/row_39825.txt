Totally alone, completely contentThere's no one who cares if I'm here or not. I have no friends I talk to no one. I'm glad for that because I cant stand anyone. Once I'm gone it'll be a while before anyone knows. I looked for help from 5 different professionals all it did was give me less hope. But you can't say I didn't try.
