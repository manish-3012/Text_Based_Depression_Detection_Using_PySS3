Can't face failure againThrowaway, etc.. I'm in my final year of med school and have struggled with mental health issues for as long as I can remember. I've been to professionals, tried meds, tried therapy but it's the same pattern every time I get overwhelmed.

Right now I'm in the middle of final exams and have failed all the ones I've taken so far this year. I genuinely would rather die than go through this again for another year repeating and that's pretty much what I'm facing.

The university has been so unsupportive and I can't stand being around family members anymore because they keep pointing out my mood and asking me questions which I hate. I just want out, I can't stand this anymore, it's not worth it
