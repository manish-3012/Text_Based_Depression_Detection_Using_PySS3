This razor blade is my only friend.This depression wonâ€™t go away. I miss you so much and I just canâ€™t imagine a life without you in it. I wish I had a gun but would I be brave enough to pull the trigger. I wish someone else would do it for me. I canâ€™t handle these emotions anymore. I want to scream, why wonâ€™t anyone listen?
