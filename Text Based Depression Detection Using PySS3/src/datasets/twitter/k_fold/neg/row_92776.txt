The pressure is swamping me.I hate the unknown and uncertainties. I think that's why I'm feeling the way I am. I have my final year exams in the next few weeks and I just feel overwhelmed. I know it's stupid. But I want it to count. But, I feel like shit. Like I have this weight on my chest constantly. What does it matter? What does any of this matter? I keep swinging from anxiety about my future motivating me to going to bed all day and wishing I didn't exist. Is it really worth this toll? This too will pass, I tell myself. But what if it doesn't? How will I cope with failure if I fail? How will I find a job? Find a place to live? I hate the unknown. There's this constant tug nagging. Sometimes I wonder if it's all just caused by my stupid contraceptive implant. That if I rip it out it will go away. But even without it I'm left with this numb feeling. I don't want to go on like this. It's stupid, I know, but at the same time I want it to all go away. It would be a quick release. If don't snap out of it I'll fail. And then what? I just needed somewhere to put this. I know it's stupid.
