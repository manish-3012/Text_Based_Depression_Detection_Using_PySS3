to die or not to die, that is the questionI never knew that stabbing yourself could be so hard. My life was always driven by fear, and the only reason why I'm not dead yet is because I fear the unknown. 

I grew up in the church, and although I'm not too invested in my religion, I know that suicide is a strict taboo. So I always debated with the following questions:

Will God be mad at me? Will he forgive me? Am I still lovable? Can I still go to heaven?

I always knew that when I died, I would die by my own hand. I remember begging for God to take my life, and that if he doesn't, I'll take my own, and that he wouldn't have to punish me because I already know that it's wrong and because I'd punish myself by dying a purposefully, slow death.

But I never realized how much strength you really need. Like yeah, with no doubt, jumping and hanging is terrifying, but once you're over the ledge, it's pretty much over. Stabbing yourself requires a follow through until the end, it's an action with clear intent. The mental strain in and of itself is unbearable. It's an agonizingly slow process. 

So before I came to this realization, I sat at the foot of my bed, on my carpet, with the knife in my hands, facing towards my abdomen. I took my dog out of my room, wrote my final notes, threw away some junk, turned on some of my favorite music, and went ahead to do the deed.

But instead of going away as I'd planned, I just sat there for two hours with nothing more than a deep, dull pain, the knife barely punctured through the skin.

When I realized that it wasn't working, I automatically moved towards the door to hang myself, but that didn't work either.

I think the scariest part of it all was that I felt no regret, even after I snapped out of what I was doing.
