I am tired and just want to leave.I feel like I am on a voyage were I have failed to follow my course and am now drifting without supplies or desire to even continue. I know for a fact that if it were not for my family I would have killed myself a long time ago. I have always thought about it. Even when i was very little. There is just so much for myself inside me. I see everything I do as a failure. I always have. Now my failure seems to have become a burden on my family and I don't think I am strong enough to do anything about it. The only thing I can think of to do is to kill myself and set them free of me. I wish there was some way that ending my life would benefit them other than removing a burden. But I think at this point it is just about damage control instead of reparation. I hate the thought of them hurting. I also look around me and just see so much pain. Everyone seems to be hurting. I see the sadness that people have. The empty smiles they make me want to cry. Despite that I have not been able to cry in many years. In this subreddit I see others that are hurting and want to help. But I cannot even help myself. I don't know why I am here for sure. But I guess I wanted to say something. I have talked to people in my life about how I feel and they either don't seem to see it or I get scared and hide the extent of my desire to die.
