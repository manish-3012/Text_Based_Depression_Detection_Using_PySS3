There's so much stress on meI want to kill myself. I can't take it anymore. My problems are not solvable. I think I have a burn-out but nobody would take me seriously. I'm so stressed that yesterday I went crazy after a very exhausting day and cleaned until midnight, I was so convinced there were bugs somewhere in the room. i cannot live like this anymore. Everyone overlooks my feelings because others are morr important. It's so loud in my appartment that I cannot sleep, children above cry day and night. I cannot move out, i cannot afford that in the next year at least.
