I can't even work up the courage to ask for helpI'm 17 and I still live with my parents. For the past two years I've become more and more depressed. I don't like the very few friends that I have that I see on a regular basis. We just don't click on any level. The friends that I do have that I like live far outside the country and while I think of them of friends I don't feel they feel the same. Everyday is a fucking struggle. I manage with school but I just feel empty inside. I've been thinking more and more about killing myself. It'd be nice to not have to feel this way anymore and to just be free of all of this. But another half of me wants to seek help. However I know that if I want to get help I have to tell my parents. I'm worried about how they'll react. I'm pretty reclusive so they don't know much about me and the last thing I want them to see is the side of me struggling to find the will to live. I've thought about just going up to them and telling them I want to see a therapist but I chicken out right at the last second. I'm so pathetic I can't even get help.
