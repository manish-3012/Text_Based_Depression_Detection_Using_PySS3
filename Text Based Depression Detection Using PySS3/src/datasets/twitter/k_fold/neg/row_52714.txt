Approaching hopelessnessI don't feel like there's a place for me. I'm fucking weird. I can't make friends and I can't beat anxiety and I can't stop dissociating. I tried to see some people I'm kind of acquainted with recently but I got too nervous and derealized entirely. 

My mental health issues are really deeply ingrained and have existed since my early childhood. I don't think I can beat this.

Life is fucking horrible
