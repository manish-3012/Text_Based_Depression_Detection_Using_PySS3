I just want this pain to be over. I don't want to die, but it's looking like an easy way out20F here - I don't have the strength to reach out like I should. I know killing myself would ruin my family and destroy my girlfriend but it's feeling so tempting. At the very least I want to take enough medication to make me fall asleep for a long time. 

I don't know what to write and I don't know why I posted here. I know I should reach out but calling my girlfriend will wake her up, which is the same for my parents. I'm so sick of being like this, I just want to fucking be normal
