Too much of a good thingGoing to pick up as soon as dboy answers his phone. Getting enough heroin to hopefully nod forever. If my tolerance is higher than expected, well at least I'll be high today. I've been on this roller coaster for 10 years, and before then, well... Let's just say I wouldn't have bought the ticket if I felt there was any point to living other  riding this ride. On one hand I look read a lot of posts here and think wow... These problems are child's play. But on the other, I have medicine that makes life tolerable for a few more hours. Without the h I'd probably have done myself in sooner. If I were dealing with bland, banal normal problems. Either way fuck it all. I should be trying to put the fragments of my life back together. Instead I'll be banging a speedball in a couple hours, and til then contemplating how much I miss ketamine, and trying to remember the name of that GHB soaked tweaker that pimped out his sister who I used to buy ket from.

God this life ages you. I'm soon to be 28 and feel like I've lived 2 lives
