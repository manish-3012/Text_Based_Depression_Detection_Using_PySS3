Paranoid and stressedLately I have been so paranoid and stressed. Over the last few months I've gone out of my way to track down and delete most of my accounts and any content I posted online because I feel like I did and said so much immature shit on the internet. Recently I had actually felt liberated because I stopped using the internet so much and had avoided social media almost completely; however, last week a passing thought has made me more paranoid and stressed than ever. A few summers ago I used grindr to talk to people since I was curious. I didn't really anything on the app itself (other than realize that I wasn't gay) but I remember making a throwaway gmail account on an old phone. I never thought about it, but I'm scared that I synced all of my personal photos and other data to that google account (google prompts you when you sign in on your phone and has it enabled by default). I'm scared that I used the same password on the grindr account as the email and that eventually some data breach will lead to someone hacking the email and gaining access to extremely personal information (sensitive pictures of me and girlfriends, contacts that were on my phone, lots of stuff I believe I deleted, etc.). The idea of this stuff one day getting hacked makes me so paranoid. I hate how careless I and stupid I was. I hate how stupid this whole ordeal is. It could seriously ruin personal relationships and future employment. I may have ruined my future over being a curious idiot.
