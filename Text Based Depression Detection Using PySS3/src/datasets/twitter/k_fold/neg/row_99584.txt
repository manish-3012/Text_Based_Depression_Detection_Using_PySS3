Writing a noteAcetaminophen, If i take enough, it will be okay. i'm just waiting for the bank transfer to buy them.

I was never made for this world. I'm too sensitive and different. My soul cries and aches at every touch and blow. Just a piece aof paper with a bunch of scribbled thoughts about life on it, is my note. i'm tired. I don't understand why people think it's selfish. You are the selfish one making me feel guilty for desiring peace. I will join the countless other souls like me who were not fit for this. This place is too cruel and unforgiving. I cannot express all the thoughts and feelings I have, i love and love and love but never will BE loved. I just can't wait to say hi to all the others before me, i'll finally be able to meet others like me, those who couldn't fit in this realm. I died a few years after I was born. Realising I could never be happy with who I was, i will never be content with how I look, all I do is dissociate from this horrible existence. It's agonizing pain to not be born a woman. I guess that's not the only reason I'm going.

Fuck i'm being an attention seeking throwaway making this shtty post, taking time of your day, for a single ounce of pity, it's pretty pathetic. I just want to put these thoughts out there. No other way, since my family is horrible and I hate being near them. I could never relate to anyone. I'm just too different. Maybe someone will see this and understand, in the future, when it will be archived. 6 months? I just wish I was able to connect with someone else. Intimacy is non-existent for me.
