I can't liveNo, not metaphorically. I literally can't live life. I can barely buy some groceries. I can't do paperwork. I can't apply for a job. I don't even have the skills to do it, let alone the social skills. I am ugly, stupid and hate my voice. My memory is terrible. When I talk I cringe. I am emotionally numb and can't empathise with others anymore. Probably slowly turning into a psychopath. One month from now I will have final exams and I will fail them. My parents said that if I can't go into a university I should apply for a job. I can't do that. I always make mistakes, I need things explained to me like an intellectually challenged person or i will make a mistake. I can't make spontaneous decisions, someone has to tell me to do it.  I will literally die from starvation or kill myself before that. I know my parents won't do this to me but I will probably do this to myself when things escalate one month later.
