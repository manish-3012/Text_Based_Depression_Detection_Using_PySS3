My girlfriend needs help.My girlfriend has suffered from depression for much of her life. She had already attempted suicide once before I met her. She recovered, and since meeting her, I haven't had any reason to be alarmed. But lately she's gotten much worse. With a new year of school (she's only a junior in high school) comes social anxiety and stressing over grades. She's also become stressed with her new job that probably gives her too many hours(20-25 a week). On top of this, she hates her home life. Her parents are overbearing and mostly clueless about her depression. One of her greatest sources of stress is worrying about her future. Tonight, my girlfriend told me that "everything is so hard." She also said she's incredibly tired and wants to "sleep forever." 

I'm not proud to say I was no help when she told me these things. I don't know what to do. I've never had to handle any situation like this. Do I talk to her parents about it? Do I call a hotline? Please. I need advice.
