Help from reddit is my last optionI have given myself a time limit, 1/2 a year. I have managed by myself to cure my depression, so my only obstacle is motivation.

I am still a teenager and l refuse to allow my severe lack of motivation(usually for things that are boring or difficult in the slightest), to result in me being homeless, itâ€™s either l have a life(ie a job) or l dont.

I have determined throught weeks of sleepless thinking (basing off past and present experiences) that these are insufficient motivators:
1 Any kind of relationship.
2 Family (as what is left of them are knocking on deathâ€™s door).
3 My future past or present.
4 For the future of the world.
5 For any experience(s) that l might have.
6 To help others out of hard times (just makes me depressed again)

You may have noticed that friends is missing from the list above read the following if care to know why:
(this is because when l find a friend usually l put in too much effort leaving them to have to doing nothing which the friendship usually feels fake which l canâ€™t stand. Friends could be a motivator but until l find a friend that puts in as much as l do itâ€™s not an option.)

My list is set in stone and you are honestly wasting your time trying to convince me otherwise. but if you think you have thought of something else worth living for l am all ears.
