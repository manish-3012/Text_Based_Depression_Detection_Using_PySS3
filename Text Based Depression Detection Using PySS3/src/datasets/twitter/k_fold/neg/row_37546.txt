I have an overwhelming feeling of emptiness. I donâ€™t want to die, but I hate living and I feel as if suicide is the only way.I mean I feel absolutely nothing. Itâ€™s literally just despair. I canâ€™t make myself cry at sad things. Nothing excites me. I have nothing to look forward too? I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s normal, but I google quick and painless
Methods at least  twice a week. My parents wonâ€™t take me to a therapist as they think they can â€œpray it offâ€. Iâ€™m sorry as diagnosed with depression by a therapist in 7thh grade and they didnâ€™t believe. I am only fourteen, I donâ€™t have access to a therapist. I have access to something like Xanax. I just feel like this level is over and I kinda want to see what comes next I donâ€™t exactly want to die though. I guess Iâ€™m kind of offering this as a cry for help or whatever but Iâ€™m honestly over everything. And also nothingâ€™s wrong with my life, like itâ€™s amazing, and I have an overwhelming guilt for hating myself to the point I am. But yeah, I thought I was bluffing other times, but Iâ€™ll prolly carry through with it.
