Starting today I'm cutting everyone I can out of my life to make it easier on them when I end it.I've wanted to end it for so long but the one thing stopping me was my friends, I'm not private about my feelings, they know exactly what I'm going through so I know if I end it at least sons of them will feel they could've done more. They couldn't've, they've done everything they can for me but they don't know that. Starting today I'm not gonna be messaging people, checking messages or going out. Many of them are going to uni next month, when they're gone, I'll be gone as well, and hopefully they won't be hit as hard as if I did it now.
