Just want to stop existingIâ€™ve been through a lot, but recently the only person that â€œcaredâ€ about me which was my gf, broke up with me telling me that she had faked everything while she was with me and that she forced herself into our relationship, my aunt died recently, and I canâ€™t pay my student loans for a law degree that I donâ€™t want, I have to keep studying because my parents need me and the money from my work, everything just feels empty an pointless now, No friends or anything I can talk to. Iâ€™ve been feeling like this for so long that I think it will never change, does it ever? Why should I keep going if I feel miserable?
