HugsI am  married 30f and its almost 3am and I cant sleep. My depression is taking a toll my anxiety is making it worse and because my mother in law drank herself to death at 55 a month ago my support system (husband) has his own issues and has to be up in less than 2 hrs so he's not an option to vent too.

I need a hug. A real tight proves someone loves me and wants me on the wart hug. Hell the only reason I'm still here is I can't hurt my husband like that. I worry he'd follow me and unlike me he deserves his life on this earth. 

Ever had chronic pain, insomnia, an anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder all at once? Terrible combination. I am so messed up I am worries I'm going to lose my work from nbn home job! I work for fucking bayer I have a well paying job I do FROM HOME but sometimes I still can't being myself to even log into my computer!! 

Idfk what to do with myself. I know they're virtual but I need a good hug (and major physcolgical help I cant find in the midwest)
