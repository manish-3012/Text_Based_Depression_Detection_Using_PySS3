DoneDowned a bottle of liquor, tired of pretending like I'm ever going to find anyone to save me from myself. It's undisputable that no one cares about my existence, and everyone that says they do based of off a short synopsis of my life only do so for a short while because they feel pretentious enough to extend a hand out of pity thinking they're gonna save someones life. Don't bother.

I'm a good person at heart, I love everyone that has showed me love throughout my life and I try to be the best I can be towards others yet I find myself hating life and myself more than anything. I'm all alone, I don't understand anything, and you certainly do not either so don't give me advice because I've gotten enough of that. 

I just want to be happy, I now realize that,, fuck it who am i even talking to
