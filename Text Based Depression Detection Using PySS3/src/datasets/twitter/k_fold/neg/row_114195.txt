all i really want is someone to love meim not talking about a girlfriend in specific. even just a good friend or family member. i have nothing to love for right now and i have lost hope it will ever happen. i know feeling this way might be irrational but i just donâ€™t want to wait and see if â€˜things will get betterâ€™
