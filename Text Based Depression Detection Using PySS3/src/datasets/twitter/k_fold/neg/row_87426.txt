The night youâ€™re about to end - a poemYou hate yourself, 

 or donâ€™t love yourself enough, 

You stop and think because you know youâ€™re loved by so many others that you stop, yet again, because you donâ€™t want to hurt them,

Crumbling in the time thats been lived and unfortunately lost by the desire to be content,

The lust begins to fade,

And within time you then begin to love yourself the way you always should have been.
