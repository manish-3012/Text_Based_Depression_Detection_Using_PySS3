I want to dieI am stupid AF. I am always the most stupid person in the room. I am not going to be able to go to collage, I don't have any future, I don't have any friends, I don't have any talents or abilities. I am a waste of space and resources. I don't want to work in a shity job for the rest of my life. I feel traped. I think for a shity being like me death would be a act of mercy. I think everyone in my life would be alot better with my weight off their shoulders. The idea of sleeping forever seems very beautiful and comforting.

I am scared of death as all of us instinctively are but it feels like something that I need to overcome to end my and my family's suffering. When I end it all I will ask my family to donate my body as a cadaver. Becoming a cadaver feels like the only contribution that I can do to our society.
  
I want to hang myself. Sometimes when I am angry I just wrap a t-shirt around my neck and pull it as strong as I can, It is discomforting only for few seconds after that your head gets dizzy. I've got myself to the edge of passing out like that but I haven't been able to go any further.

I am so sorry for my shity english. It is not my native language and I am too stupid to learn it properly.
