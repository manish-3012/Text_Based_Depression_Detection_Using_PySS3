Whenever I lift myself up from depression, something comes along and pushes me back down. What's the point?It's dumb. I start feeling happy again and then something in life forces me to be depressed again. What's the point of trying to stay happy when it won't last? At the moment I'm not as suicidal as I've felt in the past, instead I'm stuck in some between stage of feeling ok and feeling horrible. Therapy isn't helping, antidepressants aren't helping, and my family is trash. Not because they're mean, but because they don't seem to care about me or anyone else in the family. We're all so emotionally distant. I don't have any friends to talk to either. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm seriously considering suicide by police, just to make this suffering end.
