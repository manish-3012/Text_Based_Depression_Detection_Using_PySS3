Iâ€™m laying in bed planning my suicide. Itâ€™s gotten so bad, and I have nothing to offer the worldIf I had a gun I probably wouldnâ€™t be alive right now. School, work, and relationships have gone to shit. I seem high functioning, but Iâ€™m losing all purpose to live on the inside. Everyone leaves and there seems to be no way to fix things. Iâ€™m a disappointment, and itâ€™s better if I just ended myself for everyone. But Iâ€™m probably too lazy to find a gun and type out all my scheduled emails for people after I die. How do I even buy a gun without a license?
