I hate myself so fucking muchTitle. I hate myself. Everytime I look at myself in mirrors or pictures I hate it. I insult everything about myself. I got nothin to live for, ya know. I just don't want to live. I want to get hit by a car and never know I died. Therapy doesn't help me. I can't talk to any of my friends about this. My family is no help. I lash out against my family because of my hatred. I'm so desperately alone. I don't know if I'll make it through college, even if I do I have a useless major. Usually I just hate myself but sometimes waves of depression hit me. I just want to be happy and complacent. I never asked to be born.
