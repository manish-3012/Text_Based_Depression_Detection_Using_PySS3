I donâ€™t want to be hereI just started my first year of college, and iâ€™m gonna fail out of two classes and I have no idea what to do. I tried to talk to my parents and all they said was that they didnâ€™t want me coming home and that i better not waste their money.  My girlfriend had been starting fights and has been really distant lately so i feel like my relationship is going to end, I feel so alone.  I donâ€™t want to disappoint anybody and I donâ€™t want to be a failure anymore
