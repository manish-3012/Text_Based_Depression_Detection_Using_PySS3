Finally told my friends how I feel about themI had a meltdown earlier over something I asked my ex-fiancee to do and she hasn't done. I wanted her to get my number deleted from her NHS records because I keep getting appointment confirmation texts off them. 

Anyway I blew up on Facebook about how I'm sick of getting ignored by everyone and how I'm sick of trying to open up about my problems, but constantly get shrugged off and how no one wants to know that I self-harm everyday. One my friends made a smarmy comment and I blew up on him.

Told him how he's part of the problem and that I can't reach out to people because they don't wanna know. I explained that I'm reaching out whenever I ask him or my other friends if they're coming on Xbox Live, but they normally say no and very rarely say yes, or they'll join other people instead of me. I reach out to them like that because it's the only way I can distract myself from all the bad shit going on in my head. When I'm playing a game with them I'm not cutting my fucking wrists. 

Anyway I've blocked them on Facebook, I'll ignore them on Xbox, I just won't bother with any of them anymore. I'm just gonna sit in my room by myself, because it's what I'm used to, and hopefully have the balls to make a cut deep enough that it kills me.
