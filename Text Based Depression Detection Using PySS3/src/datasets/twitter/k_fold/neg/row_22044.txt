Trying not to kill myself at 12pmBit of back story to explain why I feel like I do. 

Iâ€™m 25 years old, had numerous years of physical and mental abuse from pretty much everyone whoâ€™s supposed to love and support me. Itâ€™s left me with so much mental scarring and actual scars that Iâ€™m barely recognisable compared to my younger self. Recently Iâ€™ve tried and tried to be strong, but I just canâ€™t anyone more. I guess Iâ€™m just not as strong as I once was. Maybe loosing everything that made you happy does that to you. On the 22nd August 2019 I lost my family, girlfriend and my son. This was bad enough and I literally destroyed my arms with bits of glass, cried endlessly for weeks and then I was able to see my son again, things started looking up again and I managed to get another girlfriend on the 11th November 2019. This period was great I guess, I still felt depressed but not like this. I then was denied any sort of access to my son and my new girlfriend asked for space due to personal issues with our relationship. This happened on the 1st January 2020. Since then Iâ€™ve been unable to eat anything at all for 5 days and unable to sleep, Iâ€™ve cried endlessly and tried messaging the girl I was with to apologise and beg her for a second chance. Which meant she ended up blocking me. All the while she still maintains we are in a relationship. Yet it doesnâ€™t seem like that to me. Right now I just feel so down, so bad and regret everything. I already made up my mind this morning that I wanted to die. I just canâ€™t cope anymore with all the heartbreak and the endless pain I go through on a daily basis. I am just so sick and tired of it and I feel like death is the only option I have now. Like I canâ€™t do anything else!
