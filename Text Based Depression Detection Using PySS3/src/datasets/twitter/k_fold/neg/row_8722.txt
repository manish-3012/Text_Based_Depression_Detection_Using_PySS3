Help me find a post?A few months back, I read a thread, not sure which subreddit it was in, but one person posted a link to a prior post he made about how his family coped with someone in the family committing suicide. It explained how the bloodstain was still on the carpet after a good while, and how the mom just kind of mentally checked out. He decided to delete the post before I saw it, but google had a cache of it.

I'm wanting to show this post to a friend that's thrown around the idea for some time.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

(I had read the post before I made an account, so I couldn't upvote/save/etc)
