I'm 14. I need help.You might think I'm too young to understand anything or that I'm a overdramatic fuck for posting. But I need someone. I don't have too many good friends. I don't get sleep. My parents are in my business and yelling at me 90% of the time. I try but my grades are slipping and I just cant try anymore. Most of it is probably overthinking, but I'm just never happy anymore. Things and people that made me happy aren't there anymore. I've never really, truly seen "happiness". Even my family and few friends judge me for that. I'm just so alone and people hate me. I don't know why. I've never had a girlfriend yet alone a real first kiss. People tell me I'm just not a likeable person. I don't know what to do or why I'm even here. I contemplate suicide sometimes but haven't told anyone for fear of being judged. Mostly what really puts me down is being so alone and especially not getting sleep and being paranoid at night. I just need someone. I used to smoke pot but I got busted a month ago. I never used to get so sad when I would smoke. Troubles would be gone and not ever come back. But those days are gone. And everyone talks about how much fun they're having smoking but I can't anymore. It's tearing me apart.
