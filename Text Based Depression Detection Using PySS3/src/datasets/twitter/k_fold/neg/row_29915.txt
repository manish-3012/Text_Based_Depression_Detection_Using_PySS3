I'm having a really hard time right nowI went to pride and got punched in the face, had my wallet stolen and was called a fat fuck. Combine this with being abused by my landlord slash roommate, who I found out today has the ability to throw me out with no notice, I'm kind of stressed. Now add on to that fact that I'm on disability for severe depression and ptsd. I feel physically sick and I don't know what to do.
