Got close but I'm a cowardI stood on a motorway bridge less than 48 hours in the rain for a while, I smoked a bunch of weed and like a fucking dick I called someone and walked away and I think someone called the cops because after I walked away I heard a lot of sirens and activity around there. I seriously wish I had just fucking done it. All I do is bring everyone I love down. I'm such a fucking burden and it's just one thing after another. 

My emotions run wild and all I can't handle anything I overreact and make the worst out of everything and I'm so sick of hurting people and myself I just want to fucking die but even then I'm gonna be the bad guy for hurting people by simply dying. I can never do the right thing. 

I've take a shit load of diazepam and codeine and I still can't chill the fuck out I've done so many drugs that even they don't work anymore and I always wake up. I'm so done. I'm being held prisoner in this life.
