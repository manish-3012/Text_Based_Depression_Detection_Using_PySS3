Fuck ChristmasIâ€™m not looking forward to Christmas which sucks because it used to be my favorite holiday. Iâ€™m so sick of watching years pass and me not being where I want to be. Iâ€™m being forced back to college even though it was instrumental in my suicide attempt. 

December was when I met the love of my life who has since left me, since then I just canâ€™t get excited about anything to do with the holiday season. Worse I canâ€™t even mourn it with support because my parents donâ€™t know sheâ€™s trans (she identified as a boy 3 quarters of the time we were together, obviously I had no problem with her wanting to be her authentic self and loved her nonetheless) and theyâ€™re mega transphobes but I refuse to deadname her or use improper pronouns so I just canâ€™t even talk about how much I miss her and how everyday is a struggle without her. 

They also are major homophobes and being bi their comments hurt more than they think. Plus with the stupid pandemic we canâ€™t even do what we normally do which is visit my dads side who I love to visit. 

This season and day approaching hold no joy for me instead it holds dread. Everyday gets colder and I feel worse and worse. I am absolutely dreading having to put on a happy face for this stupid holiday and go around the table and talk about â€œHoW BlEsSeD I Amâ€ and all that shit. I just wanna be done. I wanna end it. 

I can not tell you how frustrating and utterly revolting the concept of pushing through and fight another year is to me 

I physically can not imagine wanting or desiring to live.

I keep fantasizing about my Christmas gift being finally able to end it all. Only problem is I canâ€™t do it or theyâ€™ll take it out on my ex who is going through enough shit as it is, and if thereâ€™s one thing I still care about itâ€™s her. 

I pray constantly that Iâ€™ll get run over, or die in my sleep, or something accidental will happen to me so they canâ€™t blame it on her, but Iâ€™ll still be dead. 

I just canâ€™t anymore
I donâ€™t want to fight another year I donâ€™t want to
