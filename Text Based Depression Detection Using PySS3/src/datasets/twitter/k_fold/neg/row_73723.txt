This climate is not for me. I'm done.Why did I visit Facebook today?  Maybe if I'd delayed it for a day or two then I wouldn't have laid eyes on that post I saw from a dear friend of mine and wouldn't feel my heart breaking in two.

She was more than a friend.  She mentored me, brought out the best in me as an individual, instilled values and a healthy work ethic.  Basically a second mother to me as I first met her at age nineteen while she was in her 30s. I even supported her son as well, whom has needs of his own.  

Then she goes and posts an article that...well...just upsets me so much.  Never thought she'd just endorse such an opinion.  Worse still, it's related to a polarizing topic so heated it has ended up costing relationships.  I'm afraid to even offer an opinion of my own.

I have nothing now.  Feel like an empty shell.  Might as well end it.  This world is no place for an anxiety prone, special needs shit like me.

See you all in the next life.
