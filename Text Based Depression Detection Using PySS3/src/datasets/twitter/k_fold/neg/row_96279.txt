I dont want to kms but I donâ€™t see the point of being aliveI am a 15 male and I truly dont see the point of me living. All I do is take up space and resources that other people need. I am not anyone special in any way. I get average grades, have an average house with an average family. I have no point in being alive I likely wonâ€™t ever contribute to society as a mediocre person with mediocre intelligence and mediocre talent in literally anything I do. The only people that would miss me is my family. The friends I have mostly keep me around for answers on hw and the make jokes at my expense. The crappy part of my life is my (sometimes) asshole dad. The hardest part is not being able to talk to anyone because my life doesnâ€™t sound that bad but it sucks. All I am is a mediocre person that is a waste of space
