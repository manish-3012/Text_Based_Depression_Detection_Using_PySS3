Alright here goes...I was in a 6 year relationship. 2 months ago, i found out she was cheating on me. With 3 other guys. I had bought her a ring. I was going to marry her. Also, she took over 1500 bucks, plus my ipad. fucked up thing is I still love her. Even after all of this shit, I'd still take her back.

I got laid off a few days ago, I'm going to move back in with my parents. I have to leave all my friends behind. The first real friends I've had in 4 years.

To top it all off, my Dr. says I might have pancreatic cancer. For fuck sakes, I need someone to talk to. I called 4 suscide hotlines, 2 of them put me on hold for way too long, one was a shitty connction, i counld not hear them. the last one, told me they were only for teenagers.

Can someone just fucking message me, or fucking call me, im at my end here.
