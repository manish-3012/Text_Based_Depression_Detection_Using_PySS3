fuck this shit.I'm on here because I'm so fuckin done. I have no one to talk to. My own husband  doesn't even wanna hear it. seems like he doesnt care whether I die or not. and frankly with each passing day, things just keep getting worse. the more I think about it, the more i come to terms with suicide. I hate everything and just can't imagine living through another 40 or 50 more years of this. I feel like all life really is, is endless suffering. when people say "its not the solution" thats bs. doing it would solve a lifetime of problems.
