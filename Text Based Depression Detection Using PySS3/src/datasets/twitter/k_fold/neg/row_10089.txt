SuicideWatching my ex, need supportSo I told her it was over and it was a shock for her.  A large part of it was me not talking to her, so she very little clue that this was going to happen.  She had a history of depression and attempt suicide 14 years ago but nothing since.

We made a plan about how she would get her life back together, because she was incredibly dependent on me.  However, unbeknownst to me she took pills and alcohol while I was sleeping on the couch and now she's in short-term mental health ward.

Now her 72-hour mental health hold is expiring and they are declaring her fit to return to her apartment.  She is still broken and I feel sure she will try something else on Friday when she gets out.

I hate her so much.  I started this because I couldnt handle being shackled to her, and now I am chained to her even more strongly because my conscience wont allow me to stand by while someone dies.  I cant bring myself to do that.

She has no one else .  I cracked because of the pressurw of being provider, confidante, chauffeur, accountant for her all these years and now even though I want to leave I cant.

TL:DR Suicidal ex returns home in 48h and I am worried she will try again.  How does one come to moral terms with keeping someone alive that wants to die ?  Where do you find the strength ?
