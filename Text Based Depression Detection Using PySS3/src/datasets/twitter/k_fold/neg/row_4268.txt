I don't think I'll do it, I just need to talk.I'm 19. It's my first summer back home from university. My household is broken. My parents live with my mom's mom and husband because we lost our house when I was in 8th grade. I've been dealing with being homeless since then, but it could be worse.

Now that I'm back home, I no longer have a job. I've been trying and trying, and despite being the best there was in the much larger store in a big city, no one seems to want to hire me. I need a job to not only support myself, but also my mom. 

I'm in debt. I'm losing hope. I'm starting to think that things would be so much easier if I just... wasn't. No one would have to support me. And it's not like I'm going to contribute to society... I'm a writer who can't even write because I'm so depressed. 

I have bipolar disorder and severe anxiety. I know this is just a standard "low", but I feel so alone right now. I'm not the kind of person who can cry in front of others, when friends ask me what's wrong I always laugh it off. But I'm hurting. I'm hurting and I'm broken and I'm tired of being alone. I just need someone to talk to.
