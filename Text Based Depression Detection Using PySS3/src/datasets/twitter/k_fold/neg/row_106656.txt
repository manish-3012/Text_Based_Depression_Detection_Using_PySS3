It's time.It's time. Time to leave this earth as I cannot face the hardships , be it day to day ones or the ones which span through a person's lifetime. 

I ama a 29 year old man who has no career, no future, no base to stand on. Why should I live? 
My mom, dad tell me that my existence is enough for them. 

But really, is it. Even if I stay under their care for the whole life, how does it help? If I have no career, where will the money to sustain oneself , come from?
No,really, shouldn't I just end my misery and in turn, stop being a lifelong burden on them.

Hell, I am a daily pain or thorn to , even the people who I just interact in passing. 

To that end, I feel this is it for me. After writing this, I feel, this post will also be no use, just like me. Instead it will be a burden on you, dear readers. I even think that I do not even deserve to write this post.

So, yeah, bye folks. Its time for me. Do not fuck up like I did please.
