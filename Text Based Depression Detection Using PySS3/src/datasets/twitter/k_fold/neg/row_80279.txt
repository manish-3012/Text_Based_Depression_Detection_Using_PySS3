Going to the hospital?Does it make sense to check yourself in? Does it only delay the inevitable? Do they keep you for a  long period of time? Is it really expensive? I just donâ€™t know where else to turn, or what to do, or where to go because I donâ€™t want to burden the ones I love with the aftermath of my decision that they donâ€™t deserve. I canâ€™t sleep it off anymore, and I canâ€™t think about anything else.
