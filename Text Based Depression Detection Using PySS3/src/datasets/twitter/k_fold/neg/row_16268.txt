I don't know how to deal with life anymoreI'm a young adult.
Zero genuine friends.
No girlfriend.
About to be out of yet another job.

Yeah, things are going really fucking bad for me right now. The only thing holding me back from going out is my ridiculously loving parents. I had to tell them that I may need to drive myself to the emergency room few days ago. I couldn't take the stress I was experiencing at my job. One person has spread some nasty comments about me throughout the workplace. Everybody looks at me like at some monster. Even my own manager. I can not take this hate any more. But it's like, every job I think I've ever held has ended in similar fashion. I've lived with social anxiety from ptsd from the age of 10. I've missed out on experiencing my own adolescent days. I feel zero hate towards others, but I feel hated by even the people who haven't spoken a word to me before in this life. I cannot move forward being treated like this. The only reason why I'm still alive and trying to rebuild my life is because of my parents. They are my everything, as sad as this may sound. They deserve a better son. I have nobody else. I'm a yound adult for God's sake. I keep trying to get out there, make new friends, but it's like I get shut down way before saying a single word. I understand that I may have low social intelligence and social skills - I get it. I don't know what else to do. I don't treat the people who are like that like shit, why must I be treated like nothing? I feel like going away and ending myself. I only don't want my mother and father to cry for me. I wish I could be replaced.
