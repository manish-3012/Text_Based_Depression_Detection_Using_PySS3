I'm going to do it when the time is right.I haven't already because i don't want my friends and family to be hit hard by it. I just need to find a way to make it seem accidental so they'll just think i
Died by chance rather than my own hand. I've thought about walking in front of a car or having a semi t-bone me but what if I don't die? And it isn't right for me to put that on the other person. I don't like who I've become. I work full time and take classes. I'm 21 and carry a 4.0. I pay all my own bills and scrape by. I can't get much for loans because my dad makes bank but only supports my step brother. My mom would help me if she could but money is tight for her as well. I've had minor depression for about 5 years but the past 3 are the icing on the cake. Years of hard work have done nothing but put me in debt and stress me out. I'm ready for the end and I welcome it. I'm 21 and hope I don't see 22.
