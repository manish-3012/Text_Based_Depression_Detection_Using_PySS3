There is no point to my lifeI have 0 friends, my family despises me because I'm a burden, I'm unemployed, I have no postsecondary education, I'm beyond the point of loneliness but I can't do anything about it because of how paralyzed I am by anxiety, panic and depression. I haven't spoken in days and I've had several panic attacks per day all week. I can't remember the last time I did something fun, or had a close friend. Fun doesn't exist in my life. I wake up, wait for the day to be done and when it's finished, I feel no relief.

I'm 20, this is supposed to be the prime of my life. Therapy and medication hasn't helped. Nothing helps. 

I'm literally just wasting away in my own pitiful misery, wasting space on this earth. I'm ready to be done. I don't know why I'm bothering to post on here, no one gives a fuck, and two people commenting and telling me it will "get better" is sure as hell not going to change my mind.

I have nothing. I have nothing to lose. I have no one who will miss me. This is  the end.
