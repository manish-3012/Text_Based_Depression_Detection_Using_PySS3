I don't know what to doI'm currently in my second year of college, but I can't motivate myself to go to class or socialize with anyone. I only leave my apartment when I need to go out or when I go to band practice, which is one of the few things I enjoy doing. I've started to feel like I can't hold on much longer. I smoke weed on occasion and drink very rarely, but I've thought about trying to find drugs like xanax and Valium to make myself feel something. Recently I've started to think about suicide and how it would help me get away from everything. I don't have any emotions except being sad and angry. Today someone walked in front of my car when I was driving and as he kept walking and flipped me off I could only think about how I wished I had actually hit him. People don't follow through with plans with me anymore, I am failing all of my classes and I can't do anything right. It's seems like everything will be better if I just end things. No more worries. No more thinking about my problems or how I'm a mess. Just me alone, not being a burden anymore. For a few weeks now I've felt like I have depression, but I don't know what to do about it. I'm never happy and haven't been happy since I came to college. I feel like an empty shell. Nothing inside except these horrible feelings of pain.
