I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreJust how the title says I (f15) donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Itâ€™s to the point where I feel unloved and tired. Iâ€™m tired of the people that are supposed to be there for me not being there. I am tired of getting played like a fool because of my childhood issues. 

I am tired of being who I am. My depression doesnâ€™t steam from my insecurities. I know Iâ€™m not ugly and I know that Iâ€™m healthy in my own eyes. But no matter how pretty I am or how good I look the people who I want to be beside me arenâ€™t there. And Iâ€™m not just talking about some boy or some friend. Both of my parents arenâ€™t there for me emotionally. My depression started in the 6th grade and escalated until 8th when I had a breakdown and I cut myself. My friends found out and made me promise not to do it again. My mom found out and said that if I do it again sheâ€™ll send me to a mental asylum. 

There was no â€œwhatâ€™s wrong?â€ Or â€œwhy you feel that way?â€ 

And now Iâ€™m in my room with a handful of pill in hand wondering if I should swallow them. Me looking down at them now shows how easy it would be to just end it. The only thing stopping me is that Iâ€™m religious and Iâ€™m afraid that the peace Iâ€™m looking for wonâ€™t come to me. Iâ€™m afraid of going to hell but I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. 

The other thing that is stopping me is that I want my death to be painless. I went from not wanting to live but hoping that a reason will come to me to now I donâ€™t want to live and death feels like the only thing I could do. 

I went on a suicide hotline text earlier but they had a waiting list of 8 people so now Iâ€™m here. The last bit of hope that maybe there is something for me here and maybe I could find it here.
