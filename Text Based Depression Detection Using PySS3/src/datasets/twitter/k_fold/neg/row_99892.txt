I don't want to wake up anymoreI don't know how long I can continue to feel this way. Everyday has become a struggle and the only sanctuary I can find is when I am asleep. I am so lonely, I have very few friends let alone anyone I can talk to about how I feel. The only person I had to talk to was my ex but I rarely talk to her now. I've turned to drinking too, just so that I can numb the pain but even that has its limits. My antidepressants don't seem to be working either. I'm just so tired of feeling like this. I am so tired of feeling worthless, hating myself and just being alive. I feel guilty just thinking about ending my life because of how people react when they hear about suicide. How it's a selfish act but I am hurting so much inside that I just want it all to stop.
