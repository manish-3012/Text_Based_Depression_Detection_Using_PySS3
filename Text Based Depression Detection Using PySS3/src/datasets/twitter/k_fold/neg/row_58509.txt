I want to kill myself for a dumb reasonI bought a bunch of castor seeds. Because I just want to experience death. Idk why. Like I am legitimately curious. So Iâ€™m going to make some bean burritos for myself in an hour. I want to just experience it. Heh. Maybe quantum suicide theory is true. Iâ€™ll just be here talking to you guys tomorrow if it goes bad. Well love you all. Donâ€™t do what I did.
