Never really wanted to die, never felt this bad though either.I've been struggling for a while like I've had suicidal thoughts but never wanted to kill myself but it has got worse the way I'm feeling the situation im in. I'm on antidepressants but they haven't started working yet. It's got to the point where I have two separate plans one to hang and I even went walking and found the spot, the other is to OD and I have gotten some pretty strong prescription opiates in my hands now all that's left is one really bad day and fuck me there's been a few recently and the storms aren't over. I used to think if I tried to kill myself I might get some help that I need that people might realise there's a lot more going on in my head than I let out but never wanted to die. Now I know no one would even realise until I didn't show for work.
