I always said, â€œI never understand why people commit suicide. If youâ€™re that unhappy just walk awayâ€ I am open to feedback and itâ€™d be appreciated. Because Iâ€™m out of options and the probability is increasing.Then I get trapped into multiple situations, that I see no escape. So, taking my own life has preoccupied my mind, for about a month now. I try, maybe not like a person who isnâ€™t suffering, but really try to find a ray of hope. I read part of a book that said why not live in misery instead. So, I tried that, but thatâ€™s more depressing. Now, Iâ€™ve become more comfortable with killing myself. Iâ€™ve also realized itâ€™s 100% my choice, I do have that option. No one can stop me unless Iâ€™m not serious, Iâ€™ve reached out, got help, complicated my life more by doing that. Iâ€™m not going to say my plan, because I have one, and itâ€™ll work. I couldnâ€™t handle being a vegetable.
