I really fucked up this timeI told my only two friends I was going to kill myself today, but I didn't go through with it. Then I just texted my one friend and he got pissed off because I worried him. This isn't the first time either. I don't know what to fucking do. My mind just keeps going to the noose. I think I'm finally going to break. I can't lose them, they're all I have. I'm a fuck up.
