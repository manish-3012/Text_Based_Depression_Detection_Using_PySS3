Everyday the sameThey bully me, call me a crazy drug addict, I just smoke medical marijuana, Iâ€™m not some strung out meth Beth somewhere, Iâ€™m trying to cope with my crazy freakin childhood. They even smoke weed, fucking hypocrites, now I feel like dying, they donâ€™t even like it when I smoke with them I get attitude and abuse then they tell me itâ€™s all my fault. Like what did I do to you, your so controlling and Iâ€™m the crazy fucking addict. 
If I donâ€™t do what they say theyâ€™ll just take me to the mental hospital, I get thrown through the ringer, they donâ€™t give a fuck, my brother pushed me around at work then called me delusional said I made the whole thing up and said I need to take more medicine, like who does that, having me think Iâ€™m going crazy, donâ€™t hit me, then he air punches me in the head today out of anger. My little brother tells me that he wants to hit me too, so I tell him to do it, if that would make him happier, I just wish my life would end, Fuck these people already, they call themselves my family, thatâ€™s a joke.
