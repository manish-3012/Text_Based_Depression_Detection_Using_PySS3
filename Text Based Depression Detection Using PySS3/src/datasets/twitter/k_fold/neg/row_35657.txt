alone this weekendim alone until tomorrow night at home and i had a breakdown last night and cut my hair and bit my nails (something i stopped doing years ago) and thought heavily about killing myself
the smallest bit of logic i had left told me to call the suicide hotline but they were busy and i collapsed on the floor and woke up later

today my best friend was supposed to come over after i told her what happened and she just canceled i dont know whats wrong with me this sounds so fucking pathetic but i still want to die and i dont know what to do nobody would find me for at least 24 hours
