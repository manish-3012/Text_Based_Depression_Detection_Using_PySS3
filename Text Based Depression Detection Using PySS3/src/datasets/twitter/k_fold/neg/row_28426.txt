I canâ€™t go onI donâ€™t know, my life seems pointless, same routine everyday. Wake up, get yelled at, go to school, come home, get yelled at, go to sleep. I canâ€™t do it anymore. My best isnâ€™t good enough. If you try in school itâ€™s easy they said. 

I feel like my life is on repeat. I just canâ€™t go on. Iâ€™m laying in bed crying cause they never understand. I try talk to them only to be dismissed. They only want me to go good so they look good.  I feel like they expect so much but are endlessly disappointed. Iâ€™m a disappointment. I canâ€™t remember the last day I wasnâ€™t yelled at. It is never enough, it will never be enough. 

I am lost...
