Ruined my life, have 2 months to make things right, or else everything ends.I don't know what to do anymore. I have 2 months to make things right between my boyfriend and I and if not then we're going to kill ourselves. 

I want to die so bad but I do not want him to die. I'm only living to try to make things right and I keep fucking up. 

I just got out of psych a couple weeks ago for another suicide attempt. I ruined everything, I ruined my life, I ruined myself, I ruined my boyfriend. 

I just feel like the clock is running out and I'm panicking.
