Nostalgia makes me want to die(English isnâ€™t my first language so Iâ€™m sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes)
I know everyone experiences nostalgia and I know nostalgia makes you feel sad, but I canâ€™t look at an old picture or go into a part of my town I used to live in or listen to old music without hating myself and wanting to end it all. This probably sounds ridiculous but I always think about how happy I used to be when I was a younger and then I look at how sad I am today and I get depressed and suicidal. I don't know if it's puberty (I'm a female in my early teens) or what and I do have mental health issues and I'm seeing a therapist regularly but nothing seems to help and the only thing that keeps me here is my fear of death and two people extremely close to me. I want to die but I'm so scared of dying
