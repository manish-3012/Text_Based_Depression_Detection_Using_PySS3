15th Of February will be my last day "alive"Planning on killing myself on 15th of February (My birthday) which happens to be a day after Valentine's day , I'm not really holding on to the world , everything is fucked up , my life is fucked up , my parents are fucked up , everyone is just telling me "they can't handle it , so , you must handle it" and I can't handle everything , I'm fed up of this , who's supposed to be dealing with who , this isn't how it's supposed to be , plus , this isn't how it's supposed to end but hell i have no choice , I'd love to thank the internet , GOT , Mr. Robot , Rick and Morty , Sherlock , Batman , Deadoool , Breaking Bad , Tokyo Ghoul and mainly thank Reddit for postponing my death this long , Ain't nobody gonna miss me , Nobody prayed for me , Peace out. 
P.s: this is not for attention , I don't really care about this , this is a new account anyway
