tiredi donâ€™t really know what to say. iâ€™m just tired of living. iâ€™m tired of feeling so alone. like i know i have people there for me, but i canâ€™t help but feel alone and empty. iâ€™ve tried killing myself multiple times, including once tonight. i wanna die but i want to live for my best friend. not myself. i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s next though.
