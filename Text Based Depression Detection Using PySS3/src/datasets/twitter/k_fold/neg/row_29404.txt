I'm 24. I'm in the middle of a divorce from the love of my life and it's all my fault.
To make a long story short, I lost it all. Wife, home, family, money, you name it. Everything but my job, which is one of the central causes of the divorce. 

I want to die, not because I have a shitty life now, but because it's been this way. I've dealt with depression since I was about 10. Had a nervous breakdown in July, when I got served divorce papers. It's debilitating to the point that I can't work without a podcast in my ear. Without the distraction, I meltdown. 

I have no friends. And when I say that I truly mean it. I have plenty of people that I work with that people would call "friends", but I have no one. My family is great, very loving, but they're the pull up your boot strap type so they aren't really any help in this situation. 

I have a loose plan set. Gonna go out like Robin. Belt in the door style. I have guns, but don't want to be another statistic for the democrats, so I'll stick to other tools. Have a note written to her, but I don't know if I'll go with it. 

This morning I called a crisis hotline and it wasn't helpful at all. I messaged her on Facebook and she read my pleas for help but didn't even respond. I'm thinking of leaving a note that just says "I wish you would have replied".
