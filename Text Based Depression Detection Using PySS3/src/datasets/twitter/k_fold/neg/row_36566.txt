Should I continue?My life to put it shortly is a living hell and the only reason I continue is becasue I don't want my best friend to be sad,he's the best person I ever met and he doesn't deserve to go trough this sadness.
I rarely feel happiness, I'm fat, bi but I know a few homophobic people, people are always making fun of me while I just try to go about my day, I always feel like I bother people
There's more but I don't want to tell more I really think I should end it all
