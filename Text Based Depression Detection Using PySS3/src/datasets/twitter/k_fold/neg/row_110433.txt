dad hates me, want to diei do some repetitive things a lot of the time - like i eat the same breakfast, prepare it in the same way, run most days in the morning etc

my dad hates it, it drives him mad, and he doesnt seem to like me anymore. i live with my parents, have no job, keep applying for things but keep getting turned down. i have applied for funding to a phd but i know im not going to get it. i dont know what to do with myself.

sometimes i think i should take myself out the picture
