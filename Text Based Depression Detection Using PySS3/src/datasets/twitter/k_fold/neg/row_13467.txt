Physical symptoms keeping a break on my life. I don't see a way out.I'm 24 year old male. 2 years ago I started having Irritable Bowel Syndrome with constipation and stomach pains. Could not find anything wrong. Actually nothing helped (diet, medication, nothing). Then I developed prostatitis symptoms (pain in lower abdomen, perineum) for which i took Cipro which didn't help. These physical symptoms make me not able to enjoy life as I feel discomfort all the time. Also I became depressed and anxious. I fucked up my college in the last year and still haven't finished it for which my parents are mad and think it's all in my head. Also I quit my job to be able to finish my studies easier, but I still can not.

The biggest problem is, after taking the Cipro I started having even bigger anxiety, and then I read horror stories on the internet about how Cipro can damage GABA receptors in the brain and cause long lasting anxiety. Because of the anxiety (or maybe not) I developed constant heavy head feeling, drowsiness, feeling like drunk all the time.

Right now I'm on a summer job in Germany and these head symptoms are really affecting my performance for which I was told indirectly by my boss. This job pressure is making me really anxious and worried that I will not be able to work good the next day because of my mental fogginess and heavy eyes. My boss already decreased my weekly hours for which I feel anxious about him firing me.

This sucks really. I see everyone working while whistling and singing and I am struggling with simple tasks because of my anxiety causing heavy head problems. It sucks that I want to live but I am held back by some unexplicable symptoms.

I've done bloodwork and everything, everything is fine. I really loose the will to live.

And to make things worse, tha anxiety/depression (or the prostatitis) is making me have  zero feelings during ejaculation. No orgasm, only ejaculation. So I can't even enjoy tha basic human pleasures.

Life is stupid
