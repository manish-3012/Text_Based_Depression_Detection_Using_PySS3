things are getting worse.growing up, I've always been considered a happy child. My smile would brighten up any room and people loved me. I had my imperfections, being diagnosed with ADHD by the time I was 5 years old, but even then, nothing would effect my happy mood. Or so I thought. 

Once 3rd grade hit, I began to get bullied by everyone. Adults, my peers, shit even the little kids bullied me. It was tragic. As their words started to really get to me, I began feeling sad. Not sad like I would get over it the next day, the sad where I had nobody I could talk to or express my feelings to. As I got older, the sadness only got worse leading into my depressive state which I did not know would effect me to this day. 

A lot has happened to make my depression worse. I lost both of my grandparents, whom I was extremely close with, my parent's verbal, mental, and emotional abuse has gotten worse (I didn't realize until recently I've been somewhat abused), and I've lost so many friends. I finished out community college with my Associates degree and transfered to a bigger university where I still struggled but somehow made it through. But things got worse. 

Last semester, my mental health had gotten the best of me. I've skipped class to sleep and cry because I've felt so shitty to the point where I also started failing classes, especially the one I'm supposed to be majoring in. As a result, my parents forced me to stay home to "watch over me while I'm going through my depression" which is a complete lie. 

I'm nearing the end of the semester and I'm doing good grade wise. Everyday is a literal struggle. I wake up at 6:15am, go to school all day, call my boyfriend to complain about my day, get in the car to go home, get complained to and about on my way home, do homework and then fall asleep at an abnormal hour feeling like the biggest shit in the world. This continuous schedule has made me loathe being home. I tell them, "I wish I could live at school" and they give me a weird stare and say, "What? I'd rather be at my house!" Which makes me seethe. It makes my stomach hurt. It makes me upset.

Things have gotten worse. My mood has decreased, my suicidal thoughts have increased, and my will to die has sky rocketed. I have therapists on campus and I'm about to get them involved with me moving out and relocating to a safer space. 

But as for now, I'll continue to cry. I'll continue to wish death upon myself. I'll continue to take Wellbutrin and Bupoprion and hope that I somehow overdose so I don't have deal with my shitty life anymore. 

As Mindless Self Indulgence said in It Gets Worse:

Because it doesn't get better, unless you're pretty
It doesn't get better, unless you've got money
It doesn't get better, so just give up
It never gets better, no
It gets worse
 
I don't expect anyone to really read this or anything honestlyâ€¦i just thought I'd get my feelings out.

I'm sorryâ€¦
