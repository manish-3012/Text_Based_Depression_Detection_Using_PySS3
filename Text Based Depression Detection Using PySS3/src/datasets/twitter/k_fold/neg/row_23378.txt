Conflicted about getting helpI finally told someone about how much Iâ€™m struggling. They said theyâ€™ll take me to the hospital if I want, and Iâ€™m conflicted. I want to fall in love with life again, but Iâ€™m also just so tired. I have no drive or will to try to make anything better â€” Iâ€™m in massive amounts of debt, Iâ€™m alone in most aspects of my life, and Iâ€™m more of a drain on society than anything else. 

I have a plan, if I decide to go through with it. If I donâ€™t, I have 0 plan of how to go on. Iâ€™m tired, and anxiety is a constant pit in my chest. I just want it all to stop. I have BPD too, so Iâ€™ll always just end up being toxic and maybe even abusive if I go on. 

I have 12 hours to decide. I donâ€™t really have anything to live for outside of being completely terrified of death. 

Has anyone else made this decision one way or another?
