lol, both my parents have colon cancer. I'm done.My mom was diagnosed 6 years ago with advanced cancer and is in the late stages now, probably going to pass this year. My dad had bloody stool this past weekend and is anemic, and in the ER to be seen, but I already know what it is.

Just fuck it. I'm out. I've heard enough "I'm praying for you" and "God doesn't give you more than you can handle" and similar horseshit for one lifetime. I'm done. This is all bullshit and we're all just waiting for the next catastrophe to happen. 

Peace!
