Full of regretsSo, I contacted my one and only friend last night before I planned on overdosing. The one time I fully expected them to ignore me like usual they actually decide to respond. They came over and I gave them everything I planned on taking and now I am just remorseful about the whole situation. I should have just taken the pills and not worried about them. They have never been there for me in the past when I needed them, why should I have given a shit about them now?

I guess Iâ€™ll just start stocking up again and plan on trying again next weekend.
