I don't think I can handle another break up and I will most likely end my life if it happens this timeMy boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) have been together for three months and I thought (until now) that our relationship was the best I'd had and that I had finally met someone suited to me.

He was acting weird last night and wanted to be alone/wasn't talking to me, then this morning he said he was upset we weren't speaking much (and a lot more but I don't want to rant). I asked him if he was doubting us, he said yes, and said whilst he still loves me and wants to still be with me, he doesn't know if it will work. When I said how much that hurt he said "I said I don't know if it will work, not that it won't"...as if it makes a difference.

I don't think he realises how much these comments have upset me. He wants me to go over later and for us to go out for food and play a sex game. How can I act as if everything is normal after that?!

I have borderline personality disorder, depression and anxiety. I have been suicidal with attempts for six months now, including being signed off work. My boyfriend has generally been supportive of this, but I worry that my extreme sensitivity to irrelevant comments has caused him to get these doubts.

I feel like a break up is on the horizon. Not from me, but from him. How can a relationship work if one person doesn't think it will?
I am posting mainly because I am really worried about my mental health. For the first time I have been blunt with my parents about the fact that I can straight up not deal with another break up. It will end me. I can hardly tell my boyfriend that though can I? No-one should have that sort of pressure. I don't know what to do. I know if we break up I will end my life as I can't deal with the pain on top of everything else. What do I do?

Please help me. I'm scared.
