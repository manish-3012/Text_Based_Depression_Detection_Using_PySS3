How legal is expressing suicidal thoughts?I've have severe depression my whole life, starting displaying suicidal tendencies around 11 or 12. Overdosed on heroin at 14 intentionally but was brought back with narcan. Anyway, I'll just say, I had a really tough upbringing, abuse, neglect, foster homes, terrible drug addictions, everything you can think of.

Anyway, I am still very suicidal and I do intend on following through at some point. Likely Christmas. I don't have family, my girlfriend left me less than a week ago and she was the only thing holding me together which wasn't fair for her. I'm happy she got away from my toxicity because I love her and want better for her, but I can't stop my thoughts. Not from medication, therapy, anything. I want to die. It's all I want.

But when I was 16, I told my sister that I was going to do it. Ended up have the police show up ( I was also on crutches from a car accident, couldn't walk), they forcefully grabbed me by my hair and dragged me out of the apartment, brought me to a hospital with a crisis counselor, declared me as bipolar and schizophrenic and forced me to stay in a mental rehab facility which just pumped me full of drugs until I agreed I wouldn't kill myself.

I digress, but since I'm 29 now, is this something I can even legally talk about? Like if I told someone, they call the police and I admit I said it, can they detain me like they did when I was a minor?
