My death by hibachi is almost readyHi guys, 2/3 hours and I will go to sleep in my set-up tent with two barbecues lightened up , let's hope carbon monoxide will do the job. I don't even know why I'm writing here, I'm too much of a mess and failure. Maybe I just want to wish you a nice life, bye. Stefan
