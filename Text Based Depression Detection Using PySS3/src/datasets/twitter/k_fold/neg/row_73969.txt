Why I'm killing myselfBecause I hate myself! I'm regretful for all of my choices :( I'm in pain..I can't think clearly, I don't want help because HELP doesn't WORK!!! I asked God to help me so many times, more than I can count, more than you can count! There is 0 hope for me. I'm tired and I'm ready to give up!
