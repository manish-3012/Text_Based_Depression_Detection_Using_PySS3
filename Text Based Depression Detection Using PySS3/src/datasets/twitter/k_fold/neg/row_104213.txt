My boyfriend fucking hates me and my life is falling apartI know that sounds so fucking trivial with what is going on. 
"oh no! Your boyfriend hates you! Suck it up you little bitch,  people are dying!" And like the reality is, I should suck it up. Like my issues with my life are such a tiny blip in this sea of bullshit that's going on. 

We're looking down the barrel of a recession. My mom owns a small business and we will most likely suffer the consequences. We barely made it out of 2008 alive. We are lucky enough to be semi-OK now, but in a few months it will really start hitting hard. I was young-ish, but I remember 2008 being so incredibly hellish. I am so fucking terrified to live through it again. 

My mom and I have never had a good realtionship, but now we're stick at home 24/7 together. It's a toxic environment. I try to stay out of the way and out of sight to keep the screaming and the yelling to a minimum. 

I haven't seen my boyfriend in over 2 months because of quarantine. He's mentally checked out. He's peaced  the fuck out at the 2 week mark. I have such a bad case of whiplash. He went from so incredibly kind and loving to cold and uncaring. 3 years of a an awesome relationship gone and reversed in 2 weeks. He was my biggest support. He is my best friend. I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me on some cruel trick. He's a different person. There is nearly tangible wall of animosity towards me. 

I've been trying to carry our relationship to the finish line by myself. I keep thinking that if we can make it to the end of quarantine, then we'll be OK. I know he's mentally checked out because of stress, and I've been doing everything in my power to carry on. But goddamn, I need to be supported too. A voice in my head tells me I should be lucky he is still even with me. I feel like such a worthless fucking human, and I should be greatful for whatever attention he throws my way. I should just shut my mouth and take it because I don't really deserve the whole 9 yards anyways. I feel like this is some kind of cosmic punishment for being a shitty person. I don't know what exactly makes me a shitty person, but I just feel it in my bones that I am. That I'm pathetic. 

I've been trying to reach out to friends to keep busy. To keep preoccupied. They're all dealing with their own personal shit  storms at home. I just want to have a conversation or play a game or watch a movie on Netflix party. I don't want to feel so isolated.

I feel like there is this giant gaping hole in my chest. Or like I am drowning and everytime I scream for help I just end up swallowing more water.
