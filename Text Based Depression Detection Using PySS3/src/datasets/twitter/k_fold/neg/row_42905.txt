Silently dyingIâ€™ve struggled with mental illnesses my whole life. Lately itâ€™s just been hard. I hate waking up in the morning. I hate knowing Iâ€™ve survived another day in this hellhole. I hate that I made it through the night. I dread waking up every single day because I never know what mood Iâ€™ll be in or what someone says that could potentially set me off. Iâ€™ve lost my passion for life. I hate living. My family knows I struggle but they donâ€™t care. Theyâ€™re so quick to think the worst of me but when someone else needs help, they go running to them. Why the fuck couldnâ€™t they do that for me? Iâ€™ve been very suicidal lately. I casually mention it all the time but no one fucking cares. If I died, the truth is, no one would really miss me, but everyone will be crying &amp; acting dramatic as fuck at my funeral like they loved me so much. Iâ€™m slowly dying!! FUCKING DROWNING IN MY OWN EMOTIONS. Iâ€™m tired of crying out for help. I just want this to be done. Iâ€™m fucking tired.
