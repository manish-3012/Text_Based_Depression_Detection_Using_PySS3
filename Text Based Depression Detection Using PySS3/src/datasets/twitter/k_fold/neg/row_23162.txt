Is fighting worth it anymore?Today is a rough day for me. My SA is in full swing with both auditory and visual hallucinations. And my suicidal thoughts and tendancies are sneaking up on me. I can feel them coming, I can hear them in my head. My family would be better off, they could find someone normal and not damaged like I am. They wouldn't have to take care of me anymore, they could have a normal life, like I pray that I could give to them. But I can't, I just can't. It isn't possible. I'm not sure fighting is worth it anymore. I am putting them through this, and if I just do it, they can be free. I want them to be free. They deserve it.
