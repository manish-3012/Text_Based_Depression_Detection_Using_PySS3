Building up Motivation for attempt 2Maybe someone may know that a few days ago I did my first proper attempt at suicide. It however failed. 
Having not gotten help mainly because it is too late, I'm not attempting suicide on a whim here, and my adventures interested getting help for my mental health has gotten me nowhere.

Tangent aside I am upgrading my knot to something that won't come undone and changing my order of operations so that I fix the rope in place before I relax myself in a short partial suspension (seated).

Man this sucks, I want to live, I might even have an awesome girl as a girlfriend but my future prospects in Uni has been forever ruined.

And no, to my parents uni is everything, I don't want negativity anymore, I do not want to live with them as a "failure". I just want this pain, panic and uncertainty to actually end eventually, and it has been more than fucking obvious that I can't do it and the thousands I spent on mental health didn't either.

I guess ama before I go, Ill take an hour or so to build up enough courage to do it
