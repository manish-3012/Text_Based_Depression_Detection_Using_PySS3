There's no point and it's not true that it gets betterThe antidepressants have not helped with my urge to self-harm or kill myself.

Maybe the person I cared about the most shouldn't have cheated on me, been emotionally abusive to me, or done things to me without my consent. 

Maybe he could have tried to be supportive about me coming out, instead of telling me that was a reciprocal reaction to bring raped.

Maybe that guy shouldn't have raped me, just because I was too drunk to do anything except say no, which should have been enough.

I have honestly tried my best. But I don't really think I can try a lot harder. I am so anxious all the time. I can't sleep through the night. I hurt. I hate myself.
