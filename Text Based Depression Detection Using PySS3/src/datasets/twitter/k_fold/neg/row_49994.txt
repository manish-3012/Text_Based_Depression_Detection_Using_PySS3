I promised myself to live until 40 (or later), at least after mom and dad leaves .23F. 

I've had these thoughts since I was 14 . ( Quietly fighting Intrusive OCD thoughts and trying to appear normal in school previously, and now at work. )

Don't suicide. Think about those by your side. Suicide may be an end to your pain but these people left behind have no way out. 

Continue living, and try hard to find a reason to continue doing so.
