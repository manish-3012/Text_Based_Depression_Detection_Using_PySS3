Iâ€™m fucking doing it, thereâ€™s literally no point in livingIâ€™m so fucking ugly, I genuinely look like a freak. Thereâ€™s no way to be happy if you hate how you look. And I canâ€™t change that either, itâ€™s not something you can change, like hair, or skin, or teeth. My bone structure is fucked up, like itâ€™s an actual joke that a face can be that messed up. 2.8 million years of evolution for a fucking face like that? You serious? Itâ€™s a sick joke. I canâ€™t be happy when I despise what I see in the mirror.
