I think it's time for me to goTo be honest I'm not sure why I'm posting here. Maybe it'll make me feel better to get this off my chest. I really don't know. 

The only reason why I've made it this far is for my mom. I don't want to hurt her. But i don't think that will be enough anymore. 

I'm tired of the self loathing and depression. I'm tired of trying hard to love myself and enjoy life. 
I really don't want to die, I just wish I was happy. The pain is too much to keep going. 
I'm a 20 year old guy, I should be having the time of my life. Instead I'm just here in pain. 

Anyways, I already have everything planned. I just need the courage to go through with it.
