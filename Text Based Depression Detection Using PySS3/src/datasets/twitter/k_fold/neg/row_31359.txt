Could really use someone to talk to, I've been planning it for a while and I think tonight would be a good night...I have no one to talk to, either on Facebook, text, etc. and even my local suicide crisis line hung up on me.. I have a long-ish story, but I'd prefer if someone could message me, it'd be really comforting talking to another human before leaving...
