i think i should be hereI put this in r/depression but maybe it goes here instead..

I am scared of myself. I am hallucinating and I'm scared of what is happening. Please can someone talk to me and help me anchor into reality. I have been depressed my whole life and it never gets better. I don't have anything to offer or look forward to or be proud of. I hate myself, I know people say that a lot but I really do. I'm just very afraid and alone and depressed. I've tried everything (meds, therapy, psychiatrists, books, websites, food, exercise) nothing works except getting wasted and that's only until I wake up again. I don't know how it would ever get better. I used to be optimistic but now it's become impossible. Every day all I can do to get through it is take enough meds that I'm just crying a lot but don't do anything about it but I'm daring myself to just end it more and more every day. I really don't know how much longer I can last.

my brain has always been wrong for my whole life and made me see things and made me sad and I am weird and different and I don't belong anywhere. A lot people have hurt me in very,very bad ways and made me weaker. and weaker and I have been trapped under rock bottom for years now. I have been through a lot of sad things that are hard for me to say and would be hard for you to read. I feel like I'm living a nightmare. My future right now is also very, very bleak. I honestly don't think I can face it.
