i feel so stressedi feel so alone surrounded by so many people. i feel like i am just so incredibly insufficient and all my hard work will go to waste. i feel unable to manage all my stress and anxiety, which leads to me not being able to enjoy my day even after ive done lots of work. i am not sure if ill ever be able to do anything correctly. i just want to break down and cry, but that would just waste time. i feel like im constantly wasting time. i have such a hard time focusing. i just cant get myself to be doing my best anymore now. i do everything just to get by. i feel like i live for everyone around me and their feelings. i dont feel good.
