How to stop therapy?Iâ€™ve been seeing a therapist for a little over a year now, but I think itâ€™s time to end. It usually takes six months for people to hate me for being too open about my real self, so weâ€™re well past that point. I exhaust her, and she hates me for continuously falling back into old habits. And Iâ€™m just mostly done with being open to people at all.

Anyway, she knows Iâ€™m suicidal, so itâ€™s probably not best to just stop going. What would be the best way to end our sessions?

And no, Iâ€™m not going to find another therapist.
