what should i write in my suicide note?i've been living with depression and illness for a very long time, and i'm planning to kill myself soon. (and no, i don't want to be talked out of it; i've been set on this for a long time. i don't want to get into details of why i'm doing this, but i can tell you that i've made this choice after very long deliberation, i have too little to live for that is not greatly outweighed by the pain of my illness and my life circumstances, and that i'm as at peace with it as i think i can be. honestly, ever since making the decision, i feel very calm and relieved; i really am looking forward to it.)

the only thing is that i know it will hurt my family. even though we're distant, i still love them and i do regret the pain that my suicide will cause them --- wanting to spare them that pain has been the thin thread, the ONLY thread, that's kept me here this long. but my own pain has finally tipped the balance.

still, i would like to minimize this as much as possible in the note i leave behind for them, to let them know that this isn't their fault in any way and that i don't want to hurt them. it will anyway, i know that, and i hate that, but what can i say that will minimize that as much as possible and give them whatever comfort i can? if there's anyone reading this who's had a loved one kill themselves, is there anything they said in their notes (if they left one) that made the difference to you, or anything you wish they said?

thanks for listening.
