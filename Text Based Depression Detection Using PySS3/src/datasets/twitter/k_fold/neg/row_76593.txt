Its my 18th birthday today.Hurray im an adult. Great. I feel no different. Oh well. I had a good night with 2 friends last night. It was nice. I came home passed out and woke up. I dont think anyone actually remembered. No friends or family or just anyone. Id just like some birthday wishes is all. Just to feel a bit normal. Thankyou.
