I almost did itThis happened a few months ago and it still lingers now. My teacher suddenly dies from cancer and I was devastated.  At first I just denied that it actually happened and that sheâ€™s fine to numb out the pain. The pain just kept coming though. I couldnâ€™t get it to stop. I didnâ€™t talk to anyone about anything. I just sat there and cried. At school I couldnâ€™t stand to go in her classroom. I would always end up breaking down and not going in. All the crying also caused me some extremely painful headaches as well so it doubled the pain even more. Not even a few days after she passed I refused to attend school.  I couldnâ€™t sleep at all and I couldnâ€™t bare all this pain. I went to my momâ€™s medicine cabinet and grabbed a couple bottles. I was walking to the bathroom when I looked up and saw a picture. It was a picture of me and my family all smiling. I just stood there staring at it. I put down the bottles and I remembered thereâ€™s people who would hurt like me if I was gone. I didnâ€™t want anyone to ever feel the pain I was going though. I decided that I didnâ€™t wanna go through with it. I put back the bottles and cried myself to sleep that night. I didnâ€™t know what I truly had until I saw it right in front of me. Also Iâ€™ve been talking with someone about this and Iâ€™ve been getting to feeling better. Remember thereâ€™s always things to live for.
