I'm so alone and I can't handle it anymorei'm a freshman in college. in high school i had a group of friends but they were mostly guys, so in college i wanted to find a group of girls i could be a part of and do all the girly things i've been missing out on. i am friendly with the girls on my floor but i've always just felt like the odd one out. it doesn't help that i have incredible social anxiety and i need a lot of alone time. they've stopped inviting me out and i don't think i'm welcome to live with them next year. more than anything i just want to be a part of a group. i want to be accepted. i rushed a professional co-ed fraternity but they didn't want me. i'm 19 and it feels like i'm just destined to always be left out and alone. the only person i'm truly comfortable with is my boyfriend but i know he's sick of dealing with me. all he does now is tell me to see a counselor. i've been to therapy before but i didn't like it and i don't see how boring someone with my life could help. at this point all i do is lie in bed and cry and fantasize about ceasing to exist. i just feel trapped. i want to be liked but at the same time being around other people is just so exhausting and i never feel like i can be myself. i don't know. i just don't see it getting any better.
