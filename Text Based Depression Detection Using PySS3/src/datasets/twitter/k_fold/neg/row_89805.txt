I want to escapeI transferred jobs for the love of my life. 
I did not like day one of my transferred job and left 4hrs early, i am suppose to go in tonight but i really donâ€™t want to. I want to quit.
I had a full time job and a place to exist but I transferred to a part time job so i could be with him, i love him but i am not happy with my job.. i want to pursue my dream job but for some reason i feel so useless. I want to escape...
I make a lot of money doing fuck all, with benefits and a pension but fuck i canâ€™t give two shits. Everyone is telling me stay because its easy money but they donâ€™t understand i need a job to feel like i am accomplishing something. 
I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since very young...  and right now i just want to drink this whole bottle of wine and swallow a whole bottle of Tylenol.
Will it work?
