Can someone send a comforting message to my friend whoâ€™s considering suicide? CheesyMacaroni85Hey guys. I wasnâ€™t really sure about where I can post this, so Iâ€™m placing my bet on here. I have a friend whose been considering taking his own life. I know him personally, but his Reddit name is CheesyMacaroni85. We go to the same school and weâ€™re close friends. All I want is a few of you nice Redditors to PM him a few messages to make him feel happier about himself and that can help him make the decision to carry on living. Suicide is by far the last thing I would have ever wanted him to do. 
We talked in person today and he told me how he was feeling. Reddit and other social media platforms have been screwing with his life and he also has a few problems happening in his real life. One being how he had once injured his leg in a rugby game. This wouldnâ€™t let him go on most of the sports-related school trips (we had a week long Rugby Tour to South Africa). Im very aware that he was heartbroken and annoyed when he realised how long his leg would take to heal. He couldnâ€™t even join us on the trip. They were quite fun, but I personally missed him a lot. Heâ€™s one of my close friends, but not many other people in our school like him that much. Heâ€™s a good-hearted guy deep down. And I know that heâ€™s had some sick relatives for a while. As well as his other personal issues this is one that I am highly aware it is influencing him into doing such extreme things. I can empathise with him well, and I fully understand why he feels this way. So just take a few minutes out of your time to send him some nice messages. Try and persuade him to keep enjoying his life. I would not like him to decide to kill himself and Iâ€™m doing everything in my power to help prevent it.
