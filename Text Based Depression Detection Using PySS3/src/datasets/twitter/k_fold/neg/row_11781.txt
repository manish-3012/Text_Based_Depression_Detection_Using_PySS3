I have no future so whatâ€™s the pointI am in this stupid magnet program that my mom forced/s me to be in where I literally have to take ap and honors maths (where math is my least favorite subject and the one where I do the worse in. I literally have never passed a high school math course with about an 80. I love English but the magnet program is literally the opposite of that.

I have a trash gpa of a 3.8 weighted, so Iâ€™ll never get into the colleges my friends are going to and I refuse to go to community college for many reasons. And I am a junior so I basically have no hope.

So whatâ€™s the point Iâ€™m miserable every single day I got about 30 Tylenol ready to take. Iâ€™ll never be anything more than a disappointment, I am never good enough. If I wasnâ€™t such a pussy I wouldâ€™ve been ended things
