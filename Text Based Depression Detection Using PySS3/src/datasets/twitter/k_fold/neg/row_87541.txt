I donâ€™t know how to continue livingI have bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety. Everyday for the past 6-7 years has been a struggle, and I have been hospitalized twice, once for suicidal thoughts and once for an almost successful suicide attempt. I am medicated, although I donâ€™t know how well itâ€™s working. Today, after my mom had been clean for over a year, she showed up at my house and passed out in my drive way with her car running. She is very obviously back on drugs and it has sent me into a spiral. I donâ€™t know what I wanted to accomplish by posting this? I have no one in real life who cares or even talks to me, besides my husband. Iâ€™m pretty sure the only reason Iâ€™m still alive at this moment is because I couldnâ€™t bare to leave my dog behind not knowing what would happen to him. I guess I just needed to tell someone this, anyone who may be out there. Thanks for listening..
