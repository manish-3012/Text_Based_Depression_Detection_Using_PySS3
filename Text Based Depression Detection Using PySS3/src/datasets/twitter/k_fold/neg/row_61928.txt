I just had my first suicide thoughts. Really detrimental to my head.My exGF just called me earlier and told me that she doesn't want to get back with me and blocked of off all social media. I tried to apply at her job and get a position because that's what she wanted me to do while we were dating. She blew up at my face and says she doesn't wanna see me anymore. 
As I was driving back home, I wanted to drive off the cliff and figured she wouldn't even care if I got back home safe. I really just want to go away. If I can't even keep a girl happy then what's the purpose. That's all I ever wanted to do. She was my first girlfriend.
