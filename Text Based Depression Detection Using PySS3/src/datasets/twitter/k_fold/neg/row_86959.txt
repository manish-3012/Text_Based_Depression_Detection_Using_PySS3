i don't care anymorei only care about other people's situations, not my own. idc that i have a 2.4 gpa. idc that my mom is possibly mentally abusive and manipulative. idc about the reason i have ptsd. idc that i go to bed and tears threaten to fall. i don't care if i cut too deep. idc

but secretly... i care a hell of a lot..

i'm so tired.. so fucking tired.. i'm exhausted and im tired of being the parent of my siblings...

im so tired... someone please.. just hold me and tell me it's going to be alright.. let me get drunk so i can just jam out to music and drink and never sleep..please..

i can't tell my gf how i'm feeling right now because she just ranted to me about her ptsd and how bad it is today...

idk i just.. im so tired..

i wish that something would happen to me so i could die without actually doing it myself..
