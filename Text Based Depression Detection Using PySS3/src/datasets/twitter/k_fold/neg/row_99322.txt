I think I sexually assaulted my ex and I donâ€™t want to go on anymoreI dated someone a few years ago and we had sex fairly regularly. When we would have sex i would always wear a condom and she took the pill. Usually when we would have sex we would fool around for a bit and then I would get up to put a condom on. One time when we were fooling around for whatever reason I looked at her and began to put it in, everything seemed fine so I continued (having sex without a condom) after a short bit of time I got up to put the condom on and we finished having sex as usual, everything seeming normal. I asked about it afterwards and she said she didnâ€™t know I wasnâ€™t wearing one. She was quiet after saying that, I asked if she was okay and she said she was having flashbacks. I knew I fucked up. I should have simply said something rather than assuming we were on the same page. This whole thing is pretty fuzzy in my memory now but we basically talked about it a little bit and went to sleep. Afterwards things were seemingly fine, I never did anything like that again and we dated for another several months.

After we broke up we stayed friends for about a half year though I eventually stopped talking to her (this largely had to do with me getting into another relationship and sort of just feeling weird with our post-relationship friendship, it felt right at the time). She also left the school we were both going to so I havenâ€™t seen her at all since.

I always acknowledged what I did as a fuck up as a result of me being stupid and thinking we were on the same page, but for the last year or so it has been something thatâ€™s eaten at me. I keep going over it in my head and feel that it was a deep crossing of boundaries without proper communication, that it was assault. I should have just said something in the moment. I have aspergers and can have really stupid moments regarding communication but that is no excuse.

I donâ€™t know how she feels about what happened today or if sheâ€™s okay. It feels wrong to reach out now, or that it would really just be me seeking some sort of validation that Iâ€™m not as bad as I think I am. I really am struggling with this though, I donâ€™t want to go on with the fact that I did this. Even if things seemed normal between us afterwards it very clearly upset her at the time and that alone fucks me up. I donâ€™t feel like going on as someone who did this, it was essentially stealthing. I think about it and I want to hurt myself and not be alive anymore
