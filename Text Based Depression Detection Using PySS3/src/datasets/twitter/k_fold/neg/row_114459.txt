no idea what to doback again because i have no friends or people who care about me in my life haha. ive been so suicidal all day and i dont know what to do i feel like no one cares about me. its completely unfair to be like this but when my friend was suicidal and stayed in bed all day all my friends (including me) were instantly on it and we all went to go help her and we went out and bought her food and her boyfriend was helping and her parents drove out to go help her and everytime iâ€™m suicidal its like everyone looks the other way. i know its wrong and unfair to compare my shit to hers but we have the same friends and not only did none of them even try to help me no one has even checked in on me. and my partner checked in on me but when i told him how suicidal i was all he said was â€œiâ€™m sorryâ€ and its making me so fucking intensely upset like i dont know what to do i feel like everyone just wants me dead and doesnt take me seriously and i dont know what to do i cant stop hitting and cutting and scratching myself and i want to kill myself but im so scared of dying that i dont know what to do im so tired of being alove why cant i just die. i dont know how to die and i cant get help and im gonna lose all my friends and my partner and fail all my classes and i dont know what to do and im so depressed im crying to reddit and i dont even use reddit haha Wow i dont know what to do
