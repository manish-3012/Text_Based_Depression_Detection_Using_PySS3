I am uglyLet me preface this by saying I know it is pathetic and it just reflects upon how weak of a person I am, but: I want to kill myself because I am ugly.

It may surprise you that the reasoning behind this does not have to do with dating(though in a way, it does). I am not a KV(kissless virgin) as some people on 4chan an other sites like that call themselves.

The reasoning behind it is that the way I look is completely at odds with the way I feel inside. Inside I feel like a masculine man, a strong leader, stern yet compassionate, dedicated and diligent to hard work, learning and growing, and caring for my fellow human beings.
But what I look like does not reflect upon this. If you want a depiction of what I look like, google Ichabod from the cartoon "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" . Enormous nose coupled with tiny jaw. I look like a rodent. Any physical depiction that looks like me could be considered lowly and sub-human in fables and such. I cannot look in the mirror without utter disgust.
My physical appearance results in me not having respect from others. I am often bullied wherever I spend a lot of time with others, such as work and school (I am 25 btw). The rodent skull I possess could never find itself in the role of the passionate manly leader I feel I am inside. It causes me incredible heavy insecurity, further distancing me from my true nature. Every time I look in the mirror, my heart sinks deeper and deeper. Rodents are to be exterminated. For the further evolution of the human race by selective breeding to be successful, I know I must never procreate, and furthermore I don't wish to continue my existence as a sub)human, always looked upon with disgust, justifiably, by those who are true to the judgments of their instincts.

As for how, I do not wish to die violently or mutilate myself, so I will be looking into suffocation and starvation for starters.
