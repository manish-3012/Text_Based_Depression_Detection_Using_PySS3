I will not ruin anything ever againIm 35, white straight american, that alone is deserving to kill myself. I just got married and ruined my honeymoon with my wife because of my anger, depression, and anxiety. I am so broken there is no fixing it, and no matter how hurt she may be when Im gone, its better than what I have done and can offer moving forward. She is my only family, the only person that loves me, and im ruining it by being a stupid piece of shit. I think when we get home, I might just check out permanently.
