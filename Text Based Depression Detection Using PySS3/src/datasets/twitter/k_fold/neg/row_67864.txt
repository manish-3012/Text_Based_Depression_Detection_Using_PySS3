Does anyone else fantasize about living a different lifeI know this sounds weird, but i constantly fantasize about living a different life. I imagine my 2nd life being being attractive, loved by others, having friends, A curvy nice body, Not suffering from depression/anxiety, No self harm scars, Not being awkward, Being rich (or at least financially stable), being young again, Being intelligent, Traveling the world, and being some insta famous privileged white girl with millions of followers.  Instead my life is the complete opposite of that which is why day dream about living that life 24/7, I know it's an unhealthy habit. 

I even thought about killing myself in the hopes I'd get a 2nd life to start over. I know that sounds dumb, but when you're at a point in ur life where u completely give up and are sick to death of living those are the kind of thoughts that run through ur mind. I honestly hope and pray I die soon from natural causes so I can finally be free of this pain. 

No one is going to read this post but I just had to get this off my chest.
