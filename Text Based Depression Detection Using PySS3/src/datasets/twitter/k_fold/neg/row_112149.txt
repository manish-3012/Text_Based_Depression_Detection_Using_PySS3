Not feeling like dying but wanting the peace.I don't want to die but I feel like death would be peaceful. I just want so much to be able to lie there and listen to the quiet. Also get the respect I deserve because no on is disrespectful when you are dead. I just feel so disrespected and everything is a depressing hell hole in my life. The only reason I enjoy life is /u/Symmetry888 because she makes me happy. Has anyone else felt like this? Not wanting to die but also wanting the peace that comes from it.
