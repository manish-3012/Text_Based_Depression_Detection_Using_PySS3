There's a bridge on my walk home. I'm afraid I'll jump off it.I got dropped off to go to a movie (alone). It's over, but there's a large highway bridge on my route home. I don't think I can make it over. I was dumb and posted a cry for help on Facebook but the only person who commented was an estranged aunt asking about the weather. I have a phobia of talking on the phone so I can't call anyone. I'm too poor for a cab. I'm not safe to be alone but my SO is at work (where my texting bugs him) and everyone I know is out of town. I'm uninsured so not even some psych ward would want me.

ETA: I got home, after some guy at a gas station tried to get me into his car. Apparently rape is scarier than the bridge. Also, I forgot my fish needed to be fed. I'm still really, really depressed, but my betta has his food at least. I wonder if fish can feel emotions or if he'd miss me...
