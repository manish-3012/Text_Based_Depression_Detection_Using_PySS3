Iâ€™m ready to plan my suicide.Imagine being chronically ill, that is slowly killing you. Imagine being a active person in their young 20s, to being sick in and out of hospitals now in a wheelchair.
Imagine dislocating 50 times A DAY. Thatâ€™s the tip of the iceberg pain wise. Like youâ€™re being ripped apart and crushed all at the same time.
Iâ€™m done. Things keep happening. Things KEEP happening.
My only fears- what if thereâ€™s nothing after death. Just black.
Leaving my family and friends. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone but after so many illnesses and diagnosed with PTSD 4 times yeah things tip me to my breaking point.
Iâ€™ve tried staying strong. I want to believe in God; I donâ€™t want it to be nothing.
Tomorrow I will do my makeup for the last time. Tomorrow Iâ€™ll say goodbye to my parents and grandpa...
Tomorrow Iâ€™ll give them one last good memory with me. Iâ€™ll leave court documents for my mom to take over my lawsuit against a company who caused a major car accident resulting in me being airlifted.
Iâ€™ll call my friends and siblings.
Iâ€™ll finish the hard drive to send in against the man who groomed and took me from my family in 2011, which my body is still damaged from and mind forever. 
Iâ€™ll write out notes my mother is now taking these people on civil and criminal courts.
Tonight Iâ€™ll type out my will.
Saturday night Iâ€™ll overdose somewhere my loved ones wonâ€™t see to associate with me dying.
Iâ€™m done.. Iâ€™m just done...
Thereâ€™s only one wish is my family will be okay. That itâ€™s not just black. That something â€” something is real. I want to watch over my loved ones.
I donâ€™t want to die. I wanted to live. My life is not living.
I want to smell flowers. Hike again... Dance again. I want to go to the Gorge... I wanted to live so bad and help people but I canâ€™t do this anymore... I just canâ€™t.
