I've done all of this to myself.This is obviously a throwaway account. I don't want my friends to worry about me.


  Well, I guess I'll start by saying that all of my happiness has been nobody's fault but my own. I ended things with my girlfriend of over two years because I thought we would be going separate ways when we graduated. However, there are still six months or so left in the year, and it kills me to see her every day. This is the third time that we've broken up; this time it was me doing the leaving. Now that it has happened I have realized that it was a huge mistake. I love her and now I've lost her for good. No, there's no chance of fixing things with her, she absolutely despises me. I feel like such a fuck up.


  On top of that, well before that even, I've just been a generally unhappy person. Not in an outward way, but I've just felt unhappy for a very long time. I think that I've just pushed myself over the edge.


  I'm not an incredibly smart person, so I don't have that to fall back on. I'm not athletic, attractive, or any of those things. I'm quite less than average at almost everything I do. This makes me feel like I am going nowhere in life... I am going nowhere in life. And really, what's the point?


  I've broken my own heart, and now I have nothing to fall back on.
