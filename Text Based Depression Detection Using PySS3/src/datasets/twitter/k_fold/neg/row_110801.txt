I give upI think that life is sort of an exercise in futility. I don't really see a point in continuing it at all. I'm not who or what I want to be and becoming that is nearly impossible. The worst part is I don't actually want to die. I want to see what happens. But no matter when I decide to go, i'm going to miss things anyway.
