I need guidance and helpFor the past 5-6 years I've felt like a failure. I attempted to Serve a mission for the LDS church but came home due to Severe Panic Attacks, I tried to work when i got home, but was so emotionally/physically exhausted I would get fired from those jobs because of my "laziness and lack of work." Not being able to work, getting fired, and having these things repeated have really brought down my self esteem. Being put on tons of different medications that alter my cognition and make me feel different has been awful also. I feel behind in school, work, and life in general, I am 25 years old and I know I am young but all my friends are making good money, are married/in fulfilling relationships, and I am making 12 dollars an hour with 0 post high school education. I am behind, I feel like everyday is an uphill battle.. and to be honest I am sad as hell.. to the point to where suicide sounds like a nicer option than just repeating this hell that I am going through. Anyone have any thoughts on this? Also, whenever I try to bring this up to my family, a lot of them are religious and say "Pray more, keep your covenants you've made with God, etc." It's hard to talk to them... except my mom who's awesome. Anyways, I feel so behind, and that I can never catch up or get ahead in life... what do I? I feel micromanaged at work also (this is a huge trigger for me)
