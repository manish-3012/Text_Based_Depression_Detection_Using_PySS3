i cannot stay, they will not let me goas i've stated before, i have no desire to continue living. i have no goals, no reward and no light at the end of the tunnel. frankly speaking i am a leech on society. my brain is too defective to work properly, and i am incapable of having fun. i feel nothing but doubt and regret, even after success. but most of the time i sabotage myself so i am inevitably doomed to fail. i have very bad habits and cannot be bothered to take care of myself. i have no intention of changing, either, because i do not want to live. the world would genuinely be better off if i didn't exist. people in my life would have more time, more money, and less stress. logically it all makes sense, and yet i still cannot die. the people in my life cannot fathom these feelings. they say that they understand wanting to  die on bad days, but i have expressed many times that my suicidal ideation is permanent. it has been this way for about a decade, now. i am sick. people who are physically ill are allowed to have a peaceful exit, but for some reason we have made the decision to separate the brain from the rest of the body. yes, my ailment is technically physical, because my brain is damaged. and yet, because the insane narcissists in my life don't care about me despite claiming that they do, i am forced to live here. they don't want me here because they want me to enjoy life, they are here because they are afraid of guilt. they are afraid that they will have one less person on this earth to use or project onto or live through vicariously. i never asked for this life, so please let me end it before i waste anyone else's time and resources.
