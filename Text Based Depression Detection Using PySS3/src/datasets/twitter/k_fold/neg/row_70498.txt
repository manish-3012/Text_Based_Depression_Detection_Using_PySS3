Trying to be positiveIn a lot of ways I am a worthless failure of a person but I am also a kind person. I have never shown kindness solely with the expectation or on the condition of having it reciprocated. I do not withhold or withdraw kindness from people who have been unkind to me.

I want to die but I am not dead yet. While I am here I will continue to show kindness, even when it hurts. If my life is going to be filled with hurt anyway, I would rather be kind while hurting than do nothing while hurting.

I have been in a very dark place for a long time now and I am still there, but I realised these things about myself today and I thought maybe they were worth sharing here.
