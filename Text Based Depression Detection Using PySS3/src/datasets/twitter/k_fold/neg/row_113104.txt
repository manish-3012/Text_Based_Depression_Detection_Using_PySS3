I feel extremely unwanted and lonelyI have so many friends around me but I genuinely feel I have absolutely no impact in their lives, which isnâ€™t their fault, I guess itâ€™s mine for just being a person who canâ€™t fully understand if people genuinely care for me or if Iâ€™m just a person they get bored of. I just feel so unwanted in my life and I donâ€™t feel I have anyone I can open up to without feeling like a burden.
