I realised no one can look after me35F
Iâ€™ve had mental health problems (inherited and years of abuse) my entire life which culminated in the current diagnoses of bipolar 2, GAD, PTSD, Body Dysmorphia, OCD and ADD. 

I also already have psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia which used to be really bad when I was obese (110kg, 5â€™3â€) and my ex husband buried his head in the sand and ignored my health problems and I would be in bed alone for 14 hours, unable to walk, and he would leave me a glass of water and some biscuits. 

I left him and found someone who seemed the opposite (54M) and I moved across the world for him and his kids and became a step mum and lost 60kg so now Iâ€™m a trophy too. 

My mental health is being managed well but in the last 6 months Iâ€™ve found Iâ€™ve got cervical cancer for the second time, my bowel isnâ€™t working so I need surgery, and then finally, in the last 2 weeks I got leg paralysis and theyâ€™ve ruled out physical causes and are leaving MS on the table (on top of everything else.) 

I have an amazing job, I am an international keynote speaker, popular on social media etc - friends all over have world... but I never let any of them know how dark Iâ€™m feeling. 

I was sort of coping but adding Covid and lockdown has shown that I genuinely donâ€™t have anyone to care for me if I am diagnosed with MS. My partner who was amazing, picks and chooses when Iâ€™m worth looking after depending on his mood. (Iâ€™m currently stuck in bed, no food, trying not to drink anything because my leg paralysis means limiting walking around, having a text argument where Iâ€™m begging him to come talk to me but he refuses to believe itâ€™s that bad and I should walk to the living room) 

I said to my mother (73) that if I got MS I would move back to England and live with her and although she was â€˜jokeyâ€™ she made is it clear I couldnâ€™t. 

But my partner has shown that he clearly canâ€™t keep his emotions in check and look after me. He talks the talk when we are in a good place but today has shown how proud and petty he is -and the detrimental impact on my physical and mental health as a result. 

So here I am, with 12+ medications, wondering if anything is worth striving for anymore. Itâ€™s a 2yr track of uncertainty and relapses for MS diagnosis, all whilst Iâ€™m dealing with the cervical cancer and dead bowel - both of which need surgery but itâ€™s been delayed for Covid. 

I have been so close to ending my life countless times since early childhood but today just felt like a day of accidental goodbyes and clarity over the lack of control of my future. 

Iâ€™ve had my emotional tearful breakdown but now I feel calm and ready.

Does anyone get to that clarity? How do I get back to reality because surely this canâ€™t be the end?
