Itâ€™s a crime against humanity that death isnâ€™t a socially acceptable optionI wouldnâ€™t really consider myself libertarian in a political sense, but I generally believe people should be able to live their lives and do what they want as long as it doesnâ€™t harm other people. 

Why isnâ€™t death an acceptable option? You could argue that it causes pain to other people, but if I do nothing with my life and become a homeless crackhead then Iâ€™d cause pain to people (arguably more pain because it lasts a lifetime). That might not be the perfect example but just a thought, you get the idea. 

I think itâ€™s because death scares people, and nobody wants to think about it or even consider it. So most people just live their lie of a life and try to ignore it. If death was a socially acceptable option then itâ€™d be hard to ignore. 

Seriously, since when is life this authoritarian dictatorship bullshit? Everyone should have the choose between life and easy assisted-suicide. Why shouldnâ€™t we?
