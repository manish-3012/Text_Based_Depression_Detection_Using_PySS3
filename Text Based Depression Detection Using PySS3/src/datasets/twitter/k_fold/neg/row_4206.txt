I just want to end this life but I scare of the consequences that will happen to everyone around meI've been holding this thought by myself for many years. Can't find rhe right person or place to let this heavy feelings out. Waking up every morning thinking the easiest way to kill myself without feeling the pain. Then this thought of the consequences that my parents will have to bear. I'm the oldest of my family, a scholar and if I ever do kill myself, my parents have to repay my scholarship giver. It's not a small amount. Almost $100k but I just don't have the will to live anymore. Everyday there must be someone who will make feel upset, left behind, getting belittled and so on. 

I have very few trusted friends. I just can't tell them what I exactly feels. Can't even trust my own girlfriend since she always give me answers that won't even gonna make me feel better. I blame myself so much for everything that has happened in my life. Hurts someone, cheated on my ex, failed to be better and the list goes on.

I'm just writing it here because I can't hold it in my heart anymore. Every seconds I'm thinking about suicide. Feels Iike I can't live anymore. 

Thanks for your time.
