I have been thinking about my death a lot and I need some advice to see if I should be taking this much more seriouslyHi Iâ€™m 24 M and recently been thinking or more or less day dreaming about my own death. Mostly about me ending my own life. The way I feel they are mostly at night before I go to bed. Is that natural? Iâ€™m always second guessing my self about my feelings but I honestly highly doubt I would do anything to harm myself.
