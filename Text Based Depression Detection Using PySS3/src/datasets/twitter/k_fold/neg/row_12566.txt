Suicidal Scenarios in my headAm I the only one that plays out in their mind what happens after you commit suicide. I always think of each close family member my dad will be heart broken but he got over his brother being killed after a few years and same for the rest of my aunts and uncles and cousins yea Iâ€™ll miss them 5 of my cousins grew up with me and weâ€™re pretty close. My mom would so over dramatic but we have a terrible relationship and I never miss her. My brother would be sad but he rlly doesnâ€™t care we go months without talking I used to reach out to him but idc anymore. Friends? Donâ€™t have any. I hope someone does my hair for my funeral
