I don't know what to doThis is a throwaway. I never thought I'd be writing on something like this. I'm a very closed off person and I find it hard to open up to even my closest friends. At the end up summer last year I started my final semester at college. I had an amazing fiance that had to move somewhere 2 hours away for work. While I was working on finishing my semester I started to feel more and more depressed and I don't know why. Maybe it was the distance. Maybe it was because I felt like everything that could go wrong was. The only thing I had going for me was her and a job I was lucky enough to nap before graduation. Turns out the day before I graduated she cheated on me with a friend of hers from high school. I wanted to try and work things out, but she said she need time to think. I agreed and tried to keep an open mind. Thanks to Covid my job keep getting pushed back and all I could do is sit at home and think about what happened. Drove me absolutely insane and it still is. Turns out not even a month after we broke up she started dating the guy she cheated on me with. I found out last Monday. She claims she was trying to protect me by not telling me, but I don't know about that. I have never felt so helpless and alone. My job starts Monday and I am so scared that I will mess up and get fired or I'll hate it. It's the only thing I have to live for at this point. I move away from everyone I knew for this job and I'm just so scared. I want to die almost every day and they only reason I'm writing this is because I almost did it. I have my note written and I don't know what snapped me out of it before the trigger was pulled, but I just had to tell someone
