I don't know what to do anymorea few months ago I moved out of my moms house because it became abusive and she would make me feel less of a person. and so last month the one person I thought really cared about me really didn't. one a Friday I found out that I was pregnant but I had the iud. a day after the person I was so in love with got drunk and almost hooked up with someone. while he was passed out I went through his phone and he was talking to other girls for a long time. when I moved out of his place I went back to my moms. a week later I went into the hospital for emergency surgery because I had a miscarriage (ectopic pregnancy) and now I'm just so lost. things aren't the best at my moms. I still love him and its like wherever I am nothing feels right. I was so excited for college but now I dread coming. I feel like I'm just alone. I don't know what to do. I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately. I feel like right now I don't have a life. 
all my life its been rough. I lost my dad twice. my mom abuses me. I lost my baby. my heart feels so shattered. I just don't know anymore
