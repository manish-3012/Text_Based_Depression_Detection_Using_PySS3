If you really care so much after I kill myself, then why didnâ€™t you care when I was living with the pain?Not a word. No one says a word or gives one fuck while iâ€™m wanting to die. But the second i die, people care. The truth is, those people donâ€™t care about my death. They just want to make sure theyâ€™re not at fault for anything and move on. Wether or not Iâ€™m well is something they literally do not care about.
