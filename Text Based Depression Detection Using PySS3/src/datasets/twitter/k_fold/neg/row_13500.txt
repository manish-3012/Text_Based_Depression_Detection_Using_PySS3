Iâ€™m ConflictedI have a lot going on right now. For years, honestly. I really just want to end it and itâ€™s so hard to keep going when I canâ€™t even see my future. I havenâ€™t been able to for so many years. It hurts to live. But my family and friends care about me and depend on me. I canâ€™t leave them, but it hurts so much. I canâ€™t keep going, but I canâ€™t ever leave them either. Theyâ€™ll be hurt by my death, and the aftermath would be so destructive. I canâ€™t hurt them more then I already have. They have already been through so much more then me, I canâ€™t imagine how they are feeling. 

I recently thought that life itself was what you took from the experience. Then I realized I canâ€™t take anything from it anymore. I need everything to stop. But it canâ€™t, and it wonâ€™t. help me
