She was my everythingI remember being suicidal af but she was the only thing that kept me going. They way she used to tell me I'm worth it... How she hugged me, waiting for me to gain the energy to talk to her. How she was the only one who could understand me... Now that she left me, because she simply fell out of love... I just don't know what to do. I have nothing left to lose. I want to give an end in my life just once and for all. But I have a dermatologist appointment in a few days and I don't know what I'd say if I failed. It's scheduled for next week. We'll see until then...
