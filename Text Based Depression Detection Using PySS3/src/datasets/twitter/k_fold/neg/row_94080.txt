I am feeling stuck.My life doesn't move in any direction and it is for sure that it will stay this way for another two years and I am so tired of it because I spent the last three years waiting for change, knowing that none is to come. It's this constant circle of waking up, going to school, coming home, waiting til the evening and sleeping just to wake up again. I don't want to wake up anymore and the worst thing is knowing the only thing standing in the way is me. There is no way to get myself to do *anything*, because I am never satisfied with what I am doing. I used to write stories and draw but nowadays I don't even dare to hold a pencil because I know the outcome will make me so fucking angry.  can't find no motivation to do anything for school anymore, may it be homework or reading a text or learning for a test or exam. Fuck, I haven't even started my research paper I was so excited about, because I don't want to write a single thing down. I hate the words I choose so much. I hate every fucking decision I have made so much. I don't want to live like this anymore but there is no motivation and I am just so very tired.
