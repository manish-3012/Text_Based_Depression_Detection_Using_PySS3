iâ€™m ruining my familyâ€™s livesiâ€™ve only made this account to say this. i hope it justifies my next actions, and hope even more that people agree with me. 

iâ€™ve been horrible to my family my entire life. my relationship with my father was always horrible, but he puts more of an effort into being a part of my life than ever before. iâ€™m selfish and ungrateful. 

iâ€™m 17 years old, and my mom loves me and my brothers more than the world. she deserves better than ill ever be. i just got into another screaming match with her today (and itâ€™s not even noon yet) because everything keeps getting blown out of proportion. i canâ€™t ever leave things alone or just listen. 

i used to have really horrible behavioral issues. i would yell and scream and break things and my brother would cry and hide from me. i was only 12 or so. even now he cries when my mom and i fight. 

my mom doesnâ€™t give the same amount of attention to them as she has to me, and itâ€™s my fault. iâ€™m always jealous, always afraid, always wanting her love. itâ€™s disgusting of me, and my 6 year old brother doesnâ€™t know a life outside of the constant arguing. 

i tried to hang myself in eighth grade. my mom found me and i donâ€™t think a day goes by where she doesnâ€™t think of it.

iâ€™m a genuinely bad person. 
i love my family and i want better for them. iâ€™ll never be better. i cry all the time, iâ€™m lonely, and i push people away. 

iâ€™m going to kill myself. the only thing i want is for them to never find me. i just want them to be happy again
