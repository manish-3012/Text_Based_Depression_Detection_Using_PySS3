This is really strange place...When I really feel to kill myself and depressed, tons of encouraging comments in here comforts me...

But sometimes I feel someone who is desperate and standing at the edge of their life and I really feel sorry for them and I just feel sad... 

Nevertheless, the fact that there are many people who encourage to live and many people who have pain like me gives me strange feeling of consolation... thx guys
