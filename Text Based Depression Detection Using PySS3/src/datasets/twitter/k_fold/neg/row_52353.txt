To what extent can you let a doctor in on your suicidal tendencies before he hospitalizes you?While I suffer from suicidal ideation and have trouble doing the smallest tasks (e.g. eating) I also don't want to be hospitalized. At what point of severity do I no longer have a choice? If I told him I have the plan (hanging) and materials needed, what would happen?
