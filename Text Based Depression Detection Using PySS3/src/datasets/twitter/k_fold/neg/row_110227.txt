This is really stupid, but I need to know I'm not alone.I am a 16 year old girl. My way of coping with my severe, off-the-wall depression since I was a child was to create fantasy lives in my favorite TV shows, video games, etc. Most of my fantasy worlds surround video games... like one surrounding a zombie apocalypse. I dream myself to be a bad ass zombie-killing machine. I even went as far as to design how I ended up with a certain group of survivors and went super far into backstories for it. It's embarrassing to talk about, but I doubt any of you know who I am-- so whatever. My way of coping is.. unhealthy I guess? I live life up in my head instead of out here. Reality sucks, I guess. And I'm lame. And I'm actually quite lonely. My way of dealing with my manic depression is just.. live in worlds where things always work out for me, where my favorite fictional characters come to life and form friendships and relationships with me. I just.. I want to know I'm not alone with this. Everyone has their ways of coping. Also, I am sorry for being repetitive and dragging this on. My ways of coping is that + suicidal memes + me casually slipping in jokes about how much I wanna kill myself in everyday conversations. Yes, I already know I'm a loser. No need to tell me so.
