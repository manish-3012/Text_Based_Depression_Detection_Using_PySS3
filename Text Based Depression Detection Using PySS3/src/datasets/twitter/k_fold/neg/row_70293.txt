I donâ€™t know what to say, if anything, to my ex before I do itI love my ex. So so much. He doesnâ€™t love me. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m going to do this. He claims itâ€™ll fuck up his life if I end it, but Iâ€™m sure heâ€™ll be okay. 

I wish I could say goodbye face to face. Hug him, kiss him, tell him I love him, and hear him say it back, but if that was possible, I wouldnâ€™t be doing this in the first place. 

I donâ€™t know if I should text him anything. Goodbye? I love you? Iâ€™m sorry? I donâ€™t know. I couldnâ€™t write a book on everything I want to say, so Iâ€™d keep it very minimal. God I wish I was with him. I wish this wasnâ€™t how it ended.
