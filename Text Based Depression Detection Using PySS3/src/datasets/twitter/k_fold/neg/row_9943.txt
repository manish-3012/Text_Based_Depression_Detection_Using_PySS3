I am going to dieI'm almost 20 years old.

So you can probably tell by the title what this post is going to consist of, yes I've planned my suicide for tonight. This is very scary for me because of the unknown, but I'm struggling so much with how I feel, how much I hate looking at myself, how much I hate how stupid I am, the list goes on. I just wish I could say to my 10 year old self don't end up like you are going to. I'm so lost, lonely and unemployed.

I want to be successful, what 20-30 year old isn't? I see other people that are my age and winning in life, how can I compete against these people? what chance do I have? I'm a talented programmer and cyber security geek, what good can come from this? apart from being called a nerd or a loner? What girl, a potential partner would even look at me?

I have no friends, but I have family, but they wouldn't have the slightest clue what is happening, behind my smile is hurt. My focus now is making sure everything is prepared. I'll be going into a local park and ending it there, anyway you shouldn't need to know this.

I feel numb.
