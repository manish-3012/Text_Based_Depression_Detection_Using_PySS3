Need input from a parent who has lost a kid.Preface: Not looking for "Don't do it, this (insert bullshit reason) is enough to keep you going" responses. Please save those for someone who isn't lost. I really just....well, title.

Long story short (which, if need really be, can be elaborated via pm's) is that this IS going to happen, I just need to know how long I need to wait.

I have a selfish reason that is keeping me going 'till around August-September. It is at this time that I will reassess and see if another month will be tolerable or not.

**My question comes in here.**
How hard was it for you when you lost your child?
I ask because my decision kinda rides on how my parents will take it, seeing as they're the main reason I'm still here. I'd like to not hurt them any more than necessary, but I know I'm dragging them down with me the longer I continue.

So essentially it comes down to: right now, after my selfish deadline, or (hopefully not, but if necessary) after they croak?
