I'm scared, and tired all the time.I'm scared and tired all the time. 
Nothing changes, I'm stuck. Everyone else around me is moving on, making progress in their life and I'm stuck here with my stupid brain, unable to work on anything, unable to focus. 
I don't know what I want, I can't figure it what I want at all because it all seems impossible. 
It never gets any better, the details change, but the big picture doesn't and all that really happens is I get older. And the chance for change gets smaller. 

Everyone has something they can build their life on, but I'm just stuck here. My passion killed by depression and cynical reality. I'm tired of failing, I'm tired of being poor, I'm tired of being worthless. 

I'm tired of waking up everyday hoping I won't hate myself and feel hopeless. But I never do. I'm worse than everyone around me. And in this world you have to have something to leverage to your favour. 
And I've got nothing, nothing worthwhile at least. 

Fuck it all. I wish I didn't have to exist. I'm angry that I have to. And im angry and upset that people will be hurt if I kill myself. So I can't do that either. I can't talk to anyone because they'll be upset. 

I'm stuck. There's nothing I can do.
