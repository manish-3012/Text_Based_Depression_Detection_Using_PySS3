How to help someone who is suicidal?Hello guys, One of my classmates who is kind of a loner,tried to kill himself last month and I unfortunately live in a country where mental health is not taken seriously, so the victim blaming is rife out here. I don't know him very well but i want to genuinely help him. From what I've  gathered he has been neglected by his parents and bullied a lot through out his life. I made a move and I'm kinda like friends now with him. But I still don't get how to make him appreciate this gift that we call life. Professional help is not advisory because again, mental health is a taboo so even he won't go to seek help. But i want to help him. The terrible part ofcourse is people including teachers making fun of him after the suicide attempt it's gotten outrageous.
