I donâ€™t knowIâ€™m supposed to be getting my life together. Getting ready for school on Monday. Clearing my mind. But my boyfriend wonâ€™t call me back. He forced us to take a break and now Iâ€™m living with my dad with the promise weâ€™ll get back together before Christmas. 

He wonâ€™t answer my phone calls and we havenâ€™t talked in two plus days. I feel really shitty. Iâ€™ve been crying for nearly a day. Iâ€™m worried he might have cheated on me. Iâ€™m losing weight for him. His main issue with me shifts by the fight. Sometimes itâ€™s my weight. Sometimes itâ€™s him and his negative views about the world. Sometimes itâ€™s money. 

Iâ€™ve called no less than 200 times in the past 24 hours. I would call more but Iâ€™ve been restraining myself. I just feel empty and tired. And I realize how flimsy my happiness is. How this is what my life would be like if I stayed with him forever. I get mad/a bit short every now and again. I suppose I deserve this. I want to die but Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m so scared and so now Iâ€™m still here.
