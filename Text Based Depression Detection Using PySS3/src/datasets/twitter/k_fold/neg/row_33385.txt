Please help end the painI donâ€™t know if this is the right place. Iâ€™m 38 years old and have suffered from depression most of my life. Iâ€™ve taken multiple antidepressants/anti anxiety/antipsychotics/mood stabilizers over the years. Nothing works and Im just tired of it all and want to end it.  I wish there was an easy way. Please let me know the quickest, most painless way. Thank you for your time.
