How do i stop thinking about dyingSo, i've struggled with mental health shit and suicidal ideation for a while, but the latter only came up sporadically, and lasted a very short amount of time. Like a week tops.

That is, until i fucked up(in a very dumb way) an important exam last week. It's fine, i will just have to retake it at the end of the year, its not the end of the world. That is what the rational part of my brain says at least.

The other part? Not so much. I have been overcome with an awful sense of dread, failure, and general bad for two weeks, which is very worrying. Like, i can be happy. And i am now. But i also, just want to not live. It's in the back of my head at all times. I think this might have been a breaking point but honestly i wouldn't know anymore after all the crap my brain does to myself.

I guess im just asking for tips on how to get out of the funk (other than therapy which, yeah it's long overdue) ???? Maybe the ranting is cathartic enough. Maybe tomorrow i will just feel better. But i just feel so powerless right now, so insignificant. I can't see the bright side.
