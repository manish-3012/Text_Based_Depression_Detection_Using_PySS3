Is life worth living honestly?I already posted to depression subreddit hoping just letting stuff out would make me feeling better.. Clearly didn't know that im on SW subreddit. 

I use to feel like I had a purposes on this earth, stuff was going good, passing school, made friends and just enjoyed life. Everything went down hill in my life, the mother to me died, I started losing friends and I slipped into depression and now every day for the past few years thoughts of dying and how I will kill myself run threw my head, in school, on the bus, home, sleep, everywhere. I feel like I have no purpose to be on this earth anymore. It seems like you need to be smart in this world to succeed and to live a happy life. Im failing 3 out of 4 classes, first year of highschool. I thought what everyone thinks, new school things will get better.. Well they just got worse and not better at all. I wrote this because it's getting worse, I lay here staring into darkness thinking. What day do I want to end it. How will I end it. This is the first time I have considered a date in my life, I have felt like dying but not this much ever. I know its gonna be said that everyone has a purpose in this world, I felt that for so long till now, I dont feel like I dont anymore. 

I know my grammar and spelling is so bad in this, I'm 15 crying and at this point not caring if I make it don't not dont.
