I give upI really want to kill myself... I have been researching on how to do so as I do not want to fail... I don't really know why I'm writing this I guess I have no one else left to talk to... I have been eating less than 600 calories a day, smoking like a chimney, and drinking like theres no tomorrow in hopes that my body will be abused enough to give up on itself... I have sufferred from depression and anxiety since I was 12 years old it doesnt get better... I do not want to live... I give up...
