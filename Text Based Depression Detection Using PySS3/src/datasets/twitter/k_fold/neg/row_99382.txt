what the fuckI think it's fucked up that I've tried to kill myself so many times and am forced to stay alive but no one actually helps me they just want me to stay alive and suffer and check in from time to time and I fake that everything is fine so they can feel good about themselves since I know there's no point in talking about my pain and my health issues if they can never be solved and I have no money or resources to begin to seek help

Why the fuck

I never asked to be born

I never asked my fucked up mom and dad to pass down their fucked up stomach issues and mental health issues to me

I never asked for any of this
