I may have contracted HIV, if I did I will refuse treatment.I'm a 20 yo guy. I'm short and balding which I hate deeply (5'5). My ex girlfriend who was absolutely gorgeous cheated on me with my ex best friend. I miss her a lot. I don't really value my life. I'm a super nice person, not nice guy nice but I'm just genuinely good to people and it's fucked me over a lot. 

I may have contracted hiv but contaminated blood or from sex with a woman which is super rare but possible. I have all the symptoms, even the dr said so. 

I don't necessarily want to die but I don't want to be short or balding or live with hiv. Balding I can handle but being short sucks balls. I get no play from girls, I have to work real hard for it. 

Who the fuck gets hiv as a white heterosexual male... do you know the percentage? It's under 5%, that's the type of luck I have had my whole entire life. I caught tuleremia in my youth which is super fucking rare, almost killed me. I've been hit by a van which ruined my high school wrestling career, I was super good. But cutting weight for wrestling contributed to my short stature. My ex had BPD and she through me for a loop with cheating. I have so much more that's happened. 

When I picture struggle that builds character I don't picture all the shit that's happened to me. I picture holocaust survivors, soviets who stayed strong during the Soviet Union, Africans who survive with almost nothing, those people live honorable lives.

All I wanted from life as a man was simple. To be tall and have a purpose. Short with hiv? You've got to be kidding me.
