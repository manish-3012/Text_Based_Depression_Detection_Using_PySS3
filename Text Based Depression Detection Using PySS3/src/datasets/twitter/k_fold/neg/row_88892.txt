Iâ€™m at a lossI kind of came on here hoping to find a subreddit of how to you know, kill yourself. As much as I really see no other option, I feel like I donâ€™t know enough about it, and Iâ€™m scared to go through with it. What if I suck at that too, and mess it up. But instead I found a whole bunch of people who feel the same way. Different ages, stories, and paths, yet we all share this one stupid thing. What am I supposed to do? The common thing Iâ€™ve read is to just keep pushing. Towards what? A sliver of improvement? Every time I swear I have gotten past this thing, I just end up right back here. Iâ€™ve isolated myself hoping itâ€™ll force me to not be so needy and just fix myself, but idek if it was such a good idea? The first 15 posts Iâ€™ve seen were on how investing the feeling of loneliness is. I feel like I feel too much, and Iâ€™m too aware of where I fall short. I just feel like a burden to people, and to everyone else, just insignificant. I feel like I do everything to fight this feeling too. Everything they say â€œshould helpâ€. Iâ€™ve been belligerently positive for a while, yet Iâ€™m still back here. Is this what I should expect for the rest of my life ?
