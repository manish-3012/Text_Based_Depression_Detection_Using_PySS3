her we go againI dont hate women. I really dont. I dont say passive aggressive things or lash out. If ever there was anyone I would hurt it has and been myself. But try as I might to be better, to improve, to take all the same old half heated regurgitated advice there is its the same old story.

Catfish. Fishing. Lies. Ghosting. Manipulation. Scams. Etc. Etc. Etc.

What does it matter? Why even try? Its been literally thousands at this point, with not so much to show for it as a single happy memory. I'm feeling dissociated from reality. Every one makes this out if you just focus on yourself and not worry things work out. They only say that when things work out and its hasnt been a decade. No one cares about the dregs who give up. Doesnt fit the narrative. Have a little money saved up. Maybe blow all of it on high class booze to kill my gut, attempt a little fun. Its gunna be messy, though. Can't afford therapy, so might as well.
