(23 F) My biggest regret is prioritizing my relationship before my friendship.Got into a very serious romantic relationship with a girl my 3rd year of college and long story short ended up jettisoning a lot of my really solid friendships to dump all my time into said relationship. Iâ€™d always been chronically lonely so I was overjoyed at first, but now two and a half years later much of the relationship has gone toxic and I have nobody there for me if I leave it. Iâ€™d be alone, and honestly thatâ€™s the one thing worse than keeping this up.

Iâ€™ve had a history of suicidal behavior and self harm and have gone through a lot of work to get better at both. But these past few months have been so miserable that the only way Iâ€™m able to keep from killing myself I feel like is going to work and going to sleep.

Last night I had a dream in which my life was much more like how I wished it were. Waking up now to realize itâ€™s no different, the only thing keeping me from trying to hang myself is that I think Iâ€™d get caught before the attempt was complete
