Concerned about my sister. Don't know what to do.My sister has really treatment resistant depression.  She does ALL the right things.  Goes to therapy, gets exercise, sees a sleep person.  She has tried all the meds.  At one point she was on a MAOI that was helping and they stopped producing it.  After trying everything conventional she has tried the less conventional (microdosing shrooms, ketamine).  She is considering ECT.  She confessed to me that she had told herself after the microdosing shrooms that if it didn't work she was done.  Obviously she didn't give up and is still fighting but I think she is running out hope and runing out of options and she has been fighting for so long.  I feel like things aren't worse or better than before - and I know from personal experience that "overreacting" and having her institutionalized or something just makes her life harder and in the long run doesn't fix anything.  I don't know what I can do.  I'm scared.  I love her so much and I'm so sorry she is in so much pain.  I don't know what I can do.
