I'm a monster.I have ruined everything. It's like my birth was the catalyst. Unplanned. A horrific event. My father never cared. Then it was elementary and middle school. I am just ugly and stupid. I deserved to be called names in front of the whole class. I was messy. I deserved to have my heart broken and dive into deep depression. I deserved to be hurt for what I did to make others care about me. I deserved being used for thinking I was smart. To be dumped by older guys online. To fall and be stepped on. I ruined my life for dating a horrible person. For letting that break up get me to think I was smart again. I deserved being assaulted. No one else deserves that. But Iâ€™m the exception. Because there is something horribly disgustingly wrong about me. I got myself there. I got myself here. To meet the most amazing person. And disrespect them. Make them feel so small. Iâ€™m so stupid. Iâ€™m so broken and damaged that i have dragged someone who keeps me going.  Iâ€™m that annoying person suicidal over their relationship. Iâ€™m that annoying attention seeker. I ruin myself. My life. And now I ruin others who are on here for real reasons. I just wanna stop ruining things. I wanna stop being a disgusting horrifying sickly beast. 

I wanna go.

I don't care if thereâ€™s a heaven or hell. 

Or if I just disappear. I just canâ€™t be here and ruin everything anymore. I should be executed. I need to execute me. I need to do one right thing. But I know even with that, I wouldnâ€™t do it right.
