Last week I tried to kill myself by taking pills and alcohol. Next week I'm gonna start a treatment in a day hospital.A huge psychological pain led me to try to suicide some days ago, as I could not find any other alternative. I felt (and I still feel) completely lost and empty, so I decided the best way to stop suffering was to take my own life. Luckily I didn't need to call and ambulance and I could talk to a friend who convinced me to stop and contact my old therapist. Next week I'm gonna move back to my parents and start going to this mental day hospital. I need a break to think about myself.
