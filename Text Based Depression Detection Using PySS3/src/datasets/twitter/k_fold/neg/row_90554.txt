I wish I just died in that car accident.I had just finished college and bought my first car last June. It cost all of my money. It was a great car for its price and could have lasted me years. I was in a minor accident a mere two weeks after getting it, but it was only â‚¬50 worth of damage so I got off easy. I got a job working minimum wage in a call center for insurance the same month. Its an ok job but the money is mere peanuts for the labor of having to listen to people shout at me all day. I'm currently back living with my parents after college in a rural village and don't have many friends. All of them are either living back in Galway where I went to college or have moved to England or Canada. My life is basically get up, go to work, go home, spend the rest of my day on my laptop, sleep. A pretty dull life but my plan was to build up money, get my own place and find a good job with my software degree down in Dublin. However since last month, thinks started to take a turn for the worst. I was told I may not pass probation and will be let go by December because of my call quality. My alcoholic brother tried to choke me to death and I refuse to speak to him anymore. And to top it all off, I totaled my new car yesterday after skidding on black ice and rolled down a hill into a farmers field, destroying his gate and fencing. I came out unharmed but felt like a total idiot as I downright refused to learn my lesson about speeding last time. Now I have no car, the one thing I had, barely any money to buy a new one, have to pay for the damage to the farmers property, and I am in the process of losing my crappy job should I not pass probation. I am literally going nowhere in life. I feel it has no purpose. I barely speak to my friends, only my parents. My mother (despite good intentions) treats me like a child and my father always just berates me on what I should and shouldn't do. I just wish I died in that car accident and stopped being a burden to both them and the world.
