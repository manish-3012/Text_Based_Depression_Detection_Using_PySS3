I'm at the end of my ropeI'm just so done. Im miserable, undersleeping, under eating, crying all the time. I've been beaten, r*ped, gas lit, s*xual assault but nothing has made me more consistent miserable as this job. Even my days off are filled with dread. And I'm so exhausted all the time that I cant see my way out of it. I know i need to find a new job but I'm too depression to get myself to fill out applications and its left me feeling like I'm completely trapped. I dont know how close I am to killing myself but it honestly feels like I'm edging closer and closer to the cliff every day. I need something, anything to snap me out of this mindset that is slowly etching it's way into my brain
