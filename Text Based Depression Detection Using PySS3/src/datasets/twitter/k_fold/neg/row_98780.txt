Suicide due to my situationI want to start this by saying this is no way for attention, I just can't talk about this in my situation because I'd be put on literal suicide watch hence why i'm talking about this here.

I've been in the us army for a good amount of timing and am currently getting discharged and I've never felt like killing myself more than i have right now. The embarrassment of being chaptered out even if it's honorable hurts me a lot. I could lie to people about why but the fact was i suck at running no matter how much i tried i would always struggle and trained enough to where it actually made my run time a lot worse. The biggest reason i'm considering suicide is because my mindset is im getting chaptered because im a failure. I've been told that i should not beat myself up about this and i have a good head on my shoulders. But it's so hard to keep lying to myself. When i get my "honorable" discharge I want to kill myself but I'd also hurt my girlfriend i've known for 6 years now. she has known i am very self destructive but she also knows i want to always be there for her even though our locations and work schedules make it so we have little free time to talk to each other. I truely believe i dont want to take my life but i know i wouldn't be able to stand the shame.
