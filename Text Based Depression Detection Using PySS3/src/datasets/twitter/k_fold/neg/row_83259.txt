what.it's nearly five in the morning. Every single one of my friends both online and IRL has left me neck deep in shit and I just don't know what to do at this point. I just feel nothing. I can't even fucking cry. A few days ago someone added me to this stupid chat and I made a joke about going on a murdering rampage and they took it way too seriously. One guy kept on insulting me to the point that I lashed out at everyone in the chat and told a depressed girl to kill herself. Ironically I almost walked to the bridge and jumped off afterward but instead just took a two-hour walk. Because of this incident, all of my online friends have abandoned me. No one loves me. My old best friend recently blocked me on every single platform because I hung up on him on skype and I just read his new Instagram bio "Jerry is my brother for life" (Jerry being some other dude). He never called me his brother, he never acted like we would be friends for life either. I'm slowly realizing that everyone I've been friends with or been in a relationship with has fucking hated me all along and no one will ever like me let alone love me. I just want someone to love me.
