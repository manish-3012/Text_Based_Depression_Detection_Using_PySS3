notesDear Mentor,


I'm sorry. I know what hurt this will cause you. (I know this because it has happened to me too... but you know this about me.) I suspect you'll feel angry and betrayed. It's possible that you will also feel guilty. It might be helpful to know that from my perspective, there's nothing you could have done--I didn't tell you how bad it had gotten. I didn't want to cause you pain. I know that sounds ridiculous, but... well, I just wanted you to know that this whole thing is a bad accident of neurochemistry and circumstance, and there's nothing you could have done to save me from myself. 


I've never had the guts to say this to you, but I love you like you're my grandmother. I'm so grateful that I had you in my life. I'm so sorry.


&amp;nbsp;


To the man who failed me,


You told me that I could count on you. But when I asked you for help, explicitly, you did not come through for me. I told you that I was in a bad way, and you bailed. 


I know you don't feel like you did anything wrong. But I still feel hurt. I still feel angry. I want you to feel guilty for your hypocrisy and your self-aggrandizing bluster; I want to punish you for hurting me. So I'm the one who's dead now, but fuck you. Fuck you.

Dear Therapist,


I know you tried to help me, I really do. There's only so much a person can do, and I wasn't being completely honest because I was scared. I'm grateful for your compassion, for the way you offered to talk to me on the phone if it would help, for the way your voice was always so gentle when you asked me what was going on in my head. I wanted to open up to you, but I just couldn't. I'm sorry.

Dear Mom and Dad,


I love you forever and always. Forgive me.
