Went to sleep depressed woke up depressedThe first time I thought about suicide was my mom whipped me across the back one day with a star encrusted belt. Iâ€™ve been beat with it before I was really young I think it was around 5th grade. After the beating I sat there just in a daze I felt like I was on a island surrounded by being unwanted, so I found a butter knife I had in my room and started stabbing myself lol imagine trying to kill your self with a butter knife . Anyways fast forward to now Iâ€™m 20 everyone thinks Iâ€™m happy but I wish I was never born I hate the loneliness I feel everyday every serious relationship I had which was only 2 Iâ€™ve been cheated on I never knew my dad my mom has been in and out of my life the only person that really sat me down and said she loved me sincerely was my grandmother and sheâ€™s gone now Iâ€™m crying to hard Iâ€™m just going to stop this forum now... Yâ€™all please just pray for me every week I think about just ending it and living my flesh I hate it here as soon as I think my depressions gone it comes back to hunt me itâ€™s so much wrong that has happened to me and I just want to know why???? Why canâ€™t I just find somebody to love me because I damn sure will love them and never try to do them wrong or hurt them
