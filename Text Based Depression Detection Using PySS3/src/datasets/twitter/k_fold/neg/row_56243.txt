killing myself after my dog dies.might be over a year until then. but its nice to finally put a date on it. i'm unlovable. people always leave me, I never give up, I have been given up on consistently for the past ten years. uphill both ways. i lost him. we loved each other. i'm too much. not enough room in his life for me. i'm always too much and never enough at the same time. i'm so tired. have been for years.

i only ever stay around for my dog. everyone will go on without me. my dad doesn't talk to me anymore. he's mad i got dumped. probably thinks i fucked up. he told me not to fuck this up with my ex. i did.

mom is crazy. sister is traveling the world. friends are sick of me. i'm finally completely alone. i haven't eaten for five days. been smoking a pack and a half a day.  i'm only nineteen. five years of therapy and drugs has done nothing. nothing has ever made a difference, including me.

I have incurable untreatable chronic pain. I can't walk some days. Sex is awful and painful. I can't laugh. Interstitial cystitis has taken my will to live. 

i deserve a break. i deserve to sleep. i would check mysel in, i just got a new full time job. not enough money. dad would be so disappointed. just going to wait until i can die. don't think i can wait much longer. Please
