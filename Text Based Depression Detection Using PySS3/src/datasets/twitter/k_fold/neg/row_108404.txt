My mom says no one will want me and she is rightI am manipulative horrible person. I canâ€™t cope with anything in life and itâ€™s shameful. I donâ€™t think I was ever meant to be here. My mom says I will never get a job or a partner due to my self harm scars and look she is not wrong. It just screams unstable and thatâ€™s the truth about me. She canâ€™t even look at me. Iâ€™ve ruined anything good about myself. I want to go.
