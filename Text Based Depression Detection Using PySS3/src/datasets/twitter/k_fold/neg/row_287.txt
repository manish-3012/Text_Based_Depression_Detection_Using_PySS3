I finally have someone that cares about me which is all I ever wanted, so why does it make me even more miserable?Why is she so stubborn about keeping me around? Iâ€™m fucking worthless. Why canâ€™t she just let me die? It genuinely makes me frustrated and annoyed. I just canâ€™t figure out why she wonâ€™t give up on me and itâ€™s literally driving me insane. I crave friendship, intimacy, and closeness. I begged every night to have someone in my life who would just give me a chance and wouldnâ€™t give up on me. And I finally have that, but itâ€™s an absolute joke. What a sick fucking joke that the thing Iâ€™ve wanted for years just makes me 10x more miserable. Iâ€™m worthless and Iâ€™m a lost cause I need to kill myself.
