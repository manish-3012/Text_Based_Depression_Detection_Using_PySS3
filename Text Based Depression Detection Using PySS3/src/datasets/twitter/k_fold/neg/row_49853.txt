Finally thought a girl was into me. But then I remembered I'm unlovable and unattractiveI took her on a few dates, we kissed once (my first kiss in 5 years) and I thought she was into me.

Then I sent a text asking her out again... no response for two days. I sent a reminder text... no response. Silent rejection.

Life has no meaning without love... That's all I wanted. I'm honestly not seeing the point of living with this crushing loneliness forever. Oh and if you're gonna say "plenty of fish in the sea, bro!" then kindly go fuck yourself with a candlestick. It took me 5 years to find a girl who was into me a little bit. As a mid 20s male, that's just pathetic.

I really want to die.

At least it'll be nice and poetic. I'll die as I lived - a lonely virgin loser who hides his true face from the world.
