I wrote a list of pros and cons of dying, and there are more pros.Hello everyone, I am 28 years old. I have autism and other disabilities. I am an author. Generally I love life and all the things in it. But I love people more than I can put into words. 

I am lonely.

Most everyone I have in person contact with in my life is paid to have contact with me, care workers and such. I long for some contact with people.    
  
  I have friends online, few talk to me though they mostly just type... typing is okay sometimes but a lot of the time its not enough either.

The social isolation is so scary. I think about dying often. I thought making a list would help me, however I found there are more pro's to dying than cons.  
  
I am really unsure if I deserve to live.
