Reaching out for help"I've asked to be referred to mental health services AT LEAST three times in the last twelve months and heard nothing back. I spent most of last week not able to walk but my GP says it psychosomatic."

I just sent that message to a mental health crisis text service in the UK.
Want to know what their response was?

"I can hear that that might be stressful for you, and I wondered about you getting additional support from mental health services through your GP or through a self-referral?"

...There are reasons I feel like no one ever fucking listens.

Can't get admitted, don't have anyone who'll let me camp in their garden for a week, don't have any money, can't find a way to win/earn any help from the glorious NHS (mental health services have been a fucking joke for a long time), don't have the energy to endure this anymore. 
God forgive me.
