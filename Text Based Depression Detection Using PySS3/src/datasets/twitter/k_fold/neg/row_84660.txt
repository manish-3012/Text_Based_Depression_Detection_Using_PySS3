Getting closer and closer...I can't continue feeling this way every fucking day. Its so exhausting. Constantly thinking about how I want to die. I've been feeling this way for 15 years and I don't think I continue much longer. I'm married to a beautiful woman and have an absolute wonderful little girl. I'm a great father but I have such a short fuse. I need help but can't get it without insurance. I just tried the noose on for size but put it away because I felt sick putting it on. Wtf am I doing?
