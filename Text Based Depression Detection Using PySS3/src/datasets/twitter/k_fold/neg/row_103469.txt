Tomorrow is probably my last day.At 6am on Friday I think I'm finally going to do it. I really hope nothing goes wrong. I don't want to live anymore, I just want to be dead. I don't want to continue school and then work until I'm like 60 something and then die of some illness. I'm so tired of life already even though I'm really young. I just want it all to be fucking over on Friday morning.
