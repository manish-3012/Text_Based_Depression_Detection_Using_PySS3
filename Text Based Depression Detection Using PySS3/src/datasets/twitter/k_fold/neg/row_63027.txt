A friend in needHello. I'm at a loss for words. My friend has been making comments about suicide for a while now, and as far as I know, has made one genuine attempt. He has promised to be dead by Christmas. I live 6 hours away from him.

What can I do? He's so hard to connect with at the moment, he's willingly cut off from the world. I truly believe that he wants to be dead, and will act on that desire.

I'm not the strongest person to be helping him. I have my own issues with suicidal thoughts, it feels like the blind leaving the blind. I think he's very close to the tipping point where feels the release of death means more then the pain to his loved ones.
