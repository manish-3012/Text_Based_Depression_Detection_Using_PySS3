I just want him back,fuck meI just want you back so much,I want to fucking die so much more without you Jay.We never got to go on that date,I know I annoyed you with my depression and suicidal thoughts every single fucking day.I should have never broken up with you but it was so you could be happy with some other guy,I just you back,take me back.

When I want to die there's nobody I can speak to anymore,please for fucks sake come back.

Sorry I'm drunk
