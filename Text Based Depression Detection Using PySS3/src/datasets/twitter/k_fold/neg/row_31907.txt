I dont get any of it.What is the point of living if you know the rest of your years will be plagued with misery and loneliness? Why is this just okay for so many of us? What keeps you going? because im running out of things to keep me going...
and im getting tired of people thinking depression is something we want. i don't want this, i want to feel normal. Whatever normal is.
