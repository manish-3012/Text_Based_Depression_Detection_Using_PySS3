Suicidal thoughts constantly but not suicidal?I've struggled with mental health since I was a young kid, manifesting in OCD, anxiety and depression. It's been up and down throughout my life. I've battled it with therapy and medication (Zoloft for the last 6 years). 

A few years ago I got pretty bad. After a messy breakup and living alone in a foreign country I fantasised about suicide daily. It resulted in me writing the notes and going to the metro to jump - I didn't and went to the airport instead to fly home to my parents.

Since then I've been on the up- until about a month ago. I don't know whether it's covid, the fact I recently got the Mirena or what, but I'm not in a good place.

I've gone back to regular self harming, waking up thinking about how and when I can cut, and the horrible constant feeling I can just describe as darkness and numbness.

The suicidal thoughts are back very strong. I think about it constantly and have started writing letters again. I think about how I could do it, where I could do it and when would be a good time. Its in my head all the fkin time and I hate it. I can't concentrate on things because my mind resorts back to this. It just won't go away. I'm even dreaming about it.

But here's the thing ...

I don't think I'm suicidal. I don't think I'd actually do it. I couldn't do it to my parents. I know they couldn't cope without me. I don't have the guts. 

So I guess my question is, should I be worried? Wtf is all this about? I'm getting so consumed by it all it's like my head is just repeating do it do it do it. I'm scared and feel so alone even though I have people I can talk to about it. I just don't want to I guess.
