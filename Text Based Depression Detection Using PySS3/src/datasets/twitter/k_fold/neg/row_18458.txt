What am I supposed to think about?I've recently gone on anti depressants after being severely depressed since childhood.

I'm used to thoughts of suicide but now they don't come to me, nothing does. My mind is blank. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

I go to the gym, I go to class, I walk my dog, I hang out with friends, I do everything that I've been told will make me feel better but I don't really feel or think anything.
