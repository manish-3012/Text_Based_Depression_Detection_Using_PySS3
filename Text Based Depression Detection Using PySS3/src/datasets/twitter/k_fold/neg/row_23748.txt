I can't take it anymoreI'm tired of always fucking up everything, I can't do anything right. I'm tired of always being alone since everybody either avoids me or hates me no matter how hard I try to get along with others.

I've been wanting to die for so long I can't remember exactly how many years ago I started constantly thinking about it. Went to see a few therapists, tried taking antidepressants, tried to find something I wanted to do with my life, but nothing worked. Kept telling myself things are going to get better, but that's a lie, things aren't going to get better. If I'm just going to keep suffering as I have for so long, I don't see why I'd want to stay alive.

I had planned to kill myself a week ago, but I chickened out and I hate myself even more for that. I just hope when I try to do it again I'll be able to do something right for once.
