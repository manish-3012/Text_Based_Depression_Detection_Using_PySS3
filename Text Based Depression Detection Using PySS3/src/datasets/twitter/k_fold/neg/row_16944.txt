Everytime people piss me off I want to kill myselfI'm sick of people saying that I have no reason to be angry either. I've haven't been treated right by a lot of people. Everyone talks down to me but apparently there's something wrong with me getting angry. I don't care if this has gone on for years now. It's gone on this long because of a long time of exposure to toxic people. But apparently my long time anger is unjustified. So I'm just going to kill myself because I'm sick of living in a world where all people do is judge.
