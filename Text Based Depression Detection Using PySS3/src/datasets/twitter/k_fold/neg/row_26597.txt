I don't know if it's worth it anymore.I've got a bottle of prozac and a bottle of wellbutrin. both can cause death. I don't know if i want to die. I just want to escape. I almost want to be discovered and saved. But there's part of me that doesn't. I want to escape but I don't want to deal with the consequences. It's my final year of high school but I don't know if I'll be able to survive it.
