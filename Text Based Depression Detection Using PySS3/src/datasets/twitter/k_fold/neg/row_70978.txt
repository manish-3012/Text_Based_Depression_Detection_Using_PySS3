diagnosed with covid, feeling suicidalI am a student who was diagnosed with the virus only a few days ago. Prior to receiving the call, I was not feeling well and was already isolating. I've been feeling ill, lonely, suicidal... My life hasn't been going well anyway. I did stop taking my meds. I feel like I cannot be helped. If this doesn't kill me, I'll do it myself.
