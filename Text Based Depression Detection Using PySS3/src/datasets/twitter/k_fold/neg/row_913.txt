Leaving tonightNow that my family is away for the week, I think I will take my leave tonight.  I've got the note written and everything planned.  To make a long story short, I'm a 21 year old kissless virgin who has never worked a day in his life; in other words, it's nothing you haven't heard before on this subreddit.  I'm not even sure why I am posting here, but if you are reading this, please do not follow in my footsteps.  Please continue to help the people who post here and avoid wasting your time on me.

Farewell.
