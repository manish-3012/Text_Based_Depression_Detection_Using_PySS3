Death is the only cure i guessI really don't see the point of living. I know what life without depression is like. Work, do boring stuff, work , more boring stuff, until you die of old age or something, so even if depression didn't screw my entire life, it would still suck ass. It's a cruel fucking world and i honestly have no interest in being a part of it anymore. "You just need to be confident! Stop being such a pussy! You're just victimizing yourself" yeah whatever. It's just not worth it... Even if I was the most powerful, famous and attractive man alive, i would still be disgusted with this shit that we call life, because it's still cold and cruel and boring, and the few things that are good about it are considered bad habits and wastes of time. I mean sure death kinda sucks too but hey at least i don't have to spend 40 or 50 more years being shit on by all the "enlightened" people of this world who are apparently so virtuous that through "hard work" and "confidence" they achieved all their goals and are now happy and are in the relationships of their dreams, telling us how it's our fault for feeling like shit, and all that bullshit. Life is overrated, goals are overrated, success is overrated, girlfriends/boyfriends are overrated, sex is overrated and pretty much anything that is considered worth sacrificing for is overrated as fuck. There can be no hope for someone like me in life.

Just wanted to vent i guess, and see how many people could relate to this shitty situation. Hope you can understand something from what i wrote, and sorry for being weird.

tl;dr: life is overrated and it's just not worth it, no matter how successful you are.
