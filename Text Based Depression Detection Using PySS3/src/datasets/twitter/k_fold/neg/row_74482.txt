Feeling so good I want to kill myselfI've got bipolar, and I can feel myself ramping up into mania. But this time I just want to kill myself?? Like I want to get to the top of my emotional roller coaster and go out feeling great. I've got a couple of things to check off my bucket list, but other than that I'm ready. I give it 1-3 months.

I just got out of a voluntary inpatient stay a few months ago for a severe depression where I was gonna kill myself, and I'm glad I didn't go out in pain. But I'm ready now. Just waiting til it feels like my euphoria is peeking. I may be young, but this is just what I want to do.

Also, I see my therapist next week. How much can I tell her without being committed involuntarily? I can't take that prison again or the bill that comes with it, and I'll die afterwards anyways. Thanks!!
