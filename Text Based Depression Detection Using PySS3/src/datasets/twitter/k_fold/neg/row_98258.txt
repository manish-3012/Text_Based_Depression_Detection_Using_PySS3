I'm so overwhelmedSo, basically for the past 5 years or so, I was diagnosed with depressed and recently for the past few weeks it has just gotten worse, I've started having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts in the middle of class and have had to leave multiple times just to try to regain my composure. Everytime I did, people would stare and not at all ask if I were okay, but would give me weird looks. I've been dealing with some hard topics for the past few months or so and I believe that they play into my worsening depression. I recently was abandoned by my best friend of nearly two years, over some petty drama that could've been resolved easily, but he left and refuses to even talk to me ever again, I already don't have many friends and he was the only hope I had, everyday without him makes life so unbearable. I'm bad at making friends already as well. I don't have a great family, and I often get into large arguments with them and it always leaves me sobbing alone in my room. I've also been bullied for the past few weeks as well, some random boys in my school would often tell me rude things about my appearance and one time, one boy decided to slam the door on me as I was entering the school. Like , actually on my body, he slammed the door as hard as he possibly could and my ribs hurt quite a lot now. I as well have a constant fear of being abandoned and alone, and so far, my fears seem to be caving in on me, as it seems I'm feeling more and more alone everyday, wondering if there's even a point to life anymore. I've contemplated on hurting myself due to my constant loneliness and the fact no one seems to care, but I'm scared. I don't know what to do anymore.
