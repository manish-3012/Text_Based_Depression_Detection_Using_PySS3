I'm 18 I'm sorry for posting hereSorry. I'm 18 and I'm dropping out of school. I'm scum and I feel like a square peg in a round hole. I'm scared I won't even be able to find any kind of work - I only want to work a really shitty minimum wage job and just live alone in a small, rented home and then die. Every moment I feel so fucking out of place on this planet (I do have mild ASD) and so completely alone, I'll always be the wallflower on the sidelines. Trump has won the United States, the fascists are winning, and things are going to get so, so much worse. I can't stand to watch the sadness and the cruelty anymore and I just want to die because I am a fucking abomination. Sorry for posting here there are worthier ones you could help I am sure, I'm so sorry.
