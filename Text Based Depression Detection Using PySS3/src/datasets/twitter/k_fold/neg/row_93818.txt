Lost a shitload of money todayAnyone following financial news knows that the stock market had its biggest drop in years today.  I lost a fucking ton of money on some futures contracts.  If you don't know what those are, then consider yourself lucky.  Unfuckingbelievable, i wish i never heard about those.  They will fucking bankrupt you fast.  

Don't even try to say shit about how money isn't important.  I am 39 and never had a girlfriend, never kissed, never been on a date in my life.  I care about money because i have nobody else to care about.

Now i just lost an insane amount,  I will die lonely and poor.  Fuck that, just kill me already.  I'm serious.
