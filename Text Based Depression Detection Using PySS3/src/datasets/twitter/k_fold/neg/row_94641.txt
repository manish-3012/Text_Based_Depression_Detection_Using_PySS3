AloneI don't even want to post this, I'm being prodded to by a friend. They're basically all I have left anymore... I feel abandoned by basically everything, even life itself, and dismissed as another useless peice of garbage. I don't even like myself anymore, I just hurt everyone that knows me. I don't expect anyone to actually be able to help if it's any consolation, all the anti depressants and therapy never did anything so I can't ask any more of anyone on a random sub Reddit. I can't even blame you if you don't want to try and save me, I'm not worth it anyways.
