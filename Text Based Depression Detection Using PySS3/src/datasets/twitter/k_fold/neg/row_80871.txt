Had to put off my suicide, feeling extra lostI was totally set to finally end it. Saw my family for the first time in a while, saw my old good friends for the first time in a while, had good holidays for once, I was totally ready. Feeling good for the first time in months. Note written, method planned, day picked- everything. And then something happened, and my SO had to lean on me, and I had to put it off. Now I just feel even more lost and like I don't know what to do. I haven't done anything that I should have (bills, school, other adult stuff) because I wasn't going to need it done. I have even more anxiety thinking about what's going to happen when my vacation ends. I think about school starting again, having to step through those doors, and I just feel so completely miserable and hopeless and like total shit.

Just needed to throw this out into the void.
