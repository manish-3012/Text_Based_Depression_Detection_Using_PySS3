Does anyone else struggle with wanting to kill themselves on their birthday?Todayâ€™s my 22nd birthday and for as long as I could remember Iâ€™ve thought about killing myself at every birthday since I was 12. 

It hasnâ€™t happened yet probably because I have a support system... not a perfect one but I have it. And thatâ€™s more than some people. 

If I can make it past this day... I still donâ€™t feel safe
