I just contemplated hanging myself in the bathroom. I've never felt this alone in my life. I want the pain to stop.I had my laptop charger cord out and was testing the strength of the support poles and just broke down crying. My ex fiancÃ©e who was my best friend is now blowing me off like she doesn't care if I exist, when just a week ago she told me she still loved me and hoped she'd still end up with me. Now she has new friends and ignoring me.

My best friend just cut me off and told me she's done with me. I lost my job. I've been getting stalked by people. I had to move back home with my parents who are always fighting and very negative. I have no friends anymore. I'm a burden to everyone in my life and I'm just unwell. I'm not a good friend, I'm not a good partner, and I'm not a good person.

I'm tired of feeling alone. I'm so fucking tired. I'm desperate. I have nothing.
