How does losing a parent effect small children?I have a 7 year old that lives with her mother but visits me every weekend.  She is the only reason I am here.  

I first started to think about the idea when she was two years old, following the divorce with her mother.  I never really got a clear reason from her.  I just felt a change in her, confronted her about it, and suddenly we were separated, followed by the divorce six months later.   I guess her mother decided she couldn't or didn't want to help me with my issues.

So anyways, my daughter is the only reason I'm still here.  I guess not because of her but because I don't want to increase the likelihood that someday she will come to the conclusion that this is an option for her to consider.  It sounds silly that I would care because I would be already gone and clearly I support the option for myself.

I wish I bailed on her at two before she could remember anything.  I wish that I had died in Iraq before she was a thought.  I wish I could zap her memory of me.  I don't care about anything until I get to her.  I get to the point of being ready but then that thought of her doing as I do invades me every fucking time.  

Over the passed year I have been slightly withdrawing the amount of time we spend together.  I've made excuses as to why I can't take her on the weekend or hyped up the weekend with grandma.  She has a new soon to be stepfather along with new siblings.  She would have a really strong support network while growing up.  Maybe things would work out for her.  Not knowing for sure is ruining it for me.
