iâ€™m giving them 3 hours.3 hours. 3 hours for the people who â€œcareâ€ about me to reach out to me. when they donâ€™t, and i know they wonâ€™t, iâ€™m killing myself. iâ€™m sick of living this life where people pretend to care about my issues but never go out of their damn way to prove it. telling me to talk to my therapist every time iâ€™m upset about something isnâ€™t caring. telling me to change my meds every time iâ€™m upset about somehing isnâ€™t caring. telling me to â€œget a job and maybe iâ€™ll feel betterâ€ isnâ€™t caring. telling me iâ€™m gross because i havenâ€™t been able to wash my hair in weeks because of how depressed i am isnâ€™t caring. telling me iâ€™m super obese when iâ€™m under 200 pounds isnâ€™t caring. bringing up a cat i got attached to at a petstore repeatedly days after when you wonâ€™t adopt her and told me to get my own place (i canâ€™t because i canâ€™t work and they know this.) if i want a pet isnâ€™t caring!! NONE OF IT IS CARING. I AM CONVINCED THESE PEOPLE WANT ME TO DIE AND THEYâ€™LL GET WHAT THEY WANT SOON.
