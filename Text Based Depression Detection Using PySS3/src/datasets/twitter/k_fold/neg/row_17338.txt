Just a wasteI was given everything in life and it wasnâ€™t enough. Parents who care and do support me, close friends I have had for my whole life, college is coming to an end, a girlfriend who loves me. I have been given all of this but I donâ€™t want any of it, I just want to go. I thought I just needed a stable job, friend hooks me up with someone to work for. I just need a girlfriend and things will feel better. One shows up but itâ€™s not enough. Nothing can hide the fact that there is something wrong with me. These horrible thoughts I have been having were supposed to have been outgrown. The dreams I have been having shouldnâ€™t be, the things I have been doing when no one is watching shouldnâ€™t be happening. Itâ€™s time for me to go, I almost wish people knew that I deserved it
