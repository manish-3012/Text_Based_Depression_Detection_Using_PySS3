I need advice on how to handle thisSorry if i sound blunt about things im not good at â€˜expressing over textâ€™ 

So im pretty sure a friend of mine is going to end their life, soon idk when. And im trying to help them the best i can. But since Iâ€™ve had my own issues before some of the things they say are triggering my own stuff and i try and get past it but itâ€™s difficult, I donâ€™t know what to say to them to try and get them not to, they keep saying people donâ€™t care and they keep saying that I donâ€™t care when I donâ€™t reply to any of their messages(some of these are at 3am when im asleep). Im trying my best but I donâ€™t know what to do, i want to answer but I canâ€™t find the words, I donâ€™t want to get mad at them and make it worse and thereâ€™s this â€˜voiceâ€™ in my head that tells me to just leave them be and let them do it but I donâ€™t want to listen to it. 

I donâ€™t know what to do and im sorry but most of that is just ramblings but im really worried. I want to help them
