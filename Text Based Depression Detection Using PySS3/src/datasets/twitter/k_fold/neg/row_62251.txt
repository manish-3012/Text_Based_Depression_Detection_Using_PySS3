Dear MomI figured I should write her note first. Kind of makes this whole thing solid, right?

She told me that if I fuck up again I have to come home. But Jesus Christ I'm always so miserable there.

She told me that my life is fine and I have nothing to be depressed about.

She doesn't know that my ex boyfriend was abusive. She doesn't think about how I used to watch her and my father beat the shit out of each other. She doesn't consider the fact that locking me in a room with 5 other kids while she went out to drink all night would fuck me up in any way. It happened every night for about a year. She doesn't think about how my sister was so desperate to leave that she told CPS that my mom beats her.

I'm one of those basic "Smart middle school kid turned depressed high schooler." I'm failing algebra II, and I'm falling behind in biology. I'm not going to college. I won't be around that long. 

I imagine death like I imagine the blackness before birth. No pain, no thoughts, just nothing.

I'm sorry.
