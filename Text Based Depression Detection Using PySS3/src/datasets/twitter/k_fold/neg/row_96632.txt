Drastic Times Call For Drastic Measures. Okay so I guess this post is kind of an improvisation of my real suicide note. I didn't know what I wanted to write so I want to type it instead and reevaluate some ideas for what I should actually write. Well, I'm currently 16 years old and a male, and I despise life and what it has offered me in these past 16 years. I was never diagnosed to see if I have this mental disability but I believe I have clinical depression. I've been heavily depressed for years and it has broken me down severely. I don't have a bright future ahead of me and I don't have any loved ones or friends. For these past years I have just sat in my room all day and just play video games and surf the net. I wasn't always like this, but even when I tried to be outgoing it didn't work out at all. I'm not intelligent, funny, attractive, and so forth. I understand that I may only be 16, but trust me, it wouldn't workout in the near future or present at all. I have suicidal ideations and tendencies everyday, however, I don't self harm or anything similar to that as I would just like to commit suicide rather than delay it with harming. The only problem is that I don't have any necessary materials or methods that would quicken my death. I want to do it by firearm but I have no access to one. Also, I can't ask for one since that would put that certain individual in deep trouble with the authorities for assisted suicide. I've never been in an intimate relationship as well, and nor have I ever had any intimate contact with the other sex. Also, I'm an immigrant that came to the states so sometimes I get racially profiled. Additionally, there are other certain circumstances that have put me in the position I am in today but those are a bit personal. And, it's quite a lot as well. I do not fear the thought of dying or knowing where I'll end up as soon as I become deceased. I just believe that I'll be in a pit of nothingness, with nothing around me and where I won't be able to feel anything. I understand that others will object to my decision and tell me that there is more out there for me, but there really isn't. I've tried to instill a new better perspective within myself but it's just not worth it anymore. I wouldn't wish this feeling or this life for that matter on anyone. I apologize if you find this post rather heartbreaking and harsh but it is what's best for me. If life had actually gotten better, then I wouldn't even consider this "solution." There are people who get a good life no matter what, and then there are the unfortunate ones who suffer. I'm just tired of my existence and having to wake up to the same feeling and situation everyday. I can't withstand the pressures given onto me nor the burden that I'm still alive. So, yeah, I guess this is a rough draft for my real note.
