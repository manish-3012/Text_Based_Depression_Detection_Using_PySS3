Here's a different one.Most of what I've seen while lurking here has been a more pessimistic outlook on life, along the lines not having a job and friends. I'm Having a different issue. I don't know what is real and fiction anymore. I have these confusing delusions about killing myself and waking up in a new dimension where I can be something better than I was here, or waking up "matrix-style". I've been looking for help but at this point I don't know how to tie myself back down to this reality. Trying anything I can includes posting here so please. I don't want to kill myself if I am just crazy.
