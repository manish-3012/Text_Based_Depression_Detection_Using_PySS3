"Because you were put on this Earth for a reason."I hate hearing this yet again, because it makes me feel even worse. That's the problem. I don't want to be HERE. I don't want to be on Earth. I wish I had been placed somewhere else. So, to say I was put on THIS EARTH for a reason doesn't help me at all, or make me want to kill myself any less.
