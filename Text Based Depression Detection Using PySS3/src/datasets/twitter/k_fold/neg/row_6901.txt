Hi I donâ€™t know why I keep thinking about killing myselfI donâ€™t know why I think about it a lot. Like I think about life choices and they I think about the negative impact it would have and I quite often think I should end my life. Itâ€™s like a though train always ends up at the same station. Donâ€™t know if I should even talk about it
