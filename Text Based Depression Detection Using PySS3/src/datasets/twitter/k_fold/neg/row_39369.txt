I hate myself and I don't know who in my family to believe.Everyone in my life tries to change my view on why my parents divorced. My mom cheated on my dad hen i was about 10. I didnt find out till I was 17 and now I feel sorry for my dad but my mom is trying to make me feel bad for her. I really honestly hate my mom. it affects my relationships with women now. My thoughts of just ending it and making it less complicated for everyone and myself and school is driving me crazy. I just don't know what to anymore. I am getting more violent tendencies, I have breakdowns every other week and it is scaring me.

I don't want to hate my mom, I just wish everyone loved each other.
