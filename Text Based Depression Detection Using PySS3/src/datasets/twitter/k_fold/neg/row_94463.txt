I need advice. I need motivation. I need someone to fucking talk to.I was a super bright student. My dad saw the potential in me and spent tons of money for me to go to a fancy international high school that would open up my path to big universities like Yale and Harvard.

You know what I did with that opportunity? I fucked it up. I procrastinated, spent my days in smoking weed and drinking, to the point where I was suspended from the school for breaking the rules. My dad being a strict man with a short fuse was furious, but he let it go. As long as I got into a good college with a good scholarship, right?

I refused to learn my lesson and didn't improve. I fucked up so bad that I turned in an assignment late and was denied for my diploma. Add onto that, I got into what my dad calls "low-level" colleges and he refused to let me enroll in them.
Now, I'm at home, living with my parents, doing jackshit at home, having to take an involuntary gap year because I can't go to college without financial aid.

Here's how I got to my breaking point:
Recently, I was rejected from a college and my dad blew a gasket. He blamed me for fucking up my life and I've never felt like a bigger piece of shit. I will never get out of this house. I will never get out of this fucking country

I live in a third world country where there are no opportunities to move out or do something about anything. I'm well and truly fucked. I want to die. I have nothing left for me, only misery and my father's disappointment and rage. Please, I need someone to talk to. I just hate this constant pain in my heart.
