Not ready to do anything crazy, but exhausted and curious.I am the youngest of 3 I am and a manipulative pathetic weight on my entire family's life. As much as I want to give up I won't. The reason I won't kill myself is I have personally felt the wrath of a loved one killing them selfs. I never want to subject my family to the bourdon and pain of me killing myself. At the same time sometimes I think I am so pathetic that the shock of suicide may be easier than another 20+ years of me being a scumbag family member.
