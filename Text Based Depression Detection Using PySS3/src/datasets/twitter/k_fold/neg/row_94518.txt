Itâ€™s too late for meNote: Iâ€™m not a poet, and Iâ€™m not sharing this because I want people to think Iâ€™m a good writer or interesting or anything like that, I just wrote it a while ago and I havenâ€™t found a better way to express how I feel. 

Itâ€™s too late for me

Theyâ€™re reaching down trying to pull me out
But itâ€™s too late for me

I hear them calling from above
Telling me it gets easier
But itâ€™s too late for me

My hand grips the edge of the cliff
Theyâ€™re trying to keep me from slipping
But what they donâ€™t realize is
Itâ€™s too late for me

I look down towards my inevitable end
The hungry ground waiting to swallow me up
And get rid of all my hurt
Get rid of all my pain

Iâ€™m already falling
And in the moments before everything ends
I finally feel true happiness 
Because they finally know
Itâ€™s too late for me
