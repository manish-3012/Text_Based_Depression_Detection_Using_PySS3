I drank againAnd wouldn't you know it, the most miraculous thing happened. I can't get drunk. I drank and I drank and nothing happened. Maybe years and years of abusing just made me numb to it. Maybe I'm just too sad that even the sweet embrace of alcohol cannot bring me up again. I feel so miserable. I sobbed in the shower so hard I couldn't breathe. I don't know how I'm gonna get out of this. I could call my sister but that would mean letting my whole family know I relapsed again. And I cannot go home anymore. If I do, I'll have to face my girlfriend who knows I'm a sex addict now. Either way I lose. Maybe my only option is to just smash a bottle open and slice my wrists. But I can't do that. Because then I'd just be a coward. I already feel like one. So I'll just sit here drinking and hating myself again
