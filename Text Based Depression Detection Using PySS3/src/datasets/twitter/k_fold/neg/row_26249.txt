Life is good in a technical sense why do I still want to die.I have one of my dream cars, money isnâ€™t an issue for me. I have a nice house, I have friends that care about me. My life is going good, I have people constantly tell me that they wish things would be going good for them like they are for me. There isnâ€™t anything â€œwrongâ€ in my life yet I still want to die every night. I danced with death tonight actually, I was surrounded by good friends all day long and it was going good but when it was time to go home I just got overwhelmed with sadness and on a long empty road I went 140MPH heading towards a dead end up last minute I braked. No matter how good my life gets no matter how much I accomplish nothing fills the void in my life and I know like one of my favorite artist said â€œSuicide only thing thatâ€™s gonna gratify this urge to leaveâ€. Why canâ€™t I be happy when I have every reason to be.
