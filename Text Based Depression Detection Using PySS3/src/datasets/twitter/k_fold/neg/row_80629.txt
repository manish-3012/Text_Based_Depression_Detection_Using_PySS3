The weight of it, thoughIâ€™ve said it before, I always have a reason not to, always.
But sometimes the reason to is so much heavier and my weight limit is still not that high. I would throw it away, itâ€™s not that important to me. 
I go on, because I promised I would. Iâ€™m lazy for myself, and only work hard for others, and thatâ€™s how itâ€™s always been. Somehow, I feel Iâ€™ve become a martyr by not dying.
