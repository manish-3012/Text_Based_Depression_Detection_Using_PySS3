I just want to hurt myself and dieI'm in so much distress emotionally, I wouldn't mind dying a horrific death right now. I'm close to cutting. I've briefly contemplated jumping off a bridge, driving my car into a wall, something.. 

I'm just tired of this life, tired of being hurt. No one loves me, not many even think I'm worth being kind to. I'm just a game, a joke for everyone to toy with. 

If I don't deserve human decency surely I deserve to die in a painful chaotic way. At least everyone will see my inner turmoil. Then they'll get the point. I'm human and I feel pain.
