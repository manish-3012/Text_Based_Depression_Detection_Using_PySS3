Peolpe aren't there when you need it the mostI just want to kill myself because no one is actually helpful. People don't understand you and they judge you. I'm just a loser without a job but still wants other people to love and accept me. It's all hopeless and the more time goes on and the older I get the more people will just see me as a pathetic loser. I should kill myself soon because no one is gonna be there for me when I need it the most and I don't want to live in a world where nobody cares about you.
