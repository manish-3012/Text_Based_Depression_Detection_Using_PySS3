Thinking of writing my own will.I'm about to turn 18. I've started thinking of killing myself regularly again about 2 weeks ago, and I've already thought of who gets my stuff, how I get buried (no embalming, same day), and what to do on my funeral. I can't assure any of those right now since I don't have a will, I don't want anyone to spend money on my death. I guess if I wait a little bit longer, I could, but I'm really thinking of doing it now.
