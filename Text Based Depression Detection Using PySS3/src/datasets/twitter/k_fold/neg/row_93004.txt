Suicidal over every minor thing -- but today I fucked up for real and Im about doneAll I wanted to do was paint my nails but then nail polish got on the carpet but i didnt take that for an answer so I kept trying to paint them and i spilled acetone all over the fucking table and now its all fucked up. My parents will be home in 9 days but I dont have a car and i dont have anything to fix this. I really want to end it all I can't let them take everything away from me and kick me out (im 19) im sorry if this isnt the right place i just feel so helpless
