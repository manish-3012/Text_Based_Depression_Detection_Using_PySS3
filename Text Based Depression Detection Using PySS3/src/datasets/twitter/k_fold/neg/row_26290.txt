I attempted suicide.[trigger warning: suicide attempt]

Itâ€™s been 4 days since my suicide attempt and I just got out of the hospital yesterday. I donâ€™t know what I should do. How do you live again knowing that you hurt so many people? How do you live with the pain that you traumatized your family and friends? Most importantly, how do you stop yourself from wanting to try again? Right now, all I can think of are negative thoughts... I just want things to go back to normal â€” when I didnâ€™t want to die and when I was still happy with my life. Any form of help is greatly appreciated. Btw, jsyk, I visit my psych regularly, I take meds on time, I do breathing exercises and I listen to podcasts and articles about living with bipolar disorder. I just donâ€™t want to be a slave to my illness anymore. I donâ€™t want to feel so helpless. What more can I do to better my situation?
