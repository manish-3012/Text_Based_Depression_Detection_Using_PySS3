am i a terrible person? is suicide the only way out of this?lately i've been feeling suicidal. this is a long post, apologies in advance. i have a habit of getting very jealous and insecure in relationships, and when they end i go off the deepend. i am in my late 30s, by the way, and American. my last relationship ended a year ago. i had moved back to my hometown to be with someone although i didn;'t make any new friends. I was very isolated. I got pregnant and had an abortion, I was very depressed. He was very unsympathetic. He categorized me as a monster, a terrible person, a jealous person. He rejected me eventually after two years and it has destroyed me. I have dated other people and made a few new friends but I feel awful and want to die every day. I;m afraid to go places where I might see him or his friends, which in this small city is everywhere. Recently I told people that he physically abused me. He had but I exaggerated for sympathy, No one believes me and now I feel even more afraid to go anywhere, I'm too poor to move again and my family is here anyway, I don;t have any good friends and I am exhausted, I feel like ending my life is the only way to stop this happening again. I'm so depressed I can;t see a way out or how anything can change.
