its not selfish to want to dieI hate when people tell me this, that its selfish of me to kill myself, isn't it more selfish anyway to not accept someone wants to do it? Because people in reality don't fucking care at all, they're more worried about having it on their conscience that someone killed themselves rather than wanting that person back in their life, I've grown so tired of all this, I'm not going to bother suffering anymore, who wants to put up with a lifetime of misery.
