If I Can't Function Tomorrow I'm DoneI cannot function properly, haven't cleaned my room for months and still got dishes for 2 weeks ago, I have a list of 2000 things to do.

I love doing these things and being productive, but I just can't, it feels like I got severe brain damage.
Everything is shit.

I have so many regrets because I didn't do things, there's so much that I want to do but I can't because my body is failing like I'm 110 years old or something but I'm only 18.
I have no control.



If I can't do this shit tomorrow, and if my head keeps screaming at me, then I'm officially done with life.



Anyone I try to explain this to wont understand anything, I have never heard anyone have the same problem as me and I think I'm the only one.
Probably because I've hit my head so many times as a kid and now I do it on purpose.
