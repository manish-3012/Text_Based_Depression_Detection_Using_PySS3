I need someone to talk toI'm 27. I was abbandoned by my dad at birth. When I was about 6, my step father started molesting me. My mom died when I was 12 and he was a suspect. Not only was he never investigated, but he kicked me out of the house when I was 16 and took the money my mom had left me.

At this point in the story I already thought my life was broken.

10 years later my bf has cheated on me. Five times. I'm usually proud of how I have been able to hold myself through all this shit, but now I'm too weak to fight back. I can't keep going whith this relationship, because I feel jealousy is driving me insine. But I can't gather the strength to break up, I have no one else.

As If it wasn't enough, last year I was diagnosed whith a painful psychosomatic disease.

I'm starting to feel every hit is worst than the last, and I feel cornered. I could really use someone to talk to other than the liar I live with.
