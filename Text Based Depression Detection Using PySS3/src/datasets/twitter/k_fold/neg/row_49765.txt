I'll sleep when you're dead.This might be out of place to put here, by all means vote me down if that's the case. I've never been in the same situation any of you are in, but one of my favourite people has, and I thought I'd share a poem he wrote to his previously suicidal self.  
  
He is very angry at himself.

"How dare you assume that I'll sleep when you're dead  
This is well outside the boundries of acceptable behaviour  
I will not give you the go ahead, you will not be remembered fondly   
I'm throwing down the gauntlet, fuck you this isn't your decision  
And for all the holy fuck I give, your little spectacle is ended  
But dont think for just one second you've honored your obligations to me  
I'm serious look in my eyes, I don't find this funny   
Or whatever you imagine poetry and justice feels like when you combine them  
I am not going to allow this on my watch buddy, nobodies impressed  
With your imagined sacrifice device or insurmountable regret  
You are not uniquely pained and if you go we won't be sorry  
And who the hell are you to put me through the banality of watching this  
Cause many better men have gone for clearly better reasons and I  
Starkly must remind you that you have not even been trying  
And that's the only thing remarkable about you, stop me if I'm lying  
  
We are always outnumbered but we were never out militiad  
There's no dignity for criminals, no ministry for the wicked  
In this town if you make a sound you're the leper with the most fingers  
The League of Extraordinary Nobodies, the other teams bringing in ringers  
No faith in the majority, no hope for the little ones  
Sally pulled a pistol out, billy got a blunderbous  
So what the fuck are you feeling that makes your struggle so wonderous?  
Enough to arrogantly pull what's left of the rug out from under us?  
I think not, you're in the same barrel all us other crabs are caught  
And if I have to live, you have to live; whether you like this shit or not"
