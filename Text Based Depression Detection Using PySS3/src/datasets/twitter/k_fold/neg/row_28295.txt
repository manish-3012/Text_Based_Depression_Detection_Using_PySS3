I think I'm ready to go I've been thinking the past two or  so weeks, and I think I'm ready to go.  The way I am now, the person I'm turning into. And what's expected of me. It's not for me. I'm gonna go  
I'm too fucked up for relationships with anyone, I'm dead inside . And I want to end it before I completely turn bad, before I'm completely destroyed. The future isn't for me, I'm not normal, whole, or stable enough for it
