I was molested by my father and was taken away from my family for a while. I cannot bare the pain anymore.I cannot find any reason for living. When I was eight, I woke up to feel my father touching me (I am a female, I know my username says Iâ€™m a dude). I was afraid, I didnâ€™t know what to do. I was trying to decide wether I get up and confront him or move a little so that he would move his hand from me. I chose the second option, he immediately moved his hand and started patting my head and told me to hush. A year later, I told my mom about this, she didnâ€™t believe me. She asked my dad and he said no. That nothing had happened. Years pass and I was 13 when I told my mom again. Still no one believed me. My brothers, my sisters, my aunts and uncles. No one. 

Later I told my school counselor. I didnâ€™t know what was happening, but she was calling CPS. Cops came and some woman came to the school as well. Taking me away. I was put with two ladies and 9 children. I donâ€™t know how long I was there for but I felt miserable and guilty.  Everything was my fault. My mom told me to tell them that nothing had happened. If I didnâ€™t, I was never going to be with my family. So I lied. I was so ashamed that I had to. I cant stand it. I canâ€™t stand that I still live with my dad and family. I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m miserable. Please. I want help, I want to be loved, and I want to die.
