I like being alone but I hate not feeling like I belong anywhere.I canâ€™t handle this world and itâ€™s ways. I think my trauma has changed how I react to people, I think everything someone is doing is to hurt me so instead I stay in my bubble. I want to be spontaneous again and live my life but I canâ€™t when I live in my head and feel depersonalised from *everything*. From my friends, my family, my pets, my home townâ€”I donâ€™t belong to any of it. I want it to end so bad and Iâ€™m the only one in control of that right now.
