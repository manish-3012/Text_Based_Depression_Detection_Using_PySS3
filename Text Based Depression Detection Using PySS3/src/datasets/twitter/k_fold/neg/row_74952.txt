Are people with autism just meant to kill themselves?So there really is no cure this time. Thereâ€™s treatment but why should I go through it when there are others who were given normal lives? Iâ€™m tired. I feel really trapped I canâ€™t handle college or getting a job. People judge me the moment I talk. I canâ€™t do basic things without being overwhelmed. Iâ€™m always self aware of whatâ€™s wrong to do in society but also donâ€™t know enough to act normal.
