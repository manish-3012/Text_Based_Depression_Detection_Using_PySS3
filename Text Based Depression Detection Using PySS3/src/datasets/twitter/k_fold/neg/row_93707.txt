Got a "Get out of jail" free card of sortsSome info about me. I am a 16 year old boy with Aspergers. My childhood was pretty much ruined by my experience with elementary school. Basically, my elementary school had a daycare of sorts with two adults watching over us and on the first day of my 1st year, the teacher, I guess, told everyone that I have Aspergers and from that day onward I was mocked and left as that one retarded kiddo. Never got a friend, never got nothing. Didn't help that during that time, I was playing some games and the favorite one, TF2 if you are interested, the one on which I was finally respected and which restored my sanity, was banned by my parents due to media backlash of the Anders Brejvik incident.
Fast forward to me being 12yo and having A LOT of faux passes behind me. I got a bit too conscious for my own good. I started thinking about afterlife, about how the world would be a better place without me, etc., but there was one thing keeping me from ending it instantly, my mother, who is a saint. She kept me going through and eventually i found a friend, got more charisma, was getting more attention and friends, life was getting better. But then my OG friend left for another school, I got waves of depression and sadness every single day. By the time this was happening, I was 13 and I thought about stabbing myself in the heart with the kitchen knife.
But I said no to myself and carried on. 
2 years later, the same waves resurfaced and this time they were stronger. I have developed a suicide plan executable at any moment. I would come to the school restrooms or any quiet place for that matter with my butterfly knife hidden inside my jacket and then stab myself in the heart and then proceed to bleed out. I have lost all reasons to even bother to protect my life and I might as well end it one day. 


Also, if that doesn't work I may be able to get a heart attack considering that I have chest pain every other day.
