I want a bus to hit me. I'm so frustrated with myself and I deserve nothing but pain.I'm a piece of shit. I'm 22 and I've never had a relationship. I'm failing all of my classes and I live with my mom. I eat like shit and I cannot do anything except wallow in my own pity. I'm an oxygen thief and I deserve to die. I need death. I'm just too scared to do the deed.
