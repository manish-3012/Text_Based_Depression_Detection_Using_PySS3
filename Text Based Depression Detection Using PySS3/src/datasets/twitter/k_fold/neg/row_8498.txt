I fulfilled the prophecyOnce before I yearned for death because my actions cost me the one I love.

Once again the one I wanted to love and to hold has given up on me. I'm a broken toy with no hope of repairing. All I do is hurt and ruin. I hope they can smile knowing my soul burns in the deepest crevices of the underworld forevermore. Now it is time for my final selfish act, my last splash of crimson upon the tapestry. 

This is the end. I love you Parker, and someday I know happiness will fill your life like you did with mine.
