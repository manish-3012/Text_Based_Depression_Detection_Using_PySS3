I canâ€™t continue living with mental illnessI feel like I have been robbed. Robbed of a happy childhood. Robbed of a happy life. Robbed of relationships that arenâ€™t destroyed by my mental health. Robbed of an existence that isnâ€™t marred by depression, anxiety, PTSD and borderline personality disorder. 

I am 27 now. I feel like I have tried enough. I have been in some form of mental health treatment since I was 17. I have taken the meds. I have done the therapy. I have made the lifestyle changes. Everything is still pointless. I am not â€˜getting betterâ€™, I just continue to fail at living. 

My future seems impossible. I donâ€™t know how to live a meaningful existence with a personality disorder that taints every waking minute. I donâ€™t know how to live with all of this emotional baggage.  I donâ€™t know how to live with the stigma around people with BPD. I donâ€™t know how to live with hating myself. 

Every other time I have attempted suicide it was because I was in the middle of a BPD episode and I was emotionally out of control. Now I am just resigned. Resigned to my life being worthless. Resigned to it not getting better. 

I canâ€™t.  Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t want to keep failing at trying to make my life better. I am so terrified of a future that involves living with this. This isnâ€™t a life worth living. It isnâ€™t fair to expect me to keep trying.

 I just canâ€™t do this anymore.
