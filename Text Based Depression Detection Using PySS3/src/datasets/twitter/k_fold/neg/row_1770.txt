So sick of being disabledWhat's the point of life as a disabled? I can't do stuff that normal people does and there is no joy in life anymore. Things are truly fucked when basic human function like being able to lift 50lbs is a gift. The genetic lottery is the ultimate evil and crispr is the cure. Disabled genes need to be wiped from the face of earth. Everyone deserves a normal human body!
