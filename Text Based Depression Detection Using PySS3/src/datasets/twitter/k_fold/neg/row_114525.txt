GooodbyeI have decided to kill myself today. Nothing is getting any better and I'm more suicidal than ever, I can't keep living like this I can't keep deciding which day to end it I can't be ambivalent anymore. I am seriously done with my shitty life.

I've been in therapy for 3 years and it's done nothing I'm still as suicidal as ever. I know everyone hates me I know I'm a huge inconvenience in people's lives, if I killed myself the world isn't going to stop for anyone, the next day will still come and people will move on. 

Today has pushed me over the edge, my friends were taking the absolute piss out of me and recording me when I was calling someone in distress. 

I'm fucking done I'm 100% fucking done with this shit life. 

See you on the other side!
