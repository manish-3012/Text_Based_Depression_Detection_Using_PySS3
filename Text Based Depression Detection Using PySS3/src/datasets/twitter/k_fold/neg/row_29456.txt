I can't deal with feeling guilty anymoreI've decided this is maybe my only solution which makes me probably a coward and ungrateful for everything I had in my life thanks to my parents. 
I have really loving parents who do a lot for me but so much in my life they barely know about has gone wrong.
I carry so much guilt over being not able to socialize right with others and hurting the people I love. I don't want to hide behind my mental illnesses but without them my life would be different and I could have so much I've dreamed of. 
I hurt others, I'm a huge disappointment to my parents and haven't achieved anything in life. I can't live with the guilt any longer of being not the child they deserve and being an awful friend for everyone.
