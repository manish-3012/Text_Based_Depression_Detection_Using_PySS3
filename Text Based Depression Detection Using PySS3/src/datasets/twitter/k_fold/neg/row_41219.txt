I was ready to go with you yesterday..What a coincidence..but instead I gotta learn to live â€œwithout youâ€. You totally went B&amp;C without me. Not cool.


You pulled me through some of my darkest moments in life. Thank you. Rip. You can finally be free. So you did figure out the riddle without me..


..without you, iâ€™d be lost at sea..
