Is there a "normal" amount of time to spend thinking about suicide?I'm relatively concerned that my world view has become tainted by the depression memes that the internet has to offer. I understand that there are points where it flashes through everyone's mind occasionally but is the constant thought there as much as memes make it out to be for everyone?
