My ex may have killed herself tonight.She has been suicidal ever since our breakup. Today she was especially so and started saying very vague things and giving me her account information and passwords to stuff so that they "wouldn't go to waste."

Then she told me that she loved me and that she was sorry. That was the last thing she said to anyone.

I told my friend who lives in the same city as her (I moved away right after we broke up a couple months ago) what was going on and he called the police. They showed up and knocked on the door but no one answered. They didn't see any movement inside, but they didn't have probable cause to enter, supposedly.

Her car was still there so I'm 99% sure she was home. My friend called my ex's mother and has been trying to get in touch with people that live there and know her, but no one has responded.

This has all been happening the last few hours.

I have no idea if there's anything I can do, or anything I should have done. My friend and I are just freaking out and waiting because we don't know what else to do.
