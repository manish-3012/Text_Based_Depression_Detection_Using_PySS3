there's no way outive done everything wrong in the last 3 years. everything i could have done that would fuck me over i did. i wish i didnt. i didn't realize id be here today suffering. its my own fault. my own doing. i had everything laid out in front of me to do exactly what i was supposed to and have things be right... but i ruined it. ill never forgive myself. ill never recover. the heaviness in my heart and twist of guilt in my stomach will never go away. i ruined it. nobody but me. i ruined my own future... im leaving. im sorry. im posting as a last ditch effort to see some sort of hope maybe. i did this to myself. i dont wanna live with myself anymore.
