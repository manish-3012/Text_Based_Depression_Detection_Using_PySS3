Came pretty close yesterday, wrote this when I felt the worstMy computer is on its last legs. My beat up truck needs hundreds of dollars worth of work. I can't even walk into Walmart without wanting to run away screaming because of my anxiety. I am a defective human-being. I have had so many chances to succeed, and I've failed miserably each time. Worst of all, I am completely broke with no worthwhile future in sight. There is nothing to hope for anymore. This is what my life is now: a rerun. I drag down everyone around me no matter how hard they try to cheer me up. I am a swirling, black hole of depression sucking the joy out of everything and what's worse is I am a coward. I am afraid of everything and always angry. The least little thing sets me off. I am beyond tired of feeling this way. I want to be happy. I want to appreciate the nice little things in life, but I cannot. Growing up, stupid and childish as I was, I never once thought I would turn out this way. I never thought I'd be this much of a loser, this much of a disgrace. It's very hard for me to process it all. It's like I am living in a nightmare that I can't wake up from.
