My mom won't give me a chance to find a job. If I have to go to community college, I will commit suicide.I want to get a job and work for the semester instead of going to college. College makes me so miserable that I'd rather be dead.'I was going to a university, but went on a leave of absence because of bad grades. However, if I don't hear back from the places that I've applied to before the semester begins, my parents will force me to go to community college, where I will inevitably commit suicide. My psychiatrist warned my parents not to force me to go to community college, but my parents refused to listen to him.
