its been a while, big readi could write too much but basically i just cant handle anything anymore and my thoughts are beyond at the moment. recently i keep beating myself up physically to the point i am numb. i have suffered social anxiety to a scale of not wanting to go outside because of how it affected me.

i will try and describe this to you somehow in a few examples

- going to the beach looking at the horizon
- looking into the sky
- being around tall buildings (looking up at structures)

physics make me feel like i am melting/heart pulsing

there is alot more thoughts that occur all the time i am awake, i feel like a cave dweller and ive always tried to be positive about it.

i admit i have been neglective in the past but i just am simply not.

my parents have offered me numerous opportunities to go on holidays which i have completely turned down because of how i know i would be.

i am always urging for a bathroom when in public, i have turned down a free ticket to go to a concert most recently.

its been years with problems throughout school, gaming, friends, family, nobody around me


i have been super frustrated all of my time and that 0.1% of me which i rarely feel or even IF i feel myself i feel so upset about how i have acted.. i guess all of this makes me speak natural to people but i am just very upset with who i am.


another thing i am not happy with is me taking my anger out on other people on video games, i really regret telling people to kill themselves or cancer. something i just developed through nerd rage spending 18 hours a day playing world of warcraft or other games, ive been wanting to die and i know its not nice to see this from both views. i have been told the same but have took it onto the chin and just generally got a little thicker skin. i feel like i will just go to jail or something forever i hate everything. i never used to be so aggressive as a kid, i see old pictures of myself and even like 5 years ago i was pretty innocent with words :-(

(i just read about that michelle carter case and made me feel like the biggest piece of shit human too, i know she was in a relationship and gaming rage is different i suppose i dont know)


i am sorry to anyone again, my family, i always tried to express to cope with the dark void i was falling into every day. i am an idiot
