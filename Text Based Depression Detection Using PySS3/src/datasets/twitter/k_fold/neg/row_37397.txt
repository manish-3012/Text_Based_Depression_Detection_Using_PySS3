I just remembered somethingSo last year in grade 8 I finally worked up the confidence to ask this girl I liked out. So she pulls out her phone and says â€œsay that againâ€ before I finish so I do and she laughs and tells me to kill myself. So I leave and later everyone is telling me to check her insta where she recorded and posted it there. Itâ€™s still there to my knowledge and I genuinely fucking hate my life
