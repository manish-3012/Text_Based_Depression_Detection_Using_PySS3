I canâ€™t get over my mistakes in the past they eat me aliveI made truly Awful choices in my past and some even have hurt people. I live with guilt about it every single day and  I wish I could go back and fix these decisions but I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m a good or bad person Iâ€™m trying to change for the better. I feel no matter how good of a person I become in the future it wonâ€™t make up for what Iâ€™ve done in the past.
