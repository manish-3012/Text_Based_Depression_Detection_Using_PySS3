My life is going downhill every single day.I do know what to do anymore. I want to end my life. 

I've been stressed and depressed for the past year or two now, tried to hide it from everyone near me. The things that are happening to me are almost unbearable. 

I have almost burned my house down, my parent got into debt because of me. I dont feel like Im being loved anymore because the parent is now mad at me, it seems. The only person I love is my ex, and he is busy flirting with another girls and counting me as just a friend. I also have been crying a lot lately, I cut my wrists with a knife to tet rid of stress, and now I think that the only way to escape is to what I have to do.
