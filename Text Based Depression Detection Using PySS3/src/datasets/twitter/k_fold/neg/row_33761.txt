Dying in the Midwest.Just curious if there's anybody out there on reddit that wants to go together? I just want to help someone one last time before I die. I'm residing in minneapolis if that helps and do have access to a vehicle. Send me a private message if you're curious. 

Also I'm a guy if that's an issue.
