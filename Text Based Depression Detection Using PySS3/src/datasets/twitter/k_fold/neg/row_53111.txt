I don't even know anymore..     Hello all, for two years now I have been in pain constantly, I'm sad all the time and can't do anything about it, I guess it started when my family found out that my mom had diabetes, I know it's a slow process but I can't help but worry about her health all the time, I mean her blood sugar is in the six-hundreds every day..she shouldn't even be alive, but she is and I'm grateful for that... Well later on I found this girl that I instantly felt a connection with, We were together for a long time and I fell in love with her, then she decided she didn't love me anymore, Of course my heart was ripped out and I still miss everything about her. I'm just constantly in my own world, I tune out the everything and re-live all these things that keep happening to me in my head over and over again. I cut myself and do anything to get my mind off of this pain i feel. I do not intend to commit suicide because I don't want to feel that guilt of making my mother cry, But if she passes away I don't think I would be around for much longer.... Thank you for listening to my story.
