New years, alone and hanging by a threadIt's new years. I'm alone. I've been alone for the last three months since my SO left me. I've always been depressed, suicidal on and off since I was 14 years old, I'm 23 today. The last ten years I've been hurting, both physically and mentally, and I really don't know what to do with myself.  I've been considering to off myself actively for the last two months, but tonight, it feels like I'm ready to just take the car and drive it straight into a cliff or off a bridge, whatever, I don't even care anymore. I've got 92 cents on my account, I can't even afford food, so self starvation has been the only option I've had for the last two weeks. I can't see any kind of light, any kind of future. I've been considering walking the street and literally selling myself for both the self harm, but also for the sake of money, but I thoughts just keeps jumping back to that I'm too fat, too ugly and too worthless for love.

I'm in debt, I can't keep up on schoolwork since I'm in university, I can't eat, I can't sleep. I don't want to breathe. I'm a failure, and the only thing I'm good at is apparently hurting those around me. Why just don't take the step and do what my heart in fact want me to do. I want to die. I have nothing to live for, I have no future and nothing to wake up to.

I didn't mean for it to become this way.
