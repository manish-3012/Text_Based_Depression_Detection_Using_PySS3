Day before my graduationI am going to a prestigious private college this fall. I've studied for five years at my local junior college. My graduation from that JC is tomorrow. I'm an artist, and I've been selling more products than ever. My future looks bright, but I feel in more pain than ever before. 

I have OCD and Borderline Personality Disorder. My OCD causes me to have violent intrusive thoughts. When I was younger, I unfortunately endured a lot of sexual trauma. Now I have a complicated relationship with sex. I love sex, but I hate my body. I despise feeling lustful. My guilt and shame drives me to want to mutilate my body. I've had numerous intrusive thoughts recently about mutilating my genitalia. 

My Borderline Personality disorder causes me to avoid deep meaningful connection like a plague. Recently, I told my best friend her complaining was bothering me. She hasn't spoken to me in a week. We speak everyday. Her silence deeply bothers me. She's my only friend. 

My boyfriend has recently been very disturbed by my BPD and OCD. The suicidal gestures, accusations against him cheating on me (which are completely unfounded), and my overall inability to trust him has eroded his very being. He has agreed to give me one more chance in the relationship. He's going on a trip to a convention this weekend without me. We were planning to go together but he felt I hurt him too much recently.

My roommate is going to a festival this weekend. I have the house to myself. I feel completely alone and I want to die.

I'm currently cutting myself to release the pain I'm in.

I live very close to the Golden Gate Bridge. My plan is to drive there this evening and kill myself. I'm done enduring this pain.
