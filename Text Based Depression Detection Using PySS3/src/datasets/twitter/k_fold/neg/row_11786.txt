suicidal college student with absolutely no purpose in lifeI am very close to failing most of my classes. I have literally no purpose in life. Attempting to study triggers suicidal thoughts and I find myself procrastinating more often than not. I'm just not made to function in society. There's nothing I want in life except my own death. There isn't a single career path I want. I'd rather just kill myself.
