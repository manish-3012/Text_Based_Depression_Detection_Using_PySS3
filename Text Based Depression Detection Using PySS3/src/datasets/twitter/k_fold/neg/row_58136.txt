Drunken poetry (please ignore)3 AM
Pounding white claws at my parentsâ€™
I donâ€™t dream for the press of your warm lips
I dream for the press of a cold barrel 

I switch to my parentsâ€™ gin
Thieving piece of shit wants what isnâ€™t his
Why should some people have while I go without
Feel like Iâ€™ve been wronged but my enemyâ€™s invisible 
Because without a mirror you canâ€™t see yourself

Everyoneâ€™s happy but me
Everyone gets what they need but me
I am the cursed one, the freak, the outcast
And my fate is to either smite them all or myself

They donâ€™t deserve pain, since to ignore me is no crime
I deserve this padded solitary confinement
I havenâ€™t paid for anything in my life
The drunken fool is his own kryptonite

I deserve hate
But I am a snake
I slither to where I am safe
And let others believe I am an angel

I canâ€™t hide forever
Because nothing is everlasting
Something great and terrible will happen
And nothing will stand in the way between the law of nature and myself

Everything has balance and my life has not obeyed
Your luck has run out
Face the music, smell the coffee
Fraud; heed your own sentence

She was a fluke, you were bound to walk alone
Let go of what was never meant to be
And rather obey natural order
And die when you deserve

Bullets will pierce your body
Whether metal or organic
Your feelings about it are irrelevant 
The world does not care

Some will weep, others will cheer
But you will not know the difference
For in the ground from which you were birthed
Nothingness births no sorrow

â€œHow could you do something as selfish as suicide?!?â€

â€œHe was a good kid, I didnâ€™t see this coming at all!â€

â€œGood riddance, one less upper middle class prick taking resources away from those who worked hard and deserved itâ€

â€œThoughts and prayersâ€

â€œThoughts and prayersâ€

â€œThoughts and prayersâ€

â€œThoughts and prayersâ€

â€œThoughts and prayersâ€

â€œThoughts and prayersâ€





Please excuse my drunken rambling.
Iâ€™ll delete this tomorrow.
