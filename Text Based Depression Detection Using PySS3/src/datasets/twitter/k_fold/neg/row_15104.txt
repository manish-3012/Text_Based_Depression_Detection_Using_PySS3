I'm not interesting.I've spent everyday of the last 17 years wanting to die, every decision I've ever made has been the wrong one and I've fucked up my life.
I can barely function physically and mentally in normal society and there's no one around who cares, no friends, family don't care, no one.
I'll be 26 very soon and I've accomplished nothing, I don't really eat anymore, everything feels pointless.
I thought I could have hope in others but I've been abandoned and discarded over and over, I can't even muster up tears, it's just a blank exhaustion.
I know nothing will change if I die tomorrow, there won't be any impact on anyone.
Maybe I'll get lucky and tonight will be the last time I look at the ceiling and dream of this being over.
I don't really know what else to say.... just rambling I guess...
