i really wish i could take all of your pain...the pain of all the suicidal&amp;depressed peoplewhenever i scroll down this subreddit
i really feel so damn awful like
why would these humans suffer?
why? do we really deserve our depression? are these people that EVIL or BAD to deserve to feel this way?
getting emotionally tortured every damned day of their lives?
why?
i wish i could just take all your pain and misary inside of me and end me&amp;all the worlds pain with me
so no one would feel this hell ever again
maybe i at least can proudly say
that im not that useless after all
at lesst i could die happy
that i did good for this humanity
not dying a runaway coward useless asshole
