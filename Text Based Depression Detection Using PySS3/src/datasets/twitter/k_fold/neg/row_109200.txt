Today is the day for meIâ€™ve dealt with a lot and itâ€™s finally too much to go on. I had an abusive, alcoholic stepfather my entire childhood that left me with PTSD. I have OCD,  awful anxiety, and bipolar disorder that make it impossible for me to be in a relationship. Theyâ€™ve all been ruined by insecurity and belief that no one actually loves me as well as my inability to be rational. I met the woman of my dreams 3 months ago and I was so overwhelmed by it all I pushed her away due to my anxiety and overwhelming feelings that I was going to fuck it up. 

To quote one of my favorite movies, Her, â€œsometimes I feel like Iâ€™ve felt everything in gunna feel, and from here on out Iâ€™m only going to feel lesser versions of things Iâ€™ve already felt.â€ I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything left for me.

I have a loaded gun here and Iâ€™m getting drunk before I pull the trigger to make it easier. I have completely self destructed, due to things I cannot control, and my conscience canâ€™t take it. Death really can be a friend to people who suffer like this.
