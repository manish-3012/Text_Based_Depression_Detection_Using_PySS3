I feel like suicide is inevitable for me.28M here, I think suicide is inevitable, I'm a veteran in a suboxone program at my veterans medical center. While I still continue to see my psychiatrist once a week, I've kinda gave up on getting better. I just accept it, especially when people tell me what I'm feeling is temporary. Most people will disagree, but I honestly see suicide as the final way to end things. Sometimes I try pushing people away, atleast if I commit suicide maybe friends that I tried pushing away won't find out.
