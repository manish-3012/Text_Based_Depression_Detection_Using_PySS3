Itâ€™s just one thing after anotherI never get a break in my life. I have at least one traumatic experience a year while most other people havenâ€™t even gone through anything traumatic itâ€™s so unfair. And then small stuff happens constantlythat makes it 10x worse. I hate life so much and Iâ€™ve never wanted to die more.
