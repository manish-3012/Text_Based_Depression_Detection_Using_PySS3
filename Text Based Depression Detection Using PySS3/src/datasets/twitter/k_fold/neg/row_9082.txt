How do I stop this?I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on dealing with this, but long story short, my mother and sister found out I was raped (aaages ago) - I'm pretty sure they're in denial about things that have happened to them too. As I observed, whenever someone else is attacked, they label that person as damaged, weak and just use it against them whenever they later disagree on something, as though they are too broken to be deemed sane.

My mother dramatised it and made it about her. She keeps trying to confront me about it as though it's okay for her to ask surprise questions whenever \*she\* feels like it. Every time she does this I want to die more than ever, but demands she's entitled to know purely because of how we're related.

Firstly, for a lot of reasons I'm not going through again, I don't trust her at all. Over and over again she has proved she doesn't care. Also, when I tried to open up to her in the past about something she always threw it back in my face. Of course she denies all of this when I try to explain. At this point, idea of sharing a single thing to her about anything remotely personal makes me feel so ill. 

I would really appreciate it if someone who can relate can give me any advice on this. How do I get her to stop?
