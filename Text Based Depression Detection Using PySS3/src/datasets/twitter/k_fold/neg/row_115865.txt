COVID can help me dieIf I do it soon, less of a chance they'll want to save me or even be able to. Hospital ICU beds are filling up again because of another pandemic surge in my area; they are probably running out of ventilators soon. Maybe they would let me die this time. I've been brainstorming what to write in my note to the hospital staff in a sealed envelope that I'll have on me when I'm found. I'm in healthcare, too. Or was? Even in my death I'll be a waste of breath, effort and space. Just how I lived my life. Maybe if my letter is good enough, they won't hate me as much after. I'm not doing it tonight though, don't worry guys (if anybody even reads this)
