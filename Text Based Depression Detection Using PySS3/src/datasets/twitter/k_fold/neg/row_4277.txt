for the first time ever, I am contemplating suicide.I dont really know what to write other than the fact that for the first time in my 23 years I am actually contemplating suicide. Ive been unhappy for a while now since early 2013, ive been on a long downward spiral and im losing faith that I will ever feel better about my life. I am not ~~capable~~ willing to work 40+ hours a week to make barely enough money just to be able to barely afford to do it all again next week. Where does it end. Im fat and have no confidence in myself. I have a rotting tooth, no insurance and no chance of having it fixed. I also cant afford to live with anyone but my parents and they just make me feel worse. im really reaching my breaking point and im not sure what I will do. the thought of not having to deal with this bullshit anymore is intriguing though thats for sure.
