I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with meHi. A little background might be needed. I tried to commit suicide twice before, my parents stopped me before I could do any lasting damage but I had to go through months of hospitalization both inpatient and outpatient. Recently though... I donâ€™t know I just have this overwhelming urge to hurt myself badly. In the previous cases Iâ€™ve had months of buildup to it. Months of feeling shitty, of wanting to die, of overall being unpleasant. But this time thereâ€™s nothing, just me wanting to kill myself. My therapist says theyâ€™re just intrusive thoughts and that I should ignore them but itâ€™s so fucking hard to. Iâ€™ve had intrusive thoughts before but never followed by such a strong urge. Iâ€™ve already tried to take more of my antipsychotics than Iâ€™m supposed to earlier this week, and I regret not filling my mouth up with those pills and dying. I live with my family and have asked them to hide my medicine away from me. But it seems like every other night I try looking for them with the intention to swallow them all. Idk, I donâ€™t wanna die, but I just wanna kill myself. I know that doesnâ€™t make sense but I wanna know if someone can help me, tell me why I have this urge to die so much. Maybe itâ€™s a side effect from my medicine but I donâ€™t know anymore. For those interested Iâ€™m on 40 mg Geodon and 45 mg of Prozac.
