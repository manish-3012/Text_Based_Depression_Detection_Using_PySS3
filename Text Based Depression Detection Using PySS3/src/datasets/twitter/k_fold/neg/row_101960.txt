Is this to be my life?A hopeless, pointless, loveless trudge through unending days and sleepless nights? An existence where I am tormented at every step by the ghosts of my past and the increasingly fading tunnel-ending light that represents a future I know will never exist? I knew long ago that my life had no inherent purpose and decided that I would have to create my own. But at the end of each day, I am reminded that I have failed. So many people have told me that I have to be the avenue of change, that I am the only one that can fix it; what am I supposed to do if I lack any ability or motivation to do so? Simply wait until something changes, suffering for a mere possibility?

More and more I am realising that I no longer have a way out of this horrific mire. Maybe if I had gone for help sooner instead of being a 'man', maybe if I had not made the mistake of trusting those who had proven themselves untrustable, maybe if I had not been so blindingly stupid as to ignore my own emotions, I may have been in a different position. But now, I have no solution. It is entirely unrealistic to rely on others for happiness but in my case completely impossible to rely on myself for it. Even if I was capable of running I have nowhere to run to. I feel like all I am doing by encompassing myself in music and video games is delaying the inevitable.

So tell me; why should I keep suffering? When nothing can bring me happiness, what is the point of even continuing to exist? My life as a being in the society into which I have been born is valueless, and I am reminded of this on a continual basis. My life as a being in the universe into which I have been born is of utterly infinitesmal importance, to the point of being nil, and I am reminded of this on a continual basis as well. There are no scenarios I can see in which my continued life is beneficial to anyone.

So at what point can I just give up and leave?
