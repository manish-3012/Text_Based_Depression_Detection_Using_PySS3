Just bought a gun online and now I'm waiting for it to get here.School isn't going well (in college) and I don't have enough money to pay and I dont want to tell my folks because they want to retire and I  dont want to disappoint them. I just feel like nothing i do makes me happy,what I'm studying, what I'm going to do what my future looks bleak, and this seems like the best option. I've had dreams where i kill myself and each one is the same. I put the gun to my head and pull the trigger, i fall but my eyes are still working so I see myself falling to the ground and thats it. Except when I actually do it I know it'll be actually over.
