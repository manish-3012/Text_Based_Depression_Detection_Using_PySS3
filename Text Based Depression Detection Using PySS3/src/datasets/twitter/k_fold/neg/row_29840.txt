it feels like my meds are just masking my emotionsso I have anxiety and because of that I have depression, I guess it's severe?  because I don't get depressed I get suicidal. but anyway i'm on meds for that and for the first 6 months or so they worked and my anxiety was at normal levels and I wasn't depressed anymore, I stopped self harming and I was looking to the future but now it's a totally different story. i'm anxious, suicidal, depressed pretty much every day, and I started self harming again. rn i'm just sat on my bed shaking because I have school tomorrow and I can't bring myself to go, or do anything. 

basically I feel shit, but whenever i'm around people, I seem normal?? I suck at hiding my emotions, but it seems like now that i'm on meds and they've stopped working as well, I can hide them really well? I don't get it. I can laugh at jokes, hell even make a few, all the while planning to go home and off myself. I just don't understand and it's honestly frustrating. it's like i'm standing on the edge of a cliff and ahead of me is depression, behind me is being okay, and yet i'm right on the edge and I just really wish I could go one way or the other. i'm so frustrated. I just with my brain would choose one and go with it instead of throwing me around like this. one day I want to die, the next i'm perfectly okay. it's fucking exhausting. i'm sick of it
