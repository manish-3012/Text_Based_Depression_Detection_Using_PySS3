Everyone always worries but no one is willing to helpI didnâ€™t expect to post here tonight. I really prefer reading from the shadows and seeing â€œhey, this person feels exactly how I feelâ€. Iâ€™m caught in this limbo between caring about how others feel and caring about how fucking miserable being alive makes me. I lie in bed every night and think about how to do it. When I drive to work, I look for and debate on the best places to run my car off the road. If I see a gun or a concealed carry, the first thing I think about is suicide. I tell myself every day that Iâ€™m beyond the whole â€œtaking actionâ€ thing, that Iâ€™m not actually going to do anything. But I am overwhelmed every waking moment of my life with these thoughts of dying. And itâ€™s to the point where Iâ€™m desperate enough that I might do something about it. But I do worry about my husband. My mom. My brother. They would be wrecks without me. I know Iâ€™m loved and cared about (this is not an â€œeasily forgottenâ€ scenario) but that does not override the fact that I want to die. 

Context: I have PTSD from childhood rape/abuse on top of already being bipolar depressive. I have an ESA to help with the crushing loneliness, Iâ€™ve done hours upon hours of counseling, and Iâ€™ve tried anti-depressants in the past. In high school I was raped at gunpoint and tried to hang myself in the shed later that night. Iâ€™ve been cutting for years and have many scars to be ashamed of. I have severe panic attacks where I scratch my hands until they bleed. My most recent incident was carving â€œfailureâ€ into my thigh. It got so infected that I had to visit the ER amid this corona outbreak. They were so overwhelmed that this time I didnâ€™t even get that â€œare you suicidalâ€ speech from an overly kind nurse. They treated my leg and two hours later I was discharged. 

I donâ€™t like telling people my problems or whatâ€™s in my head- they always worry. Worry if Iâ€™m eating. Worry if Iâ€™ve done laundry in the last week or if theyâ€™re still a pile of dirty clothes building on the closet floor. Worry if Iâ€™ve showered or if Im sleeping. 
No, mom. I havenâ€™t eaten today or showered, or washed my clothes, or slept. When I weight my life against all of those futile things, which matters more? Iâ€™m alone in fighting to still be here and not a single person sees that. Not a single person offers to help. My husband always says he doesnâ€™t know what to do or say to make anything better. But worrying and then doing nothing feels like youâ€™ve already given up on me. And if everyoneâ€™s already given up make then... why havenâ€™t I given up on me too?
