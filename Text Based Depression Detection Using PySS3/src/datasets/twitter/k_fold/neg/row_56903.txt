My only friend just died. And it feels like itâ€™s my fault.So Iâ€™m not the most social person. So I donâ€™t have many friends. Well now I donâ€™t have any anymore. I know itâ€™s sad but my only friend was my dog Rufus. Iâ€™ve had him for 14 years. I took him in after my family disowned me for my drug usage. I just wanted to have a friend. Slowly I climbed back up and I was almost going back to being a normal fella in society. But now heâ€™s gone. He had a tumour and I just didnâ€™t have the money to pay for surgery. It feels like Iâ€™ve killed the only one I care about and the only one that cared about me. I know this might sound just exeggerated but Iâ€™ve thought about ending it al.
The bond I had with him and the years we spent together... idk what Iâ€™m trying to reach by typing this here. Perhaps putting this al into words calms my mind. Even now Iâ€™m struggling to post this. So if you see this. I bid you farewell.
