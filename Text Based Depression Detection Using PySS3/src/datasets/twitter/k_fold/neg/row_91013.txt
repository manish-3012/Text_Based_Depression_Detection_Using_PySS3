Want to die, still can't do itThe first time I attempted suicide was a little over a year ago. I tried again in August, a couple more times over Fall and several times in January before giving up until I can come up with a better option (most of the more "sure fire" methods aren't options for me, for various reasons). I was hospitalized for one of the attempts but was never particularly close to death.

I can't think of any more profoundly hopeless feeling than knowing you are incapable of even killing yourself. The fact that nobody in my "real" life will ever know about any of these attempts just makes it worse.
