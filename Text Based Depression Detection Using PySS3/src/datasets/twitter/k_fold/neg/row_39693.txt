beyondI want to die I believe the after live will either be infinitely numbing or  a new start or maybe something different from all those concepts that we believe in. Anyway I believe it will be better than my current state of existence. I never get anything out of live like I feel it should be, never enough. I'm guessing it's some sort of chemical imbalance that makes me the way I am. And I've accepted that there is no changing it.
