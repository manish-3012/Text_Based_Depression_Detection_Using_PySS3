i have set my suicide date, years from nowsaturday, november 27th, 2021. 11 AM, maybe


im a transgender man and my parents are getting the hint now, and since that's happened they've started telling me to die. they've started telling my brother to die. the only people they care about are each other. and if they don't die, or if i'm not away from those fucking asswipes in 6 goddamn years, then i'm not going to try anymore. 


maybe i'll die earlier, but i have no access to firearms. but my god, do i want to force my dad to watch me shoot myself. and i want to have something set so that once i'm gone, once they cant rescue me, then they're fucking exposed. a long letter, a long message, timed to upload on instagram, twitter, whatever, exposing all the shit they've done. all the shit they've said. all the shit they've driven my brother and i to do. 


but they'll bury me in a pretty fucking dress, and say im still religious, that i "was so caught up with *her* duties, praying",  that i was a good person and the best fucking *daughter*, and i won't be able to stop that. fuck no, that will not happen. your gay son is in that coffin. my funeral will not be an excuse for you to sit around with your best friends laughing.


and mom, fuck you. dad, fuck you. all my sisters, fuck all of you. and to my brother, i know what they've said, i know what they've done, and i'm with you. i'm with you all the way buddy, and they can't stop that. please dont be against me too


oh my god, i don't even have any friends, i could do it right now, i could do so much right now do i have a future
