My friend came close tonightMy best friend has schizophrenia, a bunch of medical problems that make it unlikely she'll live past age 30, a history of abusive and even semi rapist exes, and the most radically religious parents youll ever meet. The stress is starting to drive her insane, last night her whole body hurt and she was hearing voices and seeing animals in her room and she came inches away from overdosing. I am terrified I'm going to lose her, she's the best friend iv'e ever had and I cant live without her. Please, I need something I just don't know what
