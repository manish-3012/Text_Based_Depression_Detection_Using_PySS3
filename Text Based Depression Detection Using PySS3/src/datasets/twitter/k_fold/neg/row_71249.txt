Unending PainI want to die. There is no way I will recover from what they did to me. There is no safety. I cannot stop reliving what they did to me. Each new day brings only the same old memories of being tortured by them. There is no one I can talk to about what they did to me. Why won't they leave me alone? Why me? It hurts so badly. I want nothing more than to die. Please, someone, help me die. Everything I wanted to do, everything I loved has been taken from me. There is no justice in the world. Hope is a lie. Only death will bring me peace, only death will bring me freedom. They won't stop. I cannot escape no matter where I go. They took everything I love and turned them against me. Now I fear all I used to love. This is no way to live. I must die
