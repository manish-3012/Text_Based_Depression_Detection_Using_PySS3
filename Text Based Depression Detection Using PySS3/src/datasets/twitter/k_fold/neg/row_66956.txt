Today on August 4th i turn 18 and i still feel depressed and want kill myselfI am not wiser then i was 3 or 4 or 8 years ago. I still want to kill myself. I still have crippling anxiety and depression which i can't get diagnosed for since mental health care is being held from me. I still live in crippling poverty by my countries standards(and my country is some 3rd world Eastern European piece of shit ) I still have to go to *SCHOOL*. And I still need to deal with assholes who push me around to fulfill their selfish desires. Only thing that has hanged is i can now legally own a gun to kill myself in this country and no one will be allowed to question.
