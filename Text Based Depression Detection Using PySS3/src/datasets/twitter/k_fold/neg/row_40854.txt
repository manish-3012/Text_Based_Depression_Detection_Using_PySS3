I'd much rather get into a fatal car accident than have to go back to my shitty job tonight.I work 3rd shift. I've never been able to do it since I first tried it a couple years ago, but my boss forced us all to switch over. Now we have to work six 10-hour days. I got less than 24 hours for a day off and now I go back in an hour. I may as well just fucking off myself so I dont have to go back.
