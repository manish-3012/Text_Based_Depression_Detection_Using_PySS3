Life is fucktardedIf I donâ€™t enjoy life and I know that Iâ€™ll never enjoy the normal and non normal ways of living then what the fuck. No lifestyle is going to be enjoyable enough to justify the garbage that I have to go through everyday just to keep repeating the same shit over again the next day. Stupid and pointless survival fuck life.
