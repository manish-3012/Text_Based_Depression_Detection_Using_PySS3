Hello, it's my first timeI've been in this sub for months. I usually read people's stories and give comments if I have time. It's my first time to post my story. I'm not sure if anyone reads but if you do, I appreciate it. 

I am 26f. From the outside, it seems like i get my life together. I am passionate about my job and don't have to worry about money. But the truth is i often feel so sad and empty. When i am sad, it feels so unbearable that I think about suicide. I usually put a razor on my wrist but instead of slitting it, I just press the razor really hard until i feel the pain. I don't know if it's called self-harm because i don't get hurt. There are no scars or blood. I just need the pain to distract me from all the bad thoughts. 

I don't feel sad all the time. The days i feel okay is when i don't feel anything, not sad or happy. I am not confident enough to call it depression because I am never properly diagnosed. From stories that I read in this sub, depressed people are unable to keep their jobs and take care of themselves. They also do the "real" self-harm. Maybe I am just too sensitive and overreact. LOL my problems aren't even real. 

So that's all, i guess. You don't need to reply or give this post an upvote but if you do, I appreciate it. Have a good day, everyone. I wish you all a happy life.
