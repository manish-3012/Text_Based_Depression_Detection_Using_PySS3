Feeling suicidal for the first time in 3 yearsI haven't felt like this since I was dating my last boyfriend who was heavily abusing me mentally and physically. I'm in an argument with my current boyfriend, who up and left, said he was leaving his phone in his room, and is going out for a drive to clear his head. I'm suffering from severe anxiety and stress over this and other things in my life, and am wondering, once again, if it's better to just not be alive. I don't feel alive anyway, what's the difference? I've never really felt this level of sadness and emptiness in almost 3 years. Does anyone have advice? I feel like I'm having a genuine panic attack.
