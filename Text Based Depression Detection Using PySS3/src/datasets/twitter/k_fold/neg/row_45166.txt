Anybody know how to sell ur soul to satan for a better life?People everywhere can have a life with money, relationships, fame, etc. Even pedos, murders, thieves and just plain  shitty people have lives miles ahead of mine. No one wants me, I have nothing anyone wants. I just wanna do that crossroads thing and have satan teach me guitar or something. I want what everyone has, except I have to pay for it. 

I appreciate responses but ur response or my posting this will mean nothing and I will gain nothing because if god dont give a damn then the other guy certainly wont or the obviously theres no god or devil and everyone is selfishly looking out for number 1 or they're friends.
