Terrified to post this for fear of someone finding it but here it goes!Iâ€™ll try to keep this short. Iâ€™m in my late teens and am living with manic depression. I donâ€™t go to school, I donâ€™t have friends, canâ€™t get drugs to try to distance myself from myself and thoughts of suicide, and sit around talking to myself. I dream of living the 70s rockstar life, but know that unfortunately the only musical success is the awful â€œtrapâ€ music everyone loves for whatever reason. Iâ€™m delusional with this dream of ever being successful. I can kinda sing a bit but nothing amazing. I go from dreaming about my future to being to depressed about reality And I choke myself until I black out. I have wanted to die since I was 12. My parents do nothing but support me and love me but I still feel lonely. I have issues with weight(5â€™ 10, 195lbs) and sexuality (bi? Gay? Straight?). I hate the person I am and am destined to become. I song myself to sleep some nights, and cry others. The only thing that keeps me from ending it all it that there may be a chance for success, but that candle is burning out. I really donâ€™t want to here that â€œyou have so much to live forâ€ or â€œyou have your whole life ahead of youâ€. I just need advise for musical success or something to help me keep going because I feel my end is inching closer and closer.
