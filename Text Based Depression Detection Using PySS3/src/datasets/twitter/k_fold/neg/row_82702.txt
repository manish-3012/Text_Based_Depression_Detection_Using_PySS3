Fuck it! I Have All Eternity To Be DeadLast night, I began feeling suicidal again, but when I die; I will be dead forever unless I come back reincarnated as a squirrel, which I highly doubt will happen.  Honestly though.  We are all on the same boat together.  The titanic is going down, and we're all on for the ride.  We are all approaching death one nano second at a time.

We only live to be on average 75-100 years old.  When we compare that time to how long the universe has been around, we only live for like a micro second.  Our dead bodies will be eaten by worms, and the worms that eat our bodies will make worm babies, and a part of us will be in them.  One day the sun will turn into a red star, which will kill the generations of worm babies though.  If interstellar travel has not been figured out by the time the sun turns into a red star, then all humanity will be destroyed. 

One day the entire milky way galaxy will get sucked into the black hole that is at the center of the galaxy.  Thanks to Steven Hawking, we know that black holes "recycle" the matter it consumes and emits X-rays.  Yes, that is the ultimate destination we are heading towards.   All of us will be X-ray radiation.  

So, if it is my fate to become an x-ray radiation, then why not just stay alive.  Considering these facts,  I should just enjoy my fucking life.  Pain, why?  Pain is nothing but a figment of our imaginations.  Nothing is stopping you from letting go of all the pain, and to just live life to the fullest.  Fear, why?  We're all gonna be x-ray radiation anyway.  What's the point?

TLDR; titantic, worm babies, sun will turn into red star, galaxy will be consumed by black hole, our ultimate destination is to become X-ray radiation.  Say fuck it, and live life to the fullest.
