I just got my rapport card for this year, itâ€™s badIdk what to do anymore. I was planning on seeking help and Trying to get better. Repeating my fucking grade isnâ€™t a part of that. I think Iâ€™m gonna kill myself after the summer break so I can do a couple thing Iâ€™ve always wanted to do but was too scared to do or I was afraid of the consequences.
