i love themnot sure if iâ€™m in the right place !! but if i ever die i donâ€™t want any of my friends to feel like they couldâ€™ve done more. theyâ€™ve done more than enough for me and iâ€™m always gonna be grateful for them. iâ€™m sorry i couldnâ€™t pull through for them tho all i can do is tell them how much i love them. and if i go i hope they find this because i know they know i love them but i really mean it  ok bye i donâ€™t wanna sound soppy
