I hate that I was born the wrong nationality and religion. And possibly gender and race.I'm a white Christian American male. Aka a pile of shit.

If I was Jewish or Muslim or Canadian or female or black or Hispanic or Middle Eastern, I would be better respected. And I know in my next life this will be true. 

How do I endure decades more of pain and inadequacy when I can hope something puts me out?
