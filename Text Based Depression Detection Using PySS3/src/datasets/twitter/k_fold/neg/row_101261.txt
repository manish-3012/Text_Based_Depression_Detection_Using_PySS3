I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing anymore.Iâ€™m a mess. I have zero motivation to get myself together and even when I do try nothing comes of it. Iâ€™m jobless, and my crap resume is not gonna get me a call back, and even if I got one Iâ€™d bomb the interview. I feel like I have no confidence or drive. I donâ€™t have medical insurance right now and I have so many medical issues I wish I could attend to and I so thoroughly regret all the time I had insurance and ignored hospitals because I was too scared. I have so many people that love me and I feel like they donâ€™t even know me. Iâ€™ve lost touch with everything I love. I just feel like a zombie.
