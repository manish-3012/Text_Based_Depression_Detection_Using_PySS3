VentingWould it really matter if I died? I don't have any value whatsoever. I am just forgettable no one would remember or care. I don't know what love feels like. Ever compliment I get I reject and say they are lying and I believe this wholeheartedly. I think people use compliments for their own gain and I will never take one. Everyday I tell myself I will amount to nothing and I am a disgusting pig that should just die already. I'm scared to let people in because I feel like they will hurt me.

What does love feel like?
