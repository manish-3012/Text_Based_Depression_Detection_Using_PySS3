I have no reason, but I still want to dieI've always felt like this. Ever since I was a kid. I've always had friends and family that love me. I've always had hobbies and ambitions. But I've always wanted to die. 

I've attempted three times so far

I feel stuck in this weird limbo where I want to try again, but I'm too scared to fail. I can't even kill myself, how pathetic. I've never talked to anyone about this stuff and I'm so thankful that no one knows. 

I'm 100% sure that I'll eventually do it. As of right now I'm back in another cycle of hate myself until it builds enough for me to go for it again.
