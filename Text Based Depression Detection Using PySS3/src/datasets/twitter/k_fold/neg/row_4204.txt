I'm having a mental breakdown and I feel like my depression has reached the point where I actively want to die.I've been thinking like this for a couple of hours now, I can't get the thought of how easy and peaceful death is out of my head. I have some great friends and loved ones trying to support me, but I honestly feel like this has made their quality of life worse so I stopped bothering them with it. I have a great job, and I'm doing well in my major and my bachelor course, but my life is fucked up in so many ways under the surface. My mother told me she wished I would just die, I'm anorexic with lasting heart problems along with a 7 month recovery that has still only left me with a BMI of 17. 

It's not urgent, just feeling like I need to outsource my will to live at this point. Don't feel obligated or anything, I would feel worse if I knew I was wasting someone time or making there day worse.
