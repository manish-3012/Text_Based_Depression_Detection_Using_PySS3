I can't find what makes me happy.iI just feel very stressed. I just don't want to deal with this. I try to just blend I with some, but I am soon pushed back out because I was different. If I am no matching piece for a puzzle, is their any use for one when it just won't fit anywhere? Yes, it is called gone. I just want to go, be gone, and take the people I dislike with me on my way down. I try to find a balance that the weight of the positives is the winning side, but I can't. I can't relax, I can't find myself. I just want this freak show I am in to end. By any means possible.
