GF dumped me an hour agoTitle says it all. From the time of posting this, it has been an hour since my girlfriend broke up with me. I just don't know what the fuck I am supposed to do now. I loved her, but apparently she hasn't had feelings for me in months. Now that university has started up again, she was tired of pretending to love me. I don't know why I was so stupid to believe I could be loved. I can't be loved. I fucking hate myself.

I'm not a social person. She was my first girlfriend and I'm 22 years old. She was the first girl to hold my hand. The first girl to kiss me. And now that illusion is gone. I'm going to die a lonely, unloved virgin, and no one is going to miss me
