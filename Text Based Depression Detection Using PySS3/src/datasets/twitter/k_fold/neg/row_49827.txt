Really wishing I had something to move forward to.Hi, Reddit. My name is Morgan. I'm 23 years old. I have no meaningful relationships that aren't online. I am unemployed, a highschool dropout, and a social recluse in my own childhood bedroom. When my family looks at me, it's with pity, disgust, disappointment... I'm tired of being looked at like that. There are things I try to stay around for- Warm pizza, a game I like, thunderstorms, roleplay (it's a pathetic hobby, isn't it?) But there's nothing long-term. I don't have the energy for anything anymore. I didn't even have the energy to make a throwaway. More and more it's looking like my only option is sleeping. Like it's the only thing that will make me happy, but I'm too scared of what'll happen after it. What should I do?
