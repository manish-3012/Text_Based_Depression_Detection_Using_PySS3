I think I might try to overdose again...Last month I tried ODing on my meds, but didn't have nearly enough left and just ended up getting high. I'll finally be able to get refills on the 12th, and I'm thinking about attempting it again, possibly adding alcohol this time if I can get my hands on some to ensure I don't survive.

I'm just tired of being a fuck up, a burden, a disappointment, a failure, a worthless mentally ill piece of shit who just pushes people away. I recently pushed away the girl of my dreams, who I loved (and still love) more than anything in this world. I wish I had been a better boyfriend, I wish I hadn't been so codependent, impatient, negative. She just wanted me to be her happy escape from all of the bs in her life, and I failed her.

I'm really considering attempting suicide again once I get my refills. I hate this endless cycle of me opening up and getting closer to people and just becoming a burden and pushing them away eventually. I loved my girl more than life itself, I cared about her more than I've ever cared about anyone or anything, and now she won't even talk to me... and it's all my fault. She gave me plenty of chances, and I just kept making the same mistakes. 

I'm tired of being alone. I spent more than my fair share of time alone and miserable before I met her, and it hurts so much more now because I had my dream girl and of course I fucked it up in spectacular fashion... I don't want to be alone again, and I just seem to push away any friends I manage to make or anyone I get close to. I'm tired of this endless cycle... and to top it all off, pretty much everything about me is pathetic. I'm 20 years old with pretty much no life, and little to no life skills. Hell, I'm still trying to figure out what my ex even saw in me in the first place. 

I'm just reaching my breaking point and my heart won't stop aching. I wish I didn't ruin the best thing that ever happened to me so badly, honestly I just wish she could forgive me :(
