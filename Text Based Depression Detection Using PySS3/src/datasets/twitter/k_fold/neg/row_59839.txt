Can't live because of anxietyThe world was not meant for someone like me. I can't adapt. I can't forge out a successful life for myself. I am a complete joke. Absolutely zero connections, no relevant education, no work history, never accomplished anything, etc. How the fuck am I supposed to live when everything seems so daunting and scary? People especially. I cannot get along with the rest of the human race like everyone else can. People are fucking terrifying and being open to them is even more terrifying. I can't get involved in the community because then I would be too exposed. Same with any other job. How would anyone respect a pathetic person like myself in the workplace? Nobody would respect me. I would just look weird and out of place no matter what I do or where I go.

I don't understand how I can go on like this. There's no getting away from it. All I want to do is escape.
