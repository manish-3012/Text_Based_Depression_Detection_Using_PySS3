I get it....I posted earlier, and the responses helped. What really helped was when I finally heard from my long distance gf. I told her how I was feeling, what all had happened, and how I had really needed to talk to someone the other night....

Then she broke up with me. In the same sentence that she told me she loved me. I barely made it through today. Went to work with tears in my eyes from all the other crap. Couldn't help but cry more when people asked if I was okay. Then I heard from her. Just over halfway through my two hour walk home, she ended it. What in the fuck!? I'm not a bad person, not clingy, not overbearing. I needed her more than ever tonight and she does this. This may have been the straw that broke the camels back... If I can sleep, maybe I'll feel better in the morning. Probably not. I'll just call my guy after work
