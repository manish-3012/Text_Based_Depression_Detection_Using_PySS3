She said she didn't know if she could be happy with me anymore.Tittle says it all. She's my world the only person who's ever cared. She just told me she isn't happy and doesn't know if she can be happy with me anymore.

Waiting for her to decide if she wants to break up or not. She has said she likes the idea of trying to get back together after some time away but I hate the idea of a break, I know she's only trying to work on herself and that she struggles with depression but this is destroying me. 

So I'm just sitting here with a shotgun on my lap. Gonna smoke some bud and try to get my head back but I know there is a possibility of her wanting to leave forever and I'd rather just blow my dome back here and now than face that
