I have dark thoughts but I just can't do itEveryday I wake up, I go to University or my part-time job but I wake up, I don't feel as if I'm achieving anything, going to the train station, I know I have a grim look on my face, I feel people judge me. The only reason I stay if because of friends and family but mainly one friend, a smile grabs my face when I see him but when I'm alone I just never feel happy, it just seems like an eternity until I go to bed and wake up the next day.

It takes 4-6 hours to fall asleep, I'm incredibly sleep deprived, I lay there for hours upon hours, nothing happens, I take medication to fall asleep but that never works, I'm Diabetic and low and high blood sugars keep me up, I'm just always so exhausted and fatigued from blood sugar levels to do anything, drawing's a hobby but I draw one thing and I'm just so, out of it, I just don't want to do anything, not even just lying there can I feel like I'm achieving something that's actually been accomplished.

I was just wondering if there were any words of wisdom to get me through?
