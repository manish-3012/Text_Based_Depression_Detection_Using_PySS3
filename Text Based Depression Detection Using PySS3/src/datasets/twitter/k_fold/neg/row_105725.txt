What the...do you ever feel like you have to kill yourself, like, for no reason at all? i'm not even sad but i take suicide so normal. the kids i mostly end up talking to are suicidal (school shooter-like) kids at my school, i mean i don't even wanna talk to other kids (i mean the jocks and sluts; suicidal ones would shoot these kids if they end up being school sh**ters). to us suicidal students suicide is like sex is to these jocks- it's unmoral ( for us it is OK), we are active in it all the time, no one cares about our field of interest (difference being that naturally we don't want to kill ourselves). to me the act of attempting actual suicide is so normal it's like buying a coca-cola. i feel the urge since 12 years old. i'm sick of it. any... tips or advice besides seeing a psychiatrist?
