True clarity.The short of it; been seeing a therapist, taking anxiety medication and for the first time the voices in my head have stopped long enough for me to see through to ending my life. It's the best decision I can make. Thinking clearly was the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. I waiting for my bg check to clear so I can facilitate my chosen method of termination.  I'm almost free.
