Iâ€™m done... lifeâ€™s fucking over... I donâ€™t wanna deal with this shithole any longerIâ€™m gonna sound like a fucking incel rn but whatever...

Whenever I try to have a meaningful relationship wasting so many resources to be shot down... it hurts... I waste my life through this endless cycle of; like someone: try to make a move: rejected: try to move on: repeat.

Iâ€™ve tried to improve myself, Iâ€™ve fucking changed half my interests and hobbies for some people... and itâ€™s just such a waste to always be shot down...

None of my friends try and support me, they did, now they just say donâ€™t bother and move on. 

I donâ€™t even know why I try. I elude myself into believing thereâ€™s a chance. I lie to myself saying thereâ€™s a good shot, and I know there never will be. Yet I still try anyway and it always ends the same, in tears and pain and suffering

Itâ€™s a painful cycle of pain that I want out of. I just wanna be in a meaningful happy relationship but the longer this goes on the more it seems like a pipe dream. 

Iâ€™m sorry if youâ€™ve read this far. I need to vent and get my fucking brain into text because god do I want to just fucking ending it if I could, Iâ€™m too addicted to this cycle that I have to see it through. 

I hate this life, I hate everything
