a Christmas gift to my loved onesI wonâ€™t be here much longer. Nothing is okay, i feel as though iâ€™m walking on broken glass and looking ahead of me, i see a beam of white light that I want to reach so badly but I canâ€™t.. i reach my arms out to touch it but it disappears. Happiness is so fleeting and out of touch for me, itâ€™s been this way since i was around 9 years old. The intense mental abuse iâ€™ve endured from many different people has left me unable to have a sense of self, or trust people, or other things. My sense of self is fractured, I donâ€™t know who I am or what I enjoy. No matter where I am or who iâ€™m with I feel the profound emptiness that I can never erase. I guess what I have does that to you, but still does not get easier with time or therapy. Years of therapy, though iâ€™m only a 17 year old woman. 

Every person iâ€™ve fallen in love with has taken advantage of me or left me in some way. Iâ€™m sitting here, in my cold basement room, bored and lonely. With nothing to look forward to. A lonely Christmas all by myself. My family will all stay in their separate bedrooms, like always. Nothing is okay. I love so many people, Iâ€™ve loved and Iâ€™ve lost, but at the same time I feel as though NO ONE understands what Iâ€™m going through. I try to put it into words and they still donâ€™t get it.

Iâ€™m sitting here listening to Exit Music by Radiohead, it sounds like it could be a soundtrack for my life... The song is about Romeo and Juliet running away from their homes, parents, etc. I look at it in its literal meaning, but I also think of it as if I play both parts of Romeo and Juliet. Romeo is the romantic, loving, kind, warm. Juliet is the colder, (but still loves Romeo) and â€œproblematicâ€ person. With my disorder, I feel like this all the time. Sometimes I feel full of life and love, fulfilled yet never fully happy, but pretty close. Then, for the rest of the time I am cold, empty, devoid of feeling and my voice is really monotone and I move, talk and act like a robot. 

Itâ€™s in those moments I feel inhuman, an alien or being among the rest of people, yet I never feel better than anyone. I feel shit, my existence is shit, I am shit. What do I do that benefits the lives of others? Simply just being around them with the mask of happiness and warmth I put up? I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair to guilt someone into living just because youâ€™ll miss them or they make you happy. What about me? And how unhappy Iâ€™ve been for years? Why donâ€™t I get to choose my own fate, like the rest of us? Itâ€™s not fair, in fact I think suicide is not selfish, forcing someone to stay is.

One of my favorite song lyrics is from a song called Only Everyone Can Judge Me by Crywank. It says, â€œThis isnâ€™t a brave face, this isnâ€™t a brave face, this is a mask.â€ and thatâ€™s so accurate. Everything I do is a mask, but itâ€™s not on purpose, or malicious, or to manipulate, itâ€™s just because my actions and words are so highly dependent on my emotions. I never want to hurt people. Never, I try to make everyone feel happier than I ever feel, so they donâ€™t have to live a life like mine or feel the way i feel, see the things i see, hear the things I hear. When I get into serious relationships I squeeze every little bit of love out of my brain and heart to make them feel loved and taken care of, because I know that I never feel loved. I donâ€™t want them to ever feel that way, too. 

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing. Guess I have no one and nowhere else to turn to. Iâ€™ll write later, bye
