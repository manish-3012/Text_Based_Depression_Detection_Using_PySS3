I need someone to talk to now.I dont know what is happening to me. I've just been so on edge. Every sound i hear gets me on edge. I don't have friends anymore. Dont have a job anymore, no girl. Nobody to talk too. I'm really sick, i wake up in pain. I just thought I got hacked on fifa and lost my shit. It's my life now and it's sad. I got kicked out of 2 schools and honestly, I don't see a future for myself. I suck at everything. 
Can't keep a job. Get kicked out of every school I go. Honestly, I don't know how long I can keep going on.. let's just say I'm not planning into entering 2018.
