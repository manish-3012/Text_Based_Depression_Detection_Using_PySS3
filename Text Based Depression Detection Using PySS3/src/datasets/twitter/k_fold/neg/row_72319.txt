I'm not good at this.Hi all. Wall o' text ahead cause spacing isnt fun. I am 16 and hate myself. I have been sad(I dont know if its depression cause I never went to get offically diagnosed cause I am terrified of asking for help) since I was 13. I havent tried to do anything but I have wanted to die for the past 3 years. I am lucky to have a semi stable household, with my divorced parents both having steady jobs and such. I do have a problem with my dad being a functioning drug addict, but that isnt really the main thing making me want to die. I need help but I cant seem to ask for it. I dont have a method to do it yet but I have been researching for the past year and have easy access to lots of painkillers. I feel like I am worthless, and waste my friends and families time with all my shittiness. I am so so exhausted from putting on a fake smile everyday. I just want to give up. I feel bad for my girlfriend cause she has been putting up with my crap, and like me being sad all the time is pretty shitty especially in a LDR. I feel like Im selfish and rude and basically the worst for wanting to kill myself, but I also feel like I am a burden to everyone by just breathing. I used to get good grades but am barely managing C's now. all of my family has super high expectations of me and want me to go to college and be an engineer but I am not able to do that or at least dont think i am and I dont know i just am tired of the pressure and I cant stand myself and feel bad for living and feel bad for not wanting to live and I dontknow how to do this.(also is this allowed? i dont know and it seemed to be the best place.) Please help. TLDR:I suck.
