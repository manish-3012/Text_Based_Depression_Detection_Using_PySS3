I dont know how much longer i can do this, im terrifiedIve been struggling with depression and anxiety for years and i get suicidal thoughts all the time, i just dont know how much longer i can keep on living. Im terrified of everything, im terrified of the future. i honestly cant see myself having a happy ending, but i have never had the courage to end my life because im afraid of hurting my family, friends, boyfriend, and dog. I just dont know what to do at this point.
