3 years, 3 suicide attemptsSo i tried to OD 2 years ago and a few months later i tried to hang myself. I havenâ€™t had such thoughts until a week ago. Last tuesday i tried to hang myself again and i posted on my snapchat how bs it is that ppl pretend to care about me. I said goodbye to my friends and that was it. So obviously the rope snapped and the next day i got called into the head teachers office in my school and i was forced to talk about what was going on. Well it turns out everyone on snapchat shared my story and rumours spread like wildfire. I am genuinely pissed. I just want to find peace but i canâ€™t even succeed in that. Im such a failure.
