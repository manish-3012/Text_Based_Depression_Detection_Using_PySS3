I don't want to feel like this anymore.Everyday all I feel is either mindnumbing numbness, sadness, or anxiety to the point of me not wanting to do anything. Today has been one of the worst days, and nothing bad has even happened. Hell, yesterday I got to make out with a guy I really like. 

I guess the anxiety has been really bad today, because I think the guy I really like and I's relationship has been just... fucked up by it. I dunno. I was awkward and shitty yesterday. I'm awkward and shitty today. I feel so trapped. I don't want to feel anxious anymore. 

I've been crying most of the day, for no reason. I just can't find any reason *not* to cry. 

I don't want to feel like this anymore.
