?I may be dead in a day or two, I'm 21 and I'm guy. I still live with my parents, I've failed all of my subjects at my class because it was too hard for me, I'm taking Nursing as a course btw. My dad, hmm, he is a nice guy if all the good things are happening to him (if u know what I mean) but if he is tired or what, he instantly blames everything to me. To cut this short he expects ke to graduate soon without knowing that I fucked up my school and my payment for my tuition fee. I don't know what to do anymore. I know it's my fault but I'm too scared to tell him the truth..
