I want to dieLove is merely a social construct, With the average lifespan of a human being roughly 70 years, I only have to endure another 54 years of excruciating unforgivable pain. Everything is temporary, our lives do not matter, and this does not matter, everything is temporary and will eventually rot away as long as the factor of time continues to be the apex predator of the universe, the inevitable decay of all pain and memories is unstoppable. I feel pain, I am pain. I do not want to end my life, just my pain and suffering. as Shakespeare said, "Time is unending for those who wait".
