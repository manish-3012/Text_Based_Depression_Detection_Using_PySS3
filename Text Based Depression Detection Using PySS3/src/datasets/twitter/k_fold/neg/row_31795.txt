Goodbye.Posted here a few days ago so figured I owed the people who read it a little closure I guess. I just took the rest of my sleeping pills and am waiting for them to kick in and just wanted to say thanks for trying those of you that reached out.
Goodbye,
 -Clearhit/Gage

Update: My attempt failed, while I didn't reply to people on this thread I replied to a few pm's, eventually went and called an old friend, Thank you everyone who replied/Pm'd.
