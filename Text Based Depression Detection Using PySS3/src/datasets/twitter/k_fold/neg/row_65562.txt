I am alone in thisI am having thoughts again. I donâ€™t want to act on it, I donâ€™t want to give in, I donâ€™t even want to be thinking it. But I just keep having this feeling of this deep-seated pain that I worry will never truly go away. This worthlessness and hopelessness that I feel in my bones. After all these years, itâ€™s still there. I canâ€™t talk to my family. They donâ€™t believe me. And I have no one in my life that I am close enough with the tell them this without worrying that I need to be hospitalized or something. I just need someone to hear me, to hug me even, so I can get through this but thereâ€™s no one. Thatâ€™s the way itâ€™s always been. Iâ€™m afraid thatâ€™s the way it will always be. I donâ€™t want to die, but I canâ€™t handle this pain that is always there either.
