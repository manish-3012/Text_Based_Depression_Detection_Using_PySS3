Feeling suicidalI'm a sophomore in college and got really bad grades again this semester including my first ever F. It's not like I didn't try though, I'm majoring in CS and my classes were just really hard for me. I ended up getting just under a 2.0 gpa. I hate dissapointing my parents since they help pay for my education here :( I want to continue going here because I am happy here. I didn't really have friends in high school but I do here. I'm just really depressed after getting my exam results back...
