Not sure what to do about my futureI'm going to try to not make this post too long because long posts are tedious, but, I really could use at the very least someone relating to my life situation right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently 16 and i'm a little over halfway through high school, and I really do not know how I am possibly going to graduate. I am failing about 3 out of 7 classes right now, surprisingly passing a few of them, and I failed 3 classes last semester while just barely passing the other ones. Suffice it to say, school is one of the main roots of my severe depression and apathy towards life. I simply cannot get through it. I have skipped so many days this year just because the sheer act of getting up and going to that damn building is just too miserable of a thought, not to mention the homework and all that nonsense. I just can't do it.

My current 'schedule' consists of 1. waking up as late as possible, 2. going to school and just trying to pass the time however I can until I get home so I can sleep, 3. eat too much food, 4. go to sleep and repeat the next day. I don't have any friends and my mom is about as unsupportive as can be (not to get started on my dad but he's not in the picture). She has this aspiration that i WILL and HAVE to go to college but at this point I know I will 100 percent either just kill myself or drop out if I do that. People say they give a shit about you, but that's only when it's convenient or when it makes them feel better about themselves. And the worst part is, I'm the same way. This is a facet of my life that has been a constant goddamn blemish on what little social skills I have. I don't know exactly what it is, but I honestly do not have the ability to empathize with others. I can't relate to anyone's emotions, and I don't feel them like anyone I've ever met. I don't have the mere capacity for regular human empathy, if that makes sense. That's another post in of itself but it's.. it's just shitty.

At this crosspoint, I don't know what I'm going to do. Everything takes too much fucking energy and no one gives a shit about me.

This is sort of related but I am also gay. Have known since I was about 10 and that is also another thing I 100 percent wish I could just delete from myself. I don't really feel 'lonely' as being around other people period is something I avoid at all costs, but, I just know that even if I ever wanted to be in a relationship, my dating pool is drastically smaller. Not to mention I am physically extremely ugly. 

I may get a job this summer, but I don't even know if I'll be able to do that. My only options I can even see at this point are to just a get a job and save up for a van or some shit so I can just live out of that when I evidently don't graduate high school because I'm a massive failure OR just jump into moving traffic because there is no goddamn way I am going to stay living with my mother when high school is or isn't over. Either way, my main goal is to just get away from where I am now because I really, really, really just CRAVE independence. That's about what it all boils down to, I am beyond unhappy with every aspect of my life and I feel like I have no control or angency over fuckall. I want my own money, I want my own place to live, I want a decent group of friends I can be happy hanging out with or something without school or my mom breathing down my neck waiting for my next move.

The last part at the end got a little bit venty, but I hope someone here can either relate or provide some decent advice. Either way, appreciated.
