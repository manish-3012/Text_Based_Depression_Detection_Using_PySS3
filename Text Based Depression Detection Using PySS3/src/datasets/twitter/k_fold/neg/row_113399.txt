Just about to turn 18, don't want to live anymore.I am not feeling sorry for my self or anything. I just really don't want my life to continue. I turn 18 in June and I have my exams in may. I was bullied in high school and got really depressed. I ended up peforming averige in my exams. I then moved schools and got bullied their too. I failed these exams in extrordinary fashion. I chose to retake the year at a different school. I am not getting bullied but im extremly depressed. I am failing again and with just over 30 days to go until I sit them again I know I am going to fail again. I have never heard of anyone retaking the year and failing twice. 

My teachers are angry becuase im failing and "not putting any work in" but they nor my family actually know how bad things are for me. I find it hard to get out of bed and am always late for classes and I am so strung out due to lack of sleep that I am extremly lazy. My mom loves me but gets angry with me all the time and we fight constantly. My dad left when I was very little and I think it's fucking with me a little for the first time. I have big ambitions but the chance of me acheiving them died about 3 years ago. I have never and will never be the person I want to be. I sit around doing nothing with my life and instead delude my self into silly fucking goals that will "prove people wrong" ect. I will always be that fucking failure who will never amount to anything. 


I have tried to study but when ever I do the books remind me of how futile my existance is and how stupid my goals are. I just breakdown and cry when I work now, it's been this way for about a week now. 

I would do anything to just end it all, but it's 2 of my family member I know actually care alot for me that have stopped me so far. I know it would destroy them. On the other hand I cannot stand the shame of being the oppisite of who I want to be. 

Sorry about the spelling but I am pretty fucking distressed right now.
