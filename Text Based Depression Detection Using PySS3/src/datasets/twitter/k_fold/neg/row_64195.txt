my askreddit post saved my lifeI was so low. it's scary when I think about how close I was to being dead. I was already set on how and when I would do it . but my askreddit post went fucking viral. thousands of responses from strangers. thousands of messages from random ass people checking if I was okay and wanting to listen to me...I've never had such attention before. I'm one that kinda lost faith in humans...I was starting to think we were all assholes..but no there are a bunch of good people that wanted to talk to me without knowing who I was, what I looked like , etc. I'm definitely not okay now...I'm better than I was that week. I admit I am depressed and need help, which I am looking into. it's just scary how I can easily be triggered into being suicidal ...but thanks to everyone that checked up on me...I'm shocked that I'm alive today. all because of you strangers.
