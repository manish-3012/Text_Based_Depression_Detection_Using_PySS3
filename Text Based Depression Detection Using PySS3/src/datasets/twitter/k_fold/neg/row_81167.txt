I started college and this isn't good for me.I almost killed myself last year around the same time in early september. I got on meds and kind of surfaced, but not enough to be happy. I've been drifting emptily for so long waiting for something to change, and now that I'm in residence, I'm finally alone all the time. For one week I've been alone with my thoughts and I'm 90% sure that this place is where I'll die. I'm stuck alone, but I don't want to talk to people. I just want to die.
