Almost ready to end itAfter losing my job i was hired by someone who knew about my skill and circumstances. However i make less than half of what i did before now and i am barely surviving. I am also stressed because with my new position i do not have a clear set of responsibilities and a lot of the time i am not sure what i am supposed to be doing due to the lack of direction. I know i am a valuable asset if given the right opportunity, in fact i did make a lot of positive changes and took on my own initiatives in my new position but those are now in the past and i am left not knowing how to provide any more value. The boss sees this and stresses on me that fact.

On top of this i am running out of savings, my girlfriend has been texting other guys, my motorcycle (only means of transportation) has an impossible problem that the mechanic cannot fix, I live in a 3rd world country on the other side of where i actually call home, im sleeping 3 hours per night and not eating. Because of the unhealthy life at home it is negatively impacting my life at work and further turning me into a mess. I dont have any help or support out here and honestly i am just getting tired of trying and failing.

I keep imagining myself renting a hotel room for the night, getting really drunk and jumping out of the window. I feel like im almost at that point, like i am capable of doing it soon. When i inevitably run out of savings i will have no where else to turn, no friends, no family, no means of support, no new job opportunities, nothing at which point there will not be any other options. 

Im scared, tired, alone and just sad.
