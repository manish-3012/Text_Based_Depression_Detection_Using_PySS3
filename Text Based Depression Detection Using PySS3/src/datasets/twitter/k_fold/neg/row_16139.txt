Had my first car crash today... (16F)The last couple of days have been really screwed up for me, from failing a test I took days to study for and getting my first B to this today (amongst other things). Iâ€™m sorry to anyone reading this, I know this sounds trivial and other people have real issues on this sub, but I didnâ€™t know where else to put this. Iâ€™ve been feeling extremely stupid for the last couple of hours because the crash was completely avoidable. A car drifted into my lane while I was driving with my mom and I panicked (I have bad anxiety) and swerved to prevent an accident and crashed into some trees. The other driver kept going with no damage. I feel incredibly dumb and embarrassed, I wasted the police and emtâ€™s time (I wasnâ€™t injured, although I feel like I deserve to be), and I couldâ€™ve hurt my mom. My parents arenâ€™t mad at me and know it was an accident, but the repairs are gonna be expensive, I just know it. I didnâ€™t want to become another teenage driving statistic where reckless teenagers crash their cars for no reason, so I always tried my best to drive as safe as possible, but now I am. There are a lot of days where I wake up and and the first I do is ask why. I hate myself even more now, my life has no value. Iâ€™m a terrible example for my younger cousin who is just learning to drive, and I honestly feel traumatized. Nonetheless, this is all my fault and Iâ€™m not asking for any sympathy, I donâ€™t deserve any. But I feel so sick right now, worse than earlier and I canâ€™t go back to sleep. l donâ€™t want to feel this anymore, but Iâ€™d just get found and I donâ€™t want to create another unnecessary bill. Thank you to everyone who bothered to read this, I appreciate it.
