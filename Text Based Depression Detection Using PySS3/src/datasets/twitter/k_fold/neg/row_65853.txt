Why do I get random urges to kill myself even if Iâ€™m happy?Every once in a while, I just have an urge to put a shotgun to my head and pull the trigger. Iâ€™m happy. I have nearly everything I could want. Even though Iâ€™m probably not going to kill myself, I get these thoughts and I have no idea why. Sometimes I want close ones to die or something just so Iâ€™d know how Iâ€™d feel. I have never thought about hurting anyone before. I get these fucked up thoughts and I donâ€™t know why. Itâ€™s more annoying than it is anything else to me. Iâ€™d randomly be watching a movie or taking a walk and Iâ€™d say quietly to myself â€œJesus Christ, I wanna kill myselfâ€ nearly subconsciously.
