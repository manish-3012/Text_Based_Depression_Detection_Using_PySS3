I'm done. This is my first time posting here and it just might be my last. I almost feel bad about it.It's so strange to think about it. I feel like I'm only doing this because I don't know if I can survive the next hour without someone telling me not to do it. I don't even know how I would do it right now. But I want to. I want to, so badly, becau I can't live like this anymore. I am 24 years old, and still depending on my parents to survive. My job is so stressful I'm sitting in the parking lot crying. But I can't leave work because my boss (who is awesome, pls don't hate on him) needs me here. But I can't bring myself to care about it anymore. I've lost all emotions except for my frustrations and sadness. I'm sick and can't find a cute. Not fast enough. There's not enough time left. This is probably going to look like rambling... I'm just typing this out so I have a record, if I survive today. I don't know what to do, because I know there's got to be some part of me that still wants to live. But I can't hear it over my stress and anxiety. I want that to stop and all the practical solutions seem so far away. This life is bullshit and I'm fed up with it.
