"Suicide is never the answer" Please, shut the fuck up.It is objectively, factually incorrect to suggest that suicide is never the answer. There are plenty of circumstances that I would absolutely prefer death over, and it would be absolutely rational, good and **correct** for me to commit suicide in such scenarios.

It is from a place of immense privilege that someone would suggest 'suicide is never the answer'. 

If you are reading this and you are someone who has ever uttered the phrase 'suicide is never the answer, please shut the fuck up, you dumb cunt.
