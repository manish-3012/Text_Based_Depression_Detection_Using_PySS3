Having a rough one tonightI'll start off with I'm 26, I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was around 14, my mom died when I was 11 and my dad died when I was 16, my step family was always mentally and physically harmful to all of us  as kids and the only person I had that  understood my mindset was also bipolar and suicidal. I've had suicidal thoughts as long as I can rem, I've given it a go a few times but obviously with no success. 

I've been a fuck up my whole life. The only person I have to blame is me, I get myself into good situations and somehow end up doing the most self destructive things and ruining everything and hurting those around me. This time like usual it was my girlfriend of 9 years. 

Like most people here that fear of dying always comes up right before I really try to end it. But I'm a 6 pack deep and a handful in on some depression meds we have here at the house (my "P.O.S last  supper) and i'm pretty sure I've gotten over my brain naturally trying to save me. 

Not sure what to do or who to talk to, I don't want to talk to family cause I don't want to come off as "oh look at sad little me" but I want someone to talk to on the way out if this is it
