Just tired of everything going wrong.I left for basic training August 22nd, my phone broke august 18th I believe, pretty sure it was 4 days before I left so went to basic without a phone. Used a buddies phone while at basic on my birthday and got the news my dog died. Got my new phone when I got back home for holiday block leave and checked my bank account and havenâ€™t been paid. Awaiting on backpay now. Have -$110 in my bank account and need gas to get back to my unit station January 3rd. So idk how Iâ€™m gonna get back. Everythingâ€™s gone wrong and itâ€™s supposed to be the best time of the year.
