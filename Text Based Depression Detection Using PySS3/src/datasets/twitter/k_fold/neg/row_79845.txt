A worthless failure.I'm 19 (young, I know). I live with my friend and his parents, which is soon to come to an end. My mom and uncle are always angry at me because I can't find a job. They constantly tell me to help them, my uncle threatens to beat me, my mom calls me lazy and worthless. They yell at me for doing nothing, when I'm trying to find a job, but they pull me away from that so I can do their shit for them. I'm in a long-distance relationship, but it doesn't help. The problem here, really, is my mom and uncle, always getting on my case and making me feel I'm a complete and total failure. I've had suicidal thoughts for a while, but after a number of arguments... I'm really considering closing the book. I can't muster the strength to talk about it, and I can't afford a therapist. I feel like I can't make anyone happy. I'm not helping anyone in any way. I feel just as my mom says, worthless. I don't know how to go on anymore. No companies ever call me, and they don't understand that. My dad is a good man, but even he doesn't understand what I'm going through. He's always busy at work, or is with his girlfriend. I have a GED, I'm in fairly good working condition, but that's all on the outside. No one cares to listen to me, that's what I feel. I can't find anyone to spill my feelings out to. 

EDIT: My uncle just contacted me, told me he was gonna find me, hunt me down, more or less, and beat me to no ends. I'm not scared... But the guilt of it is horrifying.
