My sister wants to commit suicide. How can I help? Or should I let her? PLEASE HELP!! LIFE EMERGENCY!!I want to start off by saying thank you for reading this but I'm looking for answers ASAP.  

I love my sister very much. I'll do anything for her and I am trying to find a solution for her to be happy.  My sister 2 days ago told me that she wants to end her misery by killing herself.  She expecificly and repeatly said, "I don't want help, I dont need help. This is my decision and  no one is going to change my mind. I don't want anyone to know or find out.  Please don't tell anyone". She told her husband  and I separately in different occasions.  Offcoarse, the first thing I do is cry my life away. But I know she needs me and I was there listening and supporting her and telling her don't do this. But she won't listen. 30 minutes later, I called her husband and we talked about her decision. Hint: she don't want me to talk to him at all.  She will get mad and aggressive towards him. They fight a lot and she always get physically with him. He was crying but he Seems!!  That he has accepted her decision. 

Before you start judging anyone here,  let me start by telling you about how she was raised. This intensive depression has been going on since she was child. I am younger than her, so it was hard to understand  back then and still now.  She was always depressed.  We were raised by our grandparents who we could not talked to them about our problems or feelings. Our parents were not even in the country.  There was physical  and mental pain in our family.  Once we move here,  we lived with our parents.  Our dad moved out and he did not gave a @$@@ about us.  Our mom raised us after my sister was 14. She's now 28 . We had the same problem as our grandparents, we could not talk to her because she was basically on her own.  Their was physical violence,  we could not express our feelings to her because she judge us for no reason. Basically we could only talked within ourselves.  We used to fight a lot and hate each other but that was when she was a teenager.  
My sister got pregnant at 18. Move in with her husband because my mother kick her out so many times that it was unbelievable. My mother embarrassed that poor girl so many times, physically hit her and hurt her emotionally. There was a time for 2 years that she did not talked to no one, only her husband.  But then all of the sudden she came out of her darkness and started talking to us. She told us about her depression in wish we did not know because she's good at hidden it either aggressive or pretending to be happy. She seem happier -- going out with us,  spending time with us,  giving us advice, wish she's good at and spending time with old friends and everyone. But too be honest, it was all fake happiness because she was never happy at the end.  She play it very well that's all I know.  

Let me describe her, she's very stubborn,  aggressive, hard headed,  her pride is one of the highest. She's the kind person that even though people see her as an b@$#$,  she still has a good heart and cares. I know she has been fighting for too long and has not find a solution to her misery.  I want to help. It's my duty,  my responsibility. Too be honest is the right thing to do, to help when you love someone. She's my sister and I love her too much but she don't let me.  It's like she has no other choice.  She has a beautiful 10 year daughter. Smart child who I am concern about.  But my sister knows her father will take care of her when she's gone. However, he was diagnosed with early stage cancer recently.  So how is that going to be possible? My sister did not do anything with her life too be honest.  Like I said,  she got pregnant at 18. She had a hospital job for years and hated it. Her husband loves her dearly and has taken care of her since they were together. She only shares these thoughts with me and her husband.  She has party friends that she's fakes her happiness. She also uses a lot of drugs and alcohol and it has become even more of a constant used.  It's the only thing that calms her nevers and suicidal thoughts.  When she's sober,  she's aggressive,  cursed everyone out and very neglecting and her depression is bad.  We tried and stop her with the drugs.  But she gets really aggressive. Start fighting back.  Their was one point when her husband called the police because she got physical He told them she used drugs but she pretended that his wrong and seem happier and offcoarse she got away with it. 

 She has tried so many things in the book like,  open up to my mother about her depression.  My mother only said to get helped. She tried to open up to me and her husband.  We're trying to help her too.  She tried to be happy and get a psychiatrist and that did not work.  We also tried too get her help. she pretends that nothing's wrong with her to other people.  So that they won't take her.  She has given up on life and everything. 

I tried to help with my support and be there for her when she has those suicidal thoughts. I tried to get a psychiatrist and spiritual person. With hopes that she was going to change. But it just got worse.  Now she don't even wants to tried.  Yesterday, I disobey her rules and told my boyfriend and his mother. She gave me advice and tried to get help.  How can I help if someone doesn't wants the help?  His mother is a very spiritual person and reads people and she told me how she is a feeling right now.  She told me that  she has fear she don't want to do this but she has no other choice because the pain is stronger and the drugs are making it worse.  All of this is true.  So I called her husband at 12am yesterday  because I wanted to help her help right away and wanted to see if we could do something about it.  since I m living soon and won't be here in the country for 5 months.  I know it was a last minute choice but I needed to talk to him immediately. She doesn't know I have his #. She will get mad because she doesn't want me to talk to him about it.  Even though he knows. She don't wants the help.  So what happend was I called him,  she heard my voice, she immediately got mad and cursed me out. She said "it's my decision and I don't need help and don't want to talk to me again".  We called the suicide hotline,  but they said there's nothing I can do. "If she don't want the help, you can't help her at all.  She has to do it on her own". That's the thing, I don't have the time, she can do it any minute.  I want talk to my mother but she will get mad,  call her and trigger her to do it as soon as possible.  Who should I talked to ? What should I do?  I can't get a psychiatrist because it has to be her decision to go.  I can't talk to anybody because she don't let me, especially after  what happend yesterday. I can't reach out to her no more. Do you believe people have the right to choose to died?  Since there is no other option in life.  I will feel guilty if I don't do something and she kills herself. In my heart,  I know she will do it because she's feed up. But I need help?  What?   I m living for 5 months for my dream job next week and I want to quit everything and help her.  Please help me!!!
