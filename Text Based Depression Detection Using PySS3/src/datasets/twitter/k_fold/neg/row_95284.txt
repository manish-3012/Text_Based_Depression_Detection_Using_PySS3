I think I should kill myself before it gets too lateI'm young, just turned 18 years old. Everyone keeps telling me things will get better as I grow into adulthood. I'm afraid of suffering for years on end just to find that adulthood is even worse. At least if I kill myself now, people will remember me, my peers will notice my absence, I'd almost be memorialized in everyone's minds. If I wait, I'll end up killing myself knowing my life amounted to nothing, I'm alone, and I'm a piece of shit. I don't know what to do.
