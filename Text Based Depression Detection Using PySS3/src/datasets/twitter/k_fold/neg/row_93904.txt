Chronic illness, chronic stillness.My chronic illness puts me in pain every waking moment from when I lay down my head till I wake up in the morning. I don't have a job and I can hardly do anything. I feel so alone all the time- I cannot relate to anyone. Especially my peers ( 19 F). None of my *friends* text me to see how I am anyways. Everyday seems so meaningless. The pain eats my joy away. Even when I'm having "fun" I still feel it beating me down. I've been to over 20 doctors and have tried every type of medicine possible and nothing seems to work. Each day bleeds into one and I cannot take it anymore. 

Time is meaningless when there is nothing to wait for. 
Set me free.
