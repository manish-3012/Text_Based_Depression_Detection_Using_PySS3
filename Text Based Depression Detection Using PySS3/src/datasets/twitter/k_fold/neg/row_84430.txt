I just want it to endI don't care if anyone is sad.  Eventually they will get over it.  Eventually they will forget.  No one seems to understand.  They always tell me that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  But sometimes the problem ISNT FUCKING TEMPORARY.  It's a solution.  Life is pain.  Seemingly endless suffering.  I'm not gonna wait 60 fucking years for it to end.  I know I'm going to do it someday.  One day I'll finally have the courage to end it all.
