Iâ€™m an ugly male and itâ€™s ruined my life...Iâ€™m Male 182cm tall (just under 6ft)  lanky slim body  framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea Iâ€™m fucked when it comes to looks. Iâ€™m a kissless virgin.And I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and treated poorly by most and itâ€™s because Iâ€™m ugly. I donâ€™t leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something with my day for once , but other times itâ€™s very difficult. I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and thereâ€™s times I blatantly get stared at because Iâ€™m ugly. Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking, and girls who stare me down because Iâ€™m tall and slim. I donâ€™t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job around a lot of people  and a girl and her dad was standing drinking and the girl looked at me with a blank glare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face and said â€˜ewwwwww god noâ€™ (I lipread her) it was ok for her as she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask covering her face tho. it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the thereâ€™s a guy whoâ€™s a higher up authority on my part  I work and heâ€™s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because Iâ€™m skinny. I donâ€™t wanna ever leave the house. I wake up with suicidal thoughts crying. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. I canâ€™t have a life as much as I want to. Sometimes when itâ€™s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh. I have bad depression because of my looks too so itâ€™s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when itâ€™s a women and theyâ€™re always snotty and dismissive I take it personally. Thats the most painful thing, when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if heâ€™s being a complete douche. 5 years I worked in a bar and had confidence and a good life good friends and a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(
