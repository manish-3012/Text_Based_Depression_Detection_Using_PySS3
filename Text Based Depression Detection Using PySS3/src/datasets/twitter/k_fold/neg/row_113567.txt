It's all about the journey.I have come to a strange conclusion and I just want to put this somewhere. It will most likely come out as a rambling mess that no one should actually read.

Suicide, voluntary self destruction, is not a destination. As in, it is not the desired outcome. Many of us here know, suicide is a tough decision to make. It is a terrible few that choose to make that final journey into death.

Death and suicide are only the means to an end. The desired outcome, the destination is peace. Many of us that post here are simply searching for a shelter from the storm of negativity in our lives. Any scream of the world being better of could most likely be reduced to a search for inner peace.

For anyone worried about myself, I am fine for now.
