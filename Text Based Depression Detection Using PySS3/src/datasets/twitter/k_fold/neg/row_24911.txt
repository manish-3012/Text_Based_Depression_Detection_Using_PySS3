SorryI think tomorrow is going to be my last day I've had to much and I don't know what to do anymore, gonna get high with my friends then kill myself. Sorry guys but I can't anymore it's do hard and painful to keep going on, from the first moment I can remember I've felt depressed, I remember being locked up in my room being so lonely and depressed at 4. I'm only 15 now and I've tried to kill myself twice now the first time by overdose and my friend called an ambulance to save me (if you see this thank you but sorry), the second time was by nose I was already in the nose and starting to loose consciousness and then I heard someone at the door and had to loosen it to get out. I'm not sure if i will kill myself but if I do I just want to say thanks and bye. I've had some great times with my friends, but when I'm not which is %70 of the time I feel so shit, Ive spent most of my time stress eating and lying in bed for the past 2 months. And I'm not sure how much longer I can last, so if I die tomorrow or sometime in the future this is the note. Later
