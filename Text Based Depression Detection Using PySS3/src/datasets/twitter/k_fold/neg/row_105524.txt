My life is a complete messHi, this is my first time ever posting on here.. sorry if itâ€™s long. From the age of 8 to 15 my step father sexually and physically abused me. He was the stay at home parent and my mom worked all the time. When she would come home from work and see a black eye or Iâ€™m all shaken up she would ask and he would always tell me to say we were just playing. Here resent ally they separated and all I can think about is the times he messed with me. (Iâ€™ve moved out of the house 2 years ago) and all I do when Iâ€™m not at work is sit in my room and cry I just want to be gone I want all the pain and anger to stop I want the memories to stop coming back into my head. Sometimes I live a normal life I can go on about my day and smile and laugh but itâ€™s just getting way to much for me to handle I donâ€™t know what else to do.
