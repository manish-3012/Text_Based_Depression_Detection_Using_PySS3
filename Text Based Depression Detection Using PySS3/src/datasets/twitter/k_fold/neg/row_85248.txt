Looking for insight and suggestions regarding hotlinesI read the guidelines and as far as I understand, I believe this post is appropriate for this sub but please redirect me if I'm wrong.

I'm a crisis clinician and I work for a small agency that has sort of a suicide/crisis hotline ( we also meet with people face to face and do a variety of things). That said, I've seen a number of posts recently on reddit about people having some negative interactions with hotlines. I wonder if some of you would be willing to share what has been the most helpful and authentic support over the phone? I am aware different people call looking for different things (listening, validation, resources, brainstorming...). What do you hope for from the person answering the hotline? How do you want them to respond? What has a positive experience been like for you (from a hotline or a friend/family)? 
I really appreciate and thank you in advance for answering this question and helping me be better at helping people.
