Hospitalization for depression/anxiety/suicide and self harm. Not sure what to do (Inpatient vs Outpatient)Hello, I (24F) have been admitted before to a psychiatric hospital when I was 18 as an outpatient.

Things are getting rough, and I want to commit suicide. These issues of depression, anxiety disorder, and suicide have persisted for almost 14 years. I have had a self harm issue that's very bad as well for 14 years. (99% won't commit suicide, but I want to be dead).

I am medicated, and the seem to work great (for now). But its exhausting because I literally need to drug myself day and night to make it essentially through the next 12 hours without doing something crazy. I am a suicidal, self harm mess the second I miss one medication.

I want to be hospitalized, however there's an issue. I'm not in CONSTANT danger. 24/7. However lately I'm in frequent danger. Mind you I've forgotten my meds a couple times, but even on them sometimes I have had all these issues lately. Its sad that I'm so dependent on these drugs.

I feel like I'm floating between an inpatient and an outpatient program. I would like inpatient, but I think I might feel very out of place in an inpatient program. I guess I could do out, but I definitely feel like I'm floating exactly in between. 

Side note: when I act "crazy" so to say, I don't do it around people. I hide it to myself. In inpatient I'd prob have to be clearly insane. And I am, but people can't tell because I hold it in until I'm alone. If I were to be off my meds completely, THEN I definitely would need inpatient. I'm naturally very mentally ill. :(

Thoughts?
