Im not saying I will, but I'm not saying I won'tThe past 10 years of my life have had lots of ups and downs. Ive suffered with depression for the entire decade practically and just cant see much of a reality of escaping it. 

On NYE, I told myself that I'm going to make it through. 2020 will be the start of something good, it'll be the light I need. But I told myself that last year and last year did have a few defining moments that made it seem that everything was coming up for Nat. Yet here I am. I should have been half way through my first year of uni by now, but that dream was snatched away just 2 weeks before I was supposed to start my degree.  And if it wasn't for dreaming  that a degree would give me a better future, I'd still be in a job right now. Yet here I am. 

Ive been unemployed for 4 months now. Struggling to find a job and still not knowing what I really want to do with my life. Im sick of everyone telling me something will come along soon. I can't stand having to ask my parents for financial help because even they aren't in the best position right now. 

How can I keep telling myself that it's going to get better, when it never does? I don't want to have to lie. 

Im sat here sobbing because I just feel so fucking lost and I can't trust myself. I make promises that I won't hurt myself, and truth is I don't want my actions to hurt the people that mean the most to me.

But the hard truth is I'm not sure I can keep up with this. The thoughts always come flooding back.

I fantasise about death. I dream about how I would die, and I enjoy it. I imagine the feel of it and the feel of my life slipping away.

Im in a love triangle with life and death. I have to choose a side but maybe I'll end up choosing the wrong one.
