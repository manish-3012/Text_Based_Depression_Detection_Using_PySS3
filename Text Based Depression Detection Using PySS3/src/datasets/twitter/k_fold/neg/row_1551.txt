I think about it every day, and refuse to go through with it because of what it would do to my family..Like the title says. I have struggled with heavy depression for the last 4-6 years. 6 months ago my whole life plan was wrecked, after I'd moved to a different state to follow through with those plans. I have friends who feel more distant by the day, I haven't had a date or any romantic interactions since November, I feel invisible and radioactive all at the same time.. 

I have been thinking a lot about killing myself.. I thought about it in the past when I was depressed, but lately I've been thinking heavily about details. How, when, best way to do it with least impact on my family. My folks know that I was struggling and wrestling with these thoughts, but I don't think they understand how serious they have become and how much I'm still thinking about it.

I'm 33 years old, single and so lonely I feel like dying would be less painful. I also feel trapped because I refuse to kill myself before my parents pass, sister and brother in law are busy with a family of their own and can forget more easily given time. I never considered myself that unlovable/undesirable, but within the last 6 months I have really become convinced that I am going to be this alone for the rest of my life, and I may just be way uglier inside and out than I initially thought.. These thoughts of realizing I may just be alone for the rest of my life, as well as knowing I won't go through with it until I know it will be as least impactful as possible, makes me feel more and more stuck in the idea.

I have never talked about this so thoroughly.. Really sorry if this was a rambling run on mess. 3 in the morning and sort of thinking about other things besides sentence structure so bear with me..
