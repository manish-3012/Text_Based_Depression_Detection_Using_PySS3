I donâ€™t know what to do anymore...I have been thinking of this for a very long time maybe I was just afraid on what really happen afterward when they put you under. Most of my friends has either abandon me or left me. Ended up being unhappy and almost failing my first year of college. I thought it couldnâ€™t get worse when I met this really cool girl from Reddit, she was everything I could dreamt of. Until recently she had to cut all ties and now Iâ€™m alone crying. I donâ€™t know if this can get any better...
