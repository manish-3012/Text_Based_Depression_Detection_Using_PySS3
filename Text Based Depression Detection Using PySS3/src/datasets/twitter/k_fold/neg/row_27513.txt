Two meanings for everythingWhen you say: You need to help out around the house... All I hear is: I need a personal Butler. When you say that my meds aren't working, my therapy isn't working because I'm still "sad" all I hear is: you're a waste of time, money, and energy. When you say that I can't take a nap even though my sleep schedule is off due to my job and you do, all I hear is: I don't care about your needs. When you say I am the problem, all I hear is: you need to go.... When I hear myself say I don't want to live anymore in a world that just doesn't truly care unless it's an "obligation" such as a family member who would attend my funeral because they are family. All I hear is: do it.
