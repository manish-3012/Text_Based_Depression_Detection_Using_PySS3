Iâ€™ve fucking had enough.None of this depression subs have helped me once. Iâ€™m an ugly, useless piece of shit and Iâ€™m going to fail at school. I thought about waiting a few years until after I graduated to kill myself but I think Iâ€™ll cut my time short.     

Speaking of cutting, Iâ€™ve started self harming again. Punching myself in the face till Iâ€™m black and blue, cutting up my biceps. Iâ€™ve had enough. I will end it soon.
