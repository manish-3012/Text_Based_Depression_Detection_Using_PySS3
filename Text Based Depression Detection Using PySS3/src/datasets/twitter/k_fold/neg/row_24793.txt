Iâ€™m tired of life.I am so fucking angry at everything right now. Being alive is stupid and no matter how happy I seem to feel I always want to kill myself at the end of the day. Iâ€™ve spent half the day in bed because I canâ€™t stand getting up. I did something socially awkward yesterday and my boss fucking asked me about it today. I am so embarrassed that Iâ€™m even alive anymore. I canâ€™t deal with this shit.

Anyways Iâ€™m sorry for ranting but I canâ€™t stand keeping everything to myself anymore. Actual people would hate me if they knew what a depressed piece of shit I am.
