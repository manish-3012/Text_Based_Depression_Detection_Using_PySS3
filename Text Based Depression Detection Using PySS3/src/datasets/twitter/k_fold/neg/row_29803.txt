I have no choice but to kill myself but I am going to miss my daughterI want her to know that my death has nothing to do with my love for her and everything to do with my lack of love for myself. I love her more than anything in the world and I want to be with her always and help her learn and grow and succeed. 


But I wonâ€™t be able to do that. I already miss her so much. She is the smartest, sweetest, most intelligent and amazing little girl. I love her with every cell of my being. 

Iâ€™m sorry baby. I wanted to be there for you always. You are wonderful and the strongest person I know. I will be watching over you and protecting you forever. I hope that you remember me.
