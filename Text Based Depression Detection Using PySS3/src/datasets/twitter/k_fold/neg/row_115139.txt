Inpatient care, good or bad idea?Main point: I've been doing a lot of research into suicide options, they all seem pretty risky and some are just damn expensive. My health insurance will cover mental health inpatient services for a $500 copay. Has anyone admitted themselves into a mental health facility, how did it pan out? I'd rather not waste $500 (borrowed) if it's not going to do much. I don't expect a miracle, AT ALL. But the therapists I have seen are almost embarrassing with the information and advice they provide me. 

Backstory: It's been about 10 years since my depression came on, 5 since it started to get really bad, and 2 years since I've become very serious about suicide. I've seen 6 different therapists (4 of them moved away, 2 of them just did not work at all.) I'm currently trying my 10th antidepressant and I'm just at my wit's end. I live alone, which is a terrible time in itself. I lost my job 2 years ago and I cannot afford to live right now. I've tried for a very long time to find a new living situation, and aside from living in my car, it's just not working. I have 3 pets who I love more than anything in the world, and for the past year I have been trying and failing to work out some medical issues with them. 

Parents, family, friends, co-workers are all very uninterested in helping with support. They say they are here for me but when I need them the most "something comes up." I've told them about my fears of suicide and this is still their response. I really would rather not go through with suicide. I have upcoming obligations, I'll soon be becoming the guardian of my brother, and without me, he will be sent away. Even knowing all of this and trying not to be selfish with so many suicidal thoughts, I can't help but think that this condition is never, ever going to go away. I've tried so many things. 

I don't know what to do anymore. It's getting to the point where I'm ready to get it over with at the dumbest things happening because I just kind of cant handle it anymore.

I'm really sorry this is so long, I hate bothering people with any of my bullshit. I've just heard so much mixed information about inpatient treatment and I'm so lost dammit. So if you've gone through these treatments, I'd really love to hear how it worked out for you is all I'm looking for I guess.
