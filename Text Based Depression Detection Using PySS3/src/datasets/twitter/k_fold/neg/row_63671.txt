Injury Ruling My LifeI'm 25 and I have a debilitating back problem (herniated disc) that makes everyday a struggle.  I've tried EVERYTHING to fix the problem - physical therapy, bed rest, exercise.  I can tell that the issue is on a one way path to more pain and suffering, as herniated discs don't really heal and back problems tend to just get worse.  Doctors tend to be pretty useless resources - "Do more physical therapy, strengthen the core, blah blah blah".  There clearly isn't a very effective solution.

I've had two back surgeries (discectomies) to "fix" the discs, and before each I had extremely traumatic amounts of pain.  Suicide definitely crosses my mind, as it seems like the only way for the physical pain to end.  It also doesn't help to be injured at this age amongst many very healthy individuals.

Does anyone have advice?  Has anyone else gone through this sort of thing?
