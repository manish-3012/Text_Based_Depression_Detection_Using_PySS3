The Weather Is Insanely Hot In My Country &amp; The Forecast Predicts It's Going To Stay Until 19th of August I'd Rather Just RopeI can't bear hot it gives me insane fatigue, tiredness, depression and shitty headaches.. I can't sleep at night. Today I've slept horrible 3 hours. Can't turn on the air conditioner, because I've been doing it and now caught cold.  I can barely go to work due to the amount of sleep I'm getting and also the cold. When at home and really can't take it I'm forced to lay in a cold bath. Afterwards I feel good for however long then my body warms up sadly.
