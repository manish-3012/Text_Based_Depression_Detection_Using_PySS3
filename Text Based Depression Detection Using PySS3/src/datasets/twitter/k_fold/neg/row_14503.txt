Things were getting better.I finally regained hope for the future. I was doing things I hadn't been able to do in years, due to extreme anxiety and agoraphobia. I could finally manage to go without my meds. Then, like he just *knew* I was getting better, my rapist popped up again. I don't know whether it was intentional, or not, but it still brought back a world of shit for me. I just wanted to recover from it and I finally saw hope that I eventually would. Now I'm back at square one and am not coping well with it, at all. I have this irrational fear that he's looking for me and wants to retaliate in order to silence me. I have this fear that he will just keep popping back up into my life. I'm not even a threat to him, I just want him to stay away so I can recover from it. Now, I'm so restless and filled with anxiety that is relentless.
