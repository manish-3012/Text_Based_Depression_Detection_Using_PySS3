kidding around about suicideI suffer from severe depression. Sometimes, when I'm complaining about my problems, which I realise are probably first world problems to many people, I say things like "maybe I should just commit suicide" or "how about I just commit suicide right now". I say these in jest at the time, but there is truth behind them, because I actually do not want to live. 

One day I said it to a friend and she said that I shouldn't joke around about suicide as it is a serious thing and people have it a lot worse than I do. I agree with this. However, this girl knows about my mental condition and it stung a little when she said this because I felt like she hasn't actually been taking me seriously when I *seriously* say that I want to die. 

As with all 'jokes', context is all, but I understand that throwing around the phrase "I wanna commit suicide" doesn't help much. I still felt a little annoyed and now I'm slightly resentful towards her for this.

Would you be offended if people threw around that phase? Is my annoyance/resentment misplaced? Am I in the wrong?
