I think my dad wants to kill himselfi need advice like i have  come here to ask for advice simply because i do not know what to ask or say.

Just a couple of minutes ago i was looking for some pins to pin up my revision work to the wall and so went into my dads drawers to look for some. Inside it was a grey rock with black writing on it and it read "I want to kill myself but don't have the courage". My dads mental state is not the greatest, but hes happy i think. He hates his job but he has a family that loves him very much. I hope this is just a joke as he does "joke" about this but now i am starting to wonder if this is serious. I want to talk to my mum about this and hopeful she will have some sort of explanation. If any of yous have any advice please, please tell me  as i dont want to talk to my dad as am scared what he will do.

Thank you
