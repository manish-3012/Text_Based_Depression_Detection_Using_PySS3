The mental health issues/OCD that I am struggling with for more than 4 years, I think it's time to put it out of my mind it might help I don't know what else to do I feel scared.(age 15) forgive me if I wrote it poorly english is my second language.I was scared for a long time to talk about these stuff because I thought it would stay in my head more longer to an extend of having to kill myself, I think that it must be a solution out of it, I am not gonna  give up "just yet".

The first step I did was to search on google about my problem which I was afraid to do for more than 4 years also I wasn't sure it was a problem&lt;-- (still trying to fight it that it wan't a problem). So I googled it and I found out that it was similar to OCD. Here's my story:

I was trying to be social accepted because of my friend group, one friend(D) was calling the other friends and me "you have cancer" "noob"  "\*\*\*\*rd" "\*\*\*pid" and other bad stuff because we were doing stuff that annoyed him (like playing a game, not being as good as him in bikes in video games{fortnite/call of duty) and the other friends tried to be better/closer friend with him because he was like cool to them and they were thinking there was a problem with the rest of their friend group like I was thinking with my friend(T) at the time that he was keep doing the stuff that annoyed my toxic friend(D) this friend(T) was getting  more and more hate to him(T) that my toxic friend(D) calling him names like "noob" "\*\*\*\*rd" and "you have carcer" and etc. I was trying not be like my other friends/friend and tried to do things, to be more social, to be funny, etc so that they can like me as a friend. I devoloped an OCD, mental health issues that I wasn't aware of after more than 4 years than it was developed. Now I don't know if I am fully recovered from that but I am seeing some growth and improvement. Every day I wake up and I keep reminding to myself I can get recovered. I stopped any touch of communication with my friends and I can sae improvement with my mental health

I am 15 forgive me if I said something wrong or if I didn't structured it not good enough to understand the situation

I tried to make friendly advice smh I don't know if it's good enough(please be carefull with who you have become friends with if you feel like your friends are not good for your mental illeness maybe you shouldn't be friends with them chooce your friends don't let them choose who you are)

I am not sure If I should talk about my second story but I want to find a solution so here it goes:

I was around 12 when I went to my cousins(11) house at first times I got  there everything was great we were having fun doing stuff normal cousins do but the situation changed and we went to (here I am cutting out details I think I am scared of remembering stuff) jerking each others dicks of, it happened once or twice, I wasn't comfartable doing these stuff but he was pussing for more (I fell so disgust I don't know if it was a rape it didn't feel like it I had control I thought that we were doing silly stuff because he was like my friend, I tried no to be rude and break our friendship, how dumb I was, I stopped after two  times) I still feel disgusted about it I don't want never to do something like that agian (I think I was also scared about my gender sexuality off to an extend of being homophobic from that)

I think I am done I am tired, I feel bad explaining it poorly or people might not exactly know how to help me, I feel dizzy its been more than 3 hours writing these going back and forth not sure what to add or correct edit(I had to remove slars because the post was getting automatically deleted)

I want to write some other mental health issues (OCDs I think)shit, old people, my friend who was taking all the hate from my other toxic friend, gays in some degree from that thing that happened, people in my family my uncle my grandma my dad, other disgusting stuff

I wrote these things exactly as it happened, out of my head, when I started writing these stories I didn't had in mind that I would post it anywhere

I don't know what else to try I am gonna be at the comments if someone can help me or ask me questions
