I have a fighting soul, but the longer i keep going and fighting the more clear it is that there is nothing to fight aboutIt's.. I don't know. The only thing left for me to do is keep on fighting, in the hope to reach some sort of success. And i might do it, but it will never be enough, it won't make me happy.

I won't quit life, i'm made to fight as long as i stand. But It's never gonna be a happy Life. So i guess there is nothing else to do for me then keep on living a Life full of pain, so at least i can Tell myself i fought the hardest battle for my whole Life.
