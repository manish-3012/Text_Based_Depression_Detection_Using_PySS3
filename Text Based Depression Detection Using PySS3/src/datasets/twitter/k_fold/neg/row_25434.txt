I can't be here anymoreI don't even want to be happy any more. All I really want is to be gone without actually having to kill myself. I'd hurt everyone around me to much. My closest friend is already suicidal, along with my only sister. At night I lay in my bed with the lights off and hope that the darkness with consume me, and in the morning I won't wake up. I've stopped cutting now but I'm almost pushed to the limit every now and then. When I did self harm in the past i remember the urge to cut. I guess it distracted me. Sometimes I don't even really feel that sad anymore. I just know that I don't want to be living, and don't understand how anyone else's would want to be.
