Life has no value anymoreI've thrown my life down a worm-hole that I can't escape from. Everyday I feel the same deep sorrow that has engulfed my existence since I was younger. Although I'm still young, I've felt like I've lived 60 years. Everyone and everything around just feel still-minded entities, never-changing and forever at unease inside of me.
