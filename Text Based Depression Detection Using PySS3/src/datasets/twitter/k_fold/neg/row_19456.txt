I tried to jump out of the car todayI got into an argument with my mom while she was driving, at first it was just me staying quiet while she berated me with insults but then she said to me â€œmaybe if I had beaten you like in Trinidad you would have turned out betterâ€. My response was â€œJesus fucking Christâ€ then she hit me. Apparently dad used to beat and swear at her too so she said she had enough. Twenty minutes later she says something to me I canâ€™t remember and I try to jump out of the car. She stopped me and now Iâ€™m with my dad.
