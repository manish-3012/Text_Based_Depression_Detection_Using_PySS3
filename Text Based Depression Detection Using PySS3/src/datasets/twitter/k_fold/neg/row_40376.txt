What would you say?If someone was having thoughts of committing suicide, What would you say to try convince them otherwise? (Not "It`ll get better" type crap either)

I have no sob story, had a pleasant upbringing, friends and family etc. Yet I feel the world is just too painful and far too much suffering to continue, each day just brings more pain and sadness. Ive never felt like it was me or that something was wrong with me, more the world around me and the suffering it offers daily. There seems no end in sight and that things will continue on the way they are forever, whether I am here or not. Sometimes it just seems like it`d be easier to put the hose through the window and drift off to nothingness and to finally know true calm and peace. I dont know why Im posting here, I dont think it`ll help. Most comments here are just copy pasted dribble.

I just want to feel something, or to feel nothing; finally.
