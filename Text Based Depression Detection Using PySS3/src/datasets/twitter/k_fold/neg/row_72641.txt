Another sleepless nightIts around 5am and Iâ€™m waiting for the mixture of sleeping pills and alcohol to take effect and relieve me from my thoughts another sleepless night. 

The career I wanted to flesh out is more difficult to reach now, but the worse thing is the fear of still feeling that dread. Daydreaming of having it and still being plagued by a feeling of wanting to throw it away and being unhappy anyways. It seems no change of situation can change that itâ€™s always there, just suppressed sometimes.

Whatâ€™s a job anyways? Tons of people have jobs that are just a living, so they pursue what they want outside that. But itâ€™s still a huge chunk of their life and  if thereâ€™s nothing you want outside of it. It all seems redundant. All my friends talk about having kids, but I donâ€™t want more mouths to feed. I donâ€™t want anybody else to worry about. Kids aside I donâ€™t want another partner either. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m a liar because Iâ€™ll stop loving them. And then I donâ€™t want them. I donâ€™t want it.

The purpose of life is to struggle and enjoy. Journey or destination to be corny. But I donâ€™t care about any of it. Struggle is still struggle and all too often I just wanna call it a day and go to sleep. And stay asleep. Forever.
