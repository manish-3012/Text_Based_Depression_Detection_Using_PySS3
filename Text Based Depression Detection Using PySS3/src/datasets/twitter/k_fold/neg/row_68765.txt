15 year old, tired of livinghey,
iâ€™ve made a post before and got some comments telling me to reach out.
thatâ€™s exactly what i did and it didnâ€™t go the way i thought it would go. 
everything has gone downhill, nothing is better and my parents wont believe me. they have started using my mental problems as leverage in fights, mock me, yell at me, etc. nothing has gotten better, and im honestly confused. im starting to think the only way out really is suicide. im just so tired of living through every single day. i have no one else i can talk too. my â€œfriendsâ€ either choose to ignore my problems or donâ€™t care, and if i talk to a teacher/counselor all they would do is tell my parents, which will make things worse at home. please help, i donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
