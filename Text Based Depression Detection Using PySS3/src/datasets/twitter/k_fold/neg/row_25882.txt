I cant handle anymoreI've given up... I can't see a way forward. 

No job, no hope, can't get a job that works with my childcare, and my one chance a week to see my daughter. My daughter's mother won't allow that to change. So I'm screwed forever.

Goto court Friday to get a criminal record so I won't work again in my fields, even if I could get a job. Because I fucked up in a moment of depression. (Sent text breaching EPO, assuming I was still blocked)

Lawyers not even being useful, won't even return calls or emails now. 

And today now I'm told I no longer qualify for welfare. So I'll be homeless in 3 weeks. 

I've done everything for my son, he's what I lived for... I can't take care of him anymore. My life just keeps getting worse. I can't see a way forward anymore... Can't get a job, can't pay bills already, no more hope of recovery. 

I can't deal with all this anymore. I keep my son I'm homeless he goes to his abuser. So it really doesn't matter what I do anymore outcome is the same. Why prolong suffering?
