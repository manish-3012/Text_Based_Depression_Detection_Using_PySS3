Update:Not going to the hospital at the moment. 

Please don't question this decision. It IS what is best right now. I MAY go next week...but I don't know. I am no longer feeling on the edge and I actually slept better than I have in forever last night. My youngest son's 5th birthday is Monday. He is the one who has kidney disease so I am looking forward to that. 

*Breathes*

I go see my psychiatrist today at 9:40 am and I will ask her to up my meds I think.

I thank all of you for the support you've given me. My neighbor and my daughter sat with me last night and we had a deep talk about things. 

As I said I feel much better.
