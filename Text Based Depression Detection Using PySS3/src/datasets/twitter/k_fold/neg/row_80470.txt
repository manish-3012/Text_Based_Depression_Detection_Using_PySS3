My username says it all. I have to die. I need to.I'm stuck doing low salary work forever. Stuck at home caring for sick disabled family. No friends, no girlfriend, in my late 20s, and virtually no prospects for a better future. Life has no luster or joy. The last thing I want is to end up as a wrinkly feeble old man, alone in his bed, waiting tortuously to die alone by himself with not a soul who cares around. I don't want that to happen. At all. The only way to end my misery is to die. There's just no other way to go about it.
