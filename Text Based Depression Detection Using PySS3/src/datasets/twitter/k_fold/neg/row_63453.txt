Iâ€™m never going to be who Iâ€™m meant to beI forget how it came into conversation, but my roommate had told me how people in a club Iâ€™m an officer for at my university have told her that I give off bitchy vibes and that they donâ€™t like me. Big deal, right? So what if some donâ€™t like me. Except I now have reason to believe that Iâ€™m the reason for the clubs shrinking population, Iâ€™m killing something I enjoy. On top of that, I donâ€™t really have friends, people just donâ€™t talk to me because Iâ€™m unapproachable. I donâ€™t try to be you know? I always try to be super friendly and for the beginning of my life, I was super friendly and well liked. I was outgoing and people seemed to enjoy my presence. I went through a crap year and I guess itâ€™s hardened me and not for the better. 

My biggest goal in life is to be a good teacher. And if Iâ€™m bitchy and unapproachable, Iâ€™m not going to be able to be a good teacher. I want to be a good mother, and well, we all know what Iâ€™d say here. I donâ€™t want to be bitchy and unapproachable.

I want to be the happy and well liked person I used to be. I want to be a teacher and a great one at that. I want to be a good mom.
Except those obviously canâ€™t happen with how I am.

So, I want to die. If I canâ€™t be me, then I donâ€™t want to be.
