How many times can you ask for help before you stop for good?If you've already asked for help and told the people closest to you exactly how you feel and what you are going through, should you have to ask again? I mean, we all know asking for help is normally the last thing you will do before its too late. So should we have to remind them that we still need them? Or should they remember if they care as much as they claim to? I know everyone has got problems and their own lives to deal with. But all I ever hear is "you should have told me things have gotten bad again". But, what if it was your job to ask me how I was before it got bad again? You are one of only a few people who actually know, so why should I have to remind you that I am still here and that I'm still hurting? Yes we need to speak out and ask fro help, but what if we already have? What do we do then? Time passes and you go back to your life and forget, but for me, for us, it builds up inside us again, and now we are to scared to ask for help. Because you know, you know yet do nothing. I did my part and told you. Surely its now your job to do what you said you would and be there for me when I need help.
I think now I am done reminding and asking. I'm going back to self destruction an isolation. When you care enough to ask me how I am, I will say I'm fine and it's up to you weather to believe me or not. Your answer will show how much you care. weather you are asking to actually find out, or weather you are just doing your duty by asking, then wiping your hands of me.
