on the edge of the fencei've had suicidal thought before but would never commit to them, my family means too much to me.
i became close to a girl around easter time, we went into a relationship and that has almost completely removed all suicidal thoughts but i fucked up today. am i selfish to be asking for help even though i know i won't do it, but i don't know if i would. i've been drinking to help numb myself a bit but i feel its only made it worse.
