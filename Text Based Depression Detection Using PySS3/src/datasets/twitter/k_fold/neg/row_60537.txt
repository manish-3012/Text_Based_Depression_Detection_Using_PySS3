There's a line on the suicide prevention websiteI just think that's funny in a hysterically tragic and sad way.

I mean...  Feb 14th is a hellscape for so many people...  But in the haze of intoxication this evening I'm thinking to myself...  "Not what is the point?" or "who would care?"

&amp;#x200B;

But more...  How is it fair to me to ask me to continue to suffer?  How fucking selfish of you and the so-called "people who would miss me" to ask me to keep going?  Forcing every last scrap of my willpower to keep waking up in the morning and put one foot in front of the other.  I've survived deployment...  Survived cancer.  Survived sexual assault.  But for what?  What have I survived for?  Who the fuck is asking me to keep living and why?  It's sure as hell not any of the people around me or who've passed through my life.  It's sure as hell not "god".

&amp;#x200B;

Why is it so important that I live?  If suddenly 500,000 people on this planet just vanished...  Sure, people would mourn...  But in 50-100 years...  Hell, even 10 years...  we might have a day off or a day of remembrance like September 11th...  But most people just simply do not care.

I'm waiting to stop breathing.  I feel like a vegetable on life support and I just simply neglected to set up plans for someone to pull the plug.  I don't think I've really felt anything in almost 30 years that hasn't passed almost immediately.

I'm actually really happy for my ex-fiance.  She found happiness after we split.  That just proves to me she never could have been happy with me.  I'm not capable of being happy anymore.  I'm too volatile.  I've been to therapy.  I'm on antidepressants.  I'm intelligent enough to acknowledge and identify negative aspects about myself.  I just can't make myself better.  I can't put on a smile anymore.  I can't fake this anymore.  Most of the people that have shown even the slightest amount of interest in me have turned out to absolutely psychotic.  Which just drives home the point that I could never possibly have an even remotely normal relationship, platonic or romantic, ever again.

How the fuck could anybody consider the loss of me some tragic loss?  Why is it so important I live another 30-40 years crippled and in pain and hating myself?
