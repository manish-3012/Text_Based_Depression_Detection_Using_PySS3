I told an online friend about my plan today. He threatened to follow suit.I thought, online, I would be safe. I thought that as I cut off people in real life, I could talk to some people online to pass the time before I can act. But we grew to care for each other and became rather codependent. He realized something was wrong and asked me. I spilled the beans. I fucked up. I felt at peace but now I feel so conflicted again. I don't know what to do. Why is something so simple in theory so difficult to accomplish? I should have just resisted the urge to find a sense of belonging when I knew all along that this was my goal. I keep on fucking things up for myself and everyone around me. :'(

I hate having to live for others and I am not sure if I know how to live for myself.
