i plan on killing myself tomorrownot sure if im supposed to be posting this here. or where. i dont really fucking know anymore

so. im 16. ive got so many things in my life i could name that should be good and should make me happy. and i guess thats whats gonna make this so much harder because i know i have a good life compared to other people. im not being abused and im not bullied at school. so i dont know why i feel like this. i dont know whats wrong with me.

i just dont want to be alive. i dont want to exist. i dont know why. im so fucking dumb its not even funny. im not even smart enough to ask questions to get smarter. i dont understand how things in the world work and i forget stuff so much. i have zero motivation to do almost anything.

i used to love drawing but now my hands shake and i cant make the right lines. it isnt turning out right. none of it is. i cant do my school work and its only been a couple weeks but im falling behind and i cant understand the material and none of its making sense.

tomorrows my sisters birthday. she turns 7 and i dont get to see her cause she'll be at her moms house. i just thought of that. guess ill end up dying on her birthday. i know thats gonna suck for her but i dont really have any other day i could do this on. im gonna miss her and im gonna miss my little brother and my older sister. im gonna miss everyone but i just dont have a plan in life. i dont want to be here anymore.

im probably just gonna take a fuck ton of pills. if that doesnt work theres always a bunch of guns in my dads closet. i don't know anymore. im just hoping in 24 hours i wont be here anymore.

ive tried the medicine and the counseling and anything you could imagine and in the end it didnt work because here i am still wishing i was dead. i get ive got so many fucking years ahead of me i just dont care anymore
