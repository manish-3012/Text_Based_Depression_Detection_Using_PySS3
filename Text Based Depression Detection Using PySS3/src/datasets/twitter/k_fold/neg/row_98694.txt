i dislike 99% of pplI f'ing hate EVERYONE. everyone pisses me off. I see flaws in myself but I see flaws in other ppl as well. I hate submissive ppl, I hate fake ppl, I hate aholes, I hate the quiet ones who think they are a nice person but they are a POS aholes too, I hate how everyone thinks they are so intelligent and great but they are all fucking worthless shit. I hate ppl who brags about themselves cause they have no fucking life, i hate ppl who are so focused on work cause they have no fucking life or any personality. i fucking hate ppl who are so focused on famous ppl.

i think it has to do with high emotional intelligence, I can understand someone's personality right off the bat. they don't even have to expose those terrible traits, i just pick up on how they think, communicate, their desire, their drive and what they focus on. ppl irritates me so much because everyone thinks they are right. im one of the few ppl who takes a step back to realize what the fuck is going on. fuck i hate this world

everyone is annoying, they always have to be watching something, listening to music or posting silly pictures on instagram
