I'm sorry. But this is goodbye.I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I can no longer cope with my feelings. I have tried for so long to be okay. But I am so physically, mentally, and emotionally drained. It's become difficult to make it through the day. I'm lucky if I can even wake up some days. I'm sorry I have to go but I can't take it anymore. I'm tired of hurting. Hurting myself, others, hurting in general. I'm tired of living. I'm tired of caring. I've become numb but apparently not numb enough. I've fallen into an endless cycle and I don't see any other way out. I'm so sorry. Please. Don't fall down the same path I have. Please stay safe. Stay alive. I'm close to the end. I've taken some pills and I'm feeling tired. I regret it but I can't keep living like this. I'm so sorry. I might try to get help. Who knows. I'm so sorry. Thank you all for being here for me when nobody else was. Please, stay safe okay?
