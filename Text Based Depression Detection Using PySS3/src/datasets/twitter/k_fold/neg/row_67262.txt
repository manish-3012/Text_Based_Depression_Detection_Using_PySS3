Why shouldn't I kill myself?Ugly, skinny af, small dick, depressive, severe anxiety, shy and no real friends.

Never kissed someone and probably never will because of the reasons listed above.

Give me reasons not to kill myself, and don't bullshit me by saying that relationships doesn't matter because it's one of the most important things in life, if not the most.
