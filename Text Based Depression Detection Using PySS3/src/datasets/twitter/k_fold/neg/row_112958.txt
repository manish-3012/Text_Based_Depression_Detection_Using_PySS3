Fading into oblivion*Before I provide the details of my current situation and state, allow me to start from the beginning to give you some context. I'll try to make it as brief as I can, but I know it is still a freakin book. **In fact it's a little too large. So I've split it into a post and a comment.** The last part should stand by itself, so if you do not wish to read it all, you can skip there. However, to understand why I am asking what I am, the full context is important:*

**The Very Beginning:**

Coincidently before my life even started I was faced with the prospect of an untimely demise. My mother and father were told something was wrong and that it was unlikely that I would open my eyes to the light of the world they lived in. I do not know the exact details as to what was happening at the time, but as my mother's pregnancy matured things took a turn for the worse and it cultimated in a very early delivery. As the doctors worked around the clock to save the baby, it became apparent to that not only the baby was at risk, but the mother as well. The family was informed of what might happen...  As a helicopter was rushing to the local hospital to take her to a better prepared facility -- I was born. My mom survived. The doctors were wrong, and very thankfully so.

**My Childhood:**

My parents were farmers on a generational farm, and as a kid this was a fantastic place to be. I had a brother and sister that were very close, and family was a large part of our life. My brother and I would run amok around the large farm, helping with choirs and 'jobs' wherever we were able... even going as far as to once 'clean' the barn with mud, not realizing the importance of soap.  

During this time we also received our first computer, in the form of a Tandy. It was a mesmorizing machine and my brother and I would spend the occasional hour tinkering with it inbetween our shenanigans around the farm. We soon found that by modifying various files, we could alter our favorite games and create new levels. At the time we were not so much interested in the reason of why or how it worked, but rather that it allowed us to play on each other's challenging levels.
My childhood was full of great things that most childhoods are, and I feel I was blessed with many more than most.

**My Early Teens:**

As time progressed my brother largely lost interest in computers, but my interest grew into an obsession. During the day I went to school and worked around the farm. At night I spent many hours sitting in front of my computer... I ran several gaming related websites that were largely basic HTML and javascript, but later evolved into PHP/MySQL sites. I found creating websites and writing code very empowering, and largely enjoyed the fact that I could create something out of seemingly nothing. I learned C/C++ and wrote many applications in spare time just for the heck of it.

During this time I enjoyed high popularity and a great social circle at school. I was not a terrific student, but I usually kept at least a B average. It was also during this time that I realized programming wasn't a skill most people had, including but not limited to the school administration. From this I realized I could easily obtain access to directories on teachers' machines, and was able to replace their grade entering application with my own look alike. Even though the teachers still 'audited' their grades with pencils at the end of a quarter so the temporary changes were only reflected in mid-quarter report cards, at the time I thought it was great... and so did the people who I helped out with A's.

**My Mid/Late Teens:**

After being caught by teachers for breaking into the school's 'security', my demeanor grew to be largely confrontational with authority and I let everyone know it. I mostly restricted my outbursts to people whom I felt abused their power but also to my regret also hurt some that were trying to help, such as my parents. I guess I was the typical stereotypical teenager. My 9th grade year was spent mostly in the confines of our 'detention room' forced to do schoolwork. My grades faltered but my friendships and social circle did not. I had a very large group of friends and remained very popular and usually happy despite lengthy periods of detention...  That is until high school.

In high school I began skipping school to go to the college library to learn more about programming and computers. My teachers and parents did not respond well, and I pushed back. I disagreed with what was being taught to me, and thought I could do a better job myself. I am still glad I took my education into my own hands, but it resulted in me being with withdrawn from school and friends. 

In my Junior year I started becoming occasionally terrified of people for no apparent reason, and thought it was some strange form of stage fright. I didn't really worry much about it. Little did I know it was the first emerging signs of Schizophrenia. 

At the end of my junior year, I decided to drop out to show my disgust with the system and those I was on bad terms with (including my parents). Though at the time nobody agreed with my decision and let me know it (everyday), it allowed me to focus on my own education. I was by no means giving up. Following dropping out I read countless books related to programming and was taking my GEDs for college as well. I used my knowledge to write various applications and sell them online (they were not the best of the best, but people bought them). By no means did it give me funds to support myself, so I also worked full-time as a farm-hand. 

My teens were rough, but I had the future to look forward to and also college, which became a possibility when I earned my GED with some of the highest scores possible.
