I lost my will to live againThis is a throw away account cause ive posted here so much that I'm kinda embarrassed that I need constant help to not ......damn 

So...okay well I've been born with some problems that with the work of the doctors has no effect on me now aside for staying semi isolated till the age of 5 cause of staying in hospital most of the time and till the age of 10 cause of my dad I still have nightmares cause of what happened
He still makes me feel like I'm not a man tho I know the way he sees manlines is dumb 
I'm still dodging if somebody raises their hand to fast around me 
My mom on the other hand well I think that because of my dad but my hole life she saw men as animals 
I didn't want to accept that I had depression until my I think is psychiatrist in English told me that if I don't accept it I can't fight it for me it was like my mind was fighting against me everything I did I would argue with myself for fucks sake I got to the point I was screaming to myself I was living with a nuce in my drawer for an year
So I tried getting into relationships it was terrible but I started talking to this girl and well she told me she loved me and that got me motivated I started working out losing weight I....felt happy I was happy
2 days ago she told me she told me I love but she ment it like a  friend and I don't blame her you can't choose who you love and I still care about her but it hurts like something tearing  Into me ,I cried like a baby ofcourse nobody sees me like that I'm not a man I'm a.....me 
And I never stopped doubting myself but I thinking if she sees something in me there is something to live for. It's 6 am I can't sleep I can't eat I'm becoming the person that I hate again 
I think I'll end it I don't wanna live like this again
But I still wanna at least talk to her one last time because if not for her I would've been way worse
