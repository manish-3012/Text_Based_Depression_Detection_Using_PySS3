I am not okayI haven't actually said that to anyone. 

Certainly haven't said I think about how I'd kill myself every single night. 

All I need is to move. If I move, I can fix everything else. But no one will accept me. The competition in my area is awful and I'm not categorised as desirable. I can't help bitterly feeling that these people don't NEED to move, they just want a change, something nicer, something different. They don't have neighbours that spend their waking hours stomping (below, and I still feel it) around their apartment, screaming at each other, the dogs I desperately wish would get taken away, or me through their fucking ceiling. 

I cannot cope anymore. All I need is to move and it feels like I'm asking for the world and then some.
