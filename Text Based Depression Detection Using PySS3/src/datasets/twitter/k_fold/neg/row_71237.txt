Everything's falling apart.I thought everything was fine until about 3 months ago my depression (bipolar 2) was coming back and that I dealt with it in the best possible way by bringing myself into stationary treatment in a psychiatry, the treatment took about a month and really helped a lot. I also got new stabilisers (Lithium is what I take now) and they helped a lot until two weeks ago my favorite keeper of my youth residential group left forever to work in the other end of Germany. This really depressed me and led to a very depressive phase, eventhough I still take Lithium.
Everything was normal about two weeks after, I still felt a bit sad and was unwilling to keep on going, but I was able again to do normal housework. But yesterday I got detailed information by a child from my youth residential group about him getting sexually assaulted by another child. I reported it and did everything I could for him, but in my deep self it deteriorated me even faster, because it triggered many traumas, which were kept untouched.
Now I'm sitting here alone, not knowing what to do, or if live is even worth living anymore, because it has become hell again and again and I don't know if I will make today alive.

For reference:
-I'm 18 and since I turned I had to find a new psychiatrist (who doesn't want to give me more Lithium eventhough the level of it in my blood is way to low for it to work properly);
this also meant looking for a new psychologist, but I will have to wait at least another month before being able to see her.
