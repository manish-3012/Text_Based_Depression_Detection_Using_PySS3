The shell broke. i fucking need help.i thought i was a strong person. turns out all that "confidence", was nothing but a shell i had built. other people try to hide their feelings. i never did.  Maybe that's why i ended up bitter lonely and avoidant of other people's problems. i don't treat people as i should because I'm afraid of having many people around me. i left everything behind moved to a different country and I'm even more lonely (i didn't think it's possible) I'd rather die than see another fucking liar. all i did was try to help people to feel better about myself i can't fucking take it anymore i don't have a place to stay i don't have money i hate my job i fucking can't.
