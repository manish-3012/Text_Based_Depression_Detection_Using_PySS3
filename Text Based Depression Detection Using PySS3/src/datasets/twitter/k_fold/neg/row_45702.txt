A moment of happiness cannot replace a lifetime of suffering.It gets better.

God I hate that phrase.
Can it get better? Maybe. But, despite it getting better, it can and likely will get worse as well.

I'm in the best place I've been in my entire life, and everyday I wish I had killed myself in my youth or died in an accident or something. The panic attacks are increasing. The suicidal ideation is flourishing and I already have a plan. I'm living everyday, waiting for the trigger that will push me over the edge and finally let me end things.

I talked to my father after work today (he also has depression). I tell him what upsets me, but all he can tell me is "You have nothing to be sad about! Your doing great!" Yeah ok dad, thanks I guess if my depression doesn't meet his standards then it must mean I'm just a big complainer. How dare I not be happy?


I just want it all to end. I want it to be over. 
I hope you all had a better day than I did. :/
