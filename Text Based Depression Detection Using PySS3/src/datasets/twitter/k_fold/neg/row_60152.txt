So this mights be off topic or me over reacting but here it goes.just for you know im a twelve year ols girl whoâ€™s gonna go to highschool next year. So i found this not too long ago and i wanted to share a piece of my story so yeah, this happened recently about a moth ago so me and my mom got into an argument and she slapped me at the end so as always I overreacted and starded crying and then i made a drawing like i always do when im sad, it was about 3 am and my mom came into my room yelling and accusing me of taking her lunchbox((kinda stupid but she was drunk and on drugs so yeah)) so i cried again couse im sensative, and then she saw the drawing and yelled at me to kill myself and jump of and stuff couse the drawing had the words help me on it,but yeah i dont wanna say more other than i got a few punches but thats fine but besides that, so ive been kinda  depressed for about 2 years now and I usually keep a fake smile on my face and i try to make others happy but yeah ive been looking back at more things shes done to me and i feel horrible i think im the reason on her being an alcoholic and that im the reason they took away my little sister((shes 3)) and so ive been thinking of throwing myself off the bridge neer my house or drowning myself, even though my arms are already bloody i dont know how to stop i feel useless and hopeless i dont know what to do can you guys maybe give me some advice? Sorry if im asking for too much and sorry for overreacting.
Bye for now.
