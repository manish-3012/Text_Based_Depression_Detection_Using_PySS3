This place is hellSimply put. Theres no way in my eyes this life can't be hell. I can't even share my story fully because too many would judge. I get horrible intrusive thoughts, bad chronic depression for 10+ yrs, bad anxiety some OCD. Im thinking of just going to live in a pysch ward forever. I cant hold a job or get hired. I'd say life is a joke but its way beyond that. Life is a setup by a higher power to fucking torture me for eternity i think. I hope that nothing else exists but pretty convinced thats not true. I'd be so happy if death is just the end, but i cant prove it. How do i know deja vu isnt evidence for my life being repeated on and on? How do I know good people aren't just the demons living good lives to make mine seem worse? How the FUCK does therapy cost 100+ an hour but alcohol isnt close to that. Medication expensive too. Society fucking sucks, every job sucks, everything sucks with depression. Theres no point in having kids, a relationships, talents, passions, anything, i cant because im too miserable. Life is hell i'm convinced
