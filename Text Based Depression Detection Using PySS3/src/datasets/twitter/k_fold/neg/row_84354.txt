I wanted to live a brilliant, happy lifeI wanted to make friends and life-long companionship. But everything in my life stacked against it happening. Tragedy after tragedy, not even a year break in between. 

And I don't want to hear "well, it can always happen still" because that's bullshit and it's not real life. Real life isn't based on effort when you were given no chances to begin with. Nobody is gonna know, nobody is gonna care what I went through, what I lost. 

I fucking lost at life since being born into a whacked out family. I'm not that one in a million success story of some abused kid making something out of himself. I'm part of the million pool, the unlucky bastards whose was born without natural resilience, beaten out of any hope, left with the scourge of despair, tragedy, trauma. It hasn't gone away in 7 years. Why would it go away now? Tomorrow? A year from now?

I lost. That's the truth.
