I would want to week help but I don't know howSo basically since 2017 I've been considering suicide but lately I think I've begun to overcome it and I want to talk about it with a psychologist. The problem is that I have a rather strict parents and very narrow minded, so I don't want them knowing about it.
What should I do? Who should I talk to? 
P.S. I am 18 so legally I'm legally an adult.
