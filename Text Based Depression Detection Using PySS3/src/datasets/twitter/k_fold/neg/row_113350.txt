Why does everyone say they care?Everyone says they care before you die, and even  after you die so many random people pop up at your funeral and say they you meant a lot to them. Everyone is supposedly in so much pain because you died. 

I donâ€™t get it, those people meant nothing to you and barely knew you. Even your family are people that are supposed to love you but they donâ€™t know you either. Nobody is ever there for your pain and all they do is make it worse. Nobody is careful or kind when youâ€™re alive and then when youâ€™re dead all of a sudden you meant so much and it was such a tragedy. 

If I die I know there will be a bunch of lil rabbits popping up out of the woodworks to parade around with my grief. But in truth there are very few people who genuinely care if I am happy. I feel like I should make a guest list for my funeral and a do not enter list as well because I donâ€™t get why people do this. Is it for the clout of wanting to know someone who has died?? Isnâ€™t it kind of immoral? shouldnâ€™t they be ashamed of themselves. I just want my death to be truthful and for it to be known that I struggled a lot with people and things in my life, I tried my absolute best, I had a close relationship with a few special people....and thatâ€™s a wrap.
