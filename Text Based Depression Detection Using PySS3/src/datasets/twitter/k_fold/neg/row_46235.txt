Afraid to post, but feel like I need to...I feel like I need to tell somebody, anybody who understands, how I've been feeling. I've been feeling suicidal, and I am really scared. Eventually I intend to find the courage to post more about myself here, but it feels uncomfortable. I'm sorry. I don't know what to do. Been depressed for well over a year now. Been suicidal from time to time. Been really close before too. I just don't know why I feel this way. It's just too intense a feeling to just ignore. I don't know what's going to happen. I feel really scared.
