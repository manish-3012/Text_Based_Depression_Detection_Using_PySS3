I think this might be it.Why?
Guess I'm going to jump right in. After years of dealing with depression I think it finally won. I have always told myself and others there's another way out you might not like it but it's there and we'll I stand corrected. I have tryed everything meds, therapy, talking with the few friends I have let ( most I lost and some just draw apart). I have little to no family left vary few friends a wife who my best guess is want to leave me and about everthing else you can think of to bring a guy down. 

How?
Now I'm thinking bullet to the head but that alot of mess! I can't slit my throat tryed (chickened out) but that was years ago so maybe it would work. Hanging sound slow and I can't drowned myself soooo gun it is I guess. I just don't know!

When? 
The mother of all questions!!! I can't seem to set a date I don't know why if I could just pick a date it would all end the pain and sad the over all feeling of being a burden of life. But I keep telling myself just hold out you'll figure something out and then one more shit storm comes my way.    So when?
