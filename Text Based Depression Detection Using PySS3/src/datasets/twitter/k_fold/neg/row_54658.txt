just finished an online chat with suicide prevention hotline for an hour.the operator definitely got everything out of me. just told him everything that i've kept locked in my head. you could tell he really wanted to help, but there is ultimately nothing that he can do, and i told him this.

he closed the conversation by saying he wishes the best for me. swell dude

i think i like the falling asleep on train tracks idea. it would be so easy and peaceful.
