I really want to die now...I suffer. Literally EVERY FUCKING DAY WITH MY STUDIES. why? So hear. I mostly write to the point. Now my country's fucked up school system wants me to write one thing for 10 times. Like if a line has the curtains were blue, I need to explain why it was blue. IT WAS JUST FUCKING BLUE. WHAT THE FUCK DOES IT HAS TO DO WITH THE AUTHOR'S MOOD!? And I get humiliated every day about it. My mom today, broke a teak wood stick on me. My back hurts now. Why? I don't like to study for that same reason. If I study, I'll get the same average marks. If I study too hard, I'll downgrade. That simple thing is not understood by my mom. And if I die, I'll not suffer again and again every day for that. Why the fuck? Why our schools are so fucked up?
