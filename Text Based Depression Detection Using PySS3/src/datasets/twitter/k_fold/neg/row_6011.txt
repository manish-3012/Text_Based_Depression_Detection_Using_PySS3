I bought a shotgun todayI'm home alone for the weekend and I plan on drinking until I have the courage to shoot 
myself. I've already had most of a bottle of crown royal, if I can't do it tonight I'll try again. 
I have until Sunday evening to finish this. I don't feel like I can type out the things I've done 
again but you can look in my post history. I hate what I am and what I do but I've been unable to 
stop myself. I can't get professional help and be honest with them without going to jail losing
the love of my family and if I ever got out I would have to be a registered sex offender for the 
rest of my life. My little sister is the one I've hurt the worst with all this and I would
do anything to be able to take it all back.
