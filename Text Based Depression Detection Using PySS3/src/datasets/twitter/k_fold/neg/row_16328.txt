I don't know how to keep myself safe.Hi, 

I feel like shit. I don't know how to cope with these feelings. I live a pointless life day-to-day. My days are filled with worry and anxiety, I don't do the things in life I should and may well be capable of. Every few weeks I am hit with this viscious depression. Out of nowhere, like a slap in the face, the world around me suddenly appears dark and scary. My future looks bleak and hopeless. I've been at this state of mind on many occasions and have managed to ride it out in the past, but each time it hits, it feels harder to recover from. 

I have been diagnosed with a personality disorder. My personality ia disordered, my thoughts, my feelings and my behaviours are labelled as disordered. I feel as though I am a waste of a human being, a burden on my family and friends and society as a whole. I haven't contributed to this world we live in and I doubt I ever will. 

I've been trying to stay strong, but I'm running out of strength. Every time this low hits, it knocks me back and eats away at the fight within me. 

I'm scared of dying, terrified if I'm honest. But I'm scared of living too, I'm scared of the world around me, I don't recognise it most of the time and I don't understand it. I don't understand other people and I'm desperately lonely. 

My mind is broken and so am I. I intend to take a long walk tomorrow, I'll call a helpline to see if someone can help me out of this. Otherwise I think I intend to kill myself. I just can't carry on like this. Depression and anxiety are dictating my life and I've fought too long and too hard to try and break the cycle. 

I don't mean to worry anyone, I just needed to get it all off of my chest, I can't help feeling such an impulse to end my life. I hope you understand. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
