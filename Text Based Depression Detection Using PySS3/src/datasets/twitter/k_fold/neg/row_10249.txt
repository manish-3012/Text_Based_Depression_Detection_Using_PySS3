I'm worried that when my kitty passes, I'll give in and go.I've had my cat Sassy for 15 years and since I'm only 18, she's been the most constant thing in my life. I'm aware she won't live forever and I have bad self harm issues and always want to end it but don't cause I know my little girl would look for me at bedtime to cuddle. 

I'm petrified of not being home when she goes and what will happen when she doesn't. She's what's keeping me here and when she's gone there's nothing left to keep me here.
