I am about to be alone, and I can't bear that.20, M, full-time college student during the year and part-time employee during the summer.

Lately I have been working a lot (ie 5-6 days per week) because I want to save money and move out of my parents' place and be on my own.  All my life I have been very independent and I don't like having to rely on others, but I still do have a good relationship with my parents.  When I'm not at work, I'm usually home sleeping.  I have always been a person to keep a small group of really close friends, and an outer circle of friends that I don't particularly trust with my feelings but still associate with on a regular basis.

Within the next week, my best friend, a guy I would take a bullet for and a guy that can finish my sentences, is going to move in with his girlfriend, and then they were planning to move hella far away.  My second closest friend is about to go away for college and I don't know when I'll be able to talk to her again.  (she has a boyfriend, no relationship "woe is me" shit here)

I have not been okay for the past month or so, Reddit.  My parents found a dying kitten in our back yard awhile back and I made a post about it asking for advice.  We were able to take care of him and took him to the vet and he got better, then he suddenly died one night.  I have not been the same since then.  I also tried taking care of a garden in the back yard, and everything I planted died.  Earlier tonight I also accidentally blew up a friendship with someone I had known almost my entire life and now they wont' talk to me.

I feel like I just want to be alone, on an island by myself, so when I die nobody will have to miss me.  Is that bad?
