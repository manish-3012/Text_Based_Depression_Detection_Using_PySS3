I feel really close to the edge again, is it bad or too strange to ask someone in my family to hold me? [23m]I'm really lonely all the time and I don't think I'll ever find romantic love because I don't really love myself but platonic might fill the gap for a little longer. I'm 23, I know I'm not supposed to want that and maybe what I'm asking sounds like cuddling with family but that's not really the goal, it's not sexual at all. I'm too awkward around people but I don't know how to express what I want without everyone thinking I'm a freak or a loser. I mean they're not wrong but I don't even know how to ask. Is it ok? I have a cousin who's really nice to me and she has a younger daughter herself so maybe she'd be ok with it. I should probably just see a doctor but it would be so nice for someone to care for a little while, right? Even if it's family?
