Talk me out of itI see no point in going on. 6 month old step son died. I raised him since before he was born. I was his father... His Mother doesn't love me anymore... told me so on Christmas. His death didn't change her feelings towards me. She drinks a lot now. I moved out without saying goodbye. Just fucking disappeared. I started drinking a lot. My only solace was a subreddit that banned me for trolling a guy who said he wanted to kill several people that made the game I like playing. I pleaded to the mods and they refuse to unban me despite my apologies. It sounds petty, but so is everything else I've done... the subreddit was my last bastion of hope that anything would get better. The only happiness I could still cling to when everything in real life had lost its color. 

Now I have absolutely nothing left.  

Talk me out of it. I see no point anymore. Sorry if this is the wrong sub I just searched for suicide.
