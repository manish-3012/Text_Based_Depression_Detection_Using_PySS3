Given upI'm ready to die now. It won't be this year hopefully. Next year will the year I take my own life. I feel it. I know it deep down. I've started to write and plan for it. 

Not much going on in my life and it's really too difficult for me. I have a few friends who don't want to see me go but, I can't handle the stress of life anymore. 

I'm 32 years old and i'm tired of life. I feel old and worn. I'm one of the fittest people you can ever meet and right now that counts for nothing. 

My mental health has been in decline for the past decade. I'm sure I suffer from bipolar or somewhere on the spectrum.

I'm sorry for the few that I have and will let down eventually. I have a handsome and smart son and even that isn't enough  to keep me in this world.

I hardly get to see him, spend time with him. I'm a horrible father, friend, son, brother, nephew. I'm a human being who has given up on life.

I constantly self mutilate. Constantly searching for answers. I know I have inspired people to do good. I have done good in this life. That's about the only solace I have in this miserable existense.

As my mental health declines so does my circle of friends, family and lovers. I don't need this torment anymore. No one should go through this.
