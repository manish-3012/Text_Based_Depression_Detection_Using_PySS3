Loneliness, Regret, And Self Hate. Or, How I Learned To Start Worrying And Hate Myself.Now I have posted here before, and let me start with no, I will not PM anyone out of a combination of not wanting to waste your time, worrying I will say the wrong thing, and general anxiety. I don't even know where to begin with this hot mess of a life I have. I have had everything handed to me, from allowance for sitting on my ass playing WoW all day, to a roof over my head at all. I dont deserve any of it. I have done nothing to earn anything. I'm just a piece of shit who sits around all day and feels sorry for himself. I think I'm sooo special because I have depression.  No wonder I dont have any friends, no, really, zero, I havent talked to someone outside of my parents for months. I got my dumb ass pulled out of school for "mental health reasons."  I'm just a nobody, an extra in other peoples lives who thinks he's so special. Lets se, I'm also a fat ass and a wannabe actor, yeah, I try to act, its pathetic really. Every one of the productions I have been in I was garbage in, from smiling out of nervousness, to forgetting lines full fucking sale. I'm not good at anything, and believe me I've tried. Fencing, archery, math, english, talking, and the list goes on. Oh yeah, and at one point I thought I was so special that I could get away with being a production manager for one of the shows I was in. Long story short I'm a dumbass, botched it horribly, and destroyed a few friendships in the process. Now here I am, silver spoon in my ass and contemplating scuicide daily. What a piece of selfish shit I am
