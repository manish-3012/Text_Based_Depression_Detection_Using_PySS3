I put a knife to my wrist last nightI know it's not the most effective way to end my life but I just wanted to see if I could actually do it. I guess I'm a coward too because I couldn't even press down, I just sat on the kitchen floor and held it there for a solid 15 minutes. 

I'm not sure why I couldn't do it, I just couldn't. I'm not sure if this counts as depression but I've always felt like I didn't belong in this world. It's not that I want to die, as in I don't want to cease to exist. I still want to exist, but I just want to be on a in a different world. Being in this world feels wrong. I've looked around me, looked at myself and none of it feels right. I want find somewhere I would have an actual purpose and belong. And by purpose, I don't mean some bullshit society forces down your throat. I want somethings that's better than that and I don't feel what I want is achievable in this world. I feel like this world is a prison, if that makes any sense. 

I've considered suicide in the past as a way to escape this world but this is one of the first times I've ever done anything that's close to an attempt. I don't want to tell anyone about this because they wouldn't understand and I don't want them to worry. Besides, I definitely don't want to be committed to a psych-ward. So I'm putting this here, I guess.
