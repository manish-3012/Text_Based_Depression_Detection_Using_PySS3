I just can't live anymoreI am still young, 21M, I am succesful with my music but I got BPD and I can't bear living anymore.. My older friends always say something like "don't be sad, some dudes will never have the same sexual experience you have, don't be sad over someone".. but they don't get it. I've never had problem with women but right now I am completely alone and it's killing me. I am killing my pain with Oxycodone and Codeine. I wish I just fell asleep and overdosed.. I live by myself from 16yo because my parents couldn't take care of me and my whole family hates them for it. I still got 2 cats.. I was okay alone after some time but it has been like half a year. Yes, I got some hookups but I'm not that type of a guy. Few days ago, the girl I had sex with the last time (3 months ago) was here with me for a few hours and I felt nice with her company. It's just.. I think I'll not find anyone. It's killing me. I am listening to JuiceWRLD everyday because the music helps me and he was basically like me. I found a perfume of my ex who mentally abused me for year and a half. I helped her recover and was here at her worst times and it's the other way now.. I am fucked. I don't even think about her anymore, she's a terrible person but she destroyed a part of me.
