No point anymoreJust tired of it all.. i dont see a point in going on anymore, I know the world hates me for being trans, I hate myself for it too. Thought I could seek comfort and make some friends in trans subs, but I managed to get banned for telling people to fuck right off for trying to sexualize me or harass me about my identity in pm's..  Go figure. Icing on the cake is all the TERF subs whose sole purpose is to spread hate speech.. But we're not a protected class, not in the eyes of any government nor reddit's wallet. So feel free to pm and call me whatever you want or sexually harrass me, I'm sure I'll get banned from an unrelated sub that you report me to lol. So Why am I even posting here? I don't know, I'm not seeking help, I don't want it. I just needed to get my thoughts out somewhere where nobody knows who I am.
