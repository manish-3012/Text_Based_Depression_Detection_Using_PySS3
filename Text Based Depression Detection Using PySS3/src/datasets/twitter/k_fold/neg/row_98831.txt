Sister is abusing my niece with her boyfriend, can't 
speak up. I feel like killing myself.Hi everyone. I figured I would come here because I am not getting a lot of support in AskReddit. People don't seem to understand what is on the line and how much I care about my niece. No matter what I do, I feel like I can't save her, at least not without going down myself in the process. I honestly feel like I need to die and right now I don't know if anyone could change my mind. My life is crumbling in front of me...
