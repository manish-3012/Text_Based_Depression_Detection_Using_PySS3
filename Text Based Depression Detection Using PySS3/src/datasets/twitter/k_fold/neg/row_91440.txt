I'm sorry for existingI am a shy, short tempered, sensitive, male, that wants to die already. I can't really make any friends because I'm too shy to, and all my friends don't hang out with me. I'm the last person they would talk to if so and so wasn't here. And the fights with my dad make me think that it's all my fault, I'm useless, my family would do much better without me. I love my family but my dad just makes me mad, he thinks it's okay to angrily yell at us. I usually try to deal with it but sometimes I get really mad and talk/yell back. And that gets him really mad and he starts saying shit that makes me wanna kill myself. I've already started cutting my myself. I thinking to maybe hang myself.
