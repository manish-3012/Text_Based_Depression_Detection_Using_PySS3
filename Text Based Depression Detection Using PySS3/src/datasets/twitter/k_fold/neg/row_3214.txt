My own worst enemy was always myselfI've been told how scary I am when I get angry, and how broken I look when I'm sad. The anger and sadness have both dropped away now, and all that's left is a numbness and a sense of singular purpose to escape.

No one took my first attempt seriously at the age of twelve despite my reason being, "I wanted to die".

I put a gun in my mouth but couldn't pull the trigger at age eighteen. 

I knew something was horribly wrong before I got my autoimmune diagnosis for *three years* before I did anything despite leaking blood on a daily basis, and even that was at someone else's insistence.

I stopped taking the highway to work because the idea of yanking the wheel over and smashing the car was a daily draw. 

Had a complete breakdown at one job, which led to my firing seven months to the day from my return.

Nearly walked out on the subway tracks to put a foot onto the third rail. More than once.

I'm past middle age, lost my job, I've been fighting with insurance companies for a month to try to get the medication that keeps me alive.

I gave up Wednesday. I'm done.

I've fought long and hard, and I simply don't have it in me any more.
