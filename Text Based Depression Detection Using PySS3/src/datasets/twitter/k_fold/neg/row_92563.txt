Giving upThis is my first post here. I have read many posts and conversations in the past and am reaching out as a last ditch effort to save my own life. 

Backstory. Iâ€™m a gay male, 30 years old, and have been â€œoutâ€ for about 2 1/2 years. 

I met a man who changed my life a few years ago. He brought a ton of joy to my life but crushed me over and over again with bullshit reasons to leave, and then beg for me back. It was the first time in my life I ever was happy and content with my sexuality. 

After 4 breakups (same man), being fucked over financially by said person, being crushed repeatedly by broken promises (I will pay you back, I want to marry you, Iâ€™ll never leave again), Iâ€™m 7 months post-breakup, one month zero contact, and feeling like I want to die. I absolutely hate existing and I donâ€™t care to even get out of bed anymore. I hate the area I live in...I have a ton of friends and a wonderful, supportive family, but I hate my life. 

I lost 55 pounds the first time he left, in two short months I went from a little overweight to skin and bones. Didnâ€™t sleep for weeks on end. Cried every day. 

Iâ€™ve tried 8 different mental health medications, all of which my body rejected and made me feel insane. Iâ€™ve seen 8 different therapists, a psychiatrist several times, a general doctor too many times to count. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel that this person has destroyed me. Iâ€™ve been actively dating the past month and have tried also when we have been apart (longest time being 4 months besides the most recent and final one). 

I have blocked his number, completely deleted all of my social media accounts. I just feel awful. 

When will this stop? Is suicide the only way out? Iâ€™m out of options. Itâ€™s sad really..Iâ€™m a handsome guy, Iâ€™m educated, I have a good job, I own a home and have wonderful friends and family. 

I find myself researching suicide constantly and every time I drive I think about how â€œeasyâ€ it could be to have an accident. I donâ€™t have any ambition to live, work, eat, sleep, or be productive anymore and I envy people who have these tragedies end their lives abruptly. 

I guess this is a cry for help. Or maybe a place to vent. I hate my life, and I know it sounds selfish to take it, but I feel itâ€™s somewhat selfish for my loved ones to make me feel guilty about not wanting to exist anymore. 

Any insight? I tried to keep it brief. Also, this was my first true love. :/
