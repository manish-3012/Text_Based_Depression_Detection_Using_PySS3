I live with my ex and im about to end it [nsfw]I love her immensivly, we were together for a year. After we broke up she made out with two guys one which wad my worst enemy. She told me because she said she wanted to make me not want her. (We broke up together). She always asks me to move out, i want to. Its really hard because rent is super expensive i dont want to bother my mates. I have friends. I have looks. I have a muscular body. But i still want her and only her. I hate that i want her, even though she tries to hurt me.

I finger her at nights because she loves it and hs no control over it, i have sex with her then. After i feel empty and want to kms.

Today i got home from work. I layed in bed to sleep. She said she was cold and joined me and started groping her cold hands all over my body, especially my abs. I loved the attention. I then put my hands above her panties and rubbed her pussy for a bit. She then said "you dont want to have sex with me." "Ive fucked another dude last night". It hurt so bad i was already suicidal i feel heartbroke and empty. I fucked one girl after the breakup. It was good sex but i hated it either way. She keeps trying to hurt me but i love her. When we were together she was slutty and kept grinding on other people. She also hit me. A lot of times.  I never hit back. She keeps calling me a psychopath and i dont know if i am one. I havent felt remorse since 3rd grade. She says im manipulative and lying. I lie alot, i can agree with that. The manipulation has to be a sub concious act because i dont mean to. Im so close to OD-ing on pain killers and alcohol. I tried stabbing my heart, it didnt work. I just want a non violent way of killing myself without pain.
