Ever just been tired of life in general?Sometimes I just sit back and get deep in my head about things and the end result since I was 9 has always been "Fuck all of this." I have a rant that I keep deleting because in the end people will speculate it and put their own twists on it whatever whatever. All I know is I'm just tired. People constantly ask why I'm so calm and how I live so peacefully in what they call a shitty area in a shitty house and they think I'm joking when I say "Because you can't survive a fall from the building that will send you to true peace and my building is right down the street." 

It's so weird that I find peace in life knowing if shit gets bad and I mean any worse than what I'm feeling right now ever again, then I'm literally going to take my 'stairway to heaven'. Sometimes I stand at the top of that building just happy. It's so quiet up there. The only thing I can hear is the wind blowing here and there. I've looked over the edge and just thought. "I bet it won't even hurt." 

I'm too scared to shoot myself since I'm afraid of surviving because of twitching. I'm afraid to just shoot up a bunch of heroin because I have a weird thought that I'll just die in a very slow but unconscious way and I can't bring myself to cut wrists because that's definitely a slow way out. Nobody hits the concrete from how high I've looked over and survived.
