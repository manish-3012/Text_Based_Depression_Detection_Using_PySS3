My story   So I have no one in my life close enough to me to vent to so strangers of the internet allow me to vent to you.I feel like my life is falling apart I have no one that cares about me I'm currently in the 9th grade yea a fucking freshman in high school and I'm on a suicide sub Reddit anyway I'm failing 2 classes I have no friends witch is why I'm here venting I'm a cutter and the reason I do it is because I feel broken or like I'm about to have a full mental break down and when I cut I feel better about myself and like I'm not split between wanting to give life a chance and wanting to end it all and I've been having this fucked mental state since 7th grade and I fucked up once and someone saw my scars in 8th and I got sent to therapy and after a while my dad just stoped bringing me to sessions and at the time he was forcing me to go to church and I was openly rebeling against that so I don't know if he thought that me seeing a theripest allowed my hate of his religion to be seen as a good thing by me but I'm not sure but I haven't seen one since but I never stopped cutting and this weekend I had a mental break down and tried to kill myself the cuts are still fresh from a day or two ago and I know that when I have gym on 1st period on Monday someone will see and I know that if that happens odds are I'm getting locked up in a mental facility and I don't know what to do and I know most of the story's here are a lot worse and I'm sorry for wasting your time but yea I guess that my life for you I'm sorry for being such a waste to society
