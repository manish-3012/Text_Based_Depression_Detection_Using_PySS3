Every Last DropToday is my birthday. An old coworker sent me Happy Birthday Dethday. The irony is palpable. He was one of the eight people who took the time to click the popup and say something on Facebook. It doesnt really matter. I know Im wildly unpopular. 

And it doesnt surprise me that not one person asked me what I was doing, or invited me out.
And truly, that is for the best. I have spent almost a decade completely alone. Almost the entirety of my adult life.

It does hurt that my best friend didnt even bother wishing me a happy birthday. My other friend sent me a happy birthday. The rest of my friends dont exist. So I guess Im batting .500. Those are hall of fame baseball numbers.

But this isnt baseball. This is life. And I have failed in every way imaginable. I wasnt exactly dealt a great hand, but I have self destructed at every pinnacle moment of my life. When things are good, I implode. When things are exceptionally bad, Im at my best. Im just wired wrong.

Ive always pondered the root of my suicidal desire. The truth is, from the day I realized it was an option, I knew it was my destiny. Im 28 now. That means Ive spent about 20 years wanting to die, minus 3 years in the middle. Well, almost 3.

My family has hated me for most of that time. The last few years, my mom has been high as a kite and 3,000 miles away, so she likes me more now. My dad isnt my biological dad, but for the last 5 or 6 years, he has been very good to me. My brother hates me. 

I was raped by multiple highschool students repeatedly between ages 5 and 10. This is sadly uncommon on this thread. I think it somehow desensitizes us when we realize how common child rape is. Especially when it comes to men. Men are viewed exclusively as purpetrators and male victims are terrified of being exposed. I didnt tell anyone until I was 16. Of the handful of people who know, all but two immediately cut ties with me. The other two are my only friends. But they both became very distant. Thats not entirely true actually. There was also my ex fiance who stayed for more than two years, only to leave me after my first suicide attempt. 

I can not stress enough the devestation caused by sexual crimes against children. I am sexually ruined. I am emotionally incapable. And I am a completely socially clueless man. My parents never knew until the last year. I finally lost the ability to hide my emotions. Two decades of waiting to die and more recently, secretly overdosing by just enough to make it interesting, finally caught up to me. 

I began drinking a 5th of Jack every single night after work. Nichole, my best friend, called me as I was unpacking my shotgun. She was concerned by the tone of my texts earlier. She saved my life that night. But I told her everything. Things Ive never told anyone. I think. I was very drunk. She called my brother and got him to my house. Everyone in the family found out that night. My shame has never been greater.

Tonight is 5 months since that day. Almost exactly. I binged for a couple more days, and havent had a drop since September 30th. Nichole thought it would help me. Truth is, I did too. But I didnt want help. I still dont. I did it for her. I love her, I guess. As much as someone like me can love anyone. 

It hasnt helped at all. Just the opposite, in fact. Im no longer numb. I feel everything again. And it is agony. But I can hide it again. So everyone thinks Im doing better. That is good enough for them. Reality is just perception. 

Today I felt the last shred of hope leave in the form of a delusional day dream. On my way home from work, I thought maybe Nichole had set up a surprise party for me and that was why she didn't say anything about my birthday. The thought made me tear up with joy. And even though I doubted it, I felt something like hope.

When I got home, of course it wasnt the case. Ive only ever had one party, so it wasnt really a surprise. I sat in the car and just laughed. How could I be so stupid? I dont even have friends. Why would anyone care enough to throw a surprise party, and why would anyone else show up? 

I spent the night cleaning and getting the house prepped. Its being forclosed on anyway, but I dont want to leave my mess for someone else. I havent had a houseguest in years, minus a few suicide watch nights, so its in pretty poor shape. A couple more evenings and its ready. I dont know if I will be.

Full disclosure, I am a thinker. I have nothing else to do. My IQ has been measured as low as 141, and as high as 163. And literally nowhere in between because my parents couldnt afford more than two tests. I scored in the 99th percentile of the Mensa exam. Well, the practice one. I dont have any interest in paying 40 bucks to have someone confirm that Im smart. That just doesnt seem very... Smart.

I have examined every reason to stay alive. There is no logical reason. The only argument left is the baseless accusations of selfishness. If I leave, I will hurt those who care about me. This is true. Fortunately not many people do care about me. But by continuing to hurt myself by living for them, does that not make them selfish in an even worse way? Why should I live every day as such endless sorrow so that others may not feel pain at my loss. I will die eventually. What makes it wrong for me to expedite the process?
