Not sure how much longer...I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going. This year has been hell for me. Now I don't even want to eat anymore. I wish I could stop existing or have a freak accident kill me so that I don't have to take my own life.

I'm getting closer to suicide every week, I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel... I've been doing my best to make it through, but there's not even a pinhole of light that I can see.

I feel as though I am dragging myself along gravel just to exist, being told by multiple people that they cannot help me.

I want it to be over. Once and for all.
