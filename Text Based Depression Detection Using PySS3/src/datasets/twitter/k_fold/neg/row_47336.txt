I stopped believing life is worth living...considering suicideI grew up poor, and was homeless a few times as a child but i had a lot of siblings and i think always spending time with them helped. Then when i was 13 i was placed in foster care and bounced around to over 13 foster homes. It was a tough time but i worked hard and went to college. After college i met a girl and we were together for 4 years....i went a way to go to film school and we were long distance. I found out she cheated on me and left me. I blamed myself and went through a very dark period of suicidal thoughts and plans, a few weeks in a psych ward. I guess after that anyone i knew even family just didn't want to hear about it anymore. I tried to dive into art and music but somewhere along the way I just lost hope or belief anything is going to ever get better. I realized that my lack of trust comes from my mom abandoning me, the different homes abandoning me and then my gf cheating on me and leaving me. I stopped trusting people and thinking anything good can happen. I have tried to get close to people but its just to painful. I am afraid to talk to anyone out of fear of them locking me up and drugging me ......i used to believe good things could happen in my life but that hope is gone....i am so alone and have come to a belife that suicide will at least end the pain i can't seem to shake. i've tried everthing else.
