6 months post divorce.She's taken my job - We work at the same place and she got a restraining order that I'm about to lose the appeal for. (No, I never put my hands on her, I never touched her, I called her 17 times in a manner of 30 days. I emailed her several times while working through things asking her to give one chance at reconciliation, but she refuses.

She's taken my smile. I loved being a husband. She told her friends I was  strictly financial decision, that I'm insane and that I have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder)

&amp;#x200B;

She's taken my faith...I feel like I have nothing left to live for.  I'm now stuck in a dead end job, with no prospects and a pigeon-holed degree.

I truly have nothing left to live for.
