Having undeveloped social skills makes you unable to function it this world. It's a death sentance to your well being as a human.My parent neglected me. Pure and simple. I was raised by TV and video games and was always shunned away from talking and socializing. I couldn't approach my mom without getting screamed at, and I eventually stopped trying and became a loner child. During recess in school I would walk and do laps around the playground. No one would play with me.  Add to that having some kind of undiagnosed learning disorder or something that makes me very slow to communicate, and now my life is completely fucked forever. I cannot speak with other people without making an ass of myself.

I feel like I've been bullied around by life ever since I was born. I want to end things on my own terms, I want to kill myself as a way of saying fuck you to life itself for trapping me in this hole. There is no way out of this, I'm going to 100% die alone one day, so why not finish the job on my own terms instead of waiting for life to bully me around some more and give me cancer or something?
