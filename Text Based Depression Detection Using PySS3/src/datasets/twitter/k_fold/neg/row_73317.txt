Wish I could go back and redo my whole lifeI feel like Iâ€™ve fucked up everything in my life. I used to have a lot of friends but donâ€™t have any close friends now. I have a lying problem and have fucked over the best relationship of my life for no goddamn reason and I hate myself for it. Covid has killed all of my motivation and self image and social life that I donâ€™t feel like I know who I am or what I am capable of doing. I have lost a lot- if not all hope for the future of this world that my dream of having children is shot so I feel like I donâ€™t have a future to look forward to. It all feels so long gone and if I could go back and do everything over again I would. Iâ€™ve been so immature and lost for so long I feel like I wasted so much time and potential for myself.
