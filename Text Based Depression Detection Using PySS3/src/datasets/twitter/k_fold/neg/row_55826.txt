Medical mystery; want to hang myselfI've been seeing doctors for months.

So much shit makes me sick. My brain fog is so dense that I can't drive or see friends, or do anything.

I'm always so tired, I'm always fatigued.

There's no point in going on with life if you can't even get involved.

Doctors have all been useless. All labs done haven't shown anything. I'm 100% healthy blood wise, but I'm still so weak and tired.

I'm slowly getting weaker and more tired.

At least I'm too tired to drive out somewhere and kill myself.
