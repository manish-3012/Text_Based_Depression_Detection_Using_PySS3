I think I just can't do itI have nothing. I spend my days at home after work. I don't go out. I've had a week long vacation this past week. I've been drunk half of it. I have no friends. I mean it. The only people to contact me this past week have been my siblings. About a birthday.

So I'm alone. I wonder if it would be different if I was beautiful. Because I used to think that I'm not a shitty person. Well, whatever I let people see about me. It's not like I've stood up if I thought something someone said was wrong.

I've been thinking about the pills I used to steal from my parent's medicine cabinet when I was 14-15. Codeine. I could probably get something with it if I went to doc, claiming it on period pain or whatever. That'd be the end of me I think.

I can read all of those positive posts about how it will get better, how I need to rely on other people, how it is an illness, how I'm not alone. They're all lovely and I do hope that people find comfort in them, but when I read them I just feel like it's all bullshit and what I am is something that nobody cares about.

How the fuck is it gonna get better
