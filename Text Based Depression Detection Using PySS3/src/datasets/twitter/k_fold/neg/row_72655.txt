I dont know why, but today is just not working for me...I dont know what triggered this, but I was just sitting at my desk, the bottom of my stomach fell out and I just don't want to be anywhere anymore. I can't get out of my head and I don't know what's going on.

I want to leave work and drive off a cliff.
