Help me out.Hi guys. Lately I have been feeling suicidal again, I don't know what's fucked up in my brain. I am now 21, but have had depression with manic episodes since I was about 12. I have battled two turns of anorexia. My family really resents me for this as they like to put up this happy front, and especially my mother liked to abuse me for this growing up. I am suspecting she is borderline psychotic, as she gets paranoid and manipulative at times, and falsely caring the next. It was not easy growing up hearing about how horrible and fat I was. I loved my father, but he passed away from cancer when I was 18.

I do have some other relatives, but they mainly help out my two sisters, as I am kinda hard to relate to with my depressions and negative view on life. I have been in many different therapies and on different meds turning me into a zombie.

Lately I am just feeling like there is nothing for me, I am worthless and I just feel I see things more clear than others do, nothing is rosy and pink in my world. My reality is ugly and grey, and others don't see it because they are fooling themselves. 

I do have an urgent appointment with a new team of psychiatrists, but I really feel I can't go back on the meds, they are taking away my creativity and if there is an error in my brain I just don't want to live the rest of my life reliant on pills. 

Reddit, this is my last chance. I am reaching out for help when there is still a part of me that wants it. I am not sure how much longer that little part still will be speaking. I really feel there might not be much for me here.
