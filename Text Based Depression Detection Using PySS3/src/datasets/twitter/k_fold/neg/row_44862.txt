Thanks.You may or may not have seen my other posts. Since writing, my mood has lifted slightly because of you guys. Some of you commented and DM'd me giving me the best advice noone I'm close to or related to would care to give.

To think there's strangers out there on the internet who actually care about you is amazing. And to give helpful advice that actually has value and means something is beyond benevolent.

But my journey has just started, and I'm still learning to love and trust again, but most importantly, I'm still yet to pull myself out of this dark hole.

And big shouts to gurdy_fox, Solus2, Tezzaforra, and Hyperscrub. The world needs more beautiful people like you.

Love you all, peace.
