I'm at the point where I won't be alive this time next weekI just need the smallest thing to change inbetween now and then but that seems absolutely ridiculous to ask at this point. It just won't happen, I won't be alive anymore and I'm slowly coming to peace with that. Sometime before next thursday, I'll be gone and I'll be at peace
