Everyone's forgiven my sexual abuser and moved on. I have no future. I'm 18f, stupid as fuck, no social skills, no one will love me. No one is gonna see this. Yes I'm seeking attention. Yes I have absolutely no where to go. I've fallen as low as I can be.I don't even know where to start. I live with my emotionally abusive grandparents and my equally abusive mom who is sometimes the best person ever and then the total opposite. I'm pretty sure if my mom wasn't stuck with having a useless cunt like me as her daughter, she wouldn't have loved me or view me as worthy of being loved, of being ANYTHING. I'm trying to buy a helium tank online and try to suffocate myself with it. Its a peaceful death with dignity.

My little cousins came over to visit. As soon as the family was about to leave, ***my aunt told my 4 year old cousin, "Go on sweetie. Give your grandpa a hug."***

*My grandpa would say that same thing to me. He'd tell me to give him a hug everytime I came home from school so he could squeeze me and feel my breasts pressed against his chest. I'm suffocating. I'm shaking. I can't do this shit no more.*  

***She knew that piece of shit abused me. Yet she innocently told her 4 year old daughter to hug him. Luckily the little girl didn't feel comfortable and shook her head. I was shocked. I felt betrayed. Like my pain wasn't real. Like it wasn't a big deal. lol i SHOULD JUST MOVE THE FUCK ON AND FORGET ABOUT IT RIGHT?*** 

 **i complained to my mom about how fucked up that is. And she agreed and then replied, "Look how easily they move on from** ***it*****. We should follow them."**

Yeah. I should just forget about it and move on. Me and my mom had a whole arguement about this. I shouldn't be projecting my negative feelings onto her. But I just couldn't fucking stand. Something about this just FUCKED ME UP.

My aunt and uncle knew this piece of shit molested me. Sexually abused me. I was SEXUALLY ABUSE AT TEN. I WAS TEN FUCKING YEARS OLD. I WAS A BABY.  A FUCKING BABY. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. I WAS INNOCENT. CAN'T THEY HEAR THAT? I WAS A FUCKING CHILD.

To start as a child I was dumb and naive. Maybe thats why my grandfather molested me. After my dad left me, my mom and i had to live with my grandparents. Everything me and my mom did was wrong in my grandma's eyes. Nothing was ever good enough. 

My grandpa never had to tell me to stay quiet. He just knew I wouldn't speak a word. Not saying its my fault--I was 10 years old. I just wish I wasN'T SO FUCKING NAIVE. WHY COULDN'T I BE A SNAKE LIKE MOST KIDS MY AGE AT THE TIME? Why did I have to be so nice? Why couldn't I stand up for myself?

I told my ma what happened to me when I was in the 7th grade. She cried and then tried to move back to my dad. he left again. And so here I am again. 

I'm not smart. I'm 18 yrs old and it looks like I won't be getting any scholarships and getting the fuck out of this painfest. I'm dumb as fuck. I barely have any brains or social skills. No braveness. Nothing. I'm nothing.

Everyone knows what my grandpa did to me. My granny stopped sleeping in my grandpa's bed. My mom doesn't like it either but she puts up with it cause we got NO WHERE ELSE TO GO.

THE LEAST I COULD'VE BEEN WAS SMART. SO I COULD'VE GONE TO A COLLEGE OUT OF STATE AND OUT OF HERE. BUT NO.  Something happened that just set me off.
