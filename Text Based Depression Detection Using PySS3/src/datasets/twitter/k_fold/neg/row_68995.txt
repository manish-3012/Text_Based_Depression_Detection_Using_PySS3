I don't want to kill myself but I want to kill myself.Hey,

So recently I started getting treatment for depression, Citalopram.

I'm already feeling better, but I keep saying "I hate myself" and "I want to kill myself" all the time.

Mostly because I do. I have no real friends and am failing at everything. Just sitting at home playing video games, if I have enough energy for it.

I want to get better... But at the same time I really want to end it all. It seems so utterly pointless.
