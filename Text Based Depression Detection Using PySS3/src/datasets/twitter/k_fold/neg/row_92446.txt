What do I have left to live for?My father died last year and my girlfriend (27F) was there for me (28M) through this terrible time wherein everything started going to shit. Now two months ago she broke up with me. After 6 years being together. Her. I don't understand why life is so cruel. I was going to marrry this girl. She's the love of my life. Now she's gone as well. I am just on auto-pilot now. But I don't have any intrinsic motivation anymore. Now I hate her and love her. Hate her for just giving up on us. I lost everything. What do I have left?
