Shouldâ€™ve done it earlierNo ones ever actually cared about me. My parents just use me as a pawn to make each other feel bad, and my â€œfriendsâ€ donâ€™t care I exist. The world wouldnâ€™t change a bit if I was gone. Iâ€™d finally stop being in pain. So why shouldnâ€™t I? I managed to not cut for 2 months but I started again today. Iâ€™m just a waste of space.

I wish I wouldâ€™ve killed myself earlier
