Having suicidal thoughts and urges but my dad won't let me see a psychiatristI'm 16 and ive been depressed for a long time. I'm always bored all the time because nothing interests me anymore. A few months ago I was diagnosed with brain cancer. This only made the suicidal thoughts stronger. I begged my dad for me to see a psychiatrist but he just called me an idiot an got mad at me. I'm afraid one of these days I'm actually going to do it. I don't know what to do
