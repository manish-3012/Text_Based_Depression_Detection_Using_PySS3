PurgatoryI can't go on living, all I see ahead of me is a hollow future, full of "okay"'s and "fine"'s but nothing fulfilling, nothing happy. I'm alone, I come from a broken home with no examples of a proper relationship, and have just realized the one person I wanted as a partner only sees me as a close friend. No one has made me feel the way she has, and likely never will. I can't kill myself because that only spreads my suffering, someone help me, I feel trapped in life.
