friday. pay day. driving away and then end game. i can't do it anymore.i'm so sad. i'm so stuck. i'm in so much debt. my family has rejected me. on friday i get paid. i am going to pack everything i own into boxes and leave my apartment in my car. i don't know where i am going. i am either going to spend all my money on gas, or save a portion of it for a large dose of something that will put me out of my misery. either way, friday is the end game, as far as i can see it. i'm done. i'm out. i will either let myself lose my mind and just die that way, somewhere far away, or i will make it happen for myself. that's it.

nobody ever understands this, change is only in someone's control to an extent. i've done everything i can. the system has failed me. my family has failed me. i've been denied unemployment (for not making enough money while i was employed), wellfare, food stamps, even temporary disability for having fucking spine surgery. and the spine surgery, all it did has been reversed, because i've been so busy trying to fend for myself. i am about to be homeless and alone and injured, no matter what i do. it's not just emotional and mental pain, it's physical pain. it's so many things. and i'm fucking done.

all thats keeping me going is waiting for that paycheck.

edit: wow ive never had a post be trolled so hard. thanks for all the encouragement guys.
