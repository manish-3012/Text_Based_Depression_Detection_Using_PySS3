It has occured to meHey, I've been thinking about it lately. Dying. I could never actually do it, but right now would seem like the best time. I'm scared of what comes next in life, College sucks, I'm depressed, and my friends are all gone. I'm just in a stagnant piss puddle that just keeps bubbling and never spilling over.

 I can cope but I don't know how much longer. Each day I drive to work or home, I just hope someone will crash into me. I just want something different, like a midlife crisis or a traumatic event to push me to do something.

 I constantly have thoughts about the easiest way to go. I don't want it to be my fault but if it is, I would take pills. I don't want pain. I guess I'm just really miserable right now.
