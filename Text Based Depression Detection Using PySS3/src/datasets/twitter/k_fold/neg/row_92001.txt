Tonight Iâ€™ll die.â€œTonight Iâ€™ll die.

I look at my dad deeper in his eyes. 

I kiss my mother louder on her cheeks.

I hug my brother tighter around his hips.

I text my friends longer on the phone.

I see the night sky brighter. 

Tonight, Iâ€™ll die.â€

That was what I posted on my Facebook, right after Iâ€™d reached home from an extra class at 8 p.m. Iâ€™d had bad days. The only one who messaged me was a friend I barely saw in a week, when we came across each other at the hallway and Iâ€™d give her a hug.
