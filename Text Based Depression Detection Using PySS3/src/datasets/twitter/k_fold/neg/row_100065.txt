Everything that could go wrong, is. And I just canâ€™t anymore.Everything is falling apart and I canâ€™t maintain. My wife would say Iâ€™ve never been able to maintain. That Iâ€™ve never been able to support or empathize with her. I suppose sheâ€™s right. We fight all the time. I go from self loathing to mood swings and yelling matches. Last week I swore up and down Iâ€™d be there for her and today I had one little fuck up and she lays into me, how nothing fucking matters, how Iâ€™ll never be able to support her. That Iâ€™ll never be able to handle her and her family. Itâ€™s true to some extent, I had it pretty good as a kid, she didnâ€™t. Sheâ€™s right, I donâ€™t or canâ€™t grasp what sheâ€™s been through because I never had it. We both have anxiety and depression. She thinks when i am honest about my suicidal thoughts that I use it as a tactic to manipulate her into caring for me. 

I canâ€™t tell her about the times Iâ€™ve thought about the taste of gunmetal, what that would feel like to know thatâ€™s the last taste Iâ€™ll ever taste. Or the walks up to the train tracks late at night, considering whether or not I should just step in front of a train. I canâ€™t tell her Iâ€™ve been scouting out high beams around the house that would support my fat ass when I decide to throw an extension cord noose around one of them. The garage wonâ€™t work, that shits to poorly made to support me. I canâ€™t tell her how many times Iâ€™ve considered ending it all. 

I canâ€™t tell her that I constantly am sick of my inability to be empathetic and emotionally supportive for her. That Iâ€™m so ashamed of the fact that I have expected nothing of her and all she thinks is that I expect her to fix everything. 6 months ago I found out I was the reason we couldnâ€™t start a family, our dream of have a big family dashed in a matter of minutes, followed by a huge fucking medical bill I canâ€™t afford to pay off because Iâ€™m the only one working. In her defense,sheâ€™s been trying to find work, just nothing pans out.  Sheâ€™s going to leave me, and I canâ€™t fucking blame her. Who would want to be with a pathetic piece of shit husband like me. I donâ€™t even want to be here any more.  My depression and mood swings got the better of me and now I fear I may have jeopardized the one income this household has.  My job is on the rocks, along with my marriage, the bills are crashing down around me, 

I just think, fuck, I canâ€™t maintain so if I were gone, sheâ€™d only have to worry about herself. She wouldnâ€™t have me fucking up her life anymore than I already have.  Tonight, she was drinking again, so naturally we weâ€™re fighting.  She knows exactly where to put the knife and twist when we fight.  

Iâ€™m trying to hold it together. for her, but then I canâ€™t maintain for myself. 

Fuck it.
