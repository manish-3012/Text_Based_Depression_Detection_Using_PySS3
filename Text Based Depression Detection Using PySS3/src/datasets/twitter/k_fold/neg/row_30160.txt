RantI'm really fucking sick and tired of living. I feel like shit everyday, and my dad is taking away my internet access more and more often for stupid "reasons". I know it's just the internet, but that's what's been preventing me from killing myself already. My family doesn't understand the extent to which I suffer. My dad's always giving me shit for not having a job, and he's always asking me what I want to do with my life. I say I don't know yet, but I really plan to kill myself. I can't tell him that obviously because then he'll just send me to a mental hospital, where they'll just load me up on meds without solving the root of the problem (and take away my internet access; my only escape from this hell). 

I don't want to have to kill myself. I want to have a good life, but that's not going to happen. I have no friends, and since I'm a depressed socially anxious NEET, that's not going to change any time soon. I hate myself and my life, and I wish I was never born at all. I hate my parents and my brother for being so fucking insensitive and selfish. Is it really hard to see I'm in so much pain? My dad keeps threatening to send me into government housing, and if he does, I swear that's the last fucking straw, I'll kill myself right before I'm sent there.
