My bf wants to off himself on FebI don't know what to do

I'm meeting him for the first time (we are in an LDR) late January...  

He's been having it rough for a while.

I don't want to lose him.

I want to have faith that he will be okay after finally being with an actual good therapist and psychiatrist. After we stay together for 2 weeks.

I feel like I will have a breakdown because of this when I go over there

I'm so afraid. I want to help him. I love him so much.
