Why prolong a life that I know will serve no purpose?I wake up everyday and remember that this life of mine has no purpose. Am I supposed to live the rest of my life like this? I can't see myself waking up to this pathetic life of mine any longer. I have no goals, no dreams, no friends, and a traumatic childhood. I'm a useless fuck up that feels as if I'm living in a void of darkness. Ending it all feels like the only way to break the chains attaching me to this pathetic life. Ending it all would free me.
