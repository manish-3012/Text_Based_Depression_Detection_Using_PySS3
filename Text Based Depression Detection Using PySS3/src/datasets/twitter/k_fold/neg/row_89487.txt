Nearly 30 and still crying over my ex, this isn't worth it anymore.I feel like a fucking immature baby. I'm still broken over my ex and we broke up a year ago. The thought of him being with any one else makes me want to fucking die. It's not just him, it's everything. My job sucks, I can't afford to move out. I have debt, I still live with my mom at almost 30. 

All of my friends, ALL of them are in committed long term relationships, can afford to live away from home. I haven't been happy my entire life. I finally had a good relationship and life ruined that too. Perfect for each other, but we can't be together. And now I have to move on, but I will never be happy.

I see it now. I will never be happy. People have been saying it gets better for years, and it hasn't. I'm barely farther ahead in life than when I graduated highschool. I just wish I were fucking dead and it's getting harder and harder to find reasons to stay alive.

I don't think I can handle this anymore.
