Hey, i thought i wouldn't be here againSo, my girlfriend of three years broke up with me new years. I found a lovebite on her neck from someone she'd previously fucked whilst we were together. I cheated on her 3 times, and in these past few months i've been feeling better. My cheating came from insecurity, i think. I just don't know what to do. I'm bipolar, and can't help but read into everything, she's out with a guy i think she fancies tonight and i've been drinking to help it (i know, its not helpful) but i just don't know what the fuck to do. I know the relationship wasn't great but that doesn't help.
