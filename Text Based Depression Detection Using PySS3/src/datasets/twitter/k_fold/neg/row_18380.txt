ExhaustedK i am done. I try and try but the pain and anger always comes back. Life will never stop fucking me in the ass. I am trash, no one will love me besided my mom and even then, I'm tge highest stress factor for her. She'd be better off without me and my mental anf physical illnesses. I'm under heavy medication and it was working so far until some stuff happened. I can't keep living like this. II've been labelled as grossly ugly in the past, undesirable, dramatic, a plague. It's not my goddamn fault that I have BPD and depression.  Now I am labelled as easy, undesirable though not ugly anymore, I'm still worth trash because making out with two guys who feigned affection towards me makes me a whore that needs to control herself. I made a new friend a short time ago and she tried including me in her circle of friends but no, i can't function in society.

I hate myself more than anything else in the world, I've tried to commit suicide many times but failed. This time Ive decided to do it while my mom is at work. I'm sorry I can't fit in anywhere. At this point i don't even care at the fact that ive never been able to have a boyfriend (im 25) men will never take me seriously because they can sense it. They can sense that I'm worthless. I give up. There's nothing ahead of me in any sense of the word. I have an ovarian cyst that will probably be cancerous. I havr a bachelors degree in something I hate and just being awake makes me sick. There's no enough room for my whole life story but all I wish is that I don't survive this fall. Please, i need to rest
