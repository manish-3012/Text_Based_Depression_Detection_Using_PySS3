got dumped, canâ€™t see a future past this.thinking about him moving on. thinking about how other people are loved and i donâ€™t think anybodyâ€™s really loved me like that or ever will. iâ€™m broke. winter makes me feel so trapped. thinking about all the emotional problems i have to work through in order to be okay is so daunting. abandonment issues. adoption. have an unfulfilling job. trauma. have nothing to look forward to, not a thing. what do i live for? i canâ€™t hurt my parents. but this is too much for me. my body and heart canâ€™t handle this. i need company. i need community. i need something to care about. god iâ€™ve never hurt so bad in my life. 

i thought i knew what it was like to be as low as i could possibly be, but i had no idea. i donâ€™t see how iâ€™m going to make it past this, and i wish it was easier to just go. be done. i want to leave this world so painfully bad right now. 

itâ€™s unfair that we donâ€™t have a simple self-destruct button for when weâ€™ve had enough. what is the point of this suffering. i feel that whatever good could possibly return to my life, will never be enough to be worth this suffering. god it hurts so bad, please tell me this will end. i just want him.
