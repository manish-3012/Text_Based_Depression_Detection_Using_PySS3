Help.Iâ€™m sitting here at 28. A divorce I went through due to my own mental illness. A failure by most regards. I have lost all hope. I had to move in with family who chastise me when I try to contribute. They take away freedoms and then blame me for having failures. Every time I try to do better I am reminded of my failures. I donâ€™t have allies. I try to help others but emotionally Iâ€™m broken. Iâ€™m sitting here razor in hand trying my hardest to resist cutting again. I thought I had beaten this but today I want to die. I do t see any purpose or hope. I donâ€™t know how to put my life back together. I canâ€™t get into counseling. Iâ€™m trying to workout more and eat healthier. I just am out of strength. I waste days doing nothing. Iâ€™m sick of this Iâ€™m sick of having to fight hard every day. Iâ€™m sick of the monster Iâ€™ve become and have been. I donâ€™t know how to move on. I donâ€™t know how to move forward. All I see is death.
