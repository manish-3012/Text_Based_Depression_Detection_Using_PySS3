Some of my dumb reasons to liveI donâ€™t know if any of you are Game of Thrones fans, but Iâ€™m sure even those who arenâ€™t know that tonight was the series finale. I just watched it (I wonâ€™t spoil anything, donâ€™t worry) and it brought to mind some of the dumb reasons I give myself to live when Iâ€™m having a moment of depression and suicidal thoughts.

One of those dumb reasons was â€œI canâ€™t kill my self yet, I need to know how GoT endsâ€. Or â€œI need to know how Avengers endsâ€. My last attempt was in 2016 and when I failed I said â€œI need to live so I can see who wins the electionâ€.

Stupid shit like that...but then once I do see how this or that story ends, or the result of something ...then I just think of how it was only those dumb little things that gave me something to look forward to. Something to wait for before I go.
