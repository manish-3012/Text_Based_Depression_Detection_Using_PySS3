I am 13 years old and i really want to end my life.First off, i know you are going to be thinking why i made an account and why i am on reddit. I have been on reddit for quite a while now, infact is has almost been four months since i joined this website.
Now let me get back to the story, I really want to end my life but im afraid. 

See my family have a thing for emotionaly abusing me, if i do something wrong its always the same old ''What's wrong with you?" '' and ''Can't you do thing properly?". Of course you all be thinking this is a stupid reason for me to end my life but there is more. Since i was 12 i have gained weight and my family have started to realise. They slyly say remarks about my body, calling me fat and chubby. My grandad just straight up says to my face '' you are getting fat'' and ''you are pathetic'', sometimes i just silently cry in my bedroom and try to think about the good things in life.  

I know this might be a dumb  reason and that i have so much to live for but i can't be happy living with my family.

 Im sorry if there are any grammar mistakes.
