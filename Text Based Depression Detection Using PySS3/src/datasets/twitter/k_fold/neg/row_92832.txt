SchizophreniaMy sister has schizophrenia. She changes her meds for around half a year now, but they barely help. She still fully believes in her delusions and has absolutely zero intentions of accepting any other point of view.

I'm completely out of strength. At start I was being really supportive and I was trying to help in any possible way. But I slowly start to hate her, even though it's irrational. I know she's sick, but I feel like nothing really works and I'm currently beyond frustrated. I don't really want to see her anymore.

And my mother is forcing me to visit every single week. I already have a very stressful job and I barely maintain on my own. But visiting them constantly only makes it much worse. 

I feel like an selfish asshole right now, but this is really too much for me. I don't know what to do.
