I feel like it's inevitableSummer is coming up, which means taking sleeping pills every single day, and hoping one day I'll fucking kill myself. I'm stupid and who the fuck wants to associate with a stupid person like me? I'm thinking about maybe taking all the pills in my house or maybe I'll get a gun and shoot myself in the head. I deserve it because I'm worthless to society and the people around me.
