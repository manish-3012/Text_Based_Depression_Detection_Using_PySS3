It is my birthday and I have No one to celebrate it with.I'm 17 today. I'm a triple and no one wished me a happy birthday I got no gifts or hugs or anything. My family used to be very supportive of me until I got kicked out of school. I live alone I have a job but no friends anymore. I look on Facebook and see my brother and sister getting tons of birthday messages. I've thought about it for a while and I'm finally going to kill myself.
