I need someone to tell me that it's okay to let goI'm not sure if it is or not. I think if I was fully in control of my actions I would do it without a second thought.

I know it'd fuck up my mom but I resent her for it and that's unhealthy.

I just feel like I'm constantly suppressing the only impulse I have left that isn't getting really high and somehow making an ass out of myself but not regretting it because it's the only time I feel like existing is worth something. It's like everything is carefully aligned so that I feel trapped no matter what.

I'm tired of being so afraid and feeling like there isn't any relief. I know I probably deserve it for being an insufferable, selfish, unskilled, entitled, know it all douchebag whose actions are always different from what I thought in retrospect. But I can't handle feeling obligated to punish myself for a life I don't want anyway, it just doesn't make sense. I've never put any real effort into anything, and I feel ashamed of that but not because it's something I genuinely value, I see people who put effort into life and don't seem to be happy or get the kinds of returns on their investments to make it worthwhile. I don't want to fight a constant uphill battle just so I can stop feeling like a loser, if I existed in a vacuum I wouldn't mind being a loser at all, it just seems like every incentive and pressure for existing is artificial. I don't care what I deserve I just want out.
