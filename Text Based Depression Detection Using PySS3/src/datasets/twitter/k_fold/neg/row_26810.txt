Goodbye EveryoneI'm sorry for anyone I've ever hurt. I'm sorry for being a failure and never completing my goals in life. I know I won't ever be able to because of how stupid I am. I have no drive, no motivation. I know no one will ever love me because of the way I look or because they'll never love the real me. I'm sorry Mom and Dad for always being angry with you. I just wish you would get your life together and not depend on me so much. I'm sorry for my family, I wish we were closer and loved more. I'm sorry Brendan for everything. I wish you were the one who I always would say goodnight to and that I love you. I'm sorry my beautiful friends who I have distant myself from. I wish I could be the person everyone needed and never disappointing you all. I cannot handle this life anymore. I cannot handle the hurt I have. I should have done it when I had the chance. I love you all so much. Life will be better without me.
