Saved by a random guy (I'm M 21 y.o.)Sorry for my bad english.
I was thinking about killing myself for years. But it wasn't tragic thinking, you know, I just think that the death could be an answer when problems, overthinking and depression are too strong for me. Being dead is a compromise, I can't feeling good but  I can't feeling bad neither. I was really sad and unconfortable about what I was going to do, but I wasn't able to think about anything in that moment. I took the train, I went to a near city that I used to love and I just wanted to fell off a very high bridge. It was like 2:30 a.m. and a random guy just came out from nowhere. He was a nice man, he lost his daughter travelling from Africa to my country, he was really quite and peaceful. I was a bit upset but also surprised, and he stopped me from doing it. He just said to me to think about my family, how they are going to feel if I die, how much they love me. He was right, my family loves me and I don't want to do it anymore. I have a nice family, studying at university, a lot of awesome friends (One of them reached me in that city in the night), but life is just so damn hard. I know there's people going through a lot of pain, someone without a family, someone with cancer, someone who is by far more unlucky than me. And I feel guilty for this, I accuse myself for being sad and this make me even more sad. I still think sometimes about suicide, but it's against my will, they are just some flash similar to dreams in wich I'm dead, and these thought are out of my control. Maybe I should see a doctor, someone who can help, I don't know. The only think I know is that after the night I tried to sucide and got saved, I don't want to do it anymore, I want to enioy my life with my family and my friends till I can. I'm just frightned about these thought.
