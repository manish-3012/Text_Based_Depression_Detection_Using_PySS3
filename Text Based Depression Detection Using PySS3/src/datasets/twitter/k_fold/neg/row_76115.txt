I can't live just for socksI saw someone trying to reassure a suicidal person who says they have no reason to wake up in the morning by saying (and I'm paraphrasing) "one day you'll be glad for something, even if it's a nice pair of socks. Hang in there and you'll find it." Like what the hell? I'm not the person they were talking to, but I also don't have a reason to wake up in the morning, and this confused the hell out of me. How could a pair of socks give anyone a reason to live? I'm not suicidal because I have cold feet, I'm suicidal because I struggle with mental illness.

I understand that finding meaning in the little things is important, but I can only get excited about socks so many times before realizing that the little stuff can't replace my will to live. I'm tired of trying to find meaning in everything around me. I don't want little reasons to get out of bed, I want to have the same drive to wake up and do shit with my life that everyone around me has, and I'm tired of being told to "hang in there." If my life had a meaning, I'm sure I'd have found it by now.
