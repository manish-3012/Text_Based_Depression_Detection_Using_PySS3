What does it feel like to wake up and not want to die the moment youâ€™ve opened your eyes?Because I havenâ€™t felt that in a very long time. 

I wake up wishing I didnâ€™t, and go to bed wishing Iâ€™d be sleeping for good. It really sucks to have to bear this kind of pain every single day of my life.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been thinking this is the perfect time to die â€” large groups are banned from gathering, so if ever I had a burial there wouldnâ€™t be that much fanfare, like I always wanted. Eulogies, funeral ceremonies, I donâ€™t want any of that. I just want to go.
