Is my life valuable? If so why?Everyone around me keeps telling me I shouldnâ€™t kill myself because my life is valuable but I donâ€™t understand what that means. Why is my life valuable?No one seems to know beyond their own selfish reasons for wanting me to stay alive. It certainly doesnâ€™t feel valuable to me and isnâ€™t my assessment the only one that really matters (after all Iâ€™m the one that has to live it)? I just donâ€™t understand the logic of telling someone their life is valuable when the only ostensible value said life has is that that personâ€™s friends and family can hit them up when THEY feel like it without actually doing anything to try and improve that personâ€™s quality of life.
