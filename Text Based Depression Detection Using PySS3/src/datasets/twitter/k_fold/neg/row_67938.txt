Pointless.My belief system is ruining my life, for the record i'm 19 and about to go to university(i live in poland). I was always fascinated with science and that led to me trying to learn a lot about our universe, i started watching youtube video's explaining all the basic stuff to our universe, all the laws of physics, the quantum world, the entropy and the more i digged the more cold the world seemed to me. I'm an agnostic so a theory of god giving the world pupouse doesn't speak to me well. Eventually i started looking at all the emotions as chemical reacions, all our desires driven by primitive dopamine based systems in our brain, life is cold, it has no sparkle to it, we don't really know what's it's purpose, maybe it's just to increase entropy, who knows. So i started playing around with drugs(benzos and opiates) because they made me feel good, because that's what my stupid brain told me he wants and there was one moment when i mixed the benzos with alcohol and passed out for 4 hours, completely blank, i "wake up" in front of my computer not knowing what i was just doing. That's when something changed, i realised how easy it is to just end it, i was pretty sure i was on the verge of overdosing. Why end it though? Is nothingness better then pointlessness? I don't know the answers to those questions, but i know that i have some reasons to end it, for one i don't think i'll be able to handle living on my own and the university itself, i don't want to see my parents age, i don't want to think about that one girl i had something going with 4 years ago. I know this post is really long and messy, but i felt like i just needed to say this somewhere, maybe there is something that i don't see and someone can enlighten me. Thank you for reading this misery of a story.
