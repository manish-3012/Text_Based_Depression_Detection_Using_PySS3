No JobI'm 25. I have Asperger's Syndrome. I've had 2 jobs in my entire life. One lasted 2 months, the other lasted 7 months. I have no friends and no connections. I can't find a job that pays a living wage. The only thing I have to my name is a STEM degree with a good GPA. I'm working on a master's since I've got nothing better to do.
I don't want to keep living off my parents for the rest of my life. But I have no other options. No one will hire me due to a lack of experience. I can't get experience without being hired...
I don't understand this world. There are people like me that are willing and able to work, if someone would just give us a chance. But no one ever does. They'd rather have us live off of welfare for some reason... and then the people who do have jobs are all over-worked. It's like the system is designed to be inefficient.
When my parents die I will truly be alone. I can't see any sort of life where I can be happy anymore.
I feel like such a failure. My family used to think I had such a bright future. I feel so ashamed of myself.
I've been depressed for a long time, but it's hit the point where I can't handle it anymore. Suicide is the only option I can think of. I don't know what else to do.
