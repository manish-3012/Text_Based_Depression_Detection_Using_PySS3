Warning: Bleak and Dark ideas.I know I'm deeply depressed. I've been this way for more than half My life.  


I've only continued to hold on to life by the "parents don't deserve this" chain.

After decades of holding onto that chain, all the love I ever held has been spent.  


What strength I once had is long gone.  
Of the pride I had, nothing remains.  
The little slivers of control that are left, quickly dwindle, and leave only the hope of death.

&amp;#x200B;

Can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy, and pretending to be, only to keep those around from needlessly worrying, has become a crushing burden.  


Have tried meds, many meds, for long times, nothing works.  
Beyond the chemical imbalances, there are ideas that keep Me down.

BEWARE

READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.  
Life is a constant stream of pain, with brief interludes of relief.  
Doing an analysis of life in the last two decades, I can say with a high degree of certainty that; The pain to pleasure proportion is at the very least 10:1.  
Thus, to continue to live is to accept 10 units of pain for each unit of pleasure.  
And that just seems like the worst deal.  


To continue to live is to continue to suffer, day in and day out, without respite or hope.

  


I often envy the blissfully unaware, those that are sheltered by their ignorance and can keep on enjoying the shit-sludge that life is.
