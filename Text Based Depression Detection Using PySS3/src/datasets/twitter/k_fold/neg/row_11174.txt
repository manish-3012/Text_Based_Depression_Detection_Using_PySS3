I dissociate and hurt myselfI donâ€™t want to die. But I hurt so bad and something takes over me, compulsing me to hurt myself. It bangs in my head over and over again â€œjust drive into the tree it would be so easyâ€ or â€œtake your razor, itâ€™s sharp enoughâ€ or â€œput your cigarette out on your skin. It would hurt so goodâ€. I kind of just go numb and do it. Iâ€™m in tremendous pain. It wonâ€™t go away. The medicine just makes my body stop feeling it, not my head. I love him so much. If I donâ€™t update Iâ€™m either dead or in inpatient, or I fell asleep before I could do anything. I need to stop feeling this. I love him
