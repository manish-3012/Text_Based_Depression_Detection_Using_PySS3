I don't know what to doI'm 17 years old male from Australia. My parents have had a big toll on my life. They had heaps of fights when I was younger and my mother filed a domestic violence lawsuit against my farher which has lasted 3 years so far. I've dealt with bullying in the past but alwaya seemed to ignore it but recently I've been getting death threats and calls from people I don't know. I basically got a teacher fired for screaming at me and his kids go to my school so I suspect its them. I've had depression ever since my parents split and even before then when I was 12. I've always been self conscious and now I have undiagnosed social anxiety and I have frequent mood swings. I have a few friends and only find it difficult forming new relationships. I've tried to hang myself in the past but things never work out. I'm scared about the impact my death will have on my family. My parents also dont believe in mental illnesses and because they didnt and still dont have depression means i dont have it. I've tried talking to my school counselor but we cant get along and he refuses to help me. I just want to die but I am too afraid to take the leap. My lifes going nowhere.
