Can't keep trying anymoreSpare me the clichÃ©s, spare me everything that people usually say. I'm tired, I'm done with that shit. Take it somewhere else.

I keep having suicidal dreams, and I don't feel like telling any therapist or "officials" because I don't want to be put into a mental hospital AGAIN, only to have me be discharged and healthy. 


I want to talk to someone about it, befriend someone, anyone... but it's not working, and hasn't been working for 19 years. What's the point? Why do I keep trying?

So, I'm gonna do it. I don't know when, but I'm fucking tired, and frankly, the world is better off without me.
