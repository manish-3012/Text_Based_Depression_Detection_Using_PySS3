not sure why but I don't feel like giving up right now. Asking for advice on getting jobs with a felony record and dealing with being homeless.I have about 3 weeks before I get evicted. Right now, I am all caught up. 
I have car with payments. Going to try to do this UBER thing to save it.

Biggest assets I had was a paid off car, which I don't have anymore and a clean police record, which I don't have anymore. 

I have posted some dark stuff in the last few days. For some reason, I don't feel like giving up anymore. 

I am looking at eviction, car reposession.  My main worry is that when I have my day in court, Jan 21st they just throw me back in jail because I am homeless and have no job. 

I dunno. At this point, only a time machine would fix things. 

I am afraid.
