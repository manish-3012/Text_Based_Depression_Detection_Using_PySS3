Pain,sorrow,guilt?My parents both died a year apart from each other they were the two people who I ever was really close to I had friend here and there but I knew my parents had my back regardless they passed away and I felt empty,cold and lost.
 My wife took care of all the funeral issues and such and let me just be for a few months I was just a mess.
I always have felt as I don't belong her, my best friend recently committed suicide and left a note saying maybe tomorrow will be better. I never expected him to do this as we did talk about it and tried as teenagers something changed in him and now I'm here wondering what's my point.
My job cut me down so I have barely any income I'm not a college graduate because I was dumb as a teen.
Life only shows me the pain or failures I've done. I thought as I grew older life got better ,wrong. I just want to feel warm again it's so cold and it's starting to hurt. I felt my soul or something feel like it left me the other day and I have been freezing ever since thath moment. 
I see myself just walking down darkness where I just don't care about anyone , and then I hurt everyone around me because I'm a selfish prick obviously.
My words are those just on some screen.. probably meaningless.

It never goes away it doesn't get easier. That's all bullshit
I just want to be watching my family seeing them...onces I haven't seen for years decades even. I miss everyone... I have no friends here my family's all dead but my wife has her family. Not my family we don't get along.  Makes things harder.
Ontop ofit my wife's pregnant and I'm going to be a shitty father who can't provide.. yep one two fthis
