The world will be better off without meFor the last 2 months, I've been feeling like a hurdle to the world. 

People approach me only if they need something ONLY I have. I'm in a grad school in a new university where it seems that everybody else has built their friendships during their undergrad years and there's no need for me. 

Then, there used to be a group of friends online I've been a part of, then it fell apart, and this January, the bloke I've been pretty close to has turned cold towards me (but not towards the rest of the group), and yes, I've tried to reach out to him, to take initiative.

There is a complicated subject in the Uni, and judging by how the professor talks to me, he assumes me to be a dumbo (yes Mr. Professor Sir, I CAN count to 2 and much more than that!). I suspect profiling - I'm a girl with long blond hair and don't wear glasses. He doesn't talk to other students like that, even if they fail to answer his questions.

This Thursday, I lost a new friend by speaking my mind to him about his other friend in a public place. He suggested we go separate ways.

The entirety of today was the straw that broke the camel's back. The cashier was rude to me because I made an honest mistake, and mum showed me very vividly that she couldn't care less about my feelings through how she talked to me and then to my dad. 

The world would be a much better place without me. I'm too inconvenient, uninteresting and stupid. My death would increase the world's intelligence and overall happiness by a margin. And to be fair,  I myself too am tired of being inconvenient, of being ashamed for existing and being a circumstance to other people.

Now to find the most efficient way to do it, so I make the least mess with my death for other people to deal with.
