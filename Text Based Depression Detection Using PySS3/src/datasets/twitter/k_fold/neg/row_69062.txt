I'm so confused. I don't know what to do.I've wanted to kill myself for a long time, but I've been putting it off until I could get away from everyone I know so my death wouldn't affect them so much. To cope in the meantime, about three weeks ago I started drinking. Hard. Anywhere from 4 to 7 shots of 80 or 90 proof straight from the bottle, no meal or mixer.

And now all of a sudden, I feel "normal." "better". "functional." I feel like I could try to do things again and make something with my life.

But honestly, I don't want to anymore. That little piece of me that says "I want to get better, keep going, whatever," feels broken, and I don't know that I want to fix it anymore. I've spent so long just wishing my life would end, not get better, just end, that feeling "good" all of a sudden, for a few days, feels worse than feeling bad before. At least then, I knew what I wanted.

But now I'm not even sure if I can kill myself, and that hurts even worse, and makes me upset and angry with myself. I feel guilty too...because I know I *should* try to do things and *could* do them if I tried hard enough, but that part of me doesn't want to keep going anymore.

Between the guilt, the suicidal desires, and knowing that once I stop drinking I'll probably go back to where I was....and keeping having to think "You can do things now, you should follow your dreams" or whatever....it's just confusing. I want to die, and now I ca'nt even do that.

I guess I jsut didn't know who else to go to.
