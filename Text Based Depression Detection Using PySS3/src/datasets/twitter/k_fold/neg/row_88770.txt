I donâ€™t know what to do.Iâ€™ve been hoping for death since before my stepfather died (about 2 years ago). He was an asshole who emotionally fucked with me every second of my daily life for 18 years. He killed himself leaving us in a heap of debt for about a year and wrecked my mother emotionally. I am afraid that if I were to kill myself, that maybe my mother would follow soon after? I sincerely hope for the best for her and want only great things for her because raising me and my sister has not been an easy task; But everything seems so hopeless and desolate. Everything about society and life as we know it is dying slowly. I donâ€™t see a point in feeding anyoneâ€™s bank account by forcing myself to go to college while burying my family in more debt. Iâ€™ve been having these thoughts so often that Iâ€™m seeing scenarios in my dreams. Iâ€™m a coward and are terrified of pain and suffering so Iâ€™ve been waiting for the chance to get a firearm as that is the most surefire way I can think of. The only thing Iâ€™m unsure about is my mother.
