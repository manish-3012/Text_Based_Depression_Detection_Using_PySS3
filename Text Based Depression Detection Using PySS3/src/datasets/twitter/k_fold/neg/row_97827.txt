Nobody will miss meNobody will miss me when I end myself

I'm replaceable and to many, they wouldnt even notice I was gone. Theres nobody here to tell me everything's going to be ok, nobody telling me they've got my back for today. My mum, she has other children. My friends, they don't give a flying fuck. I dont know why I'm still going

There is no such thing as a me-sized hole in the world. The world doesn't need me
