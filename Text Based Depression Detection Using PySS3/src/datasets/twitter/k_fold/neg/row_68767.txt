Tired.I've written plenty of notes, sat in several psychotherapist offices, sought out any means suggested and yet nothing works. Nothing fills the void or, makes the aching inside go away. I've worked so hard and have restarted so many times and with all I've done I've got nothing to show for it. I'm inadequate in friendships, relationships, and giving simple advice. I had hoped and prayed I wouldn't make it to 23 and I'm a month away from being 24. People ask that if the number of attempts is so high why don't I just give up as there is obviously a reason as to why I'm here. I have no purpose other than to be a resilient placeholder till everyone I know finds someone better to replace me with. I wish I would've succeeded by now.
