I will be a useless doctor.I'm not even going to med school because I like people or medicine. I'm just good at it, and I'm good at remembering that information. I also want to prove on some visceral level that if someone like me can get through it, then humanity is a joke.

I'm so sick of the superficial nature of life. I feel alone. My ex of 7 years left me. I don't really know what I want out of life. I'm just wasting my time.

Fuck, I loved her, though, but I guess I'm a little too weird for most people. I think she got sick of me.

I don't even know why I'm living right now when the end result will be the same. I have a fuck-load of benzos and alcohol right now that could kill me if I wanted.

I think I'm just scared of the future. I don't want to be alone or with someone I don't care about. I don't know how I could ever get as close to someone else as I did with her.
