I'm going to be carted awayI hate this. This is why I don't tell people things. I'm going to be locked up in a fucking kooky bin because cutting is my coping mechanism and I trusted the wrong person, who apparently "loves" me. This is the kind of shit that brings me closer to the edge. I don't care about methods or how much it'll hurt or if I have a chance of living and being mangled anymore. When I get out of this fucking hellhole, I'm doing it.
