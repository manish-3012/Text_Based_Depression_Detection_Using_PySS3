RIP to everyone that lost their life on New Years Day.Many people Iâ€™ve come acrossâ€”wether it be online or in real life have decided to end their life around the holiday season (mostly New Years) because of their pain. I just want everyone to know that you are NOT alone and many people can relate to you and donâ€™t want to see you pass on. Donâ€™t let the holidays determine if you get to see another day. So many redittors have kill themselves today, and theyâ€™re not responding to anything I type.

This mere fact makes me cry, and I donâ€™t want anyone to die, wether I know them in real life or not.

I made this post because I want you all to know that you do NOT have to end your own life. Things WILL get better and you WILL NOT ever find happiness. You may not have a picture perfect life, living in your dream house sipping a martini on your front porch with a SO, but things WILL improve for you if you keep trying. 

Happy New Year, everyone.

I miss you, Nick.
