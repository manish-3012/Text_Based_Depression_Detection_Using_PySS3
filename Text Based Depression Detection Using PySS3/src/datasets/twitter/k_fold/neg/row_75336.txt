Hello, suicidal people, I have a dream.Hello, I've been suicidal since 2years ago, I really want to kill myself, had suicidal attempt 2 times since the last month. First time I slit my wrist, second time I burned coal in my room. I've seen therapy, been persicbled with antidepressants, but it's not much help. I still struggle with constant pain and worry daily. 
I know that many suicide people have different reasons for killing themselves. 

I'm only 23this year, I still want to study and contribute to human society. And been a good person and all. 

I've help homeless people on the street many times, because I believe in humanity. 
Now I want to study in nz for construction. But I don't have the money for it. It's been my dream. But I couldn't seem to be able to achieve it. 

Can anyone give me any advice or help with it. Thanks. I think with suck purpose that I try to achieve. I'll be less likely to kill myself. 

Thanks
