My girlfriend is depressed and suicidal. She doesn't want to go to a therapist. How do I make her go ?So I'm 16 years old and my girlfriend of 6 months is depressed and often has suicidal thoughts. We talk quite a lot on Facebook but don't really meet much in person because here in India, dating is not really something you want your parents to know about. So none of our parents know about us. She's had depression for a long time or at least that's what she says. Her parents fight a lot on silly issues and her dad is a frequent smoker. Whenever they fight, she ends up crying and blaming herself for all the problems in her family. She's an only child and often feels lonely. She says she needs me but when I tell her that I'm here for her she says she doesn't want to hurt me. She's attempted suicide twice already by overdosing on pills and it hurts to know that it was when I was dating her. I don't want her to feel this way and I'm ready to do anything to help her. If anyone can tell me how I can help her without hurting either if us too bad in this relationship that would be appreciated. Also, I want to make her go to a therapist but she won't. How do I force her to do this ? I believe it's the best way to stay treatment against depression.
