i made an account just to at least leave something behind even thought this will probably get deletedThis is the first and probably last time I'll post to reddit. Around next month I'll be gone, I'll probably just buy some rope and go into the nearby forest. It's laughable that my last escape would be on reddit. I'm a struggling 19 year old college student and I have tried so hard just to reach this point but I guess I'm at my breaking point... Depression, I don't know if I have it or not, either way I'll just end up dead in some forest. So yeah if you see any news about a guy hanging himself in the forest then it might be me.
