I signed up to work as an escort while drunk, and now I feel like I should kill myself because I've made a mess of life. Basically what it says in the title - I signed up to work as an escort and now I want to back out. I am scared that I will be blackmailed since they have some photos of me. Has anyone been in this situation before? How can I quit safely?
