A lobotomyIdk how else to explain this but i want a lobotomy. That way i wont actually be dead, i just literally would lack the brain matter and neural pathways to form any kind of cognitive thought including the depressed ones. Granted, i will become a vegetable but i want that at this point. Just shove an icepick behind my eyes already or scrape at my brain matter until i cant speak anymore. I hate life. I hate myself. And while to many that may seem worse than just dying, having lost a friend to suicide last year i know what that does to people realistically. I cant have that weight on my conscience because despite my brain i do know people around me actually give a fuck. They could cope with drastic change better than death. 

I have chonic clinical bipolar depression and ive had it for most of my life. I feel fucking awful, i wake up and i wish i hadnt so i spend an hour in bed wishing i was dead and that i hadnt woken up. Suicide has been in my head for years. Meds dont help and i just lost access to my therapist (fuck you american healthcare system).
