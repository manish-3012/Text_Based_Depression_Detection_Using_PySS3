Told by/stop drinking id be best to post here. Please readNew account for this guys. Basically I stoped my daily drinking of ten years 8 weeks ago. I knew there would be some initial depression to work though. That was fine but lately it's getting to a point I just can't stand it anymore. 

I'm envious of everybody around me, friends given businesses by family and not having to work. Meanwhile me and my girlfriend have to scrape by every month working 70+ hours a week. 
I had high hopes for life and my love of adventure. 

My girlfriend wants to have kids, pets, marriage and I can't get rid of this guilt that I dont want that as i feel I could never cope with all that pressure. I can barely cope with a few bills/ work and social occasions. 

I just feel so alone. This has been going on for so many years and I'm certain this was my reason for drinking to block it all out. I'm unhappy, I can't think of a time I ever was truly happy.. 
The idea of working and paying off a house for 30 years to just retire and die fills me with dread. 

I feel I'm not made for this world and can't find a way around it other than giving up. It pains me to say it :(
