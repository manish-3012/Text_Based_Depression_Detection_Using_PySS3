I don't know what's wrong with me.Its hard for me to pay attention. I have ADHD, but I try to control it (but I can't). I try hard to be nice, but my parents yell at me when my grades start slipping. I try to tell them that there's nothing I can do while I'm at home and that I can get it figured out the next day, but they don't want to hear it. I think I may have some sort of mental issue, because when they yell at me I almost always yell back. I know I really shouldn't, but for some reason I can't help it. 

Last night my mom lashed out at me again, and didn't let me explain what could easily be fixed. I got so frustrated that I yelled back for a long time until I felt my dad's fist hit the back of my skull. I ran to my bedroom and locked it before he could do anything else. I heard my dad yelling and mom crying upstairs. Soon my dad began pounding on my door and screaming to let him in. I stayed silent, hoping he would go away. Nope. He grabbed a key and began punching my chest and stomach until I puked blood onto my pillow. 

I just need someone to talk to.
