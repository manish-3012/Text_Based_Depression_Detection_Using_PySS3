I gave myself a lot of chances in lifeI still am fragile unstable unhappy 

I am doing a lot of mistakes that I regret

Iâ€™m sorry

Every time I think of killing myself I try to say thereâ€™s another day but this time I feel like lifeâ€™s too tough for me.

Killing myself takes a lot of courage that I just canâ€™t 

I wish I was never even born
