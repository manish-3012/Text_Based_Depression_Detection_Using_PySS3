So I've been thinking of rehoming the cats...Like most people, the suicidal thoughts are worse some days than others. One of the constants is my two cats, Ohma and Terry. While they are one of the reasons I stick around, they're still just cats to me. 

One worry I have however is what would happen to them if I go? Would they be given to a shelter? Would my family take them? Would they be kept together or separated?

Admittedly, I don't want my family to have them. While I do love them, I know family enough to know the idea of "indoor pets" is alien to them. I've been city living, they live out in the country. And I know they wouldn't keep them indoors for me(none of them are actually cat people) so I don't see them lasting long out in cougar and coyote country. 


Of course, its the wrong detail to worry about. But I worry about it because I know no one else will either.
