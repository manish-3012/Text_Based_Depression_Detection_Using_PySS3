Yep I tried I tried you can't tell me I didn't I tried to reach out on here this sub on reddit in general I only got ignored or trolled so I'm doneLook at my post history for today I'm in a really serious crisis I'm having a really horrible day and was already suicidal I have depression that's "abnormal in its severity" and guess what I get told to post my suicide on liveleaks when I posted on this sub. I tried to make other posts on here no response. I tried posting to freecompliments they told me I was "seeking advice" so they deleted my post. I tried posting to kindvoice no response. I tried posting to needafriend no response. I tried posting to makenewfriendshere the first response said and I'm quoting word for word: "I wish you used proper punctuation, but how is your day going?" So I responded (because seriously correcting other people's grammar how is that not annoying??): "I'm a having a really fucking horrible day and I don't care at all about fucking punctuation." So some dipshit responded: "You're not going to make any friends with such hostility no friendship can be based around such negativity." So of course I responded: "Oh I'm so fucking sorry my fucking bad." And I added because I was really annoyed: "Here's a hostile response: go fuck yourself" and then this same asshole told me about how it's really funny that I'm so angry and no wonder I don't have any friends and so on.


I tried. I tried to reach out. I have no one to reach out to in real life. So I tried on here. That is what happened. I'm done.
