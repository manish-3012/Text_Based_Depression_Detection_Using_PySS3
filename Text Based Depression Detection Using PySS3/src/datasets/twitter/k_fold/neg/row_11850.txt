why not kill myself? i'm 18, no job or money, mom was abusive in the past, father abandoned me when i was 5 or 6 ish. i'm trans - mom is less than supportive, i hate the way i look, i hate the genitals i have, and i cant change any of it because its fucking expensive as shit. the guy i'm supposed to contact to even start with the process of this is ignoring my emails outright...and even then this simply isnt covered in my country

i've tried to find reasons to stick around, but...there arent any. i've already tried to kill myself once but the blade turned out to be too dull so i failed. i really dont see why not try again and make everything to succeed...
