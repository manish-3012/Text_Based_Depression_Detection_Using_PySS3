I hate everything about myself. Almost at the brink of suicide.I am an extremely hostile, sarcastic, inconsiderate, self-centered person. When something/someone bothers me, I can't describe how I am feeling very easily, without feeling embarrassed. What comes out of my mouth is usually "Fuck you" or "Shut the fuck up.", sorry for the foul language. That's another thing. I curse SO much. I can't help it!

Due to a history of bitchiness and hate and hostility, most of the people in my school hate me. They stare at me, they whisper at me, they talk about me. I know it's happening, and I think about it constantly. One day someone in my class will be nice to me, talk to me, and I'll mention her to a friend, and they'll inform me that that person constantly tells my friend how big of a bitch I am and how manly I am and how ugly I am.

What I am asking if you, SW, since I am on the brink of suicide, how can I go and apologize to these people? I can't stand it. I can't control my emotions. 

I am pathetically asking you to help me write apologies that I can say to people without seeming awkward.

-I called this one person named Brooke fat and ugly with buck teeth when I was in 3rd grade, and she will not forget about it.

-I was extremely rude to this one boy and even beat him up to the point of where if he sees me somewhere he is disgusted and picks at my flaws in front of everyone.

-I was rude and hostile towards many people, and even made a fake facebook account so I could insult them. I feel horrible about this.

-I insulted one girl on how bad she sung, and caused another facebook argument about it.

-I insisted one girl's opinion on how guys should be was wrong and now she hates me

-People that I knew in elementary school now hate me

Please, reddit, how can I apologize to these people? I want to start fresh without moving away from my home, which I can't, because I am 13.
