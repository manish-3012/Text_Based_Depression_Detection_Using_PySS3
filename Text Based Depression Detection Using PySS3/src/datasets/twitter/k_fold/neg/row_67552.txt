Tired of the noise inside my headSince watching the Ron McNutt video from the other day, I think Iâ€™ve been given the courage to finally do what I need to. Iâ€™ve fought it off long enough, but Iâ€™m at the end of my rope. I canâ€™t come up with any positive from my life the last year and a half, itâ€™s just been perpetually downhill and Iâ€™ve reached the bottom. Today was the icing on the cake.

Thanks to anyone who reads âœŒï¸
