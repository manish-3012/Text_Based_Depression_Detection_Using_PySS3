Not sure how much longer I can keep doing thisI'm 23, almost 24 now and have had depression since I was 14. I've been alone my whole life and no I'm not exaggerating it either like a lot do. I literally have no family, no friends, and never had a relationship of any kind. I'm just never good enough for anyone, not even enough to fucking talk to. 

I'm just tired of trying, it doesn't do anything. I've done it all, tried being honest, tried being myself, tried being someone I wasn't, tried buying friends, nothing works. No one gives a shit. I tried working out to better myself, changing my style and hairstyle, moved to a new place with all new furniture, tried being more social and outgoing but in the end it's all the same. People act like they care for 2 weeks and then never hear from them again. Just went on a date recently which was the best date I've been on, we had everything in common and conversation just flowed naturally. Well she ghosted me 2 days later out of fucking nowhere like everyone else does. 

This shit sucks, I've been trying for 10 fucking years just to find anyone to have a connection with, even a fucking online one. But nope nothing. I'm almost 24 and have never had a single person in my life or even one momemt of happiness. Like how fucking sad and unfair is that?! I didn't ask for this, I just want it to stop. I hate it so much, this is literally my personal hell.
