WorthIf I could push someone out of a way of a train to save there life I'd do it

Because I know even a man who has no arms no limbs, no ability to speak, a absolute shit life, no money, no love, is worth more than me

Sure maybe I have a few of the things he doesn't but
He'd still be worth more than me because I know what I'm worth
I'm worth nothing.
