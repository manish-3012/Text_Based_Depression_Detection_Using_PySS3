No one really cares until too lateI hate how people always say that if only they know that the person who killed themselves was going through hard times they would have done something. Itâ€™s a stupid excuse these people donâ€™t care about the friend or loved one and just trying to justify themselves to their friends. No one really cares. One life doesnâ€™t impact the world.
