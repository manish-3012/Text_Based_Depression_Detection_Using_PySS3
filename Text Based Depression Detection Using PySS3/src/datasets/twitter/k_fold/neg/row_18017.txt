no one loves meI started to figure out Iâ€™m all alone I canâ€™t really have someone I could hold or someone who I could truly be with cuz Iâ€™m never the one? Or Iâ€™m not loving enough? Idk Iâ€™m just a horrible person I donâ€™t have the balls to kill my self if I had a gun I will I just wish someone cared about me or that someone truly loves me Idk I just feel broken
