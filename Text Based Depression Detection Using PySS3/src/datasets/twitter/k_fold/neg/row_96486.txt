A tumblr user has just said she was going to kill herself and has stopped posting since. http://spys-cock.tumblr.com/post/39265783217/im-so-tired-if-even-being-alive-anymore-i-dont

This was her last post, 50 minutes ago, she was posting every few minutes before that.

she is living in Britain and has borderline personality disorder.

I dont know what to do, I only know her on the internet and I live in Singapore, is there any way to help her???
