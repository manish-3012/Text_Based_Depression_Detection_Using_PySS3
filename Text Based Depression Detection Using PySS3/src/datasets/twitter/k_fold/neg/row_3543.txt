"It'll get better one day".Aye, I'm sure it will. 
But I've heard that for years, now. 

I was told that 6 months ago, and then I lost my dad, my house and my job. I'm homeless and couch surfing. This quarantine and my dad has destroyed every bit of fight I had. 

I graduated a year ago exactly and have nothing to show for it. 

What's the fucking point?

One day is too far away just for it to maybe get better or worse. What I do doesn't matter - it is always out of my control in the end. 

I'm only 21, but the future seems to hold only grief and death.
