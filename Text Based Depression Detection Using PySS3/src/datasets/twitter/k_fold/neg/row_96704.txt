Kind of upset I didnâ€™t dieI took around 50+ pills when I decided to overdose. I remember blacking out an hour after and then waking up 8 hours later as if I had just gone to sleep normally. After that I started vomitting like hell and the taste was so fucking disgusting.

I still taste it on my tongue and certain smells trigger it. I remember vomitting for around an hour- just on and off. I remember crying and being so fucking pissed because my body was just naturally kicking out the pills. Throughout the rest of the day I just couldnâ€™t move and lay in my bed with a huge headache. 

I know I should be grateful but a part of me is pissed that I lived. I wanted to die so so much. Now I feel like I have ptsd or some shit because Iâ€™d think of the smell or the taste and Iâ€™d automatically gag. I have to brush my teeth automatically or eat something to distract me from it. 

I hate this shit so much but I canâ€™t do anything about it since Iâ€™m in Uni and donâ€™t want my roommate to witness it.
