I don't want to be here.I've never been more depressed in my whole life. My family and I no longer talk. I've deleted all social media. (Except Reddit.) I live with my boyfriend, but fuck... I haven't felt wanted. Nor have I felt loved in like two years. He just makes me feel like shit, and when I express my frustrations he just invalidates my feelings and calls me crazy. Says to me "People usually say it's not you, it's me. But I'm telling you that it's you, not me." Over the summer he told me to kill myself on more than one occasion. We went to Vegas and I actually purposefully sliced my leg open BADLY the night the Vegas Massacre happened (too bad I wasn't at the concert, right.) My uncle died a year a go this January. He was there for me more than my own father ever was. So it feels like my only father figure I had to look up to died. I can't see the point any more. I even have a loaded gun, including a silencer so I don't wake anyone up too loudly. Everyone has to work and I'd feel awful.

So I've got everything ready. My only problem is I'm a pussy. I don't want to live. I just don't want it to hurt. I don't want to find out I'm going to burn forever in hell. Even though I don't think it exists. Like if it just so happened to exist... I've already lived a full lifetime of pain. Can't I just get a break. I even decided I'd do it in the bathroom for a bit of an easier clean up. Even though I know it'll get everywhere pretty much. But at least you could run the shower and get a lot of it.

No one loves me.
No one cares.
I have no family. 
No friends. 
No children. 
No pets.
And I'm a burden on everyone who knows me.

I just don't want to be here and I wish I could just stop being a bitch about it and just pull the trigger.
