Way OutI wish there was a way out without making my family pay. I just want to feel peace but because being here is torture. The only peace I get is when Iâ€™m not awake. I keep on living with this pain because Iâ€™m too scared to end it all. Just looking for peace if mind. I try to be better but the thoughts still remain. Not sure if a therapist could help me at this point. Things arenâ€™t looking good for me. I am truly a miserable person.
