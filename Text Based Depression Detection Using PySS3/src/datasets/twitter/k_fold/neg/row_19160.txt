Mother Problemsiâ€™m 19 and my parents have recently forced me to move back in with them. my mother is controlling as all hell, and my dad goes along with it because heâ€™s intimidated by her. i have always been the least favorite child. they didnâ€™t raise me until i was 9, and they only started raising me then because they had an IQ test done on me and decided that i was â€œworth itâ€. for context, i have a brother who is four years younger than me and they have raised him for his whole life. tonight, i told my mother that i was tired and depressed over how she tracks my phone, my car, my heart rate, my exercise levels, whenever i leave or enter the house, has ranges on my phone where if i go outside of them she gets an alert... i mean i am a legal adult. iâ€™m so fucking tired. and then tonight she says â€œi just cannot trust you. i never have and i never will. i know youâ€™ve tried to kill yourself, but at this point youâ€™re already dead. youâ€™ve completed your road of destruction and thereâ€™s only one ending to your storyâ€ like fuck...
