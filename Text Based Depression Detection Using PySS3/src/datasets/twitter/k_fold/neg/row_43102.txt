My mind is tearing away at meIâ€™m only 16 and I feel completely numb at many points in my life. I live a perfectly normal life and I always have, so I donâ€™t understand why the hell anything is going wrong. For so long my mind has been swirling with thoughts I canâ€™t even describe that cause my body to ache in pains equally unexplainable. Every time I feel this way, as though Iâ€™ve hit rock bottom, my parents tell me that I will get through it. And I do until it boils over again, and then all I want to do is lay down and pass away. Every time my parents try to comfort me I can hear their voice break because I know deep down they just donâ€™t want to see their child dead. And truth be told I donâ€™t want to die either, Iâ€™m too scared of what would happen, being so young. All of this has been increasingly elevated throughout the years because of school as well. I feel so damn mediocre to the point that I donâ€™t even know if I can care anymore. I feel like all my teachers hate me, even if they donâ€™t notice me because I donâ€™t like to speak up. I hate this empty feeling, I hate myself, even when writing this my mom is unaware and told me to take things step by step. That wonâ€™t help, Iâ€™m lost and spiraling and I just canâ€™t stop it. The negatives in my life have overwhelmed the positives for too long now and I feel worthless and like I canâ€™t continue. My instinct to continue living is making this hell on earth for me. And now Iâ€™ve reached a point where Iâ€™m venting on the damn internet. Iâ€™m so shattered feeling. No matter what â€œhelpâ€ I get it never helps me for long.
