i guess i just need to write this downthis post may be long and difficult to read too, since english isnâ€™t my first language but why do i care...

iâ€™m exhausted. iâ€™m extremely exhausted. even the word exhausted doesnâ€™t describe how i feel, i canâ€™t explain to anyone how i feel and thatâ€™s why no one is taking me serious. i donâ€™t want to live, the thought of the death doesnâ€™t scare me anymore. i havenâ€™t committed suicide yet just because of my mother.

when i was 10-13 my classmate used to make fun of appearance. it sticked to me so much that when i was 12 i developed an eating disorder. i'm 15 now and haven't gotten any better. it's just that from anorexic i turned into bulimic. the same classmate became obsessed with me when we were 13 to 15, he would stare at me all the time, touch me without my consent  and text me creepy things like â€œi can pay you to lose your virginity with meâ€. i have no idea why but this caused me being attracted to forced, molested porn. iâ€™m so fucked up.

because of my eating disorder i became depressed and extremely anxious. because of all the stress gathered in me i started being really auto-destructive. i almost failed school because i was too stressed out to go to school. i felt too ugly to go to school. i felt too fat to go to school. i felt so fucking disgusting. but in the end i got accepted to one of the best highschools in my city which made it even worse. i became even more anxious and stressed.

also my dad. heâ€™s just awful. i hate him and i hate that i need to call him my dad. heâ€™s a fucking sociopath that HAS to make my life worse than it already is. when i was younger he would spit at me while screaming at me or move his hand towards me as if he was about to punch me. the worst thing is that i need to live with him. iâ€™ve talked to my mom about him multiple times, even my adult brother admitted that our life would be better without him. but my mom doesnâ€™t do anything about it. she wonâ€™t even let me live on my own.

as you can guess, my mom is the only person that i can rely on. or could. lately sheâ€™s been so cold to me, like if she had enough of me, which i totally understand if she did. also the thing is that my mom always tries to make everything perfect. i think she wants to have a perfect family, with perfect kids while in reality both me and my brother are depressed. she doesnâ€™t believe me that iâ€™m sick. she lets me see a therapist once a week but still she acts like there is no problem with me. 

this whole situation with her changing her behavior towards me made me feel like she wonâ€™t miss me after i die. maybe sheâ€™ll feel relieved even. this made me think about my death more often and i think i will finally do it. iâ€™m broken and iâ€™m never gonna be fixed. iâ€™m never gonna live a healthy lifestyle. iâ€™m not patient enough or just have the energy to wait till im 18 so i can move out and donâ€™t have to see my dad ever again. 

i really donâ€™t want anyone to tell me how life gets better, because iâ€™m just so fucking tired of waiting till it will. mine wonâ€™t ever, my mind wonâ€™t change. i guess i wrote this here because i want to get used to the thought of me killing myself. i donâ€™t know... i hope none of you will ever feel like me.
