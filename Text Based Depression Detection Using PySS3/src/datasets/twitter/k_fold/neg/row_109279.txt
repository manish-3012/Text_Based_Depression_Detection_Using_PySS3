How do people find a meaning in life?I don't understand. Take this example: I'm chasing a dream job, working my ass off for years and finally get my spot. Next day, I die in a car accident. What is the point if death is guaranteed? Why not just hurry the process and die now? I seriously see no point in even trying. Seems like a huge waste of time. Fast suicide &gt; spending 50+ years wasting your life. That's how it always will be. I always think about this and that is why I have wasted my life away. So how do you truly find a meaning in life?
