Anyone have luck with BetterHelp online counseling?Have you had success with BetterHelp? I just spent a couple hundred bucks for a months worth of counseling. Four days in and I'm already wishing I hadn't spent that money. The counselor I was matched with seems to be going off on a tangent. I have the ability to switch counselors but am unsure if I should do so. Don't want to come off as rude or needy or quick to judge. Thanks!
