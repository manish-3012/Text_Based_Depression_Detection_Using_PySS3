I donâ€™t understandI donâ€™t understand how so many people kill themselves everyday but I canâ€™t find a way how. I take hundreds of pills a week and I always wake up. I donâ€™t have a gun. I canâ€™t hang myself. I donâ€™t have a car in a garage. If I jump out in front of traffic, Iâ€™m afraid I will just be severely injured and not actually die. I keep googling things and nothing seems like something I can actually do but I want to die more than anything. I am ready to go. I also think itâ€™s so lovely how so many people here donâ€™t do it because they donâ€™t want to cause their loved ones pain. I wish my loved ones cared.
