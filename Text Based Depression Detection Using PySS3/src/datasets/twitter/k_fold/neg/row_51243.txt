I canâ€™t do it anymore.I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Iâ€™m supposed to turn 19 on Monday. My parents donâ€™t love me, Iâ€™m transgender and they donâ€™t support me. They kick me out all the time, they obviously donâ€™t want me. Iâ€™ve tried to move out 4 times this year but all have been a bust. I lost my job thanks to the pandemic and I have failed over and over to find a new one. I have 84 cents left. Iâ€™ve attempted 15 times in my life 4 of which required serious medical treatment. Iâ€™m such a failure I canâ€™t even kill myself right. Iâ€™ve pushed away all my friends, Iâ€™ve been alienated by my family, I truthfully have no one. I have no where to go. I have nothing to live for, and I certainly canâ€™t live for myself. Iâ€™m ready to go, Iâ€™m so tired. I just canâ€™t do it, hopefully this time I wonâ€™t fail.
