In the process of getting drunk and I'm going to kill myself.It's been a while since I've been here. Well, not really, but considering the circumstances, that time felt like an eternity. An update from last time, I saw the doctor. She called me "insightful and smart" which I thought was really funny because it's not true otherwise I wouldn't be like this and I wouldn't be mostly alone. And I was a blatant liar to her anyway. She was a good doctor in all honesty but didn't seem like a good fit for me and she was sort of my last option for a doctor so that kind of sucks. After seeing her, I was still somewhat suicidal, but during the past two months, I didn't drink. I was so damn proud of that. I mean, I really thought my drinking would kill me. However, I'm still here for whatever reason. I was trying to get my life together. Take better care of my pets. I was doing okay. I'm not now. I'm in the middle of trying to get fucking hammered and I feel so damn sick and my anxiety is through the roof and I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I'm actually worthless. I have no value in the world and all I do is bring others down. Is there any reason to continue? My pets are better off without me. I'm an ex-drunk/junkie who failed at life. I sit at home all day and disappoint others. I don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend. I'm a virgin, and no one expresses any interest in me because I'm one of the ugly undesirables. Maybe my Christmas gift to others should be me killing myself. I'd finally free them of the chains that my life binds them with. They'd have freedom and the opportunity of happiness, which is something I can't offer them. I think I'm going to kill myself. I'm suffering and causing everyone around me to suffer and I feel horrible for it. I need to do this. I'm sorry to rope you all into this but I just need to vent my intentions to the world. I owe my loved ones happiness so I need to do this. So this is the end of my saga I guess. Happy holidays everyone.
