I'm struggling hard right now. Every time I try to stand up I get kicked on my ass again.A month ago, I thought I was getting married to the love of my life (the date was set for this September). We've been together ten years.

This has been the series of events:

* We went on an absolutely amazing week long vacation up by Canada in a private cabin. Made love every day, held one another, made long term plans and just generally had an amazing fucking time.
*  Came home and everything was fine for a week or so. One day she came home just moping and eventually told me she didn't want to be engaged and is calling off the relationship altogether.
* I spiral. She insures me she has no interest in seeing anyone else and just wants us both to grow as people. Constantly peppers in promises we're getting back together, she loves me deeply, this would be happening to  *anyone* she was with and not just me, etc.
* In a panic I start making plans on how I can win her back and wondering what the hell went wrong at all.
* She blurts out that she wants to start a family and that's her chief reason for all of this--she has expressly stated in the recent past even that she doesn't want/like kids--and essentially tells me she needs to find someone else.
* I never had time to wrap my head around having kids, so I start to consider the idea and its long-term ramifications.
* Last night she was highly alluding to her either being interested in or already fucking our neighbor.

Ten years. We have a house together, pets, cars, all of our possessions are intertwined, everything has been 'us'. In a month my entire fucking life has gone to shit and I have no idea where to turn for comfort. We always held one another up and now, though I *desperately* want to be around her, I also don't want to be in the same room as her.
Our friends aspired to be like us. We were always *that* could that everyone envied. It's just this hollow fucking shell now.

I don't know how much longer I can handle this shit. I'm living in constant fear of the next revelation that's going to come to light. Fuck, I wish I didn't love her.
