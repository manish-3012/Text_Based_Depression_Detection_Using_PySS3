Again everydayNo matter what I do I always in dispair at the end of the day. I have dinner on the way and it's my best friends birthday tomorrow so why do I have such a strong urge to harm and kill myself I called my psychiatrist today and she talked to me for ten minutes and just gave me the same meds that aren't working she doesn't listen to me at all I will never get help and nobody listen to me why do I fucking try why don't I just kill myself
