I cheated and hurt my GF, I tried to make up for it and be the man she can be proud of. She belittles me, and I have been closer and closer to killing myself, I don't feel good.I try and talk to her over text/voice/video, She's never happy with me. I don't deserve her and I never should have hurt her in the first place.   


I don't know how to make her happy, nothing I've done, no talking, no hanging out, no quality time. Giving her space.   


Nothing nothing, she gets mad and she goes off the fucking handle and she really digs deep and tries to make me feel like shit. I apologize constantly.   


I try and try and try, really committed to just making us work and I really am shaking, I feel my fucking blood pulse in my arms. I can't focus on anything. It hurts so much.  


She thinks I gaslight her and manipulate her, I don't! I'm so fucking frustrated. I am literally ugly crying and typing this. I can't
