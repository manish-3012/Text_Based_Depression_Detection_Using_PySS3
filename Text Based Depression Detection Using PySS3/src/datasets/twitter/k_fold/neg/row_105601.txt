I donâ€™t think I can endure the wait for my new antidepressants to kick in.I had hope for the first time in weeks today and now Iâ€™m back to crying in the bathtub trying not to see different ways I can kill my self. It was dumb to switch antidepressants. The side effects of Prozac were bothering me, but having the suicidal thoughts come back is much, much worse. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m such a failure. Even when I try my hardest it all goes to shit. I need to sleep. I need to stop having mirtazapine induced food cravings. I need to get rest so that I can work and go to my doctor tomorrow and then go to a job interview so that I can have a second job.

I keep lying to my doctors about my history of self harming. 

I want to die. I canâ€™t try anymore. Everything I do is wrong and then I try harder and it hurts just a little more when I fuck up again.
