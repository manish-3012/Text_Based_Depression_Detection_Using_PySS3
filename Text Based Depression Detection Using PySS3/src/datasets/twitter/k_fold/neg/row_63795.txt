...My grandfather who raised me since i was a child died recently of cancer. He was a father to me, and one of the only people I've ever cared about. Now my Grandmother and my grandfathers son are in a court case over who gets what. My girlfriend of 6 years left me 2 days ago. She was my only friend and best friend. Everything is just happening all at once, and I feel like I have nothing left.
