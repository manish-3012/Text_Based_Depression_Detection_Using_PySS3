University dropoutHi. I'm a 24 M, student ar Architecture uni. Due to my depression I can't go to courses and probably I have to dropout. But if I can't continue the architecture probably I will kill myself. Architecture is the only thing I love to work, even if I know i'm not that great at it. If I'm going to commit suicide atleast everybody will remember me as 'architecture student' which is better than live as a failure. I know that probably everybody in the comment will tell me that 'being a dropout is not the end of the world' but for me is really the end.
(Sorry for my english)
