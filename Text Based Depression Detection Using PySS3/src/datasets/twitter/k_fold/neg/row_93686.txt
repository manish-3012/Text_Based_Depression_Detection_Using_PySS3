Iâ€™m trying everything I can to fit a square peg in a round holeIâ€™m so fucking tired. I meditate, therapy, have relationships, workout/ yoga, try my best to be creative ( comedy). But nothing, nothing seems to work. I just feel like Iâ€™ll never write the joke, hook up with, have a relationship, have the therapy session that makes it click so Iâ€™m not miserable. I just feel like Iâ€™m trying to make something work that just wonâ€™t. Maybe Iâ€™m just not a round peg, maybe thereâ€™s no way to make it better. IDK, maybe Iâ€™m just venting. But Iâ€™m tired of trying to make it better, it just wonâ€™t. Maybe this is just it, and if this is all there is. Pain, misery, a weight I canâ€™t carry. Iâ€™m done. Fuck life
