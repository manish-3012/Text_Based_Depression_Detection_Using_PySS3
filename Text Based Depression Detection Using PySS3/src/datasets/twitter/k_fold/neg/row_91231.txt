brain is too fogged from anxiety to even tell what is real.been trying to find my way. i have some talents, but in times of instagram, your talent is just not enough. Everyone has seen everything and you're just not new. too tired to work on anything, 'cause i know i won't excel past my fellow "instagrammers". Just too tired to live and can't accept to be just another one barely living. Have nothing to add to this brand new world of models and masks. Been wanting to say goodbye for a long time.
