On my better days, I want someone to run me over.I just cut myself. That's usually calming. And it's my second day in a row. I've never done that before. But it's not helping. I don't know what to do. College starts tomorrow and I would rather just hang myself tonight but I can't do that to my mom and my dad. 

I wish no one would notice my absence. That would make it better. I wish I could just disappear. I miss him. I miss everything about him. The way he said beer instead of bear. Ugh. Everything. College starts tomorrow. Yay college! Let's go there and pretend everything is alright. That to get by every night is not a struggle. Let's all pretend to be happy. That's the way to go. Bravo! 
Someone kill me please. There's no use of my existence. All the turtles are dying too.
