Dont see no point in doing this anymore22 years old, been living the same life day in and day out for the last 8 years, waking up eating and going back to bed, playing video games and listening to music, over and over again. Never finished high school, never had a job, a few one night stands but never a real relationship, had a troubled childhood and i remember thinking it would all work out and i would be happy someday but that day never comes, last 2 years been thinking heavily about ending my own life because i just dont see any meaning in living like this, if you could even call it living. Just wanted to spill my feelings for somebody to read, peace out.
