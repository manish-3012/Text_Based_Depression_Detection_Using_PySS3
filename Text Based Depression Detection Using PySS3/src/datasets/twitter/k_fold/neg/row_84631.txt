There's nothing for mei am 17 and I have nothing going for me, I'm dark I'm ugly im hairy I'm a girl I have low grades and even then I will never be able to pay for college so this is the end of the line for me. I don't want to live to se next years sorrow of being rejected from every college I apply to. I have no friends. My mom wishes she'd gotten an abortion and she yells it at me every time she gets the least bit anhry. Then she beats me. I told her I am going to kill myself and she said go ahead. I feel so pathetic I never had a chance at life.
