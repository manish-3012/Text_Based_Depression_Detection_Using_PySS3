LaylaI wish we still be friend at the end of the summer, I know its hard for you to deal with all the things going on in ur life, but please stop pushing me away and realize that I love you a lot and will always be there for you Layla 

Please donâ€™t kill yourself, Iâ€™m scared for you every seconds of every hours, your life is so precious and I hope youâ€™ll be okay. I know life is hard but you have always been so strong Layla, you were my rolemodel for many years and now you are my best friend and my inspiration everyday Layla. 

All I do, I do it for you. Please, stay with me, stay with life, you are important for us Layla :(

Iâ€™m scared. I wish Iâ€™d never have to post here that youâ€™re gone Layla
