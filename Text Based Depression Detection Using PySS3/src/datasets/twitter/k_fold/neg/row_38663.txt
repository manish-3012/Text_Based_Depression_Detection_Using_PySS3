Suicidal because gambling took it allFeeling worse then ever.3rd time gambled this year..

How family can trust me? They cant.I have new solutions to overcome this and be more "safe", but i dont want to spread pain again.

They can get heart attack cause of me.Im serious.. I just did this like 1 months, gambled too and they felt sick.

And again in this shit.You cant imagine how much you destroy other overs this addiction.

They should give up on me, gave me too many chances.I can pick additional work for weekends, im in debt 11500 and i would got 1600 additionally so after 8 months i can pay it back

I wrote suicide note too, i dont know how to stay alive
