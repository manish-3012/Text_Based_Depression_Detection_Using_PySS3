I'm at my wits end.I figured I'd come here to get everything out, seeing as I have pretty much nowhere else to turn at the moment. Everything just sort of piled up onto to each other and I don't feel like it's worth continuing, life just doesn't have any appeal to me right now.

It feels like the older I get, the worse I get handed. I was physically, mentally, and sexually abused for most of my childhood/adolescence and I just can't get over it. This has caused me to develop severe problems with depression, anxiety, and self-worth issues. 
I can't keep a steady relationship with anyone because I'm constantly questioning their every move. 
Last night my boyfriend broke up with me, and if that wasn't enough, he finally told me he actually loved me but just couldn't be with me now. So I'm left here wondering what I did wrong, what did I do to make someone who says they care about me just leave.

On top of my own issues with myself and everyone around me is school. I'm about to finish my Sophomore year in university and just can't deal with it anymore.  I haven't been able to keep up my grades and they just keep getting worse and worse. I can't even sit in my classes without having to leave because of frequent panic attacks. 
I'm in physical pain about 90 percent of the time. I have a number a things wrong with my body and medicine isn't working anymore. I just can't take the pain anymore. I figure if I'm going to be weak and sick for the rest of however long I have, that it'd just be easier to end things now.

I just don't know what to do with myself anymore, nothing seems to work to make me feel better. I'm so tired of what has been given to me. I know there are millions of people who have it worse than me, but ending it seems like such an easy option right now. I know suicide seems selfish, but I can't help but think that this is what I should do.
