I just want to give up and die!Iâ€™m tired on waiting all the time for things to change! Iâ€™ve been waiting all my life and all I get is hate and misery. Iâ€™ve tried to reach out, but it doesnâ€™t work, my parents get angry at me when I start to vent and think Iâ€™m a bad influence on my stepsisters. Iâ€™m left all alone here on my bed wishing I was fucking dead, I have so many fucking responsibilities and my mental and physical health is trash. I just want to give up and die and not have to deal with this anymore.
