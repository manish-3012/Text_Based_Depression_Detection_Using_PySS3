16M, I cant do this anymore, I need helpIâ€™m 16M and Gay, I canâ€™t do life anymore I have too much stress. I canâ€™t get help because that means I would have to come out which I donâ€™t want to do. I have too much stress with school and I have to play an instrument in an orchestra which I hate doing but I canâ€™t stop or Iâ€™d be stabbing people in the back. I have extreme anxiety and recently Iâ€™ve been hitting all new lows. I donâ€™t think very many people even care. How do I end it all.
