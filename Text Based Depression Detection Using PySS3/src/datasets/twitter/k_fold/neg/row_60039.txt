I have a question about lovemaybe this is the wrong place to put it, but i am suicidal, from a lot of things, but a lot from people that i thought i loved running away from me. My question is... is sex the best when you lose your virginity? is sex only good with the first person you have it with? could you fall in love 100o times, get heartbroken 1000 times, and then finally find the right girl? idk my wording is so bad :(
