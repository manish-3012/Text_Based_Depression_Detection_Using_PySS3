I need a miracle.I feel like my life has basically been over for years now. I started going to Smash Bros tournaments but now I'm not too sure I want to go anymore. I feel so unmotivated to do anything anymore. I want to go to bed but there's stuff in my bed I don't feel like moving. There's a lot of homework I don't want to do. I know my career is going to be shit because of my shitty grades. I have a GPA of about 1.8. I've been thinking about suicide for 6 years now and it's been a horrible fight. I want to die but I don't even feel motivated to. I'm scared of the pain. I'll chicken out and be in a worse state than I am now. I've asked around online before on why I shouldn't die. Nothing seems to change my views. No matter how many flattering and motivating comments, I don't feel any happier. I feel like the same, miserable human being. I need a miracle. What should I do?
