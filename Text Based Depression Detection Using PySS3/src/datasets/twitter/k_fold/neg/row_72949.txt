I might have to kill myself toniteI am homeless and hungry right now. I need some money (just a bit) to get food and a pay a motel (there are no homeless shelters where I live). I have no family to help me and I'm scared. I haven't been able to afford my meds because I've been spending my disability money on food. Now I have nothing to eat or nowhere to stay. If I don't get help I might have to end it. I can't live like this.
