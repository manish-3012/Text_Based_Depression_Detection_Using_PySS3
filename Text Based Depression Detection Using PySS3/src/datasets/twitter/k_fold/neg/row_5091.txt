AdviceI am 32. I have schizophrenia. I am not currently psychotic. I have insight. I know the voices are artifacts and misfiring neurotransmitters in my brain. I have had this diagnoses since I was 20 or 21. For over a decade I have been medicated and tried therapy. I have been hospitalized ten times or more. I know this illness will never go away. My maintenance phases get shorter. My last break was bad. My next break might see me on the street and I may never come back from it. The idea of fighting this for another 20 or 30 or 40 years or spending that amount of time drifting in and out of psychosis while on the street is frightening. I would tell someone on my care team but they would instantly pink slip me and I would spend 72 hours pretending to care about group therapy in a psychiatric ward and talk to a doctor for a total of five minutes before they released me. It is all about liability here. If anyone can give me an objective, logical reason why I should continue to exist I will not kill myself. Not "things can always improve" or "you need to adjust your meds". Something concrete. I have already tried so many permutations of medications and therapies that I have lost faith in those things. I am planning on killing myself within 24 or 48 hours using a method with a 90-95% lethality rate if I cannot find an anchor. Reddit is pathetically my last chance.
