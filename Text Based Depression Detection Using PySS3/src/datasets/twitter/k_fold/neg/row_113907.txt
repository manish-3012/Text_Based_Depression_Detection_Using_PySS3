I can't live anymoreWill turn 22 in a week, could not get a job through campus placement. Got rejected by many companies in various rounds. My family expected a lot from me. I expected more from me, but wasted time and can't get a job. I think of myself as a big loser. All day I am inside my hostel room depressed. I don't have any friends. In 5 months I will graduate, most probably without any job. I don't think I should live anymore. I am not interested in my graduation branch, but can't get any job in another sector. I consider myself a waste. I have failed everyone. Today also I got a rejection. I am crying always inside. Feels like I can't make it to my next birthday. Most of my friends got a job.
