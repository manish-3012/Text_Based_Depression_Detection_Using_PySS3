Gambled everything, if i win i live, if i lose i die.Today I've had enough and decided to tempt fate and let it decide whether my life is worth living or not. I am in debt, fed up with my life and the people around me, fed up of constantly having to work and spend money to change my looks just so society and women will accept and appreciate me. I am wired on Sertraline and feel exhausted all the time. I am depressed with this horrible society we live in. I was thinking of ending it all but thought why not take a gamble. So here we go. All my money on Dominic Thiem to win his tennis match tomorrow. If he doesn't well, it's the end for me. If he does, I might stick around a while longer and enjoy the new money I'll have made. I mean I have no job anyway and trying to get one these days is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. The ones that are available are just depressing and boring. So let's wait and see what happens and let fate determine whether my life is worthwhile or was just all for nothing...

HE WON. TODAY IS A GOOD DAY FOR ME. Light is at the end of the tunnel.
Also I wouldn't advise anyone else doing this. In hindsight it was foolish and he very nearly lost.
