No idea what to do.I'm 19. I'm trans. And I've just pretty much given up. I'm too scared to get help from psychiatrists, whether it be with depression, anxiety, or any other sort of thing I need. I've felt rather depressed the last like 3 years, and had various anxiety attacks for as long... And been feeling transgender for as long as well. But now, today, I don't feel like it's worth fighting anymore... I've just given up. I'd cry if i could, but i can't. I just want to sit here. Do nothing. Be no one. Just like it feels like I've always been. I don't deserve to live. I've done nothing good in my life.
