Scared at how suicidal I have become and know I need help, but worried about repercussions of looking for help. Two years ago I was in a bad spot. I now relies I was dealing with PTSD at the time, but was never diagnosed. I became super suicidal and had six failed attempts. After the sixth attempt and failure I hit rock bottom and asked for help. I got my mother to drive me to emergency and I proceeded to tell them how low I was feeling and how failing in my attempts to kill myself was only making things worse - yet another thing I was screwing up in life. They gave me the option of becoming an inpaitent or an outpatient and my stupid pride made me choose outpatient. I see now i likely would have benefited tremendously from time spent in the hospital where I would have had more hands on treatment. Two years have past since this time and I have been stifling my continuing suicidal thoughts. I would think of offing myself at least once a day, but it would come and go quickly and I was able to more or less function okay. Recently the suicidal thoughts have become much stronger and longer lasting. I spend most of my days loathing my very existence and while I am mostly sure I wont act on these feelings, there is a part of me that worries I will. I want help. I dont want to die, I want the pain of depression and self-hate to end, but death seems like the only true relief. I have to talk myself out of calling 911 on a nightly basis because my feelings are so strong I worry I will act, but stop myself because of the shame and stigma of mental illness. It is as though getting the help I really do need is a form of defeat and yet more failure and really...I cant stomach any more feelings of failure...which just turns the cycle of wanting to just end it all as a means of escape all over again. I am an educated woman, I know mental illness and depression are real things, that there is nothing wrong in asking for help, if anything it is a good sign - I know these things rationally speaking, but it is not my rational side that seems to be winning. I am super close to calling 911 again tonight, this time I am the closest I have been to going through with it. The dial tone is what scares me most, it represents giving in and ending life as I know it, because once I am admitted nothing will ever be the same.
