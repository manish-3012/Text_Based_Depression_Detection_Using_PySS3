I give up, but I don't want to die.(19F, diagnosed with autism, ADHD, and anxiety) I do not know where to start, but I used to be happy when I was a child. But ever since I became  aware about what the media was talking about, my anxiety got worse, and by the time I was 12 years old, I was too scared to even go outside. And this anxiety had gotten worse by the time that I finished 11th grade, as now I was too scared to even leave my own house. In addition, I have not had a single friend ever since the end of my 8th grade year. I have tried internet friendships, but they only last less than six months. So at this very moment, I am left with no one to talk to. I started going to a special school for people with autism on Tuesday, but my classmates are more "developed" than me. They already are comfortable with going out in the community, while I am always refusing. I am afraid that it will be too late by the time that I want to be their friend, because I fear that all of my classmates will be graduating this year due to their maturity, as I stay for another year. After each school day, I either feel super stressed or am crying. And I literally have no coping skills. I try playing video games, but I continue having unwanted thoughts. And due to my lack of coping skills, I continue to panic when the little kids of my school make any noises, as I feel as if those noises are all gunshots.

I also have issues with my own family. My mom and dad had a major argument over five or so months ago, and I feel as if it traumatized me. Ever since that argument, my father brings up divorce and leaving the house more often. I am not even close to my siblings as well. My brother was constantly annoying me, but he left for college last week, and I do not have his contact information. As a result, it is too late to mend our relationship. My sister and I are not close either. And guess what? I do not have her contact information as well. (Despite the fact that she is still living with me and my family) I frequently lash out at my dad and mom, and it makes them very angry. My dad sometimes calls me a bitch and my mother sometimes says that she doesn't know what to do with me.

I fear that I have some issues that have been undiagnosed, like agoraphobia or depression. The only problem is, I never get what I want when I go see my therapist or my doctor. All I want is a new diagnosis, but they won't give me one. I am afraid that if I don't get diagnosed with something new, I will have a severe mental breakdown and will be forced to leave my home. And this would just make me worse.

To end this all off, I just want to state that I do fear dying, but I do but do not want to kill myself. I just want to get better.
