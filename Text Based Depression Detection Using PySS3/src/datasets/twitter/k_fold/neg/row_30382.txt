Is feeling suicidal weak ?I really need to know for my self-esteem , I was suicidal since I was 9 or 10 , I'm 17. Yes I know it seems like I'm just seeking attention but I have never told anyone in real life that I wanted to kill myself , or that I have tried countless of times just to end myself but I just couldn't , it frustrates me that I can't kill myself and it also frustrates me that I want to kill myself. I feel so weak whenever I think of killing myself and it is just making me feel weaker everyday. How do I stop wanting to kill myself or if you have a better answer , how do I just stop being afraid of killing myself ? I really can't take this anymore , I feel like I am going to break down and just explode or something , my head hurts everyday no matter how many painkillers I take , I can't go to sleep at night just cause I wish I could just lay down and sleep forever. Sorry to burden the people reading this I know it doesn't matter to you guys , I just want some answers.
