I can't do this anymore.Everything is so wrong. Everything. 
My grandfather passed away two days ago because of heart failure during a surgery to repair a stint. My so called boyfriend demands that I have cheated on him when I haven't. He told me tonight that if I don't tell him I cheated he will leave me. 
I also am 80% sure I'm pregnant. I do not want to raise a child when I cannot even take care of myself. I have been contemplating killing myself for days now, and this.....I can't do this anymore. I've attempted suicide many anytime before and this time I am determined to die. No taking pills so someone can find me in a few hours and take me to the hospital. My father has a pistol. It is loaded and sitting at the end of my bed. Part of me wants to stay alive and give this possible child all the love I can.
But I'm just not that strong. I've never been that strong and I never will be.
Help me....please...
