When I see people in groups or couples laughing and enjoying life I have a mental breakdown.I am completely alone in this world. It's been so long since I had someone in my life that I wouldn't even know how to start meeting new people. During my time of isolation I have lost all my social skills and ability to connect with others. I don't even feel human. I feel like I am an object in the background like a bench or tree. 

When I see people in groups or couples laughing and enjoying life I have a mental breakdown. All I ever wanted was to be a normal person with a normal life. When I see others living the life I never had my mind starts rejecting reality. I avoid going out in public as much as I can these days. I can't live like this anymore.
