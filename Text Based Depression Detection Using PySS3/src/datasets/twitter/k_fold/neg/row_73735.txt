All I ever wanted was to be touchedAll I want, all I ever wanted, for years, is to be touched.

Why is that too much?  Some people drive their boats into larger boats. Some people rule parts of the world. Some have orgies every night. Most have lovers and friends.

All I want is to be touched. Why is that so much to ask?  Why is that too much? Humans are animals until its convenient; humans only use their brains when itâ€™s to fuck another person over, otherwise itâ€™s just touch-go, touch-go, donâ€™t think about it, just feel. Just feel. Turn that brain off and feel. I donâ€™t like this feeling, that of exclusion, of worthlessness, of working out to the point where I pass out only to be told I should have been tall. I should have been born with a nice penis, I should have been born with a better voice. I should never have been born.

â€œDonâ€™t live for others,â€ weâ€™re a social species, thanks for the myopic reply. I lived for myself and all I ever wanted was to be touched. The brain atrophies without touch. At this point, I can do nothing but hate. Women donâ€™t care about brains, they say they do, because it would be so incredibly uncouth to say otherwise, but look at what they respond to in reality. They just want to have sex with the largest animal possible; women in Japan this summer were getting off to a fucking gorilla.

I just want to be touched and Iâ€™ve slowly evolved from a social progressive hippie into someone who only feels hatred when I feel at all. I understand why some societies condemn sex: because it isnâ€™t equal, and because it doesnâ€™t follow any sort of morality. I hear sexuality is amoral; if sexuality is amoral, then there are no morals at all, for all morals are manmade. So if the women and men around me donâ€™t believe in morals, and if morals arenâ€™t real, then society isnâ€™t real either, and laws are only made to be broken. There is nothing good because thatâ€™s what you all want, isnâ€™t it?  You want to be ruled by bodies, not minds. You want to feel, not think. You want to be, not do. I donâ€™t understand you, and I will eventually have to kill myself because itâ€™s your world, not mine, no matter what I do, no matter what I want, no matter what I push. I just ask you, one question?  Why was being touched too much? I am probably in better shape than you, only because I woke up earlier, and worked harder every day. It did nothing, because thatâ€™s all a lie we make to justify the state of the world, but in justifying the state of the world, we endorse poverty, war, genocide, slavery, cuckoldry, and all those wonderful things that humans do daily.

Why is it too much to ask to be touched? Iâ€™ve already lost a year, because no one will answer this fucking question? Why is it too much to be touched? Do I have to ask this question for the rest of my natural life to get a response? Why do I have to kill myself because the human brain needs intimacy and touch, and not a single woman on this planet will give this to me, but they will give it to serial killers, gorillas, horses, and rapists. Why? I donâ€™t want to die, but the rest of my natural life is nothing and I can not live without touch.

PLEASE SOMEONE TOUCH ME.  I AM NOT A MONSTER I DO NOT HAVE DISEASES. PLEASE I DO NOT WANT TO KILL MYSELF BUT I AM CONDEMNED TO A BEDROOM UNTIL I DO BECAUSE I CAN NOT FUNCTION IN A SOCIETY WHEN I DO NOT EVEN GET TOUCH. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN CONFIRMS THIS. I AM TRAPPED AND I NEED ANOTHER PERSON TO GET ME OUT. IF I COULD TOUCH MYSELF I WOULD, BUT THIS INVOLVES ANOTHER PERSON, AND OF 8 BILLION OF YOU, NOT FUCKING ONE COULD BE ASSED. FUCK YOU. I GAVE SO MUCH ONLY TO GET NOTHING BUT SLANDER AND HATE IN RETURN. THIS SPECIES IS EVIL, IT IS.
