Being ghosted by my best friend. I'm worried about both of us.(Just for some back story, we are only 16, we went to the same school but we are leaving to go to different colleagues this year and she is moving 3hrs away).

It's hard to come to terms with the fact that she probably doesn't want to be friends anymore. Before this I'd say that she was my best friend and while everyone else started making new friends and connections I always stuck by her. Now I feel so lonely. Yea I have a few other friends but I don't think I will ever be as comfortable around them as I was with her ya know. Like we had so many inside jokes and we could chat for hours. But now I feel like she doesn't care. Besides if she can drop me so easily, it wouldn't be any harder for them to ditch me too.

I always knew she wanted to be that girl. The girl who parties, does drugs, is popular, has many friends and who always has a bf. For the past year we have just watched her change and during these last months alone we barely talk and it's awkward. I get it that people change but this is just weird.

The thing is I know I'm not being dramatic or picky. Last night my other friend (who also used to be close to her) was complaining about how she never bothers to talk to us, how she is using her bf for sex and how desperate she is to become a druggie. She glorifies that whole life style and we don't know why. Her parents are lovely (yes they are a lil but strict but when compared to my parents they are angels), she has money and she is attractive. But she just wants to rebel. I cringe at it so hard.

Idk, maybe because she is moving so she sees no point in keeping in contact. But she was the last person who I thought would do something like that. It really hurts, it's as if these last years didn't matter. The main reason to why I'm still here today was because I had a friend like her around. Although I never told her about my depression and suicidal thoughts she knew I was struggling mentally so she always stayed by my side. But now I feel like the only reason to why she stayed with me during school was because she just felt sorry for me. I used to be so awkward to be around, I'm glad that I'm not like that anymore. But other than that there wasn't many other reasons for her to be my best friend.

It's hard to pin point whether she is ghosting us because she wants to leave this life behind or because she never liked us that much in the first place. I've known her for so long so I know when she does a fake laugh... and she does it a lot when we are in a group.
 
I just feel so alone and I know this sounds bad but I genuinely can't see a future for myself (not to say that's her fault). I wish things were different.
