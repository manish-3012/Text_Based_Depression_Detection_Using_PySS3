Life doesnt seem to get any betterI was fucking miserable all througout high school, It got so bad to the point where I just didnt show up anymore. Luckily got into a university, however I still had to stay home with my parents since its more of a commuter school.  Despite wanting to get a second chance and have a new start somewhere, i figured living with parents wont be as bad since i still had the pontenial campus social life. However online classes made everything worse and now I've been literally stuck in the house for nearly a year. I have no friends, no goals or dreams, im just passive day by day and i want it to end
