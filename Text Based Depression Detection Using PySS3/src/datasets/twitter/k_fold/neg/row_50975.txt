CrossroadsI've thought about suicide for a while. I've methodically planned multiple ways for me to snuff out this miserable existance. But I've just been waiting for something to break and give me a reason. So, I'd given up on trying to talk to anyone and the one time I do, it's awesome. Even though it was only one date, she gave me a glimmer of hope. But now my issue is that I've been divided whether to go for her and try to obtain a better life, leave everything behind and try somewhere new, or just end it and enjoy death. Being an analytical thinker, I've thought all my options through and leaving or killing myself would be the easiest (of course). But just knowing that there's a chance this person could cause a different fate means that it may be worth a try. I also don't want to psychologically tie my will to live to a relationship because I think that's illogical. And it was the same $ that I had tucked away for one of my methods of death that paid for the date. Idk, I think I'll give it a week and by then I'll decide my finalÃ©.
