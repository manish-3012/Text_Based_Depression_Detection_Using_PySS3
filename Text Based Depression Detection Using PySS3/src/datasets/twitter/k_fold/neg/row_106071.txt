DefeatedI'm thirty years old. I dropped out of college when I was 22, joined the military for 6 years, and here I am back in college, trying it again. Except this time something seems undeniable: I'm not intelligent enough, I can't handle emotions, I can't admit to emotions. I'm completely lost, and I have no desire to go to class or do any school work. I just recently came to terms with my sexuality and I've told a few people, including my therapist. I'm currently taking anti-depressants, doesn't seem to be helping, but increasing the dosage to see if that does something (so far it hasn't). I've always thought that I was going to kill myself, now it seems clear that it's the right step for me. It makes me feel satisfied to know this, it's the only logical solution for me right now. There's just too much to change. I have no real friends and my family members can't stand me. I've tried reaching out to friends, but I've been ignored. I tried talking to my brother but he avoids me. Next time I go into therapy I'm going to admit to having suicidal thoughts (I've lied about it up to this point), but I don't think this will change anything.
