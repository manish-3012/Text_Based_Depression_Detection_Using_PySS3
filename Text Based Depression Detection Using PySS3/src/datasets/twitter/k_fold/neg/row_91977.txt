Is my life mine to take?I want to die, to the point where I've become obsessed with my own suicide. I have everything planned and ready but i can't seem to do it, despite the pain I'm in.

I have a decent enough support group and people who love me; this is my biggest hurdle. Once I'm gone, there will be even more pain but I'd have passed it on to the people who care for me. The rope hangs my family, the pills kill my friends. 

I've spoken to therapists and taken all the meds. The only time i feel at ease is when I'm contemplating my death. The only thing in my life that feels certain is that i can take it, but i can't.

I think i know the answer to the question, i just needed to get that off my chest.
