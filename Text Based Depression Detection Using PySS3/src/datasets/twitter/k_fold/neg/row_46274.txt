Catastrophising but if uni goes to shit, I can't go back home.I'm 0% independent and I'm really struggling right now and my partner looks after me but if we broke up (which is a bigger threat now than before but probably be OK) I'll probably just fail uni and just not do anything adulty.
Sure if everything goes to shit people drop out and go home but, my family is abusive. I'd probably kill myself. I fear I'd have to leave in the streets?

Lmao love being disabled.
