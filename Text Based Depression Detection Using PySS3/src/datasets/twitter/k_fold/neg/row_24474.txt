Sorry to bother youI don't usually do things like this but I just want to get this all down because I don't know where else to say it. The only reason I'm alive is because my father raised me with the belief that only selfish people kill themselves and he made me terrified to be selfish. 

I tried to kill myself once in college. I got really drunk and took a bottle of sleeping pills. I hadn't slept in days and I was just desperate for sleep. It was only when I woke up in the morning that I realized what I'd done and I was so sad that I was still alive. 

I have a loving family, good friends, and wonderful partners. But I live away from all of them. I hate where I live but I'm about 30 minutes away from my partners. I'd love to live with my boyfriend but he doesn't want me to. So I pay $1400 per month for an apartment I hate with two roommates who stopped liking me when they found out I was polyamorous. They think it's gross and now they gossip about me having diseases. I'm barely making enough for rent and I've been trying to find a new place to live that costs less but all are in scary areas. I'm heartbroken that the man that I'm living in this stupid city for won't take me in although I'm also aware of how selfish that makes me and that makes me hate myself. 

I had a job I hated so I left and now I do freelance, working 10 or more hours per day just to try to make ends meet. I'm constantly sad and tired and I feel like, with every day the same, I'm just not sure what I'm still around for. I'm failing at everything anyways. If I'm failing at life, why should I keep going? And then I remember that I'd be selfish to kill myself so I just cry every morning and every night. I miss my family and I miss my best friends and I want to feel at home in a place for once for the first time in years. Just once. I'm so tired.
