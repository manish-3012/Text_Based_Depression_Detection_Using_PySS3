my childhood best friend left me &amp; iâ€™m on suicide watch.
We basically grew up together ever since I moved here. I had a terrible childhood. My step father would always drink, call me a bitch &amp; threaten me. My mom never showed that she cared about me or tell me that she loves me, etc. 
Importantly, my ex best friend is why I am still alive today. 
She would come over and try to cheer me up when I would be crying, wanting to attempt. 
When time passed, things started to become weird because I started getting into relationships. 
Slowly everything became distant. 
She still tried to hang out with me but she wouldnâ€™t engage in conversations anymore or even try. 
It was like she was uninterested in me. 
I think I made her believe that she wasnâ€™t important to me.
We had a text argument about this whole situation and she believes that â€œwe were meant for different paths.â€ and said her goodbye. 
It never made sense to me because she chose to go on the different path rather than tell me how she feel. 
It broke me. 
I donâ€™t know what to do with my life anymore. 
I have no friends. I drink everyday, I cut now and I desperately hit myself. 
 I really think I wasnâ€™t good enough for her.  
please help.
