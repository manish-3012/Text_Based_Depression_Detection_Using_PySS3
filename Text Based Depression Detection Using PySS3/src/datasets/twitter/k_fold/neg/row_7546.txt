Having a hard time around friendsI talked to someone for the first time in months about how I have been actually feeling. It didn't make me feel any better. It just made me feel really frustrated and misunderstood. I tried to be careful in choosing someone I thought would be open to listening. It ended up feeling like an interrogation because I wasn't able to articulate what I was thinking and how I was feeling in a way that would help them understand what I was going through. They weren't following anything I was saying so they kept having to ask me what was actually wrong even though I was already trying my best to explain. I don't blame them for me feeling worse afterwards. I think it was just a matter of bad communication on my part.

When I am talking to my friends, I feel very distant from them as a person. Sometimes I like to share small things in my life with them like stuff I'm looking forward to or something that happened that day. I feel like they view them as very trivial things and don't give them much attention. I wish they would listen more intently to what I have to say, because I really like talking to them and would like to share with them things I find exciting. I usually just omit things I want to say because I know it will not garner any response or care.

It feels like everyone there is sitting in a circle in the middle of the room, but my seat is in far corner.
