Naya Rivera DrowningDoes anyone else think that Nayaâ€™s drowning was intentional, and if not intentional, at least reckless-as in, she knew of the possible outcome, but didnâ€™t take any precautions to prevent it? 

Just keep thinking she knew what she was doing. (Her ex committed suicide after being convicted of child porn, 1 of the many occurrences that make me wonder....)
