Real life situations scare me, and Iâ€™d rather die then try to face them.Currently I have to 

* meet with my ex-professors to speak with them about recommendation letters for my new university plans and 
* prepare for job interviews to find a job parallel to the first task/project (I have never worked in my life before).

But whenever I think about doing anything about those things I get very demotivated, to a degree of not wanting to do anything at all â€” just lie somewhere and be motionless, wanting to disappear. 

In fact any notion about these two activities makes me so uncomfortable that more and more often I incline towards the radical decision of shutting my brain down altogether.

I have living parents and grandparents now, and I don't want to kill myself because I know how bad are my GPs at coping with relative loss situations (even with remote relatives). I am inclining towards a â€œplanâ€ of faking a life up till they peacefully leave this world and then committing suicide myself. That â€œplanâ€ had been steadily developing in my head and gaining momentum for 4-6 years by now, and I think Iâ€™ll not be able to change my life scenario to anything better then that any more.

**I want to know** if someone was in a similar situation before and if yes, how did you manage to get out of it?
