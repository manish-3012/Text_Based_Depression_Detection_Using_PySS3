My first and maybe last postI'm thinking about killing myself this Saturday. Me and a few college friends are planning on going hiking to a mountain with a steep drop. I'm so tired of it all. I've been thinking about it for a long time now. I don't want to upset my family by killing myself at home so I figured I'd jump off somewhere my family doesn't frequent. I feel bad for my friends and family but I just can't do it anymore. I just hope they'll be better off without me.
