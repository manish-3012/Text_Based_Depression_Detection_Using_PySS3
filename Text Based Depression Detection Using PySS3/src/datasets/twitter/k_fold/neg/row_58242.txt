Iâ€™m brokenIâ€™m so sad. Iâ€™m so very sad.
Iâ€™m sitting in my bed crying right now. Iâ€™ve been so sad for months, almost a year, and have wanted to die for a while now. Itâ€™s almost been a year since one of our family friends died from cancer at age 18. That broke something inside of me. Everything hurts. Iâ€™m in so much pain. The only boy Iâ€™ve ever loved wants nothing to do with me, my best friend seems like the only person who even cares a tiny bit, but I donâ€™t want to live for other people anymore. I want to be selfish for once. I want to end my life.
