Barely keeping myself from doing somethingI've been diagnosed with clinical depression and panic disorder and even though I've been on meds for a couple of months now, the progress is so slow that it often seems almost nonexistand and gets burried under all the things that worry me and I'm constantly tired and stressed out over everything. I'm tired of people saying "well, don't think about it!1!" and etc., you know, the usual, and even though I seem smiley and okay, every day I have these lingering thoughts of "I want to die. I just want to die." They are in the depths of my mind constantly, no matter what I do, and I just can't keep on going like this.
