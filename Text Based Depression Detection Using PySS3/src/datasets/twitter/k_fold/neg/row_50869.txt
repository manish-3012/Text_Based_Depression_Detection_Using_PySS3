Just venting not in immediate dangerI'm suicidal right now. I don't want to be suicidal but I can't get my brain to listen to reason.  My partner told me to tell them when I feel like this but I'm terrified of being a burden.  

It's passive suicidal ideation but it's still screwing my brain up. I'm more afraid at this point that I'll try to self harm.  

Sorry for the ramblyness I just needed a place to vent.
