There is a dog I really miss and it hurts so much.My last memory of it is my grandpa beating it up. Her name was Goza and we only spent less than a week together yet it felt line we had known each other for years. My grandpa dumped her just like most of his dogs. It's been 7 years. I desperately want to know where she is and whether she's okey but I never will. I hope she is okey and if she isn't, I hope she had a peaceful death.
