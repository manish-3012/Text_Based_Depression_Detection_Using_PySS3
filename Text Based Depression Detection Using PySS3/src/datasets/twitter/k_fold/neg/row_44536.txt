I'm only 17 and I fucked up.Hi. I've been struggling with cocaine addiction for about 4 months, and meth addiction for 2. I find myself breaking all the rules I set so that I don't get addicted, and at this point I'm using about every other day, and I can't get the fucking needle off my mind. I tried to kill myself December 21st and left my family disappointed in me and with debt from the hospital bills. I just can't fucking do it anymore. 

If i were to go to my family with my drug issues i would probably just get more disappointment and anger. i have a gun and no more will to try. please, what the fuck do i do now?
