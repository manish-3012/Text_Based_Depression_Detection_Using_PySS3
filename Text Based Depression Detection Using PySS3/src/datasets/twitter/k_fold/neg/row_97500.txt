I keep pushing back the dateI set a date for this year but then a lot of family stuff happened and I used it as an excuse to push back month by month.
I reset the date for next year so that I have time to put as many things in place as I can and have a few "lasts". I fluctuate between worrying that I won't make it until I have sorted everything out to worrying that I will find a reason to delay again.  Sometimes the need to die is so strong that I can barely breathe.  I am holding on but only just, I am so tired and just need to die.
