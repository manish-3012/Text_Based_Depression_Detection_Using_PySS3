I lost all my hopeI just got back 2 of my accounting exams scores today and I failed miserably. I thought about whether to major in accounting some time ago, but I convinced myself that I should because I really liked it. However, the reality has proven me wrong. Now I've lost the courage to continue studying and don't feels like living any more. I really see no meaning at trying any harder.
