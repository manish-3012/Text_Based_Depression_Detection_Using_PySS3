Edging closer towards suicideBeen trying to post this for a while. Ive not done so before as i had no idea how to even explain my situauion. It's probably going to be a long post so feel free to read or not read it. I guess it's my way of just getting it off my chest before it inevitably goes down this year.

So I'm 24 and currently a second year at university and I'm pretty much ready to follow through with my plans to commit suicide (I've had these plans for about five years but I've been thinking about it for longer than that). I tried to last year just before the second year began but I ended up not going through with it because, the few people I told wouldn't let me leave the house (besides for uni) and I knew if it didn't work I'd never get a chance to do try again as I'd be paralysed for the rest of the time my body keeps me alive.

The thing is I have nothing to complain about (so I feel like an ass for posting here where people have actual problems), no real reason (other than I just want to be dead) to want to commit suicide. I'm not good looking but I have a supportive family, great friends and I made it through the first semester of the second year of my course (which usually cuts the class size very intensly due to its difficulty and did so). 

Despite all of that I don't want to be here, I've never wanted to be alive (and unlike with terms and conditions I didn't have a choice in being born). I've tried therapy (counselling which Ive just cancelled and CBT), medications, exercise, being more social, going on dates etc and nothings worked or if it did it worked for briefest of moments, then just leads to more pain. I spend time with my friends and family or programming, gaming etc and I enjoy it in the moment but as soon as it's over I'm immediately back to thinking about when I should just take the risk of suicide.

As of the last month I've been hovering almost every day/night over the option of buying a coach ticket to head to the place where I plan to attempt ending my life, but the fear of it not working is holding me back. I just want it to all be over but it never is. I go to bed hoping that I don't wake up or if I do for things to just feel better, to have the passion and the energy I once had. But I'm exhausted and sick of this never ending nightmare and even though I'm surrounded by all these people, I still feel alone, I always have and always will. I genuinely have no idea what to even do anymore other than to wait until I snap and go through with it.
