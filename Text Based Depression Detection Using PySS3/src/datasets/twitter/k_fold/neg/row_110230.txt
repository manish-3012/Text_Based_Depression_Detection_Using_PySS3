Feeling like I'm on a slippery slope again, unsure of what to doHonestly don't even know how to begin. I'm in a pretty crap situation at the moment, but I'll sum up my backstory as briefly as I can. 

22 years old, lost my mum to cancer when I was 10. Got bullied for "having a dead mum" until I was 13, and was almost killed by a bully for defending some asian/disabled kids from him and his friends at 16. I've had 6 relationships (if you can even call them that), 3 with girls who were using me (for money or to make someone else jealous), 2 which I had to break off as they were long distance and they couldn't work, and 1 I found out I was just a guy on the side for a secretly married woman. Due to my depression and anxiety peaking towards the end of school, I botched my A-Level/University entry exams and ruined my plans for the future. Ended up doing terrible retail work as a fallback, until my dad and his new wife decided to move across the country away from my friends and childhood home. 

More recently, I had another retail job that (long story short) was a major contributing factor amongst others in making me suicidal. I finished a shitty day at work and knew my dad and his wife wanted to yell at me about something minor when I got back, so I broke down in tears on the walk home. Stood crying in the rain contemplating jumping out into oncoming traffic, and also holding back to call Samaritans on my phone. In the end I fell back to sit on the grass and cry because I couldn't bring myself to do either. I ended up going home and accepted getting yelled at for an hour, and slowly returned to some semblance of "normalcy". 

Now it's a couple months later, and I was doing better. I'm now on a personal development course instead of just being unemployed, and I began to get back into some kind of routine. But things are all going wrong at once, and I don't know how to handle it. My dad decided electrical devices shouldn't be on at night, and has switched the plug sockets for radio controlled ones that ensure he and his wife are the only ones who can allow me to have electricity in my room. 

Not only does this mean I can't have my fan on(that helps subvert my mild tinnitus when I try to sleep), but also means that my new step mother can take the remote that enables my electricity with her to work, ensuring I can't use my devices until she gets back. My two remaining friends are always extremely unresponsive although are practically never busy, and they know my past and present situations well (I don't expect them to always be there for me, I don't want to be a burden, but it'd be nice to not feel completely alone every once in a while you know?). 

I met a girl on this development course who is beautiful. Honestly she has her imperfections which is kind of a massive plus for me (I'm hardly perfect, and it helps counter my low self-esteem), but she has a great personality and is into everything I am into. Comics, games, anime, heck she even writes short stories and fan fiction (the interesting kind, not the purely slash fiction kind) that is eerily similar to the Marvel Superman series I've written. She's shown interest repeatedly, always looking over at me before blushing and averting her eyes when I glance back. She hugged me for comfort and reassurance when she was about to try and conquer her fear of heights on a group challenge, and once more when she did it. We had to navigate a narrow cave in pitch black Co conditions, and she opted to hold my hand the entire way instead of grabbing my shoulder as was instructed by the group leader. She's always praising me and asking my opinion on matters, so I guess overall she's just great and I really like her. But I found out recently she has a boyfriend, and they're supposedly going strong. Really through a wrench in my heart to learn that, and now it's making this course a damn nightmare because I keep misreading signs and switching between being enamoured or cynical because of feeling enamoured. All the time I'm distracted around her though. 

Through this course I've improved on personal skills like confidence and leadership, and I really began to realise I wanted to find a career involving my passion of writing. I got excited for it, as finally I had something I was good at and loved. But now I've realised, I can't do anything with it. I'm not going to be able to write a novel and have it become a bestseller or even successful enough to pay my bills with. I don't have the experience to join a magazine or newspaper company. I had so many aspirations, but I've realised they don't matter. My dad told me that no matter what it entails, the first job offer/opportunity I get at the end of this course is what I have to take. It doesn't matter if I'm not interested in the role or comfortable with the tasks I'd have to perform, it's a paying job and that's all that matters. The idea of taking a couple of weeks or a month to find a job that better suits my interests and skills is complete nonsense and stupid to contemplate. So now I've got that to look forward to for the rest of this course. 

Then you've got the financial side of things. I quit my job in March due to the previously mentioned suicidal thoughts and anxiety. Since then, I've been using my savings to pay off my phone bill and visit my friends once (anything for a chance to feel like one of the guys again, I guess). Suffice to say I'm in the red at the moment, to the point of having to use what little birthday money I got to pay off my overdraft. The recent phone bills have pushed me back into negative funds, which just makes for a great background feeling of dread and anxiety. 

I have an addiction to caffeine (or more specifically Coca-Cola), which is making me spend whatever change I can find on cans of Coke (or making my irritable and aggressive when not possible). I've been prescribed Mirtazaprine (antidepressant), but they made my mood worsen for months so I impulsively stopped taking them a month back. For one reason or another I'm getting sick a lot more frequently, with the most recent illness keeping me bedridden and coughing to near suffocation for around 2 weeks. 

I'm really sorry for ranting and churning out all this wall of text. It's not something anyone would want to read, heck I don't want to and *I wrote it*. I just really needed to vent, or explain my situation to try find some help or **something**. I don't know what to do about any of this, and I'm getting back into the feeling of uncertainty, anxiety and misery that I felt before the suicidal thoughts kicked in last time. I'm not trying to sound melodramatic or anything, I'm just worried and so... so tired of trying to do all this alone. I get that I'm not *really* alone if I have friends and family, but when my family only ever berates me and ignores my requests for help, and my friends ignore me unless they want to discuss a new game or sexual conquest, it really feels like I am alone. Frankly the only person I *can* talk to is my brother, who is as emotionless and monotone as a robotic Spock who hasn't been programmed with feelings. 

Again, I'm sorry if I rambled. Well, I did. But I really needed to write this out, to help make sense of some of what's going on. If anyone reads this or can give me some help, well that's icing on the cake that I'd definitely appreciate. 

TL;DR Bad past, suicidal thoughts almost acted on in the recent past, future looking bad and present seeming to decline into harmful thought-provoking territory. Wrote this post to vent and clear things up, but help would also be a major benefit to me.
