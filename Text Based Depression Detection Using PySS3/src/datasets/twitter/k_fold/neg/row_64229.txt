All I want is love and affection.All I want is affection. I never got it as a kid and now to be frank. None of my friends how that they care, none of them love me back. Ever since 8th grade I've always wanted a girlfriend, not to be cool, but to experience the raw feeling of being loved and to love. As a Senior, nothing hurts more than to be rejected by the one you truly love and care for to reject and tell you you aren't good enough. This friend I cared for, she told me everything, she was a big part of my thoughts. I hate myself for being so mushy and vulnerable, but I can't escape these feelings and the longer life goes, the larger the desires to be cared for are. My life is beginning to spire down and this is one of the reasons why.

I am pathetic and disgusting for saying this, but the only thing I want is someone to spend time with, a girlfriend. It really hurts to say that and I'm sorry.
