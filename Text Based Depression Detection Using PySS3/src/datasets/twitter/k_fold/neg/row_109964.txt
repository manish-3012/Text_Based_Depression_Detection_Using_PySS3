Iâ€™m ready to goIâ€™m only a junior in high school but Iâ€™m so sick of everything and everyone. I hate myself so much and everyone else hates me. No one ever loves or appreciates me. I always mess things up and can never do anything right. Everything is so stressful and I get no reliever besides weed. Last attempt was in July and Iâ€™m ready for another attempt which will hopefully be the last one
