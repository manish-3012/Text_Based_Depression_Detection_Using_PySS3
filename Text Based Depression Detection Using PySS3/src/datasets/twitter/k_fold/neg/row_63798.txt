Nothing feels worth it anymoreI donâ€™t consider my self to be a very depressed guy but I just so tired of everything I thought that Christmas would cheer me up but it just hasnâ€™t I always love getting into the Christmas spirit but this year I just canâ€™t and I canâ€™t find anything fun or truly enjoyable Iâ€™m constantly in a unhappy state no matter what and i always feel like Iâ€™m tired but I never can go to sleep. I really just feel like nothing Is worth it anymore and I canâ€™t find anyone to help me with it. I am to afraid to seek help from my family because I feel like they wouldnâ€™t really care and would just push it of like Iâ€™m joking and I also donâ€™t even know how I would even bring up to them I would rather just suffer alone until I act upon my impulses.
