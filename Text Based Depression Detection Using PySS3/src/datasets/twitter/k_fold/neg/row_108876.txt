The LaughingHas anyone ever pranked you before?  I have been pranked before.  This guy thought it would be funny to slip me some LSD.  He had done so without my knowledge or consent.  Later that night I was raped.  I never would have had sex with that person had I had been in a right state of mind.  HA HA HA.  The prankster thought it would be funny to put my rape on youtube.  HA HA HA. I found out that everyone in my hometown watched the video and was laughing at me HA HA HA.  Two men came up to me and asked me about it.  I've never heard such a horrible laughter in my entire life HA HA HA. I can still hear them laughing HA HA HA.  After cutting myself 50 times across my chest and intense self-evaluations, I found out that I was absolutely positively straight.  I am a straight male.  HA HA HA HA HAHA HAHAHA. I can take that to a lie detector. HA HA HAAH AHAH AHA HAHAHAHAHA.  But there is only one problem HA HA HAH AH AHAHAHA!  I CAN'T STOP THE LAUGHING!
