I will be killing myself one year from todayToday is my birthday and my life is worthless. Iâ€™m a total loser and Iâ€™m ready to die. I have to wait a year to pay off my debt. One year from today, Iâ€™ll be gone. Iâ€™ve been mistreated my whole life and Iâ€™m tired of it. I no longer care how this will affect my family. For once, Iâ€™m putting myself ahead of everyone else.

One year, thatâ€™s all I have left to get through. Just 365 days...finally something to look forward to.
