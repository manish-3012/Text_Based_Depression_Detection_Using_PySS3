First year teachersecond dayI can't do it I'm scared and I can't handle itSo mcub paperwork and lesson plans I haven't done i know what in doing tomorrow but I do t have it actually written up there's just so much to do and it's never going to be less I'm not strong enough for this and I'm scared and it would be so easy to just kill myself right now I can't handle everything that's going on I cried yesterday I cried today  during lunch I cried all the way home and I've been crying for the last 2 hours I thought I'd finally found what I wants to do I haven't been able to keep a job I went back to school because I thought I wanted to be a teacher but I just don't know now I'm definitely depressed right now everything is foggy I have to to pause for 15 or 20 seconds now and then when I'm talking to gather my thoughts  I'm not enthusiastic at all I have little interest in my students I'm tired all the time I'm not trying to learn names what is wrong with me

Edit: it's after lunch and I spent all my planning this morning and all my lunch crying. I feel like a huge failure in life and think I've just made a giant mistake choosing this profession. All I can think k about all day is how much I want to not be here and I should just leave as soon as possible so they can find a replacement.
