I have a gun to my head right nowI did everything, i bought the gun, i got the hotel room, i got into the hotel room and called my ex the last person to know im about to kill myself. She hung up. Wouldnt respond to texts messages or phone calls. She did what I expected her to which was leave me in my darkest moment. Again. I sent her an email with my location, and contact numbers of people i know. That was 4 hours ago... i thought maybe she cared enough to call the cops and alert them to me. But not even that. NOT even that!

The gunâ€™s safety is off and im holding the trigger while typing this. Im mad at her but i dont want my last thought to be about her. She doesnt deserve it. I was already over her but this was the worse ive ever felt towards her. But my finger wont pull the trigger. Im trying but a thought of her pops into my head and stops me. She wants me to die. Or maybe its reverse psychology idk. Idk what to do. I have to checkout soon. But I dont want to live still. But i dont want my last thought to be of her. Fuck man.
