This is weird but it's a way to feel close to death and it's strangely nice..Sometimes, when there's tension in the air, or I'm feeling lethargic and sad, I go into the kitchen and open the draw.

I get a knife, put it up to my neck and I start to feel better. Sometimes it bleeds. Sometimes I get a scar. The thought that death is so close and it could all be over in a swipe. Is that weird? Yes it is. But I don't care.
