I can't deal with my life any moreI'm 17, and I wish I was dead. I've been struggling with severe depression for about 8 years now, and it just keeps getting worse. My family, my girlfriend, my school, they're all stressing me out so badly. I can't take it. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with severe depression, and anxiety, and was put on a medication to hell serotonin production, but all it seems to do is make me sleep more, but it doesn't get rid of the nightmares. They're so bad. They're so bad I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy. I wake up every morning almost screaming, freaking out, and thankfully in a few minutes I hardly remember the nightmare, just how it felt. I dread getting out of bed, because I don't want to do anything, I don't want to see anything, I don't want anything to push me past the delicate balance I have keeping me here. Most nights I want to kill myself. It's not just "oh, I'd love to not wake up, I'd love to walk off a cliff", it's "I have a plan". I know what my note would say. I know every word. I know how I would do it. I'd sneak outside at night, going through my window. I'd go deep out into the woods, farther than anyone would look. And I'd slit my wrists. All the way down, on both sides. And I wouldn't have to deal with anything else again, ever again. It's all of want, all I can think about. I want to die so badly. I need to die. And yet I'm too much of a coward to do it. I lied to my doctor when I was there, and she asked if I was suicidal. I said it wasn't that bad, and the last time I had thought about it was back in January. In reality, the night before I was going to do it. And now I want to again tonight. I want to do badly. I'm worried I actually will now... I can't talk to anyone. Nobody can make me feel better. I don't matter to anyone. I have no need to be here, and it's so tempting to go out. I need to die
