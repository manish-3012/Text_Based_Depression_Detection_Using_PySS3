?!Once again no one is answering my texts. But like someone did, strangely enough. More of a classmate than a friend, but she responded with a pointed question of whether or not I am still a virgin. Well I am, at the age of 18. Pretty sure she's with a bunch of folks laughing their heads off at my affirmative response. I don't know what point there is to life since no one enjoys my company. I would kill myself but that seems kind of insane. What to do :/
