I don't want to exist anymore, my happiness left meI don't know how to go into that much detail, I've done it so much before in previous posts asking for advice, but the love of my life left me because of how awful I've been to her. We used to think we were so perfect for each other and I just pushed it apart. I don't want to exist anymore, if I never existed I wouldn't have hurt her and myself. I just want to give it all up and die right now, I'm in so much pain I've just hit rock bottom despite how much I've tried
