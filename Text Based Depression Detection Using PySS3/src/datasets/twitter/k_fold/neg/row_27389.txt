I don't want to go, but I'm finding it hard to find a 
reason to stay.I'm twenty years old, I've lived my life in pain, and lonliness. I feel robotic, in the way that things have gone. I wake up. I work a shitty job for people that constantly push me down. I go home, I sleep...and I can't find a reason to get out of bed. I started cutting myself, to relieve the stress, little shallow cuts up along my forearm, then deeper ones on my legs, my brother who I live with found out about it, and asked me to leave, because it was traumatising his girlfriend and him. My Fiance of 3 years, has openly admitted that she's grown bored of me, despite everything we've done together, and wants to experince new things, and see other people. When I know she's been cheating on me for the past three months. I feel like I'm in a pit. And I can't get out. Every time I feel good, just good. For once. There's always someone to push me down.

I don't want to go. But the only reason, I see not to, is for my parents. But even that, in my infinite selfishness of wanting peace, is getting harder to deny.

No, I don't know why I'm posting here, but. I just want to see if anything can stop me, because I don't feel in control any more. I can't stop this pit inside from eating me alive.
