I've set a date and got my things in orderJuly 1st. July 1st is the day I've decided to leave this place. I've been planning my exit for quite awhile and I have been enjoying my past few months knowing my life will be over soon enough. $400,000, I figured that policy would be enough to pay off the rest of my mortgage, pay for my kids college and set my wife up to be successful when I'm gone. It's not like I don't feel loved, but you know what it's like to feel tired all the time? I'm just tired of the effort it takes to live anymore. I don't get enjoyment out of life, but I'm not a selfish person at all. I've taken my time to plan this out and be precise. I've decided the guaranteed route of exit that won't leave me to burden anyone. I'm actually excited to get it over with, I'm not scared of leaving. I've used this forum for awhile to read about people's success stories and try to morph my way of thinking and I appreciate everyone on here. For the most part you guys are all kind souls and good people.
