Don't want my roommates to have to deal with meThe only thing really stopping me from killing myself is that I don't want my roommates to have to find me and deal with it. This doesn't really have to do with anything I just feel really guilty for wanting to die but as a result leaving behind trauma for my roommates to deal with, I just wanted to tell someone.
