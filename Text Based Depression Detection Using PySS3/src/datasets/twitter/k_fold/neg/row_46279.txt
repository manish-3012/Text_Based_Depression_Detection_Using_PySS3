I don't think I deserve to live because I'm a financial burden on my family.It would be cheaper without me. I don't want to be a burden anymore. Funny thing was I was actually a bit hopeful that I could contribute a decent amount since I have no friends/roommates/partner/reason to move out asap (just turned 17 and don't see this changing soon) and I could just stay home and do chores and babysit my siblings for them. Then my step dad's hours and therefore pay were cut in half, now that hope is pretty much gone. I overheard my mom arguing with him over telling me that. He defended himself by basically saying it should make me want to cost him less now that I know. This is really triggering (hate that word now but whatever) my suicidal thoughts
