Nothing's workingI suffer with depression, anxiety, OCD, anger issues, schizophrenia, body dismorphia, phsycosis, insomnia and I'm sure there's some stuff that hasn't even been diagnosed yet. I'm at a point where I'm literally just waiting to die the only reason I haven't offed myself is because I don't want to hurt my family, I'm not even living for myself anymore.

I feel like I've tried everything honestly years of talking to so called professional's no help, years of medications usually make things worse, I'm a qualified PT and still hate my appearance, people can't tolerate being around me because of my mood which makes me feel guilty, can't sleep even though that's all I want to do, I enjoy nothing the things I do enjoy I usually overthink which is exhausting so I avoid them and on top of all that my younger brother just died. 

This doesn't even scratch the surface honestly I've handed literal booklets to my therapists just full of stuff like this. I'm trying my best to stay motivated with life but I feel lile every time I get passed one thing another problem smacks me in the face and the problems I do get passed are usually only temporary fixes and resurface again after a few months. 

I can't see a future where I'm happy, kinda just feel like someone being tortured and begging for the end. What next step can I take when I feel like I've exhausted all options?
