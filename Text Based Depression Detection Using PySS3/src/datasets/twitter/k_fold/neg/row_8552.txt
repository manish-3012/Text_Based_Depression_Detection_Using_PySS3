LolBiggest mistake of my life is actually sharing that Iâ€™m sick in the head to other people, my friends and family. I shouldnâ€™t have.. I should have just keep it to myself and eventually just die... now I have to suffer from another pain.. pain of being ignored, pain of feeling unimportant, pain of being insulted and not being understood. I became a laughing stock and a uselesss dumb person to them...
