I'm 24 and I have one year left.I turn 24 this Sunday (July 12th) and ever since I was very young (teenage years) I made a promise to myself if by the time I turn 25 and shit still sucks, I'm out. Never thought the day would come.

But for now I'm going to have to most enjoyable (potentially last) year of my life. I'm gonna branch out, try new things, meet new people, and all the stuff that depression has taken away from me since I was 14. I want my last 364 days to be the best days I've ever had.

I've had enough of this life but for now, I'm going to live the best year ever.
