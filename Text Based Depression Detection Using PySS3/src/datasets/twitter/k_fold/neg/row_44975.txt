I don't fucking care anymoreMy boyfriend of a year and a half, the only person who could ever talk me out of suicide just ended our relationship because I won't admit to something he 'knows' I've done. I didn't do anything. I've invested everything into our relationship, I have put myself into debt for him. I'm done, I'm fucking done, I'm done with life. I have no reason for anything anymore.
