I've picked a dateI made my fourth but most serious attempt at suicide about 2 months ago. One of the first things I said to my mum was "I timed it wrong". When I was fully awake I wasn't happy to be alive or disappointed it didn't work but I knew I'd do it again. My mum made me promise I wouldn't but I knew I was lying. All of this has made me a liar. Work has taken away any confidence I had left. Splitting from my boyfriend has only given me "evidence" that I can't trust anyone. I wanted to die with good memories and on my own terms but right now I want to go because my backs against the wall.

I can't see a future that I want. I try, I really have but I can't live knowing every 6 months I'll have an episode that'll drag me back and lose progress I've made and then some. I feel like instead of riding the wave, I'm getting dragged along the floor and the only time I'm on top, is purely a fluke and soon enough I'll fall back. 

I'm trying to distance myself from people to minimalise the damage...while still wanting to go somewhat happy. I bought some rats under the guise of making myself feel better, but I actually got them for my mum and sister to focus on when I'm not here. 

I hope someone I know will come across this post afterwards and understand why I've acted the way I have.

I know the date, where, how and most importantly, the timing.
