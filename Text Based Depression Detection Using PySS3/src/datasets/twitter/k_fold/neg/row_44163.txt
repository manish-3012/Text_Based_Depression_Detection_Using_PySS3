Why am I never good enough?Got turned down for another job today. I'm so sick of working 60+ hours a week in addition to a full time academic program. All I wanted was a normal job with a normal schedule so that maybe I'd stop feeling so fucking dead inside. But apparently a masters degree isn't good enough to get a job changing lightbulbs and cleaning sidewalks. No one will even look at me. I have no idea how I'm going to pay my tuition now. I'm so fucked.
