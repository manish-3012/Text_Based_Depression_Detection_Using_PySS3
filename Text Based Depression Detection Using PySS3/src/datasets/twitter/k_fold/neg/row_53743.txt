[Vent, NSFW] I'm just an edgy, fake depressed, ungrateful pussy.Hey, everyone. I'm 13 and the stereotypical edgy teenager. This is a throwaway account so I most likely will never reply to anything on here. I won't share my name, but you can call me dragon.

I guess I'll start off where it all began. This is legitimately my life story. This isn't a sob story though, I just want you to see why I hate me, too. When I was born everything was good, until about the age of 3-5. I can't remember the exact age. My mom used to send me to my neighbor's house to hang out, watch Harry Potter, and play with my neighbor. Her name is Martha and she was 16-18 at the time. She had a pug, I believe named Leo, a brother named Wayne, and a mom I believe named Liz. Martha was nice, Liz was too, but Wayne was completely different. He shot at my room and he killed my cat, on top of always busting my mom and I's windows. We lived by ourselves and honestly I don't remember much about then but she tells me a lot. Wayne killed my cat, Shasta, a beautiful gray and white baby, and put her by the training wheels of my bike and I found her the next morning. The worst part is that we had to throw her away, that's an awful thing to say but there was nowhere we could bury her so we had to.  Big deal, cat died, whatever. I've had plenty of cats, Shasta is seen as replaceable. Back to the babysitting. Sometimes when I went over to their house there was another boy there, about 10-14. He would pester me for sex and then I didn't know what it was but I knew it involved bad touching. I eventually said yeah just so he would shut up, then I locked myself in the bathroom to go pee. He tried to come in and- fulfill the agreement, and then Martha came and stopped him. I started calling him demon-child. DC came again and this time we went to a different house with Martha. We watched Hannah Montana and he stepped on me, and wanted me to step on him back. I thought it would hurt him so hell yeah I stepped on him. I didn't realize he could have liked it, and guess what I blame myself for now :)

I'm a complete and utter piece of shit because of the things I did then. I never told anyone about it until 2019 and I'm embarrassed to talk about it now, even if it's just one-sidedly to a bunch of anons.

After that I moved, and then moved again. I went to 2nd and 3rd grade in Arizona. I got extremely bullied. Death threats, shoving, punching, fights, even almost got suspended for it. I *did* manage to make 3 friends though.... well, 2. One friend sexually assaulted me one night at a sleepover. I know that was my fault too and I own up to it. I'm disgusting and now after being ruined nobody will ever want me or love me. Nobody wants a used anything; used dishes, used clothes, used car. I'm like dirty money, but at least all money's worth something somewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved again, back to the place I moved to the first time. I'm still here now. I've made new friends but none still seem to like me. I've had two "boyfriends", if you can call them that. I'm too young to have *real* boyfriends, and to have depression, and to be suicidal, and to feel real pain. I'm just a baby. I'm not good enough for anything. I don't do anything right. Nobody will ever really love me. Nobody will ever want me. I'll never be able to be a mom. I'll never get married. I'll never live a happy life. I'll never have anyone to love. I'll never be good enough. I'll never deserve love, happiness, or anything else I could ever want. I'm pathetic. I'm not even a good little. Good littles are ageplayers who let their daddies use them when they're little, I'm a bad little because if anything remotely sexual happens when I'm little I break down. I could never find anyone to truly love me. I don't even deserve to have a capitalized name I'm so disgusting. Even Hitler is a proper noun. I've tried pathetically to kill myself but I'm still here and the only other person who knows of my attempt laughed at it. I can't even cut myself properly. Boxcutter using cunt. 

I'm a disgrace to everyone and everything and I don't deserve life.

I.

Am. 

Bad.

I'm a bad human. A bad friend. A bad daughter. A bad love. A bad lover A bad mother. A bad person in general.

I'm sorry, everyone.
