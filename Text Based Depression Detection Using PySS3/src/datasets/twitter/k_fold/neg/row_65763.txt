I don't recognize myselfI made the mistake of opening up to my girlfriend so the relationship is probably going to be over soon. I looked myself in the mirror and I look like absolute shit, bags under my eyes my fucking skin look pale. I don't REALLY have a future, the only reason to keep living would be the present and the current false sense of happiness really doesn't entice me. The world doesn't need me and I don't even want to be around anyway. fucking sad I know. it sucks contemplating whether or not the four story drop from my apartments roof would really kill me fast enough to make it worth it. I don't feel happy and she basically told me I bring her down with her when I tell her so why the fuck would I open back up. Literal disappointment to my family and my death would matter for like two years tops and even that'd be pushing it. I feel like I fell through the cracks and a second chance wouldn't matter because then I would feel like I didn't deserve it. I feel I wasted the life I was given then given a second chance when it could've been over and I wasted that to.
