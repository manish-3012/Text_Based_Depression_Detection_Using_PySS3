Losing the will to liveI feel like Iâ€™ve lost any sense of purpose in my life and like Iâ€™m just watching every day go by without it leading anywhere meaningful. The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is that I really donâ€™t want to hurt my parents, my partner or my friends. Iâ€™ve got an appointment with a psychiatrist in mid-January but it seems to be so long until then and Iâ€™m actually scared it might get too bad before that. 

Not really sure where Iâ€™m going with this post, I just feel so alone rn and I canâ€™t talk to anyone about this kind of stuff, I canâ€™t put this burden on them. If anyone had any piece of advice, Iâ€™d be very thankful.
