I hate this...Sometimes I go into /r/SuicideBereavement so I don't kill myself, but even that last minute ditch attempt doesn't work anymore. As edgy as it sounds I feel like I don't care, like I don't feel anything. Distant. Last night I stayed up all night crying and having nightmares. Weird nightmares. I have one good friend and everyone keeps telling me that that is more than enough but I feel so out of place. Distant. I love him to death but from my first post I've made it doesn't feel right. Yes, I made to my next birthday, but it doesn't feel like I should have. Things keep moving forward when it feels like I shouldn't be.
