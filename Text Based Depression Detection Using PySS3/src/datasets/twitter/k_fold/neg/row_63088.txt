21 lonely male...close to ending his life..Im so tired of being lonely... I want friends and people to talk with and hang out with, but at the same time a very shy and withdrawn person and get uncomftorable in social circumstances.... 

This has led me to feel very isolated and unable to relate to other people, but this loneliness, also makes my depression worse....

 I have a girlfriend but it's a long distance thing, and she's been able to keep my depression from getting the best of me, but recently her father had woken up in the middle of the night while we were calling and talking to eachother and since that happened she got in trouble for it and now, my already limited time being able to contact and call/message her is in jeopardy and with her being the only person ive had contact with... 

Im afraid that if our time together messaging and calling stops, and we cant contact eachother anymore that ill be completely alone and forgotten.

I've been contemplating why i even bother staying alive... The one person who makes me feel the most alive and makes me depression feel like nothing could end up being not being able to contact anymore.. and if that happens everything bad just rushes back... i dont see why i should live... when all i live is a very lonely lifestyle.. have no friends besides my girlfriend.. dont have a social life.. my family doesnt like me that much... i dont know what to do...
