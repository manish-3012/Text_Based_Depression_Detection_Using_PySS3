I don't even know anymoreI've done everything that I thought would make me happy, and at the end of the day I always end up in the same place. Sitting at my computer, feeling empty. I don't know what I've done wrong, I have friends who have much less than me and are just so much happier.

I mean, I thought I was smart. I thought I was going to be different, and I still have time to change. But every day I wonder if I'm smart enough to do it, or if it will really all work out. I've been struggling my whole life with anger issues, depression, and extreme social anxiety. I'm lucky where I'm at today, but I always feel sad, empty, just wanting to end it. I should be happy where I am, it took me years to get where I am. I'm so lucky I finally have friends that understand me and my issues. They don't push me, and they don't force me into social interactions with new people. I've had trouble making friends my whole life, and I should be so happy. I just don't understand.

I've honestly lost all my motivation in the past few years. I've stopped trying at school, quit my job and just sit at home all day. I feel like there's just no point anymore. All my friends think I'm going to be something someday, and I thought so too. But every day I waste my time, and every day I stray further from my goals. At this point, I can feel my life slowly slipping away from me. I don't have control over anything now. I really wish I was young, happy, and careless again. I really do think I'll end it soon enough here, and I'm not writing this for your pity, I just want someone to remember me, and if it a random person on the internet, that's better than nothing. Maybe tonight will be the night, I really don't know anymore.

I wish I could just be happy, I wish I could just be someone. I wish I wasn't dragged down from my own fucking brain. Why was I born this like this? Every moment alone with my mind is torture, but every moment with other people is a fear of making a mistake, a fear of them hating me. I'm truly sorry to everyone I've hurt, everyone I've disappointed. I'm sorry I couldn't always be there for my family. I'm sorry my anger has hurt people. I'm sorry for existing. I would say sorry to God, but I know after it's over there's nothing. I'm not even going to reread this, it doesn't matter anymore.
