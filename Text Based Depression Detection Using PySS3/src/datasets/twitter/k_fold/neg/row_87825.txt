Just A ThoughtIm currently in the final decision making stage. Ive always hated my life since i was 10. I was bullied at school for my stutter so i had no friends and still dont at this point in my life. But this summer was the best and worst summer of my life. For the first time i was happy i met a girl and she was everything i ever wanted but after a couple of weeks she had to move back to her country and that broke me. I started to not eat, not sleep and just wanted to be alone. That also caused my family to hate me. They wanted to help but id push them away. Now a month has passed by and i come to find out she has a boyfriend. The thoughts of suicide were strong before but now they are even stronger. For the past month ive had that feeling in my stomach of butterflies or wanting to vomit and i cant take it anymore. Ive cried almost every day and though im going to therapy the thought of suicide keeps growing stronger. I was meant to start my second year of university but i told them i need a year break because i cant get anything done. Ive stopped taking care of myself and i feel bad for my parents. Ive already written a letter to my whole family and my ex in case i were to pass away but i dont know what to do. Its a matter of weeks/months now i dont see myself going past 2018.

I know this isnt as serious as others on this group. I just wanted to say that i know it feels shit but i pray to god that something good happens in the next fee weeks. I love you all and it makes me so sad seeing so many people with the thought of suicide every minute. It shouldnt be this way. I wish you all the best and i hope you give god a second chance and stay here with us a bit longer. Theres a reason why you havent done it and you need to keep on believing in yourself. Im trying my best.
