Today I wrote a suicide noteIâ€™ve had these thoughts for a long time and today I wrote a note to everyone about it all. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to be able to go through with it but Iâ€™m right there. I really want to end it all. I have parents that hate me. I went to school and was one of the smartest people there yet I had the worst luck with teachers that wouldnâ€™t grade papers and so I failed a couple classes and now colleges donâ€™t want me. Iâ€™ve got a girlfriend but now she doesnâ€™t care about me. She literally says every day how annoying and ugly and stupid and just useless I am so thatâ€™s something big. And Iâ€™m working and thatâ€™s the only thing right now thatâ€™s keeping me on the path of life. I donâ€™t know what would happen if something were to happen. I just feel so useless. Pointless. Empty. I just give up I want it all to end. And I tried to just be alone so I can clear my head but my house has 10 people in it so there is never a room thatâ€™s empty and if I try to go out my dad will literally take my phone to check my work schedule and then if Iâ€™m working then he will give me my keys but if Iâ€™m not scheduled then he wouldnâ€™t give them to me. So I literally have to be around people that hate me 24/7 and itâ€™s starting to be too much. I donâ€™t want to end it all I really donâ€™t I want to grow old with a wife I love and a beautiful family but itâ€™s starting to look impossible
