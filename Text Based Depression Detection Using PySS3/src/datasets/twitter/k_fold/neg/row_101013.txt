My Friend is planning suicide by Monday, already attempted to do so a day ago but failed.I need some help, Iâ€™m not sure if this is the right sub but like the title states, my friend tried committing suicide a day ago but failed, luckily they werenâ€™t hurt to bad but theyâ€™re planning to do it again on Monday, I donâ€™t know what to do or say to keep them from doing it, weâ€™re online friends so they live in the UK and Iâ€™m here in the US, the problem comes from their momâ€™s verbally and emotionally abusing behavior towards them and itâ€™s driven them to the breaking point. They canâ€™t runaway and all of the plans we come up with arenâ€™t going to work. They lost all hope and are planning to kill themselves on Monday and I canâ€™t convince them otherwise, not me nor any of their other friends. I really need some advice on what to do to help them.
