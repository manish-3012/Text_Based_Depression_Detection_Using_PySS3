Why shouldn't I kill myself?In two years when I turn 18 I'm going to buy a shot-gun and I'm going to kill myself. It's as easy as that.

What keeps bugging me though, is why everyone says that suicide is a bad thing? No one has really given me a good reason not to die. The way I see it, is that if I kill myself the world goes on. The people that feel hurt, eventually die. Then it won't matter. It really doesn't matter. For all I know, the world is just a projection of my mind and everyone else isn't real. Everything around me is just my reality and the people that tell me not to kill myself is just my mind protecting itself from not dying. See? Listen to how self indulged I am and how I wear a coat that's made of myself. I'm already selfish, so what does it matter if I kill myself? 

Nothing to lose, right?
