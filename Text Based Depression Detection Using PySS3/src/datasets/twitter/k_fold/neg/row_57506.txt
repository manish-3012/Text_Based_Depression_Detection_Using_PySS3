I need a plan.I've been plagued with the conviction that I'm 
 an unlovable piece of shit for 4 really horrible months now, nonstop, even my dreams I am rejected or abandoned - I've had depression since I was 14. In my waking hours I keep concluding after hours of back and forth in my mind that it's best I stop being a useless burden on the last few people who can put up with me (I've managed to hide the extent of my depression from them so far, I really don't want to cause them unnecessary stress, but I'm seeing the signs that they will soon pull away, that I've out stayed my welcome). 
I can't be convinced otherwise, even if someone tried. I know myself and what I've done too well. My disappointments are too great.
Im not asking for sympathy, I can't imagine a virtual stranger's kind words could really affect me more than a momentary distraction - though I've tried to distract myself for as long as I can (exacerbating my uselessness). 
I really just would like to know:

What's a surefire OTC pharmaceutical cocktail that's easily accessible that could finish me off? And how to do it? I'm 29, 5'3 and 46kg (102 lbs). Pretty fit, have been exercising regularly and eating healthy. 

I just need to have this around as a security blanket, to know with certainty that I am indeed in control of my life.
Please help me. On lockdown and tall buildings are unaccessible. I don't want to have a meltdown and stress the people I'm locked up with even more.

EDIT: God I've just read the rules and it says you guys can't tell me how. And now I'm crying uncontrollably. It's 8am. And I'll have to go down to breakfast soon. I need to stop. Wtf do I do???
