Why do I have to be the one who changes to make friends?It's been ten years and I'm still alone. It's only going to get harder as to.e goes on too.

I tried being myself and everyone hated me.
I tried not being annoying and ended up never talking to anyone.
I tried being out going and inviting myself to things but if they never initiate I can't keep doing g that.

What else is wrong with me? What else do I have to try? Why am I so broken? Why can't I be fixed?

I'm almost 23. I would rather be dead than spend another 50 years by myself
