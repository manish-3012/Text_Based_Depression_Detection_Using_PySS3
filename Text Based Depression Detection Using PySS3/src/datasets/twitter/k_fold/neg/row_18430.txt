Im planning my suicide.Im already having weird feelings about writing this. But i have realized that im finally ready to do this.

From outside im a normal guy, 25, single, active, smiling a lot, making jokes around friends, living in a one bedroom apartment and has decent income. 

But i feel like im tired of self motivating about different things in life.. i think i have never truly feeled loved as well. I have always valued people, and have been let down and now im just used to this and its really hard(maybe even impossible) to have feelings again.

I feel like i was searching for a reason, or just something to keep me going for the last couple of years. Because deep inside i knew i would end up at this point. I tried hoing into nature, making music, being involved in sports , chnaging jobs, learning new things etc. But at the end i somehow end at in my car outside of my place feeling nothing at all and just thinking. I have this strange idea of just restarting everything. Almost like im done with this and i need to get out.

Im planning to donate part of my savings and leave the rest to my family. I will also write a letter explaning it to them. Also I will probably do it in an instant way. 

I didmt wrote this to seek attention or anything in that sense. But just to share how I feel.
