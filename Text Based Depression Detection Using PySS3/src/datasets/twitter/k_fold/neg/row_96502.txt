Just want it all to endI have server OCD and I constantly feel guilty like I cheated on my girlfriend even though I know I haven't. I forgot to send her a snapchat for 10 mins after I got home and I have to way of proving I was home for that ten minutes and it's just making me feel dead inside. I've just been dealing with this so long and it's so exhausting I just want it to stop. It feels like life is just getting worse and worse I hate school, I hate my job, I constantly battle with OCD. I just wonder why I'm living this life of mine if it just sucks so much. I just needed to talk to someone I didn't know where else to turn. I can't tell anyone else because they will freak out I just feel like I want to die sometimes and tonight is one of those times.
