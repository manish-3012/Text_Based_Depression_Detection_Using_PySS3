This is itI hurt people that I cared about and they were all i had. I was selfish and I did it because i thought i would be happier without them. I canâ€™t apologize now and I donâ€™t want to be lonely anymore. Every day feels long and I canâ€™t get out of bed. Iâ€™m 17 and i already feel like iâ€™ve lived longer than i shouldâ€™ve, the rest of my life seems bleak. I want to disappear from the world and i donâ€™t think anyone would care that much.
