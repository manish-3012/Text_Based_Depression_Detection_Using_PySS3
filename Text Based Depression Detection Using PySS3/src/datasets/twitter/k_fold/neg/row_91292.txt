Yeah.Im lost. I need help but im horrible on the phone and the chat lines are so slow that i forget that im even waiting for them. Ive been put on a new medication becuase the one I was on hasn't done anything. I can't sleep with out thinking about suicide. I can't do anything without thinking about it anymore, which isn't anything new but normally i can brush it off and go about my day till it inevitably happens again. Having a plan isnt a sign anyone should worry with me. 

Though not anymore, every other thought is just my head picking at me, making plans with out me even having a say. I was whole heartedly ready to commit tonight for over 3 hours this morning. 

I can't go to a ward again, they don't do anything other then make sure you're stable enough to leave or at least coherent enough that you can fake being stable enough to leave.

I'm tired of being tired. 'Endless slumber' doesn't sound all that bad anymore.
