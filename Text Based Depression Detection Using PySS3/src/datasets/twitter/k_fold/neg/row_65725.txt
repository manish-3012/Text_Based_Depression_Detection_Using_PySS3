I donâ€™t want to leave my pets alone when I dieThis is probably so stupid to hear. Im having suicidal thoughts again, my life is a laughing matter. I could easily kill myself any day I wanted to. I have access to firearms thanks to the right wing asshole my mom is dating, or even just ODâ€™ing myself. Mom and her boyfriend work till late at night so Iâ€™m home by myself a lot. The problem is I have 3 cats (one of them is super close to me) and a young dog I love dearly and are the only ones in this shitty house I care about and make me happy anymore. I care more for my pets stress and sadness than my own fucking mother now. What would they do when iâ€™m lying on the floor dead? I donâ€™t want them to be confused as why iâ€™m not there anymore. I donâ€™t want to leave them.
