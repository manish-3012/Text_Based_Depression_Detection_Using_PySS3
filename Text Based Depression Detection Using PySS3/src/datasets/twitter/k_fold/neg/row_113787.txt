is this how life is supposed to be?goddamn. i can't fathom the idea of anyone being anything other than fucking miserable. i know people with a great family life, close friendships, and fulfilling work/ class lives. but even they have to have moments where they come back to earth, and face just how shitty life is sometimes. and we're supposed to not only enjoy life, but embrace it? no matter where the fuck i go, i can't make a place for myself where people are fucking happy to see me. and we're expected to live lives like this? at a deadend? knowing you can't do for people, when you try your fucking hardest, what others can do just by being there? i'm supposed to live knowing i don't bring any value to anyone's life? that my presence is a fucking reminder i disappoint no matter where i go? i can't live like this. i can't be the bad guy. i can't be what brings a frown after someone smiles. i can't be disappointment after disappointment. being the person i want to be to the people i want to be is impossible, and i don't have it in me to live as the person i am.
