LonelyAll year I have been going through suicidal impulses and feeling really crap and even attempted a few times. Although I haven't told anyone about the attempts cause I'm nervous they'll lock me up or something.

I got a hold of some anti-depressents type things from the street and have been taking those but my parents are making me stop (I'm 16). I haven't told them about anything.

I have no friends. No life. I'm so lonely. I just don't feel like living anymore. Can anyone help me?

I'm just so scared. I've tried talking to people online but nothing helps that much. The medication helped a little but now I can't take it anymore.

**Telling my parents is absolutely out of the question so don't even suggest it**

I just feel like if I cut again all the pain would go away and I think that's what I want to do.
