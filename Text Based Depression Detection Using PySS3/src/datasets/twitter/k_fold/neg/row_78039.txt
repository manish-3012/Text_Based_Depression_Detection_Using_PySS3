I dont care about the afterlife (just here to vent)I'm kill myself soon so i don't care what i leave behind because i got no one i care about. I'm 22 years old and still haven't gotten any friends and I've felt more alone then ever. I hate myself and fuck my life if i go to hell when I'm gone then so be it because this life is just as bad as hell. Honestly it feels kinda good knowing I'll die soon.
