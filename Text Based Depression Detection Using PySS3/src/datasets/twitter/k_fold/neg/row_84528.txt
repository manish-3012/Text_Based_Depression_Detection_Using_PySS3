Goodbye everyone.I have the noose around my neck and I'm standing on a chair. I'm going to kick the chair over right after this is posted. This is it, this is really the end for me. I'm going to slowly drift out of this sick world in just a few moments now. I truly appreciate all of the ongoing support I've received in this subreddit. And, I'm so sorry everyone. But, I just can't continue living in misery and suffering everday anymore. I've tried everything to fix all of the issues I have, but none of it helped me. So, this is the only way out of it all. I hope you all live a much better life than I did. I just wanted to have a post as a memory of my existence. This is my final goodbye to this world! 


Goodbye everyone!
