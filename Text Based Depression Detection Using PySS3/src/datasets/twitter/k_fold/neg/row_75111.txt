Wish i stopped existingIm so depressed. I was making $10k a day as an Amazon seller. Amazon locked up my accoutn with 70k on hold and is refusing to disburse my money. 70k lost. Thankfully only 7k is debt. My husbands family sold the house we were living in. My husbands credit is shit. we have applied for multiple places but have gotten rejected because of him. I have no money. He doesnt have a job. We have a 9 month old daughter. I dont know what to do. I dont want to kill myself. I just wish i didnt exist. Even as i write this im sobbing. Its a way to vent. The pressure is on at it is with my husband. Wish i wasnt alive anymore.
