I feel like everything I do is wrongTagging this as a spoiler since I don't know the triggerwarning-ettiquette on this sub, sorry. Don't read this post if you're in a bad place, I just needed to vent and feel like someone is listening. 

I've just had a really shitty day. I feel like I don't get along with anyone, I can't seem to do anything right and I just feel really fucking hopeless. I promised myself long ago that I'd live at least until I graduate from school. Now it's just over two weeks left until I do and I just really don't know what to live for anymore. I'm just too tired. I'm not currently seeing a professional because the queues are really long, and I have no idea when I can expect to get help. I know deep down I don't actually want to die, but everything feels so hopeless and so incredibly fucking difficult. I can't do this anymore but I don't seem to have a choice. Sorry this is such a downer. I just wanna feel happy again but I don't know how that's possible anymore.
