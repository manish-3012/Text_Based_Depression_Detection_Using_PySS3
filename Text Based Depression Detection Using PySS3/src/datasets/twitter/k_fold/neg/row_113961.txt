Any reasons not to kill myself?I just keep having one disappointing experience after the other. No matter how perfectly I do things or how good I'm, it just ends in disappointment. Everyone keeps telling me "it's not your fault, you're a good person in a bad situation" but what is it even worth it? I'm so tired of everything. It sucks that I have to be dependent on other people for things, like doctors, government, family, friends, etc and they decide how one's life is going to turn out like.
