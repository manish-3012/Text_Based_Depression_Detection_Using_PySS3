Why should i stay?I'm not sure if this is where i should write this so my apologies if it's not. 

I feel incredibly depressed lately. it's been a few months and i've just felt so alone even though i'm surrounded by people. i'm not saying they care for me, but they are around. I'm just so tired of people asking what's wrong and they try to fix my mood for the moment but minutes later i'm back where i started. i feel like i have no close friend whom i can vent to when i want to or laugh with during my "good" times. i have a boyfriend but im currently having a pregnancy scare so i don't like talking to him because it just reminds me what new mistake i could have made.. i'm too scared to take a test for now. 

i feel like i'm not a successful or motivated person either way. i can't get a job, i'm 18 and should be so much farther ahead in life than i am. i have a job interview at target on monday, but in the back of my head i'm thinking i'm sure i won't get the job because if i'm pregnant id have the money for an abortion which i know is terrible and wrong. 

i feel like i can never make any positive contributions to anyone's life and i know i'm too coward to kill myself but i wish i could. it's been so long since i've felt useful or wanted.
