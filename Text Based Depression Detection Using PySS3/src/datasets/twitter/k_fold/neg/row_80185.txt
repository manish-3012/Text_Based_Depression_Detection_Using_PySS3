Had a major surgery, landed me with chronic pain in my hips and legs.I wonâ€™t be able to walk anymore. Iâ€™m getting a wheelchair soon. 
Iâ€™m 15. The pain isnâ€™t going away. Itâ€™s been happening for almost two months now. The doctors say itâ€™s probably permanent. I canâ€™t hardly move. I really donâ€™t want to live like this. The pain is too much and the idea of never being able to walk and do things I enjoy again is killing me. I plan on killing myself soon.
