I want to die but if I do it might kill my mumLife has gotten completely unbearable and nothing out of the ordinary has happened. The same groundhog day from March has been ticking over but I just canâ€™t face the idea of waking up each morning. Recently we found out my mum has adrenal failure and if she has an attack it could kill her, these can be brought on by shock. Iâ€™m trapped. Trapped into existing because even if I want to die I canâ€™t risk what itâ€™d do to my mum. only one life has to end, but I canâ€™t even have that anymore. Iâ€™m angry and upset and full of regret that I didnâ€™t follow through properly on my previous attempts. This isnâ€™t a â€œsignâ€ to stay alive itâ€™s the sickest cosmic joke. Even if I died now I could potentially put my family through something even worse. Fuck this world that I have no interest in being in, Iâ€™m trapped here at least for the rest of her life.
