I hate myselfeveryone is better than me in any way  . school, intelligence, socializing, art, sports, videogame, heck uniqueness even. I'm an ugly person that have nothing interesting to even bet an eye on. I tried to ignore this and just simply improve myself. but I can't. no one is willing to talk to me, my parent will just fed me some "go study" crap. got into a major that I utterly dislike, my amateur skill is too incompetent for anything. every "friend" I have just want to take advantage of me, I just want to die. I don't want to see more disappointed face, isolated feeling and endless amount of anxiety.
