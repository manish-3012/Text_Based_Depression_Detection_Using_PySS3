This is just hellI fucking hate it all. There's no way in shit that this isn't hell. Dealing with the fact you mean nothing, the fact that people see you as another THING to use you for, how you only fucking live for others is shit. Oh, and give some fucking credit to public education. Whoever the fuck came up with the idea of having 8 bosses thinking they are the center of the world that give you tons of work and fill your backpack with a binder, a folder, and a book for each of those bosses worsening or even causing scoliosis isn't going to make people not want to live is just a pure genius that should be injected with cyanide. My life is just school repeated over and over again being surrounded by people that think and act like 6 year olds. The people I am surrounded by are always screaming because "HAW HEE IM FUKNG AUTISZ END LOUID IS FUNY HEW HEA" , those who aren't screaming like a 6 year old that just lost his oreos are just cunts as they have no regard for human decency and just love destroying others property. It doesn't even get better after school, as you can either choose to go bankrupt for the rest of your life to spend another 4 years in a concentration camp or work a minimum wage job and want to stab yourself more. 
I have tried to kill myself in the past, and I regret failing it and backing off last second. It's only a downard spiral of staircases, and I am starting to just want to jump down the center. I am literally crying myself to sleep right now just so I can do the same utter bullshit I do nearly daily in my life. 
I have 80 years and I get to spend it living for others while being actively aware of it. What a fucking gift I got.
