What the heck is going on?!?I don't even know what to say... I think I might actually be losing my mind. 
&gt;
Brief history... The last few years... I took care of my grandfather alone in my 20s and watched him slowly die... A year after he passed my dad committed suicide.... I packed up my life, put it in storage and moved to the other side of the world... my mum called a few months after I arrived to tell me she has terminal cancer. I came home watched her die the most horrible death you can imagine everyday for a year and a half. I'm an only child... I have no other family. I moved into her home after she died, surrounded by her things....in a small town that is a "retirement community" (I'm 30 btw), while I figure out what to do with my life. Not long after my mum died the woman that I thought I was going to marry broke up with me. She thinks I'm an asshole who can't deal with stress and has a lot of bad luck... Tonight...it's my birthday, I bought myself a new phone, tried to transfer everything over, deleted everything on my phone, including the backups... All the photos I took with my mum before she died are gone... Spoke with tech support they told me to update my computer... It crashed... I'm going to a wedding tomorrow (alone) and ran over my dress with my computer chair and tore a huge hole in it. I'm sitting here staring at the blank screen that was my computer... With my dress in my lap... In a room full of all the things that dead people left me... Wondering how the hell it all went so wrong. I'm losing my mind. I'm laughing and crying at the same time, what is going on?!?
