It's curious...I know over the last few days i've been making many posts and comments dwelling on the thought of suicide and expressing my inclination towards it. However, it has, very unexpectedly, happened that i now have something to look forward to, in life. And, please, don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that i no longer see the negatives in this world (which are many), and i will probably still have a hard time if i keep living, but now there is something that might make it worth going through.

It is true that i still kind of not have a dream, but there is something that is going to help me stay, because now it feels like it is good enough for me to consider it outweighs the negatives of continuing life in this world. And it is escapism, or just the concept of escaping this reality; fantasy and imagination are now a sort of comfort i can find in this life. I figured that all of the things i desire can be attained if i just go into my own mind and make them a reality there. And i am also aware that it is quite silly to not have considered imagination before, but i've come to appreciate the joy that getting far enough from this reality can give.

I have found and unprecedented comfort in stories, be them presented in movies, series, anime, etc. Oh, and also art... i find it gives me sich pleasure aswell, the music and the beauty and meaning and emotion that can be expressed through various mediums, such as painting and drawing and singing and, well, many things.

I almost feel like a different person... and that makes me a little uncomfortable and insecure; i almost feel like it's almost a betrayal to what i said before about me wanting to end my life, but i still stand by it. I believe the past me truly wanted to die, and was right to do so, even if something happened to make him not want to anymore. Other people should still receive respect for their wishes if they truly want to die.

What happened to me was that i came to accept that i did have desires and i just found a way to make them kind of a reality for me (which before just felt like an impossibility). Now i feel like i can be free to be whoever and however i desire, because it is all in my head. I must admit i still feel insane, but now i don't really want to die anymore; i just found another way to live, one i can accept now.

And yes, i would trade this life to one completely made up from my own thoughts and emotions and desires, but it's enough having that just by going into my head almost anytime i want. I'd rather live inside my head than dying, i guess that's all i'm trying to say.

I do want to apologise for saying that i was going to kill myself, but i still believe there was truth in my way of thinking.

And, in case you're wondering, i didn't talk to any sort of professional or anything like that, i simply asked myself "is this what i truly want? Is there really no other way?" and figured that... there was, even if it should've been more obvious to me.

I guess i have commitment issues or something but i already knew that; had i had enough resources before i would be dead now, but oh well, it didn't happen, but maybe it will later, i don't really know. All i know is that i want to live inside my head and maybe hopefully start creating stuff with it, possibly even earn a life through it?

Anyway, thanks for reading.
