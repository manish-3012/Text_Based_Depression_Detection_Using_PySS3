It's ny birthday today and also the day that I was supposed to kill myself.My depression started when I was 7 years old and I remember promising myself that if I was still dealing with this by the time I was grown up, that I'd kill myself.


Today I turned 18 years old and the thought is still with me. I wrote a note 2 years ago and its still sitting in my desk. The plan was to buy a gun and shoot myself, but plans don't always work out. Now I can't get the thought of starting my car and just sitting in the garage out of my head.


In the past few months, things have changed though. I haven't been happy, but I don't feel sad anymore. I don't know if this is what people mean when they say it gets better, but I guess it did get better.


Now I'm just laying in bed wondering what I should do with my life or if I should start the car. I just feel so confused right now.
