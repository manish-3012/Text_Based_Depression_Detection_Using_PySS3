I just disposed of the method I was planning on using to kill myself...Hi reddit - I just need someone to be proud of me. I just came back from an errand, where I disposed of the thing that I had been holding onto in case I wanted to kill myself.

Nobody seems to care. My dad doesn't know that I idealize suicide. My friends and I aren't that close. My SO knows and was there with me, but didn't think that it merited celebration. He's dropping some stuff off at the dump now while I'm listening to music and redditing alone.

I just want someone to say that they're proud of me, reddit. I've been holding onto that method for years. I think I did a big thing... but all I feel is small.
