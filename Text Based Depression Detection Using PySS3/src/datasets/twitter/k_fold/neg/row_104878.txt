DebtI don't see the point. I work 40 hours/week, making more money than I ever have before ($11.15/hr at age 26), and I can barely make minimum payments. My interest is piling up faster than I can pay it. I don't know how much longer I can keep my student loans in forbearance. I'm fucked when that stops. So why keep living? What the actual fuck is the point? 

I read a few articles, but they're so fucking clueless. "Call a hot line! Get professional help! Your debt is temporary!" Ok, yeah. I'm sure a hotline is going to just magically melt away all of my debt, yeah? Because nothing they can say is making that go away. And professional help? Really? On an article about suicide and debt? Fucking joke. There are two universities in my city and neither offers free services to non-students. I can't find help anywhere. These professionals don't care about helping, they care about the bottom line. So I guess I just need a reason to keep sinking lower and lower into this bullshit.
