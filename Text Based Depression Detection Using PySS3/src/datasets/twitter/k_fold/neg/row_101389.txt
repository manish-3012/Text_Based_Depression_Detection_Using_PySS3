Not sure whether my fear of living outweighs my fear of dyingI hope some of you will take the time to read this. It is long, but I desperately need to vent.

For a long time now I've been terrified of dying. The concept of an eternal oblivion waiting for me upon my death fills me dread and raw terror. I've had these feelings concurrently alongside a long period of Depression, General Anxiety and Panic Attacks. I've tried avoiding these feelings anyway I can. I am an Alcoholic, and I heavily abuse Benzodiazepines, Opiates, and other miscellaneous hypnotics when I can. I went through a large period of heavily abusing cough syrup after an upsetting period of my life. It detached me from my feelings; it detached me from reality as a whole. I was consuming several bottles a week for extended periods of time. In retrospect, it was clearly just me trying to escape the misery of being alive without resorting to the terminal solution (suicide). I feel as though this has irreparably damaged my brain. My memory is a constant haze, the days bleed into each other like watercolor paints.

The shift in my mood probably started in my tenth grade of school. My grades dropped dramatically (in elementary school I was known as very bright and people commented on how I enjoyed being at school more than at home). By the 12th grade I had dropped out. I no longer had the motivation to do anything. By this point I still enjoyed to some extent old pleasures such as movies and video games. That changed soon after, as I lost most of the joy in almost everything I once loved to do. This is the point where I became a heavy addict. I had two close friends at the time. My rampant alcoholism was a major contributing factor to losing one of them. The alcohol numbed my depression and killed my anxiety, at the cost of me being a miserable excuse for a person that no one wanted to be around. During this time I tried an SNRI medication with no success, and had already seen two therapists, both of which were of absolutely no help.

Then there came a catalyst that changed my life almost overnight. I bought, prepared, and consumed a psychoactive medicine known as Ayahuasca. How I managed to undergo such a potentially terrifying experience with my level of Anxiety I will never know. After it was done, I was better. The gray depressing world that surrounded me flooded with color and reality was no longer suffocating me like I was in an endless ocean of water with no help or hope. I started enjoying hobbies again. I was no longer getting black out drunk every night on Alcohol (and sometimes during the mornings too). The only thing that hadn't improved was the total lack of motivation towards anything, but it was still an incredible improvement and exceeded my wildest expectations.

Fast forward ten months. Ever since that experience my mood had stayed steady. Then, things began to go downhill again. It was gradual at first. The anxious knot in my chest appeared, and wouldn't go away. The world became dull and intimidating. My thoughts turned overwhelmingly negative and I was experiencing long stretches of what I can only describe as incredible dysphoria. I'm trying to graduate high school again (I'm 20) but it's very likely I'm going to fail yet again. My anxiety and lack of motivation makes it seem like I'm going to have no future at all. My father who I still live with has threatened to kick me out of the house if I don't get a job or graduate high school. I don't know if he will actually go through with it. I couldn't survive being homeless, there's just no way. I only have one friend left and I doubt they'd be willing to let me stay there (they live with their parents as well). The last two months has been the worst. I've been average at 4-5 panic attacks a week. Recently I started heavily abusing Benzodiazepines to treat my Anxiety and Panic Attacks. It provides relief, but I always inevitably overdo it. The last few days have been such a murky haze. Only pieces and fragments of my days are easily recalled due to the amnesiac effects of the Benzodiazepine. 

For the second time in my life my mind turned to suicide. The first was during my heavy Alcoholism stage, when I had a hookup for Opiates. I knew I could get Morphine from him, go down to the pharmacy and buy some syringes, and intentionally overdose intravenously. I wanted the misery and Anxiety to end. But I also terribly scared. Paralyzed with fear over the idea of nothingness forever. That particular time the fear of dying outweighed my fear of living. 

This time, I'm not so sure. I've been thinking of buying the parts required to build an exit bag, fill it with Nitrous Oxide, and go out peacefully like a giggling fool. I know that things will eventually get better. They've already gotten better once before. What terrifies me is if I'll be able to hold on until that time comes again. It's just so difficult. So difficult... I don't know if I have the willpower to make it through again. I have more Ayahuasca, but my anxiety has gotten bad enough that I am paralyzed by fear to try it again. It kills me inside to know that I have a sister and best friend that would be devastated if I ever went through with it. My friend means so much to me, and they've already had to deal with the suicide of sibling. I don't want to have to place this burden on them.

I just don't know if the suffering of living is preferable to the horror of nonexistence. I just don't know anymore. It's like a Catch-22, I feel so helpless.
