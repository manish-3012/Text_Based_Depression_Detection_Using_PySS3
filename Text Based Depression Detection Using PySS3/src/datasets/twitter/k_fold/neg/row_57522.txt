HelloAs I type this one out I have already thought about ending it all for at least 3 weeks. I'm only living for my family at this point. That and the fact that I don't want my family to pick up what remains of me after I've ended it all
 
I've been lying to my friends about getting help because I feel inadequate to be helped by them. I've always been independent and I've always been the one shoving them with life advices but I don't think I deserved to be helped by anyone. And to be honest? I don't want to bother them. I feel that right now, I'm a bother to everyone.

I've been wreckless with my heart, my mind, and my body the past few months and I'm reaching my limit. I hope I can find something that I can live for a bit longer other than just surviving. Maybe. I'm just dramatic. I don't really know. But I really am trying my hardest.
