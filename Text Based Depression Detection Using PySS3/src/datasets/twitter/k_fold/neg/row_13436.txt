I think about suicide just too oftenI once got drunk and walked into a truck. The police drove me to my place and I woke up, didnt remember anything. My sister had run away from home, everyone in  my house was sad and I just got drunk and did that. I hate my life. My parents are old, way old my dad's 75 my mom 60 and they have no idea what they are doing. Neither do I. I kept getting blackout drunk to numb all this pain. Somehow I pulled myself out of that and now I just get responsibly drunk.

I have a nice life, my parents have a high status and sometimes it seem that's all they care about. 
We dont have the money. My mom is a  manipulative narscisisst, she always belittles my dad, and everything she does is perfect.

I think about cutting and bleeding to death. I drive like crazy, I want to numb myself with drugs, I just hate my life. I want to cease my existence. I want to jump into the river and see if i make it. I have horrible nightmares.  I need help.
