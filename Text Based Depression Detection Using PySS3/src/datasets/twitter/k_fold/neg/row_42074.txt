Iâ€™m not even sure anymoreIâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m suicidal or not but Iâ€™ve made my mind up that I donâ€™t want to be in this world by next Christmas if Iâ€™m still alone. Iâ€™ve been alone all my life, family barely interact with me and make me feel like an outcast. Iâ€™ve never had any real friends, only people whoâ€™ve used me or bullied or both. I donâ€™t even have the strength to see a therapist. Iâ€™m pathetic and donâ€™t care anymore
