I'm hurting so much now its unbearableThe past 6 days have been the hardest since i last tried to end it over 2 years ago and i feel so much lower than i did back then. I know I've done wrong but i want to make things right but i cant ever see me getting the chance or making it there. I'm sorry for everything.
