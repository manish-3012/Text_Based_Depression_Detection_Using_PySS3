Being quarantined feels like a death sentenceAcknowledging that most of the world wants to avoid contracting COVID 19, for me there could not be worse timing for isolation. Not even a month ago I made a suicide attempt and I feel like I didn't try hard enough. Two weeks alone with my thoughts is going to be lethal, I know 'recovery is always an option' but to be honest it feels like this is the chance I've been waiting for? So I'm stuck between fear and resignation. 

Two weeks might just be long enough for the voices to win.
