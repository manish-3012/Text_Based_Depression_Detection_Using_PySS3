No rest for the wickedDoes anyone else have serious trouble getting out of bed. The only thing i seem to look forward too everyday is when i get to go to sleep. It seems like im just existing through my boring day so i can escape to my dreams at night. I've had days off where i just lay in bed with my eyes closed wishing i could just escape this reality. Has anyone else? Even if death just leads to an emoty void i cant help but wanting to end it just so i dont have to wake up again. I guess i just need to make a plan already and stop procrastinating the inevitable.
