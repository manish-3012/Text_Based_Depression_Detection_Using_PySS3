What do I need to do before I commit?I don't know exactly how it happened but I just don't want to live anymore. I know better than to act on my initial feelings so I'm giving myself a week to get everything in order before I finally make any irreversible decisions.

I'm just asking what do I need to do? Do I need to write a will? Will my debt be transferred to my family? I wish to die from carbon monoxide poisoning. Will this be a danger to the people in the downstairs apartment? I don't want this to harm anyone else.
