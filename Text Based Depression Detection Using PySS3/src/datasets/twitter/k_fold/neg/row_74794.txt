I need to just get it over withI told my boyfriend about my suicidal thoughts. After telling me that it's selfish and that he'd miss me he said "If you're going to do it then just do it. If you are actually goddamn serious about it. Stop telling me".

Things are piling on me. I am wondering if I should check myself into a hospital but i'm a mix of afraid of what'll happen if I do and self-hating for being too much of a coward to just do it. 

I just don't know anymore. I can't trust myself.
