My sister has very low self-esteem, and she has suicidal thoughts. How can I help her?My sister, who is also my one of my best friends, used to cut herself and I believe she once told me she attempted suicide a few months ago. I don't remember quite clearly if she said that, I was in too much shock when she told me she was hurting herself. She is thinking of cutting herself again, and I do not want that to happen.

I really don't understand why she is doing this. She has a loving family, and a lot of friends that truly love her. We don't go through any financial problems, and she has never gone through anything that would be traumatic (Like abuse, bullying, etc.). She is a great person, it's just her self-esteem is really low, and she has no motivation to do anything. She says she doesn't see a future for herself. 

I feel like I'm stuck. I don't want to make her do anything, or else she will hate me. But I want to help her so badly, because I love her so much. Can someone please give me some advice? How do I raise her self-esteem?
