Problem solvingAll my life I've been told things can be fixed, things will get better. They do not. Do not ever believe anyone who says you can lead a happy life because they're wrong. They're just talking about their own ambition, not what could happen to you. You have to know that nobody cares about *you*. They care about the effect on them, what they'll lose if you leave. You're truly the only person who has a proper interest in your life and if you don't feel like you can change then you're stuck. Forever.
