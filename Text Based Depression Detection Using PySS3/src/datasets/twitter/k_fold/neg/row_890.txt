How do I tell my family that I don't want to live any more?It's all I can think about. I want euthanasia (legal in my country) so I can donate my organs and it won't be as unexpected as suicide for my family. I really hope I can find a doctor who will help me with that. Because I don't want to kill myself, but I will if it's the only way.

I suffer from depression if you're wondering, and yes I have tried therapy and drugs.
