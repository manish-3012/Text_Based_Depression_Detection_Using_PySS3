Did I do the right thing?My friend, 24M, that I met online about 2 months ago and have spent time with in person, threatened suicide tonight. He said he was going to drink until he felt brave enough to slit his wrists. He said he had the razor blades ready. He said goodbye to me, told me to enjoy my life. I called 911. I gave them all the info I could considering. I don't have his exact address, I don't know remember his last name. I gave them his cell phone number and carrier.  
If he gets put in the hospital, I know he'll never forgive me. But I had to do it right? I care about him. He's quickly become a good friend of mine. And even if he weren't, I still wouldn't be able to stand back and watch this happen.
I feel absolutely horrible. I feel like such a piece of shit for not thinking about taking down his address and last name when I knew he had suicidal tendencies a few weeks back.
