I cant fucking handle this bullshit anymore but I'm gonna put up with it anyway.I have had to talk my bf out of suicide multiple times this week. I'm basically numb to it now. "No dont" "please" "dont" "please dont" "stop" it's all so repetitive. I basically am just like "here we go again" now. I just want it to stop but I know it wont. I'm giving one word answers now. My heart isn't in it anymore. I'm not crying about it like I used to. Just kinda like... minimal responses. This is affecting my mental health. I cant handle it. I'm only fucking 14. I've had to talk 5 different people down this week. I'm just completely numb. Obviously I dont want anyone to kill themselves. Otherwise I would just completely give up. But I'm so fucking numb to it now. Its basically a nightly routine.
