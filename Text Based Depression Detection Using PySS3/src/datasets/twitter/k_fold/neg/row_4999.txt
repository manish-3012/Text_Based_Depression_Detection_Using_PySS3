I feel like I'm about to relapse into depression and suicidal tendencies.I really don't want to cause an alarm by going back to the psychiatrist. 

I have alot of Zoloft pills on me. How could I find out what would be the appropriate dosage to take? I heard that using the wrong amount can make it worse.
