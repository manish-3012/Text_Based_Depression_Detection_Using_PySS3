Just writing about my lifeAt this point, I know most generic responses. Iâ€™ll make it through, donâ€™t give up, youâ€™re worth it.

Problem is I donâ€™t feel that. Now truth be told Iâ€™m an asshole. I wish I could change that for my loved ones but so many people have no patience for me anymore and I feel like Iâ€™ve burned all my bridges.

Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, ODD, depression, chronic anxiety, high functioning sociopath. Years ago I dropped my meds and havenâ€™t touched them, I have no plans to again. They turned me into a heroin addict and a coke addict. That part of my life still haunts me. The things I did, the people I hurt both mentally and physically. 

Coming from always being the kid that was blamed for school mishaps and the such, I never had much self respect. Still I believe that I canâ€™t no any worse than Iâ€™ve done, sure Iâ€™ve burned people, hurt then. But ... they arenâ€™t me. Generic but true, no one knows me. I limit myself to one true friend, my best friend. Currently Iâ€™m trying to maintain a relationship with this wonderful girl but she has all but lost hope for this relationship, I canâ€™t seem to get it right. Sure I love her and protect her against anything but when Iâ€™m the one she needs to be protected from, well thatâ€™s not a good feeling.

Years now Iâ€™ve been contemplating ending my life, Iâ€™ve sat, Iâ€™ve thought and Iâ€™ve talked about it all, how I would do it, things Iâ€™d leave behind, people Iâ€™d loose. Maybe just maybe Iâ€™m a cynical person but I donâ€™t believe in god or anything of the such, when I die, thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™m dead. I wonâ€™t have to deal with pain, sure Iâ€™ll hurt people but what do I care? Iâ€™m dead. Thatâ€™s sure a grim outlook on my life.

And the worst part of all of this is, Iâ€™m self aware of my mistakes, but I canâ€™t seem to allow myself to fix this shitty person I am. And here I am again. Thinking. I feel less pain than I ever have. Sure Iâ€™ve cut myself, and I did it just a few minutes ago, I stick needles in myself, I electrocuted myself a few times... in hopes something would change.

The demons I face in myself are self conquering,  fighting against all odds and trying my dearest to make this girl happy. Tonight I yelled at her because she put words in my mouth I never said and even when I calmly explained that she wouldnâ€™t listen. Seems to always be the case with my outbursts. 

I spend 8 years in anger management for this. I spent 16 years of my life seeing therapists about my â€œproblemsâ€ and nothing has worked. It made me more self aware. That allowed me to hate myself, itâ€™s a consonant down spiral of mishaps and misshapen futures I hold in an open hand. Allowing everything to slip away.

Sure I cut myself, clichÃ©, I know. Iâ€™ve attempted hanging myself and the rope/belt/rubber hose broke. Maybe it wasnâ€™t my time.... clearly I donâ€™t believe that because here I am, writing this. Depressed as ever, as all my relationships crumble, as I turn my face away from everyone. Bleeding pain away.

In my heart of hearts I know one day Iâ€™ll finish what I started. Being as big of a disappointment to myself as I feel in this moment, and many that have come before, Iâ€™ve willingly given my all to this relationship. Iâ€™ve stood by my mother who was abused, but other peoples problems arenâ€™t hard for me to mentally handle. Itâ€™s me. 

Comment if you want. I just wanted to write this, maybe for a life lesson, maybe as something Iâ€™d leave behind. I havenâ€™t decided yet.
