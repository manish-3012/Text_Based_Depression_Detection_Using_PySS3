It's just one thing after another going wrongI was diagnosed with MS I'm December 2015 and since then my entire life has been spiralling downward. I'm 22. I had a couple attacks where I just lose complete feeling in pasta is my body. Now I have to miss so much school because I got appointments 4-5 times a month between neurologists, psychiatrists and psychologists. In 2017 I attempted to hang myself which failed and landed me into the loony bin where I got diagnosed with mixed state bipolar. Now recently my right eye has suffered severe nerve damage and is barely functioning. And the newest addition of the problem is I just fell yesterday which caused my teeth to go through my upper lip so I had to get an ambulance which brought me to the hospital to get stitches. My front teeth are also severely chipped like 2/3 gone on both of them and I just wanna give up clearly life doesn't want me to be happy.
