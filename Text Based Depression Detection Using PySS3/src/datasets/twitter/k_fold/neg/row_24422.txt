I hate myself. I never finish my projects..I went to uni, i have a worthless degree, no job..and I started living with my parents again. Idk where i'm heading, but i feel worthless, and with no skills, with no use in life. I feel like I don't deserve eating. Also disabled. I feel my parent's life woI hate myself. I never finish my projects..I went to uni, i have a worthless degree, no job..and I started living with my parents again. Idk where i'm heading, but i feel worthless, and with no skills, with no use in life. I feel like I don't deserve eating. Also disabled. I feel my parent's life would have been so much better if they didn't have me. I ate up so much of their resources and gave nothing in return.
Idk what to do to feel better. I am very ashamed of myself. I feel I don't deserve to live.
