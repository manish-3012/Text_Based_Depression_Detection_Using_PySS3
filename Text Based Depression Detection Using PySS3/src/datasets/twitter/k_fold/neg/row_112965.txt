I need to get this outI don't know what's keeping me alive anymore. I don't know if it's hope that I'll be happy or that anything will make sense one day or that I'll reach some fleeting sense of oneness with myself but it's never going to happen. I'd kill myself but I imagine my mother after that and I just can't. I'll do it one day, though. I don't think anyone can stop me at this point. I don't even know why I'm doing this. To feel better? To get something out into the world? I hate this and my stupid brain for thinking anything would help me.

There's so little keeping me going. I'm so angry and confused. I don't want to get better because I know it doesn't work. I got better before and it just keeps getting worse and worse every time I fall back in. I'm tired of living and working and moving and thinking because I'm not good at any of it. Everything I want to be I can't be and the people around me agree.

Some people get sympathetic looks and conversations and "You can do it!"s but I don't and it's because the people around me know damn well I can't. I'll never be able to. I don't get pats on the back because they know I'll never be good enough. I just think everything would be a lot easier for myself and others if I simply weren't around. My friends would stop being dragged back by my presence, my parents would be spared the disappointment, etc.

I'm still not sure why I'm posting this. I'm sorry for getting in your way.
