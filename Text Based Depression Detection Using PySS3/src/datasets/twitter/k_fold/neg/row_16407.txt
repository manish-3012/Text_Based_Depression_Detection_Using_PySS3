All these, "I'd do it but my mom" postsThey have me thinking, they have me contemplating and realizing; I don't care. I don't care if I die and my mother weeps at my body crying and begging me to come back, even to the extent of my grandmother I wouldn't care. I've reached the point of apathy, even the thought of killing myself hasn't sent any percussion throughout my thought process. I want to leave, I don't want to walk these shoes anymore. I think it's almost time for me to go, but as I've always said to others and myself, "a flower blooms when it's ready". I'm just not ready yet ig.
