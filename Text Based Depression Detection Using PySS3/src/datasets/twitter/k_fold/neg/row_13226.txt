How will my body be handled on the other side of the border?I've decided on ending my life, already firmly committed to it without going into detail, so this need not be taken as a cry for help -- it's already decided. Was booted from r/legaladvice for asking there, and I do sincerely need to have this issue settled before going through with it so please spare any judgement or well-wishing or telling me to get any help that I'm not specifically interested in recieving, just strictly legal advice if you please.

The issue I'm having trouble with is with being US citizen living in Canada on temporary residence. Got married after moving for the purpose of sponsorship, and my concern here is that my former partner would be burdened with financial cost and legal responsibility in terms of having my body rounded up, processed, or whatever potential expenses might arise in the aftermath. Not bothering with divorce because it would take months and I'm assuming would automatically invalidate the sponsorship anyhow, so not a hoop I feel any real need to jump through on my way out the door.

In light of this, my biggest consideration has been whether suiciding myself in the US would alleviate potential legal/financial responsibilities for her completely, and how the process might unfold with being on the other side of the border since my body would most likely (and thankfully) not make its way back to her. I have family in the states so I'm also assuming that they would be the first to be notified, but would that also extend to the wife being notified from across the border?

We don't have any substantial assets, nothing to bother writing a will over, just the question of body disposal after the fact.
Thanks
