why donâ€™t more people kill themselves out of boredomiâ€™m not depressed at all, thereâ€™s never anything to be depressed about, nothing is that serious. but iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself just because iâ€™m bored. i sit in my house alone, i donâ€™t enjoy doing anything, i donâ€™t want to watch netflix or play video games itâ€™s not interesting. i sometimes hang out with friends and thatâ€™s not very fun either. it feels like everything i do is just to try to distract myself from boredom but nothing is really helping, i feel bored with everything i do.
