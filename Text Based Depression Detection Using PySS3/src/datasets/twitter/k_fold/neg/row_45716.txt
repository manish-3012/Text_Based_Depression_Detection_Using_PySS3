Fuck youI want to die. I fucking hate everyone and everything I want to break everything and cannot not fuck up. I ruin everything I do and can never seem to do anything right. I want to fucking break everyone's back across my knee and burn them alive. I can't do wellll enough in school for anyone to be truly happy. I have insane anxiety on where I will go to college and how I will do in life. I hate myself more than anyone else because of my inability to ever to anything right. Why the hell was i born? I didn't want to be born. I want to break everything and am often filled with rage because of how much of a failure I am. I fucking hate how my family never shuts the hell up and argues about everything and I mean EVERYTHING. I hate that I don't have many "friends" and I'm unsure you could even call them that. My only true friend was my girlfriend and she broke up with me because I'm to much of a fucking bum. She was my everything and I, for some reason, am unable to let go of her. I am currently drifting through the motions of life and I am watching everything slip away from me. That maybe my one and only, my grades, my 'friends', my conscious. I will do anything that will spike my dopamine level so I am able to escape reality. After my girlfriend broke up with me all I ever want to do is drugs because I makes me fell gooood and allows me to forgettt. I have quit vaping(gayest shit ever I will come to your house and beat you to a bloody pulp if you do it) and am trying to quit jerking off and smoking. I am just a disappointment to everyone around me and don't feel able to maintain what is expected from me. Sorry if you read this. Utter waste of your time
