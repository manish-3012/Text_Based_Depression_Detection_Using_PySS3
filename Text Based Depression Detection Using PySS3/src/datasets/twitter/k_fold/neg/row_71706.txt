I just realized somethingI just realized that some of the things happening are my fault. If I wasn't so afraid, my dad wouldn't had almost died and wouldn't be stuck between being homeless or roommates with a crazy drunken person. I'm always afraid to do anything. I wouldn't had been taken advantage of by my classmates. I wouldn't had been abused by my aunt and uncle on my mom's side of the family. Just today, I was too afraid to talk to my best friend about my suicidal thoughts. I feel like an idiot. I know that everyone would be better off without me. My parents wouldn't have to spend any money on me. None of my friends would care. My high school that I'm going to wouldn't have to try and teach the failure I am. I just wish I was dead. I don't have a rope but I do have towels, blankets, and a dog leash. No one would care. Everyone would be better off without me.
