Why couldn't I have been a woman?I feel like being male and not having confidence = being unloved.  I know women have their own problems but they have the friends and intimacy... I have nothing... I wish I could have been beautiful and appreciated... since I'll never be really liked I just feel like killing myself... whats the point of being alive if everyone hates you for being male and being awkward and ugly?
