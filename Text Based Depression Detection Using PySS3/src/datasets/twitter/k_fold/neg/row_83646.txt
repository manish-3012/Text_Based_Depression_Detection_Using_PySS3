Iâ€™ve decided to kill myselfI have been through the worst so much so I believe this was always the way my life would go.
Probably why I always said I wouldnâ€™t make it to 50
And most people Iâ€™m close with know I want to be cremated lol
2015 was my best year I was finally used to living in Australia me and my 3 sons were finally doing great without there abusive father and I had meet the man of my dreams granted during that time my appendix exploded and I had to have surgery the day before going to court to get a avo against my ex(which I did with a massive cut across my tummy) I was still very happy life was amazing I had been with my partner for over a year I had an amazingly easy job which paid the rent and the boys well they were always spoilt.
Than I got the best news I was pregnant not just that I was pregnant with twins the best day of my life until I looked at my partner and he looked like the floor was going to swallow him up I cried we went back to his place if you have ever seen a man break down itâ€™s the most painful experience to see I tried my best to get him used to the idea but he pulled away for weeks he felt further and further away I started to feel guilty I already had 3 sons and he would tell me that if we had an abortion now we could try later when we were financially more able to cope weeks of that and I started to think ok maybe he right so New Years 2016 I said yes it was the happiest I had seen him in weeks he made the appointment quickly I cried all the way through the procedure and wanted to die on that bed when I woke up a week after I lost my job or technically my shift were put to 1 day a week 2/3weeks later I found out the man of my dreams was cheating on me with his ex gf who pretended to have cancer but he begged and begged for forgiveness and I loved him I was stupid enough to forgive I could not lose him I found out I had abnormal cells in my cervix I was depressed I continued to get pregnant and miscarriage 10 more babies at different stages I started to take out loans to try to keep him(he doesnâ€™t know)I let the boys father back into there lives I wasnâ€™t coping by the end of 2016 he had cheated on me multiple times and I still couldnâ€™t let go the thought of getting my twins outweighed anything I sent the boys to live with there dad and saw them every weekend until there dad decided he didnâ€™t want me seeing them ( I havenâ€™t seen them in a year) My partner proposed and I thought omg this is it I gave up my place and moved in with him it last 4 months before he kicked me out I was homeless sleeping in my car outside a gym.
But I pulled myself together for him to only return after 9 months to say he wanted children he missed me and he wanted to get married I miscarried after 2 months and he left I lost my job I couldnâ€™t get out of bed I have to vacate my property in 2 days so I will be homeless in Melbourne Australia I cannot go Home to Nz because of my fines parking and loans I took out.
I have $100 left I have decided to use charcoal in my car with alcohol.
