Will probably kill myself in a few hours or later today (as it's only 16 minutes past midnight for me).I struggled for so long with trying to surpass survival instinct or figure out a way to kill myself, but today I realized the perfect/easiest method (for me) was in front of me, and now I'm drunk and have everything needed in my room to follow through, as long as I don't black out first.

Hopefully I commit to it.
