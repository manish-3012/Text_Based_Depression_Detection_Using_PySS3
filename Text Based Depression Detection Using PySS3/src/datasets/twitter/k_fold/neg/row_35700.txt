I want to die, but Iâ€™m too scared of death.for years Iâ€™ve had weeks on and off of just wanting to kill myself. 
Iâ€™m only 15, but I just canâ€™t do it anymore guys. 
my parents suck (my dads an alcoholic) my friends donâ€™t care about me, I donâ€™t have any joy in life besides my dog. 
Iâ€™ve tried to overdose, but it didnâ€™t work. And since then Iâ€™ve been too scared to die, but I donâ€™t want to live.  Iâ€™ve tried to think of methods I could easily just die and I canâ€™t think of one. this sucks, Iâ€™m too dumb and scared to even kill myself. 
I keep thinking things will get better, but they never do!
