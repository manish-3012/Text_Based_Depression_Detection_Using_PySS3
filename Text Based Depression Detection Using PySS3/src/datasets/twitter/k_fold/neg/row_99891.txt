I just need helpEverything is going wrong, my life isn't bad, i don't need anything because i have everything i want. I don't wanna die, but i'm so tired of always feeling tired of living, because it's just so boring and stupid... i feel empty, everything i do is wrong and people keep reminding me that. I don't like people because it's too hard to have a social life, so i have no friends.

I'm always the fucking problem with people and i'm so fucking done with that, i'm considering killing myself (tried it 6 months ago or so by overdose, didn't work) and i know i need help, as much as possible, at the point i was considering going to a mental health hospital... I don't know what to do, i just don't know.
