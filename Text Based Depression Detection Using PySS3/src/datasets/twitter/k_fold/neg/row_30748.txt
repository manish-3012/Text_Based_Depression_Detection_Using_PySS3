The view from halfway up.I canâ€™t leave the work parking lot. Itâ€™s a hospital and Iâ€™m supposed to be a doctor. Iâ€™ve been here for two hours just sitting crying and kind of stuck. 
I know if I drive down the multi-storey carpark and drive home, I wonâ€™t be able to come to work tomorrow, probably having done something. 
I also canâ€™t go up, I know how easy it would be to jump. 

Iâ€™m just stuck.
