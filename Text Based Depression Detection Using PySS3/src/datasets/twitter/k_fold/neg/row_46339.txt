trying to die whats the fastest and most painless wayim thinking popping a bunch of xanax and just never waking up.....my "guardian" was upset that i snuck out to visit a friend for 3 hours because he was leaving out of the country for school but plans to start a new life there...so technically a very close friend leaving forever.  my guardian then calls my boss at work and hes now pissed that i lied to him that i went home (but intead snuck out).   she told me to get out of the house (i am a struggling opiates addict/ but as of now i am semi clean (methadone program)...my boss doesn trust me anymore and i feel hes going to let me out of the job at some point...if it ever came to that point im going to have nothing going for me...working so hard and potentially making a lot of money (telemarketing).   the day i snuck out for 3 hours...my guardian called me sayingWHERE ARE U...told me to come out and pack my things and leave....as i was about to leave she told me to give me my phone..im like...i paid for this phone, dont worry im going to leave and find a way to die bye.  10 minutes later she then comes out and tells me to go back in the house...so everything is back to normal now except now my boss just hates my guts and i dont blame him.

i dont care if he is mad, but what i did was non work related and if i were to be punished AT work for something i did outside of work....im about to just give up....i know lying was bad but even if i asked to go hang out wit ha friend...the answer wouldve been no...sorry for random rant..i wouldnt mind dying if the people that cared aboutme just gave up on me...i put myself in this positino and im willing to just die to make it easier for everyone else,  long story short i basically got in trouble for NOT doing drugs . (usually its for drugs)
