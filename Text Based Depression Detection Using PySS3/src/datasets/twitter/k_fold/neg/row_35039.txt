I'm doneIn the last six months my life has gone to shit and I can't take it anymore. My amazing girlfriend dumped me and won't even talk to me, and then I got put on medical leave from school due to having two seizures with no history of seizures in my life or family. Now I can't drive or return to school for the next sixth months. Every time life seems to be going my way and I am genuinely happy it all gets torn away from me and I'm tired of it. I have no money my career is in the toilet and the girl that I love wants nothing to do with me. Today is the day I shoot myself and get it over with. I feel like a useless piece of shit, nothing but a burden on those around me. I'm sorry everyone but I just can't deal with this anymore.
