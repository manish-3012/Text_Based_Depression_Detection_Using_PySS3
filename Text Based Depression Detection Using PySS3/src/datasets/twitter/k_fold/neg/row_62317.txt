I don't care about anything except the people that I'd hurt by dyingIs there a way to make it hurt less for people? I've been trying to distance myself but I know it'd still hurt the people that know me. I don't want to live in this world anymore. Everything sucks immensely and I have no passions or desires for anything. Life is absolutely meaningless.
