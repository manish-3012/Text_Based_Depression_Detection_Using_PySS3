Made usage of the suicide prevention hotline service for the first time in a while today.I'm not proud that I had to, but I'm proud that I did. Suicidal ideation has been hitting me hard recently and it all came crashing on me this evening in a downward spiral of not knowing what I want in life and using that as a weapon to destroy the good things that I have. I don't know what paths to take to happiness, for me it my loved ones, and I'd rather just take myself out of the equation.

I didn't die today, though.
