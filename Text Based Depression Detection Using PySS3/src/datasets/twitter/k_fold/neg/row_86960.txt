Can't get the thought out of my headI try to keep myself busy so I can avoid thinking of suicide, yet even just in the middle of any activity I will think, "I want to kill myself".

How do I just get the thought out of my head. Sometimes it is passive, and sometimes it is at the forefront. I have been doing everything I can to keep myself here. I just...can't.

Two hospitalizations, several group meetings, several psychiatrists...it just doesn't leave...will it ever leave?
