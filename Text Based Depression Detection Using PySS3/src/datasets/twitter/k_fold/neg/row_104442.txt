I decided a date.I used to have intrusive thoughts that I never really thought anything more about after a few hours and occasional thoughts of suicide, but life is bad. Life is really bad. I started self harming again. Life keeps getting worse.. I know youâ€™ve heard it all before. February 15th 2019. My favorite holiday is Valentineâ€™s Day. Iâ€™d like to spend one more with my boyfriend before I go. That would be a nice way to go.
