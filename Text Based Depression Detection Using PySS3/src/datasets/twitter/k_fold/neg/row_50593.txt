I hate myself and wanna end it all soonSo I have realized Iâ€™m an ungrateful fuck, my parents have worked so fucking hard to save money and send me to school in the US, and now there is a possibility I might fail out, itâ€™s not a done deal yet and I need like all As on my finals and Iâ€™m working my ass off and I still have 10 days till my finals. 

Laziness has been the sin Iâ€™ve constantly been committing, I am actually a smart student but Iâ€™m unorganized and unmotivated and surround my self with bad company. On top of that my gf broke up with me today. Iâ€™m so fucked rn that the gf things barely bothers me rn.

If I happen to not make it to the next semester, I donâ€™t have the balls to make the call to my parents and tell them, I would rather die and start over I guess. The only thing is that my parents fucking love me cause they think Iâ€™m a very good son, I cannot break their heart and disappoint them, if I fail out I have nowhere else to go,

But on a positive note, Iâ€™m studying my ASS off and mathematically I can still pass if I gets As in all my finals.

Iâ€™ve literally started praying to god and asking for forgiveness for being lazy ungrateful and negligent.

This is prolly the hardest time of my life cause if I donâ€™t get thru this Iâ€™m done I have no where to go and I could never live with the burden of disappointing the people who have faith in me. 

God, how did I fuck up like this? I just need a chance to prove that Iâ€™ve learnt from this fuck shit and Iâ€™m being a more responsible person. 

Pray for me guys for real I need some blessings an positivity radiated towards me.

I hope you guys have a nice day/night. God bless you all and hope anyone going thru fucked up situation I will be wishing for your well being as well.
