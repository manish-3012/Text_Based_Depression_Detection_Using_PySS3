Iâ€™m awake but my thoughts are nightmaresIâ€™m not doing well. Life is tough. I have medication, therapy, a routine filled with everything they told me to do and two people who love me unconditionally. But that doesnâ€™t stop the memories, the flashbacks, the mood swings, the self-harm, the shame and guilt of surviving what I have. 

Iâ€™m lying in bed, three hours before my alarm, going over ways that I can successfully kill myself.
I need to write this out before I do something impulsive, something detrimental to my sons life.. Thank for giving me an outlet. I can promise myself another hour at the least.
