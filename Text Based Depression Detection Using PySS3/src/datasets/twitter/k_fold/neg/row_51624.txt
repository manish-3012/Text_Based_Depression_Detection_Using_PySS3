I'm sick of living.It genuinely feels like my only option to solve all of my problems is death. I'm so fucked in the head. I'm such a waste of space and everyones time. I feel like everything that I do wrong is almost always my fault and I am powerless to fix it because I'm so pathetic and weak. Life is not a gift. It is a curse.
