A Reason To LiveUp until today, I hadn't even admitted to myself that I was seriously planning to off myself. I started talking to someone recently, purely platonic. She's six years older than me. I've never had an easy time admitting things to myself. Didn't even acknowledge the possibility that I could be anything other than cishet until eight grade. Even then I didn't really even try to understand until my freshman year. She, she's my catalyst. I've known her for two weeks and I realized that she's one of the main reasons I'm not dead. I stopped using social media. I stopped writing on Ao3. I stopped everything cause I didn't want to interact with people in any way. But then she told me she cared about me. She told me that I was a friend. That she loved me like a little brother. She's the reason I flushed my bottles of painkillers. She's the reason I started really writing again. She didn't even know what I was planning. I didn't even really know what I was planning. I just kept lying to myself. But she, as cheesy as it sounds, saved me. I owe my life to her. I owe everything to her. She's showing me love and compassion and understands what I'm going through. She hasn't backed away cause she found out how bad it really was. I can't put into words how much she matters to me. She's the only thing in my life that's actively there for me. I love her. More than I can express. She's my rock. She's there for me. She listens. And I do my best to return the favor. I can't believe someone across the country is the reason I'm still alive, but I'm not complaining.
