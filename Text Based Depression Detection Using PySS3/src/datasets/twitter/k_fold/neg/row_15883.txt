Lonely and suicidalFeeling so low ..struggled with depression for years ..tried meds and therapy but no joy really with either ..been looking up ways of ending it for days now sat here at home alone with really bad anxiety/panic attack ,just really want to sleep forever...I wrote an email to doc,Samaritans and some other helpline but no response yet..I just feel so embarrassed lonely and pathetic!! Whatâ€™s wrong with me ..Iâ€™m a 52 year old man and I feel like Iâ€™m behaving like a kid..keep telling myself to man up and sort myself out but just seem unable to ..Iâ€™ve read so much of other peoples stuff on here so I know Iâ€™m not alone in feeling like this and other peoples posts have had me in tears all day ..itâ€™s so sad that so many people are so unhappy ..Iâ€™ve  even ordered helium of Amazon to end it ,Iâ€™ve got belt and towel to hang myself sat right in front of me ..donâ€™t know if I have the stones to do this but I canâ€™t go on feeling like this
