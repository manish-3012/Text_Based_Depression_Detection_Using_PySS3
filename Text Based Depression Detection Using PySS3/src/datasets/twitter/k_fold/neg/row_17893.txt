I feel nothing.Iâ€™m talking with someone from the Crisis Text Line and I understand that they have certain ways to approach situations but Iâ€™m such a fuck up I canâ€™t even phrase what I mean correctly and like Iâ€™m just dancing around the situation.

I feel like I need to cry and I also know I should probably talk with someone because Iâ€™ve thought about ending it so much recently but when I think about who I have...well no one.

I guess my old friend was right, if I keep pushing people away, Iâ€™ll end up alone. Bitter ending I guess.
