SummerSummer is approaching and I am terrified.

Three years ago I was arrested and brought to a mental hospital right before summer began.

Two years ago I was admitted to the same hospital, right before summer began.

One year ago the police came into my house and brought me to the same hospital, fortunately the doctors in the emergency room let me leave. This also happened right before summer.

Summer is approaching soon and I am very scared. These events mentioned above have been becoming less dramatic over the years, but they have always been traumatic for me.

The thought of impending doom is weighing down on me. I want to die so badly.
