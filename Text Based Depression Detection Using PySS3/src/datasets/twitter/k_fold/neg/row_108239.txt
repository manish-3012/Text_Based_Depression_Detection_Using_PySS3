I need some adviceI don't know if I should cut off contact with my friend or not. I'm hurting him and I'm a toxic friend. I don't do it on purpose but I really am hurting him. My mind is a mess and I'm really unstable and often really suicidal. I know he doesn't trust me anymore and I'm afraid I'll cause him stress. I know he already has his own problems he has to deal with. I have tried to cut off contact with him but he doesn't allow me to do that. He doesn't understand that I'm only thinking what's the best for him. I really care about him and he is pretty much the only one who I can talk to. If I cut off contact with him I'll be alone with my thoughts but I don't want to bother him anymore. I'm just a burden. I'll never be a good friend
