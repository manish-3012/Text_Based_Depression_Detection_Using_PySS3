I ready to die nowHi folks,

So I am feeling suicidal right now, felt the same last night too. I have little reason to feel like this. I have a good job that I enjoy with amazing co workers. I have the blessing of family. Dont have many friends but few is better than many. I have amazing pets that I love to bits. I have a lot going for me right now.

However I just want to die. I know I shouldn't want to, there are millions of people in worse situations with smiles on their faces. 

I tried to suffocate myself 3 times last night, all of shich I blacked out on but woke up each time. Tried again today as I just don't care anymore, evidently I am not very good at suicide, should have studied it in college but I chose dumb A levels I didn't complete instead. 

I don't really know what I am going to do, I've tried all the help I have access too and thought I got better but here I am wanting to end it. I think the worst part is I don't even care what my family would think if I ended it. 

I think I am just prolonging my hopefully final attempt but venting at this point so I will wish you all a great day or night and will update you if I'm still alive.

Laters.
