I feel like I can't handle the pressure anymore.First off, before writing this I took 30mg of Melatonin (a very safe (although high) dose of a very safe sleep aid) to try to get me to crash out. So if I don't/stop replying it just means it worked, will check in in the morning.

This is my first time ever posting to this sub. I don't really know what to do right now. I am (was?) A paramedic that has been off work struggling hard with PTSD. While I have made improvements with EMDR and CBD I feel like I'm a shell of my former self. The past few weeks have been especially bad for my anxiety and depression. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get better. I've been off work for over a year now and I feel like I just can't keep going on like this. 

All I want is to go back to work. I really love my job. I love helping people. 

I feel so alone right now. I have friends that care about me and are concerned, but none of them really understand what I'm going through (none of them are EMS). I'm so sick of being alone. I just really want to die so that all this pain will stop.
