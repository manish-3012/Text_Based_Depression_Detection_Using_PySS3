Well I figure I have 24 to 48 hours left...After a suicide attempt last year I did what every one said and gave it time, took the pills and had the counseling.  I still feel the same and am tired of being broken.  I am in the process of drinking as much antifreeze as i can stomach before i pass out (because of that bitter shit they put it in it now a days it is a bitch to knock these back)  No one will look for me for a rather long time.  I don't have a note, i don't think there is anyone around who i would even write it to... Any ways i needed something somewhere to prove i existed for just a bit until i am gone. Thanks for your time.
