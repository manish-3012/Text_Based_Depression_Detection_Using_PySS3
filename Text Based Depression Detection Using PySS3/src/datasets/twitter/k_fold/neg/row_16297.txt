IdekI feel so blah, everything seems so pointless. I see ppl everyday and itâ€™s like itâ€™s all simulated. Sometimes ppl catch me looking sad and ask but i have no answer i dont want anyone to know how pathetic i am

Im always in pain, i cant focus on anything, i am constantly binge eating and putting myself in danger

I go to counseling i make plans i fail i repeat, 2 years of the same garbage and i cant take it anymore. I was in contact with a covid case last week and i was so releived, i thought i would just get sick and die a natural death

Of all the people i was the only negative, what kind of fucked up fate do i have where I am condemned to suffer

Disease after disease, people treating me like shit only to apologize and move on. In the one left to deal with the peices and the pain. 

Thereâ€™s so much pain, physical, emotional, mental. The last 3 years have left me empty and the future just doesnâ€™t even seem necessary, why should i wait for more tragedy heartbreak or sick days when i can just end it all now.

I want to watch my wrists bleed out so i donâ€™t have to watch tm play out.
