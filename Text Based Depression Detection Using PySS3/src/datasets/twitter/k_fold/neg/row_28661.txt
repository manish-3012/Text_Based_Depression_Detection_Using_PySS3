Pondering scenarios where it's okay to take your own life. Details in post'Okay' might be the wrong word, and I hope this doesnt break rules but...



I'm thinking about a scenario where a person wants to commit suicide, doesnt have friends or family, and is unemployed. They dont get joy from any hobbies or activities. Very much just a wake up and wait for sleep, rinse and repeat life. Let say it's been this way for a decade now.



And I'm sorry for what seems like a bullshit post. Im wondering what advice a doctor would give to a person like this, and I'm curious if there ever can be a point where there is some unspoken agreement that someone living a such a numb life doesnt need to feel guilty for committing suicide. 



I hope this isnt offensive and doesnt break rules. I'm struggling to find the best words and struggling to even understand myself what I want to say.
