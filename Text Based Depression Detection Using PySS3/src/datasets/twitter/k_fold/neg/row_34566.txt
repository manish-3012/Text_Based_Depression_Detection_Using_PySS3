A loved one died and all I could think of during the ceremony was how much I wish they were my ashes being scattered?How quickly does life go by? Do you really get to 50 and feel like you were 20 just yesterday. I don't know how I can think about going on if it's not like that. I wish so much I could just be burned to ashes, one with the ground beneath.
