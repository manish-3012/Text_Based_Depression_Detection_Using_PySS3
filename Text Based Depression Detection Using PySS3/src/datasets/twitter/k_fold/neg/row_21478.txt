I'm going to do it.I have a few steps planned but with them comes a slightly longer wait-time. It should happen before my birthday in September, which I'm thankful for. Every birthday of mine has been miserable and full of regret for my existence, I don't want to go through another.


Nobody responded to my last post when I posted a few days ago so that helped this sink in and settle. My family is getting increasingly dysfunctional and miserable. I have no friends. No solid foundation in my life. No positive aspects. My past attempts failed. I'm so fucking exhausted. 


I should feel more relieved when I get through the few steps.
