A Toad in Boiling WaterSince the day I was born I've been like a toad slowly boiling in a pot of water. I also feel as though I was a rare animal evolved on a far away island, to survive only on that island. I've also always foreseen the issues that would arise in  my life and while I could solve one or two on my own they were bigger than myself, requiring that somebody would help me. No one was really ever there though even when they wanted to be. 

I had productive things to do today but having nothing entertaining or distracting to do, I just went for a drive. Today as I drove I couldn't stop thinking about hitting the gas and ending it all but I constantly got myself out of it by coming up with something to do or a place to go. Eventually, I made it back home and realized again there never anything to do. I bamboozled myself and I should've just hit the gas.
