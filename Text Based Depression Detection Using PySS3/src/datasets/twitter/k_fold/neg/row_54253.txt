The struggle of an inside battleGuys, just before I start I would like to say that I am not contemplating suicide by any means, I just want some advice on how to tackle my mental illnesses. I am a 16 year old male who lives in the uk, I do pretty well in school (mostly straight Aâ€™s), I am quite popular and I get along with the girls in school. It seems like I have got things pretty sorted out. However this assumption is wrong, every morning is a mental battle for me, I love to sleep to escape reality. I suffer with bad anxiety and Iâ€™m probably mildly depressed at this point. My anxiety causes me to believe I am things Iâ€™m not (I went through a phase of hocd which is unwanted thoughts of the same gender). My anxiety tried to make me question my sexuality because I thought a guy was handsome. Isnâ€™t that ridiculous? Well I just wanted to know if thereâ€™s any advice available, every day I feel like giving up on school even though I have the potential to be a doctor. I feel like this because I know my mind will never be truly at rest and each day there is new mental battle. Please if anyone has any advice, please tell me.
