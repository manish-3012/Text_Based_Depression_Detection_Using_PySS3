Feel so fucking awful, all I want is help and someone to take me seriously and I don't know what to do.I've been trying so hard to get better, I was going weekly to therapy and had a very good therapeutic relationship with my therapist. She understood and listened was funny called me out on my shit and we were doing really good work together. She told me two weeks ago she has breast cancer, and for at least the time being while she has surgery and treatment, our sessions can't go ahead. She had her supervisor make a recommendation for someone else for me to see but I haven't been able to give them a call. This is especially sore for me as my mother has stage 4 melanoma. 

I also went to my doctor 2 months ago, I told them I strongly suspect that I have Borderline Personality Disorder, I was referred to a specialist. It took two months for them to reject my referral, I don't know why, they told me they explained in a letter to my doctor, it will take 3 weeks before I can see my doctor again according to the online services. I have booked the appointment.

I can't believe that I have been rejected without an initial interview, without a phone call, without even doing a questionnaire or something. Why won't someone take me seriously? I want to die. I want help and I want to be understood. I want to understand why I am the way that I am and why I feel like I find everything so much more difficult than other people and why everything is so painful to me. I can't do this anymore especially when nobody is there to help me.

I'm a fucking loser I can't hold down a job or a relationship, I'm living with my mother as a carer and I'm just a waster that smokes a lot and cries all the time I can't do it anymore.
