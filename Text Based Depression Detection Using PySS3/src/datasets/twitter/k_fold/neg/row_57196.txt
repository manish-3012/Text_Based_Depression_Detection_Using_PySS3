Failed another examination attemptThird attempt of pre-defence was failed. If I'll fail my last attempt tomorrow, I'll have to wait until autumn. And probably -- pay money for having another attempt. 

I need to rethink everything till tomorrow. But I just can't. I'm worn out. 

I want to hang myself this night. Or throw myself out of window. 

I'm so fucking tired of everything.
