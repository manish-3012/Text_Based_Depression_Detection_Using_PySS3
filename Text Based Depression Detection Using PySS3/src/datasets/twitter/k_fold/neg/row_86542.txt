Not sure exactly...I have wanted to die since returning from iraq over a decade ago. I have tried everything. Prescriptions, therapy... Nothing seems to help. Then when daily little things get added on it is all i can take. The va doesnt help, it seems like the would rather I kill myself than help. I'm just lost and it would be better if this sad show was over.
