I wish the car crash would have killed meI was involved in a crash the other night due to a drunk driver.  Airbags deployed, EMS called, the whole deal.  Somehow no one got hurt.  

I didnâ€™t see my life flash before my eyes.  I didnâ€™t think â€œI still have so much to doâ€.  I didnâ€™t think about how lucky I got.  

The only reason Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t die in that crash is because I wouldnâ€™t want that to weigh on the conscious of the driver.  Pretty much the same reason I havenâ€™t gotten the balls to kill myself yet.
