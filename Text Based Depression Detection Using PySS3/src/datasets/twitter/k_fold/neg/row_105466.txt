I'm trapped and don't know how to get help.Hello reddit.
I made a new account on here because I am really close to losing it. I'm 15 and I've always been anxious and frequently experience extreme lows, to the point where I plan out my death in great detail and write letters to my family just in case. 

I really want to get help, and hearing about all the help people get from trained therapists, psychologists, etc. just sounds so amazing. However, my mother is extremely religious and strict, and she doesn't believe in mental illness or therapy. Once I asked her, theoretically, how she would feel if one of her children had a mental illness and wanted to go to therapy. She said that kid would be "a disgrace to the family" and said she would disown them. 

It's slowly killing me, to hold in all of these feelings of suicide and hopelessness. I don't want to be selfish, because I love my family and we are very close, yet old-fashioned. I want to talk to someone and get help, but I know that if my mother found out, she would slap me or disown me. 

I don't know what to do... I can't kill myself (my small, tight-knit family would probably go insane over grief) and I can't get counseling or therapy. Will I have to keep living a life I don't want and keep quiet about my pain forever? 

Please help. I can't do this hidden emotion thing much longer. I don't know how to get help, with my restrictive family.
