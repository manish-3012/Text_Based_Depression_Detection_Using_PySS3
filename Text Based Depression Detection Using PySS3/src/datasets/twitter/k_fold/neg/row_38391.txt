Please tell me what I have to live for.I am writing this plea in crisis. 

I have struggled with major depressive disorder and panic disorder for the past four years. I have be rotting away since then, I have lost every job as a result, failed out of college, lost contact with every single friend I have ever had. I was raised by abusers and have no blood to turn to.

The only thing keeping me alive has been my husband, through every job, through every rough spot, through every pain he has been there. But the pain is too much, I am only alive to keep him happy. I can't kill myself, it would ruin him, he would never be the same.

Today I sat down and talked with my husband, confirmed he isn't happy being with me and wants to live a better life. I want this for him too, it is not his duty to keep me on life support while mental illness eats me alive. After 7 years of being together, we've decided together we would be better apart.

The problem is that I've lied. I love him more than anything, I've only agreed so that I can be alone and not feel guilty about taking my life. I can stop suffering and the person I love can be happy.

I don't want to fight, I don't want to keep trying, I want to sleep. I have no one in the world to turn too. I've been a burden to my love for too long. 

It may not take me tonight, it hasn't taken me yet, but my husband is the last thread tethering me to life and we've decided together he's better without me. 

I have nothing Reddit, please tell me how to survive the night.
