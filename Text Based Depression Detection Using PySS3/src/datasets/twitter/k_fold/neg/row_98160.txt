Hopefully my last words. F14Its currently 2:39am in New zealand and iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide all night. I would just like to thank everyone for all the support and messages. Iâ€™ve had reddit for not long and already got so many, it helped... but not enough. Nothing can ever make me happy again, iâ€™ll never be the same. Iâ€™ve lost myself. My head is always hurts. My heart feels like itâ€™s been ripped out and been stabbed a million times. Iâ€™m going insane. My brain is overthinking every single thing i do. I canâ€™t do it anymore, i canâ€™t handle it! Iâ€™ve had enough. My mum doesnâ€™t love me anymore, maybe just a little bit but she doesnâ€™t care about me. The rest of my family has literally forgotten about me. I got no birthday wishes from any of them, nothing. My self harm scars make me insecure. I canâ€™t tell my mum that I self harm so I always have to wear hoodies and jeans or long stuff. I hate every single thing about myself. I have no friends at all, I canâ€™t get good grades, I get bullied all the time. I am even getting bullied for rumours that weâ€™re spread last year. At a school I donâ€™t even attend anymore. The drama and pain just follows me wherever I go. I canâ€™t open up to anyone and the only few people I could open up to have left me, or passed away. I canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m going to try to overdose and drink alcohol with it. If that doesnâ€™t work, then I will try again. Iâ€™m not going to stop until I finally end my life. Goodnight.
