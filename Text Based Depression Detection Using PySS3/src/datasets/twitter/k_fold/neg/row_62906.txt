Service dog growled at another service dog. Girl is spreading rumors my dog attacked her dog.Iâ€™ve been crying and panicking and crying and cutting myself. Note I am in college

My service dog likes to have her space with other dogs, which is fine. But I was talking to someone in the hall and didnâ€™t notice the girl with the other dog. While my back was turned my dog lunged and growled at her dog. I felt really guilty and apologized. 

On my way to my 2nd class another person from her class talked to me and told me the girl was telling everyone that my dog attacked and was biting her dog. 

Iâ€™m scared to go back out. I donâ€™t want people to look at me and judge me like Iâ€™m back in high school. Iâ€™ve always had severe depression and anxiety. Iâ€™ve been doing really good with managing my suicidal thoughts but after this event I just broke. 

I just spent an hour pacing and sobbing in my dorm room with no clothes on my bottom half because I cut myself on my pantie line and was bleeding. 

I tried hanging myself by laying on the floor with a noose tied to the bed but it didnâ€™t work. I might try the doorknob tomorrow.

Iâ€™m skipping all my classes tomorrow. I just canâ€™t. I want to fucking die. I really want to fucking die.


TLDr: my service dog growled at another service dog bc she was startled. Other handler is telling everyone my dog bit and attacked her dog. People looking at me funny. Cut myself and trying to hang myself. Wanna die.
