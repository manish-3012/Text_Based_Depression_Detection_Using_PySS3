Does everyone feel that weird stomach feeling when they think about doing somthing badEverytime I think about somthing, I get this almost extreme nervous feeling like a pit in my stomach then it goes away after a couple seconds. I don't really understand but I dont wanna ask anyone in real life about this. I get it everyday mutiple times per day and somtimes I start to panic while it happens.
