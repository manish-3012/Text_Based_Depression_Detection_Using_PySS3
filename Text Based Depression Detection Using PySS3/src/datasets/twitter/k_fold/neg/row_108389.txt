istg im losing itAnd I know you still fucking stalk my reddit, I know youâ€™re seeing everything Iâ€™ve been going through, yet I havenâ€™t heard from you. It would have been our anniversary today, I stayed up till midnight hoping youâ€™d text. Waited until 1pm cos thatâ€™s when you usually wake up, still nothing. So Iâ€™ve slept the whole day, not ate anything so I almost fainted. Why donâ€™t you fucking care? I hate myself for missing you
