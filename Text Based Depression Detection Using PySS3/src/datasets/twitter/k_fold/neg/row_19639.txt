I can't get a job. I can't get out of here.I need to get out of this place. It is hell here. But I have no idea how I'm supposed to get hired. I'mâ€‹ 20 and have no experience and no degree, that's a huge red flag already. What am I supposed to say I've been doing for three years since high school? I can't tell them I flunked university, they'll never give me a chance then. I'm not attractive, have no people skills. So what else is there? There is no way out. I'm going to die in this house.
