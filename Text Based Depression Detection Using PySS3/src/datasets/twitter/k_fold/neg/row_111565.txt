To anyone who cares to read thisYou're probably a much better person than I am and you deserve the world.

I've fucked up in multiple ways, pushed away good people, and destroyed my life. I don't wanna live and keep worrying other people, pushing others away because of how mentally fucked I am. I have nothing going for me.

I don't know when or how but I wanna end my life to stop being a burden on others and to save me from myself.
