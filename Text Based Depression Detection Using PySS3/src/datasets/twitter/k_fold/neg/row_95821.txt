I wanna kill myself so fucking badEveryday, every fucking day I fantasize going on a rampage and then killing myself to bed. I am sick and tired of living. The only things stopping me from doing so are my parents. This is so fucking unfair, I have no reason to be sad. I may have ran into some problems in the past but I've convinced myself into believing that's not the problem. I have Bipolar, my moods range from extreme happiness to rage and anger. God fucking help me if someone comes around bullshitting their way through my room and I run into them. 

I can't believe that I've actually given murdering my parents a thought before killing myself so they wouldn't have to go through the pain of seeing my dead body. For fucks sake I just don't want to live anymore. 14 fucking years of depressive bullshit (I'm 22, got my first hit at depression at the age of 8). I've experimented with all kinds of meds (on 1600mg of lithium right now) as prescribed by my doctors. It's time for me to pass on. 

Do not give me shit on how it's going to be ok because it never does. Happiness lasts for a week or two only swirling my sorry ass back into sadness for 6 months.
