Maybe it's time.22M, been depressed for a decade, suicidal for 8 years, i have no friends, been bullied and outcasted in every school/workplace i went to. Every time bad things happens i just lie to myself ' life gets better ' it never does, does it? People tell me its selfish to kill myself, but nobody is ever there for me, i suffer in silence every night for as long as i can remember, 'friends' tell me how i fail to see how people care about me and im only thinking of my own pain, but where are these 'people' when its 3am in the night and i need a hug, need some love, need someone to listen to me, or to just sit there in silence with me. There's nobody. All my 'friends' leave me, everybody leaves. My recent girlfriend who was everything i need, you know that feeling when you just see everything you want in a person? that's who she was. she broke up with me on my birthday, told me she only stayed because she pitied me. I gave everything. in every friendship, in every relationship i gave all that i can. Every time i tear down my walls i just get reminded to why i built them up. Maybe Im just impossible to love. I'm just a useless pathetic piece of human trash. I'll never be good enough for anyone. Maybe life isn't for me. Maybe I should had killed myself back then, instead of lying to myself it gets better. It never does. It never does. If you read this far, thank you. It's 2.30am , i'm tired, i'm in pain, i'm just typing pretty much nonsense now. I wish i was dead. Maybe it's time.
