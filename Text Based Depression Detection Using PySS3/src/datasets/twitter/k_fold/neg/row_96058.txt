I'm really scared I don't know why I'm writing this, I don't expect anything to help. Maybe I'm just looking for attention like my Dad says. Maybe I just want someone to say something nice for once. Maybe I just want to rant. I don't know.                                  

 Today was the day I was supposed to tell my Psychiatrist that I thought I was a danger to myself and ask to go back to a mental hospital, at least for a little while. But I didn't. I don't know why but now I'm just sitting on my bed with my suicide note written staring at my pills trying to convince myself to just take it all and fall asleep and just drift away. But I'm so scared and I don't know if I can do it. Maybe I should tell someone and ask them to help me go back into hospital, but why bother? I've already gone and it only helped for a little while and now I'm worse then ever before. I want to take it so bad, but I'm so scared.

Sorry that this probably doesn't make much sense, I can't make sense of myself right now.
