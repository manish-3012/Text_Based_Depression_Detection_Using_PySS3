I've bought a gun.Finally, I have done it. I've been waiting so long to work up the courage to purchase a gun. Anxious thoughts about how it was going to be suspicious kept me from going, but somehow I got past them. I really must be desperate. I can't stand the mental agony anymore. Why do I have to be so unhappy when I am successful and try so hard. I want to die, I want to end the torture of depression, anxiety, and life in general. I've spent hours and hours researching the best bullets and the right location of my head to shoot. I feel relieved honestly. I tried reaching out for help to someone who should have helped and they did nothing. My feelings don't matter, nobody really cares. What else am I left to do but blow my brains out? There's nothing else I would rather do.
