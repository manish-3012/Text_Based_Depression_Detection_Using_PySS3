Iâ€™m not suicidal but I might as well beIâ€™m young. Iâ€™m barely starting my life yet so much has happened that I might as well suicidal. Letâ€™s begin with my family life. My mom is a drug addict. She didnâ€™t get help for many years and she only got it last year because she was gonna lose me and my younger brother. That women left me so many traumatic stuff that I lost care in everything she did. Then now this year she starting to fall back to habit. School, all my friends hate me because I snapped last year when the pressure of everything made me just snap and argue with them. My grades drop after this corona thing because I donâ€™t like online. My first boyfriend that I loved was taken away from me and my mom didnâ€™t let me even be friends with him even though he made me happy. My second boyfriend was probably the best and worst. He was nice and caring but then he lost his memory on just the second week of dating. I couldâ€™ve left since we were so fresh in a relationship and could listen to him say heâ€™s dating his ex but no I stayed a fought and I got him back. But just barley. We started to talk less and less. On my insta his last words were I love you and on my snap he said he knew I loved him and then for a whole week he never looked at my messages and then blocked me on everything. I felt broken. Now Iâ€™m just lost in everything and I just need someone to pull me out.
