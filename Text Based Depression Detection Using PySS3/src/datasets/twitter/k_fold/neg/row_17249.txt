Call an ambulance or police for suicide?Hey, gonna suck down six bottles of sleeping pills tomorrow afternoon, when I do it should I call an ambulance to pick my body up or the police? I'm hoping to not leave a mess for many people. 

Sorry for posting again in this forum, first time I avoided suicide, this time I can't, and I wanna know so I don't rot by the time I'm found. Also, sorry again for adding to this gloomy reddit.

Thanks!
