had to talk my friend down tonightso to celebrate my bday i had a small party with like 8 friends and my best friend got drunk off some cheap wine and got really upset and started talking about how she wanted to be dead and that itâ€™d be better if she wasnâ€™t around etc. it was really scary to hear because i was drunk as well and i didnâ€™t want to fuck it up and say the wrong thing but it made me realize that how much she had been there for me and i was being incredibly selfish not thinking she could be feeling the same way i did. itâ€™s hard to remember that we are not the only people in the world and that hundreds and thousands of people exist outside of our own little bubble and we never know exactly whatâ€™s happening to them.
