Could see myself dying within this weekUsually it's just like once a month over the past couple years or maybe a few times a month where it lasts a week, i just feel zero motivation and I'm either super depressed or flat out numb but this time I feel like I could go through with it maybe?

I want to write a will, leave some of my stuff that's actually valuable to people I care about like my computer and my audio setup. I've got some other electronics that are pretty useful so it'd be a waste to just toss them. Is there a way to guarantee that all my stuff gets to where I want it to get to, even if it's across country borders?

Last time this happened the survival part of my brain just kept trying to make excuses and fair enough I have a bunch of stuff that I'd like to have done after I'm gone but this time I genuinely just wanna tie up all the loose ends like internet accounts and whatnot so that there's nothing left of me that exists other than ashes after I go.

tl;dr: Is there a way to guarantee a will I write is followed after I die; would I need a lawyer or something? And is there any easy way to close all my accounts across the whole of the internet without going to *every single website*?

If there's any week where I'm really feeling ready enough to die it's this one.
