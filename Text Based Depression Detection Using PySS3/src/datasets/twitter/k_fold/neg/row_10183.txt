Help?I'm nothing special. I'm not failing college courses, I don't get beaten, I don't get abused. I got bullied through high school and my dads kind an asshole but that's fine.

My relationship with the most spectacular person is falling apart and I can't fix it. I can't find a job despite turning in over 100 aplications over the course of 6 months.

I can't do it anymore. I have no goal or focus in life, I have nothing, no one cares about me, no one will stop me. I told my girlfriend i was worried i might do it and she didn't even respond to me. You've helped me before. Please, I need you guys.
