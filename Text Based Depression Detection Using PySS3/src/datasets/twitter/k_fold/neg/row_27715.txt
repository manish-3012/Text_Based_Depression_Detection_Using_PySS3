Planning and prepping stage...I have a date and time selected.

I have my methods chosen.

No local hospitals are accepting new patients unless they are involuntary.

Iâ€™m going through with it if I donâ€™t die in surgery.

I have a therapist, she canâ€™t help me. I have a psychiatrist but I refuse to try adding more pills.

I just need to write my note, gather my supplies, choose a location, and then wait...
