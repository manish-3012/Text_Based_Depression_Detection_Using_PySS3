i dont know how to deal with my childhood (this will be long but i need to tell someone this. i am tired of keeping it in my head)hi. im 16 and i am feeling suicidal right now (have been for  months). i know i wont do it because it will devastate my mother and i never want to do that to her but i cant deny that i wish i was dead almost everyday. i don't want to kill myself,  i just want to be dead. thinking about death just makes me feel free and happy. i just feel like i'll be happier in heaven and i long to have that feeling. i lived a very traumatic childhood and i feel like i cant forget the bad memories.

 i need a therapist but i am afraid to tell my mother because she wont understand. i also don't want her to blame herself for my depression and this makes me feel guilty. sometimes i feel like i don't 'deserve' to be sad because my mom tried her hardest to provide us with the best life that she could. however, our life was always very hard and miserable no matter how hard she tried to fix it . i once cried and  told my mom that i felt depressed because of everything that happened when i was a child and she started crying as well telling me that she felt guilty and that our life was the best she could have ever give us. also, she kept saying stuff like "what do you want me to do!?" and " i feel more depressed than you" so i feel like i can't tell how i feel because she makes me feel guilty for being sad. 

since i was younger, money was always an issue. i felt as if money was going to run out and i was always scared of what we would do if that actually happened. so whenever my mom talks about money, i get so nervous and anxious and i just wish i was dead. because my childhood was so stressful (up until last year), i tend to break whenever i encounter a stressful situation. i just cant handle it anymore. i just feel as if my mind is overflowing and is going to explode from stress and anxiety. my childhood was so stressful that i started losing melanin in my skin. so, i ended up with white patches on my body. idk if anyone has this as well.

dont get me wrong, i adore my mum, but she just can't handle my depression because she deals with it as well. so, i never tell her because i fear that it will make her depression worse. i just sometimes pray to god that i die because i feel like im too broken to continue with life. i used to look forward to go to college and continue on with my studies and get a good job and blah blah blah. my parents used to be so proud of but now i feel as if i cant give that to them anymore. i have lost my interest in studying and i feel lost in my dreams. i just feel like i'll never actually have a successful and happy future anyways, so why keep living? 

 i just want to be free from all of this bullshit.
