It's Almost Time.A little under a month ago I posted [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4b4zfz/this_is_my_story/).

After being pulled back from the brink, I told myself I would hold on until my upcoming vacation from work. In the meantime, I've tried to wrap up the last loose ends I have. I've spoken to many people in my life, many of which, I had not seen in quite some time. It was pleasant seeing them again and I'm glad I did it. My vacation starts Monday and lasts almost 2 weeks. Adequate time to get any last minute items taken care of.

I've held on this long, still hoping to turn things around but it's been a losing battle. I've always tried to live a good life and be a good person but somewhere along the way, everything went wrong. The more time has passed, the more I think that it's time to go on my way and see what the next world holds.

I'd like to thank the people that reached out last time and I certainly hope that this community continues to help those who reach out for it. Take care everyone.
