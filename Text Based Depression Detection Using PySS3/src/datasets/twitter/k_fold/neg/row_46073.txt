I read my dad's suicide letterSo my mom wants a divorce and my dad is mentally destroyed. He goes to therapy and takes medication for his anxiety and depression. He also used to take something to help quit smoking but that made him have suicidal thoughts so he stopped. 

Anyways, today they fought while I was at school. Things had been going well before this so idk what happened. He said he was going to give up trying and that there was no way she'd forgive him. He then showed me his notebook that he used to write down his thoughts. 

While going through it, I read his suicide letter. It was short but it still really got to me. He said that he made that way before, but he has talked about killing himself throughout this while thing. Now I can have a normal conversation with him without rushing to the bathroom to cry. 
Idk why I'm even writing this. How can I help him? He already sees therapy but idk. I'm worried.
