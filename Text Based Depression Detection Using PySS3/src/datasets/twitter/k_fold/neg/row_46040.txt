VailedMy careerâ€™s built on a house of cards, and itâ€™s all my fault. I played well until I used my heart as a suit. If a single card topples my life is ruined. Iâ€™m already suicidal all I need is a real reason, so I keep on reaching for the light but that just blocks my field of vision. 

I was a boy scout for a couple months, and have these loose ropes I canâ€™t seem to tie up neatly, music, schooling, and athletics are just among the long list. Because I donâ€™t gamble with money, only addiction; and correspondingly my life as well as future well â€œbeingâ€.

Iâ€™ve laid dormant too long, getting high, trying to escape the foul clutch of human feelings. I did a double tab but never stopped to close my eyes and experience what unknown beauties lay behind. It made everything so vivid, so I over exposed my eyes, had a good cry, and realized all my lies. But once it wore off I forgot them once again, still Iâ€™m reaching for that bright, vivid light I keep on promising to myself. 

As I get older, I fall much harder. Though I seem to be losing weight from my lack of appetite. Disappointment is just over the horizon. My axonâ€™s are a guttural waste land and my brainâ€™s in desperate need of de weeding.
