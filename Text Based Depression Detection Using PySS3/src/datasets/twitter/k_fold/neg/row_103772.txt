Funeral Planning - An Update[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8d1d2o/funeral_planning_do_i_have_to_reveal_my_intent/)

Friday evening a couple friends talked a shotgun out of my mouth.

The next day I saw the funeral planner. She reeked of death. We discussed my options and found that it was $3141 for direct cremation. She was overtly religious and it was very awkward for me to sit there and lie to her about being terminally sick. She looked rather uncomfortable at times Planning this with me. She kept commenting that I was just a baby, that it was extremely rare to get someone my age (26) Planning. I signed all the documents and submitted all my information and took my plan home. The first payment comes out of my bank account tomorrow. The plan is priced to come monthly out over the next 8 years but realistically I could pay it off in 2 months. I just want to lessen the financial stress on my family. 

I promised my best friend that I wouldn't kill myself. For now. He's going through enough. He's had a hard life. He has a hard life ahead of him. I had always thought of and considered him. I just wanted to be considered back. That was too much to ask for. I promised him I would talk to him if I felt this way again. He was one of the ones who begged me not to do it. But I know this feeling won't fade. Soon I probably won't be able to see him again. He's being ripped away from me.

The package comes with a fingerprint imprint necklace. I asked if he wanted it. He said yes. 

So I will bide my time until he's gone. And when he's gone from my life. I'll abandon my own life as well. 

But for now. I will stay alive. It's so hard. I just want to sleep forever.
