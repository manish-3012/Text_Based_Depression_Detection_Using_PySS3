i hate methat sums it up. i hate me. everything about me, i hate. i want to disappear permanently. i don't want to be hear. i can't stand it. sitting here is driving me crazy. i feel it building up inside. i don't know what to do anymore. my thoughts are all over the place and the only way to get it to stop it to die. i can't take being me.
