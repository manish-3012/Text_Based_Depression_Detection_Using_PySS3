I just can't take it anylongerI just can't it anylonger, i'm not old, i'm 25yo, but still i had some depressions along the way. The worst was 2 years ago, i was so low, and the same time hight on weed everyday. The pills make me sleep most of the days, even during class. Everyone knew but noone did anything. After 3 suicide try, where 2 lead me to the hospital, I finally manage to get throught thanks to the pills. But now it all starting over again. The pain, the anxiety, the stress, the fear. All because i have to face a new challenge, work a lot. But i fear so much to work that i end up not working, just crying over myself. And in now 20 days i have to give a memoir that will allow me to go to phd or not. And i don't know how to face the fact that i will not have the possibility to do it. It's killing me inside. And i can't stop thinking about putting a knife in my heart and slice it. It's in the dream i make, i think about it so much, all the time.. I just want to do it, and this time right.
