Iâ€™ve had enoughIâ€™m a 17 year old girl, and Iâ€™ve honestly had enough. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 12, and itâ€™s been rocky since then. Two attempts and multiple instances of self harm. My boyfriend has just broken up with me and this is the final straw. I want to end it all tonight but Iâ€™m struggling with the idea of my family finding me.
