I feel so guilty.A few years ago my best friends mum died, she was like my second mum. She died from cancer. When I was two years old I was diagnosed with cancer, Iâ€™m still fucking here! What did I do to deserve being here more than her??? She has a husband and three daughters, and they miss her so fucking much! It kills me that sheâ€™s never going to see her kids get married or graduate. God, I canâ€™t even sleep at night anymore and Iâ€™m not even exaggerating. I feel so guilty, I donâ€™t know how her daughters can even stand to look at me. I donâ€™t know how I even made it this far. I would do anything to switch places with her, my god I would do it in a heartbeat. She has so many people who miss her and Iâ€™m only 13, itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ve made an incredible life choice yet. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m married or have kids. I just donâ€™t know how long I can go without just ending it. I need to die. And if heaven is real then I know Iâ€™ll never get to tell her how sorry I am because if it is real then I know I deserve to go to hell. I just... Need to try to get up there at least.
