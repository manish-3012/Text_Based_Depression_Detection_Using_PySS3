Birthday wishesHey, all. I just turned another year older, which I guess may be cause for some celebration. But I don't often feel like celebrating on my birthday. I usually just feel like thinking about what the past year was like, and what I might expect the coming years to be like. So, even as I tried to find things to enjoy today, I found myself doing all that again. I thought about the melancholies, disappointments, and failures I've experienced in the past year, and in the years before, and how disheartening that it is that I don't feel able to just cut all the unpleasantness short and end my life already.

I don't feel able because my family has been through enough loss already, and I've given them assurances that they won't experience more of it because of me, but I don't often sincerely believe that my continuing to live is really what's best for the family. I think I spend enough time concerning my family and drawing them into arguments that they really would be better off without me. But I've made my promise to endeavor to keep myself alive, and I can't imagine reneging that promise in the foreseeable future. What hurts is that I don't really want anything in the world more than the ability to take it back and just end it. That's what I find myself wishing for on this birthday more than anything. 

I guess the one thing to appreciate on a day like this is that I'm one year closer to the day on which I inevitably get to lie down, die, and say goodbye to all of this. I don't know that anyone on here can really help me, but I guess I'm reaching out to just express myself or see if someone can help me see things another way. In any case, thanks for reading.
