Best way to end itLifes shit, you find someone and think itll get better but infact it just gets worse because its just 1 more person to let you down, whats the point in living when life is shit and when we die we have nothing left anyway, whats the most painless way to kill yourself, i dont wanna do it yet like cus i still have hope life can be good but yea. Im posting this on reddit cus i dont want anyone around me to know what i think about n shit incase it makes them see me differently or makes them feel bad for me, but i still want people to know how im feeling in a way, idk its complicated but yea, lifes really fucked up and anyone who has kids on this sub, tell them you fucking love them please, trust me, they love you, and if you have depression yourself, tell them that its not their fault cause a lot of people im mates with feel like their parents are depressed because of them, i myself am 14, i dont know why im depressed, cus the only things ive been through are shit like finding out my dad aint my real dad n my real one left me for drugs, which, because i didnt know my real dad, didnt effect me too much, its probably just my mindset or me being the daft cunt i am, if you read through all this thank you, youve read a small fragment of the utter shit that goes on in my head and half of it probably doesnt even make sense but im just typing as i think,
Thank you
