Iâ€™m never enough.I think Iâ€™m gonna try again. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m inadequate. In school I was the weird kid no one wanted to fw. I ate lunch in the girls bathroom the majority of 8th grade. In high school I attempted suicide multiple times, one of the attempts landing me in a coma for 3 days. But Iâ€™ve been to the psych ward countless times. Iâ€™ve been to dbt therapy, cbt, and Iâ€™ve tried so hard to get better but I canâ€™t. It ainâ€™t my life because I have a pretty decent life. I live in the US, am a sophomore in college, and despite my families money issues, my parents have parented me to the best of their abilities. Itâ€™s just me. I am never enough as I am. I donâ€™t fit in with people, and no one will ever love me enough to marry me. Iâ€™m pretty, but my personality sucks so much I donâ€™t see why anyone would ever want me. And even if there was a possibility Iâ€™m done with hope. Whenever I have hope, I get hurt in the end because I expected too much.  Sorry I just needed to talk to someone since I canâ€™t talk to nobody I know in person about this.
