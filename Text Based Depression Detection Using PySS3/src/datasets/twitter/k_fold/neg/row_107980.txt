I wanna kill myself (Long)For years since I was about 13 I have felt depressed I am now 17; The feeling still haven't gone away. I left my old school it was cancerous, too this day the thought of the school highlights my failures. My parents changed my school after someone who was my father figure killed himself. My dad did not care about his death, however why would he the man who killed himself was more of a father than my biological father ever could be. I began going to a private school, its was slightly better. However this year the thoughts have returned with a passion, unlike before they are relentless; I should actually kill myself. Im a waste of space costing my family thousands of pounds a year and Im still failing at life. Life is not worth living for me its endless pain and torture, a pain that I put others threw. Im a terrible person, literally I am the embodiment of everything wrong with society. I try to bring everyone down to my own level of self hatred by destroying people verbally, and sometimes physically. Doing this gives me a sense of power that I will never be able to achieve. I know I havent gone very in depth of my own personal problems however I still wanted someone to know how I feel... Incomplete, a husk of a man.
