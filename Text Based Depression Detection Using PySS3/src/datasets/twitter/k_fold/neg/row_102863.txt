I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to exist. Is that too much to ask?Overall, I just don't like life.  At all.  I don't want to exist; or at least, I don't want to be aware of my existence.  I'm bored with life, and I don't want to do it anymore.  It's like having to play a video game you don't like, and there's no way to quit without causing severe emotional trauma to those around you.

I feel trapped.
