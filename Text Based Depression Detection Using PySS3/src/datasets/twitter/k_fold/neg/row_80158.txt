I just want someone to talk to.I'm home alone on yet another weekend night. I should just work on the weekends so that I don't get so lonely. I suppose I choose to keep my weekends free just in case someone actually wants to spend time with me. My boyfriend's out getting drunk with his buddies and I don't want to be that pain in the ass girlfriend who messages him while he's trying to have fun because he already hates me for being a crazy bitch. Fucking blah blah life story shit. Just talk to me reddit. Please.
