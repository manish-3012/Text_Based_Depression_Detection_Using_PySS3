I think I might end up killing myselfIâ€™ve felt depressed and anxious since I was a child. It always comes back. My meds (citalopram &amp; Xanax) donâ€™t do shit anymore even though I take them exactly as Iâ€™m supposed to. I have these godamn cycles between being alright and wanting to die. I seem to be doing better and than it spirals back down.  Iâ€™m a failure and a disappointment. 
Iâ€™ve even failed at trying to kill myself in the past. Iâ€™ve hid all of this from my parents. I remember breaking down when I was 12 telling my mom that I wanted to die, and I was shown a godamn video that basically said that people who are suicidal are being selfish. And I guess their right, Iâ€™m a selfish fucking asshole with has lost ambition. I went upstairs and took my knife and was going to slit my throat and end it all. Iâ€™m the end I wimped our like the pussy I am. After, I cried harder than I have in years. Everything is a blur and feels fake. I lose track of the days and time and it doesnâ€™t seem to matter anymore. The time before trying to kill myself is some of the most peaceful times Iâ€™ve ever had, like someone has told me itâ€™s going to be okay and I can leave now. I believe in no god or afterlife. I simultaneously want to get help and feel better, but also donâ€™t want to put that on my parents, I wish I could just disappear, die in my sleep and everything will be fine for my family. My belongings can be trashed or sold, my tarantulas can be given new homes, and my dog will be sad initially but she likes my dad better anyway.
I have a therapist, but I only get to speak with her every month and a half to two months for 40 minutes. Iâ€™m not able to change that.
People tell me I have a choice in my schooling and life but every time I want to make a choice Iâ€™m not allowed. Iâ€™m told I simultaneously am smart enough to make that decision and not able to make that decision by the same people.
I just want to fucking end it.
