I'm a total failure in every single aspect of my life 
since the day I was born.I'm in my 30's and not even a grown man.  I have multiple scars from injuries and busted my head while riding a bike.  I have no job, no friends, no life, no girlfriend, still a virgin, I have a severe hearing loss, my ears and head constantly ring with various noises, extremely myopic, my eyes are filled with black and white dots and lines, I have bad yellow &amp; broken teeth, moobs, too much fat in the gut and groin &amp; short stub, phimosis and am deathly afraid of needles.

I've been admitted to psychiatric hospitals twice in the past two years due to depression and anxiety and tried a plethora of antidepressants that had no effect and only made me gain a shit load of weight.

To top it off I still live with my parents and they always play the guilt card and threaten that I would send them to hospital If I ever talk about "leaving".

Everyday I feel like eating a bullet, and every day my will to live decreases.

How do I go on?  How do I convince myself that life is worth living?
