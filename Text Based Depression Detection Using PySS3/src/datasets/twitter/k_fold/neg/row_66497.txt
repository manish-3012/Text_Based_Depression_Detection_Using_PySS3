I have nothing to live for anymore.I just want to die. Why should i continue to live in a world where no one cares?

I can't find a job. I'm working with a friend just to keep myself busy, even though I'm not making any money. I still live with my parents, with no hope of young anywhere, and I'm not exactly young anymore. My parents are well of so they don't complain, but i cannot keep asking them for money.

My girlfriend left me. Even if she didn't, i cannot offer her what i know she deserves. She claims she loves me and she just needs some time apart, but i know that's bullshit. I still love her and dream of marrying her. That's what's keeping me going right now, that maybe she really just needs a break. I can't keep lying to myself. But if i do anything stupid right now, she might think it was her fault, and i can't cause her pain. I don't want to feel pain either. I've been thinking of trying to land myself in the hospital for a couple of days, but I don't know how, and people will notice that something might be wrong. And before anyone tells me anything, no I won't talk about this with anyone. I had someone I could talk to, and now she's gone.

I truly have nothing to live for anymore. This won't pass, I've been feeling like this for a long time. Too long. I was happy for a while, when I met my girlfriend, but now that she's gone, I remember everything i used to feel before her. And i cannot continue living like this. I just want to feel nothing.
