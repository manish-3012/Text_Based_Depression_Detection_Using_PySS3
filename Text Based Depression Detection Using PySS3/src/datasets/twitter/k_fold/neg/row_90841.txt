My family continuously invalidates me and I don't know why I'm staying alive for them anymoreSo they all know that I'm struggling with my mental health, but they don't know anything more than that, and I guess I've hidden everything pretty well. They all started making jokes about suicide and were just laughing about everything and talking about how they were all sure I didn't have any suicidal tendencies. Some of them have fucking watched me try to kill myself. I've tried twice. But apparently my problems aren't that bad and I don't have suicidal tendencies. They don't seem to really believe in any of my problems, actually. They all think self harm is just for attention and refuse to believe that I might do it while hiding it because I explicitly do not want attention for it. They all think I couldn't possibly have an eating disorder (I'm anorexic) because I'm male. They all think I can't have anxiety because I'm quiet about it, I guess? They just invalidate absolutely everything I'm struggling with and then go off talking about how selfish suicide is and how people like me should just get over it. I can't deal with them. Every time mental illness comes up I just feel so much more alone and misunderstood, like why am I staying alive for these people that don't know me and make no effort to understand?
