Somebody went off on me and Iâ€™m going to the dark placeI tweeted an â€œinnocent commentâ€. Somebody picked on ONE word and went off. I even asked a couple of times for a time out as I was feeling shit.

Iâ€™m in my bed now. I relapsed on self harm after being clean for almost 6 months.

I want to jump out of the window of my apartment.

I also donâ€™t want to, but my mind feels on fire and screaming and I need to end everything.

I donâ€™t know what to do.
