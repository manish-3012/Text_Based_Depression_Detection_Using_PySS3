It feels different today...So... I've struggled with suicide for years now and everytime I want to talk to someone they just ignore the fact that I'm completely honest with them. They just shrug it off and say that its "a phase" or "its ok, everyone feels down sometimes" yeah sometimes but not every god damn day over and over plus suicidal thoughts. 

I've been studying business for the past year and realized that its just not for me. Not I want to do something else, I mean I'm only 20 years old I have time right?  My parents are pushing me somewhere where I dont belong and it makes me even more sad when I tell them I dont want to do it anymore because it makes me unhappy, they just change the subject and except me to agree with them. It's like a fucking loop with suicidal thoughts i just cant take it anymore. Everytime I feel like I'm going to harm myself or even end my life I just want to talk to a family member, but they have disappointed me so many times that I dont even try. 

No support from my family when i need to make important decisions. The only person who supports me is my best friend and no one else. 

I've been through this suicide bullshit so many times but this time it feels different it feels worse, that's why I wanted to share it on reddit and ask for your opinion and advice.
