Would someone please tell my husband that I love him? I can't do it.Long story short, I was on the verge of a divorce. 2 kids. Tonight, I found out some things I just cannot handle. I can't be without my family. I love them too much to live without them. Any of them. Can someone please tell my husband? I'm afraid if I call myself, I won't get it out. Thank you.
