I don't know what to doI feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life, even though I'm just 23 years old. That's the core of how I've been feeling for the past two years of my life and even more so these past couple of months. I really do feel like my existence has no meaning. I feel like a constant failure in everything that I do and like I shouldn't even try anymore. There are no meaningful connections in my life â€“ I'd want to have someone to give all my love to and be loved in return, to be understood and heard. But when I feel this way I have no one to talk to, I have absolutely no one to turn to. Maybe that's why I signed up and am now writing this. Today I started to search for tips on how to overdose on regular drugs and that made me realize I'm definitely not okay. I don't know what to do anymore.
