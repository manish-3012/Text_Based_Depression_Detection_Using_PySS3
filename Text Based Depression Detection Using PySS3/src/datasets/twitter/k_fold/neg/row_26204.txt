I hate living and i hate dying.I have a tumor i dont know if it will kill me but i kinda hope it does. I also have a shit job that starts in october. ive never had a grueling desk job but something tells me jts not going to make my life less shitty living with my parents my whole life and just not have anything whatsoever to look forward to. Im 23 and im such a worthless.piece ofcrap i want to die a neet. And yet i also hate being in a hospital or on an operating room table not knowing if i will wake up from surgery. But i admit there is a sort of clarity and peace from knowing you wont have to deal with the shit of life even if the alternate is death. I.just dont know.what to do anymore i go to bed these days telling myself every time i go to bed its the same as.dying to calm myself down ao i can sleep i wake up at the middle of night for seemingly no reason my oncologist tells me its stress probably but i dont know what im stressed about i wanted to be dead before the tumor came along why would i care if something kills me before i do? I dont even know anymore i think i just dont see a good life or a good end anymore. I think i should have killed myself before 2020 i promised myself i would if i was still a neet but i was just too depressed to follow through on any plans. Besides i live with my parents in a small one bedroom apartment not much space to hide tools.like a helium or.nitrogen cylinder.

Im not sure where im going with this but probably noone will ewad this anyway.
