Can't do this anymoreLike everyone here, my life is shit and I can't take it anymore. I want to jump on a plane and never look back but I have no fucking passport so fuck me right. I'd just like to have one goddamn day where I'm not considering driving off a bridge or blowing my fucking brains out.

Seriously one amazing moment where I could be like yeah I've done whatever I can die now. Because everytime I think about ending it in this small town, overly bureaucratic, pissant, satan's asshole of a cock-sucking infected shitshow I just think to myself why am I staying here.

How did I get stuck here dealing with the fact I'm a fucking failure when I could be somewhere amazing being a fucking failure.

I'm blowing all my money on mundane workaday shit when I could be hiking or in the woods or fuck even a great big shithole of a tourist attraction city. Really fucking live before we're all inevitably not anymore.

Because goddamn if there is absolutely fuck-all after death why am I not spending the pissant amount of time with the pathetic amount of money I have on this fucking rock enjoying, I don't know, something.
