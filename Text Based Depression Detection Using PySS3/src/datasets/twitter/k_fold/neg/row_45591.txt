Rage turns into suicidal ideationFor a long time now I've noticed any time I get very angry, I want to kill myself. Yesterday was a good example of that. I was speaking with a recovery coach of mine. We have a great relationship, and part of his job is to challenge me on things. I made a decision on something and he kept asking me over and over again why why why. I kept answering him the best I could, and was finally like, this topic is over. I felt like he was forcing me to cave in to him. Yet I know I am an independent man who can make his own decisions. The outcome of those decisions are irrelevant; it's how I learn and grow a mature adult who is no longer a "yes man."

I noticed, as usual, after the conversation was over, that I wanted to take my life. I have a box cutter on me. I first fantasized about "pleasing" my recovery coach by cutting my jugular "for him." (I have learned for me, personally, this is my distorted way of trying to make someone happy. I know where this stems from and I'm working on this dynamic).

Next thing I knew, I started fantasizing about jumping in front of a high speeding train. I take the train to and from work, and there's a high speed train that speeds through on one of the tracks. I could easily jump on this track and get struck by the train.

Obviously I did not act on these fantasies as you can see. I woke up this morning feeling sad about the conversation I had yesterday. I hold no resentment towards ny recovery coach, I'm just sad. I felt ignored, dismissed, misunderstood, and disrespected.

I feel better just letting this out. It just sucks. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts my entire life. I just discovered this subreddit and it may become a safe place for me to just get my thoughts out.
