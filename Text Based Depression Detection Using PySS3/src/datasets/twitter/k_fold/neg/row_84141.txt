Death by forkEating yourself to death is the cowardly self indulgent way to "do the job." It's slow and relatively painless. It is the easy way out. You don't have to face the fact you don't want to live, just have another bite and put all those thoughts of self harm away as you swallow that decadent bite of carbs laden with animal fat. 

But in reality, every time you bite into food that you know is not good for your cardiovascular system, you know you are taking another step towards the final solution. It's easy because you don't really have to face the fact that you are killing yourself. 

It really takes courage to stay alive. It's difficult to survive even if we aren't scavenging for scraps of nutrient on a barren plain. Even if we live across from our favorite fast food restaurant. 

Consider two bowls of food. One a bowl of lightly steamed fresh vegetables, the other a double cheeseburger with extra bacon smothered in mayonnaise. Not too difficult to see which is more appealing. 

But to a "fatty," one who has spent a lifetime over indulging on extra rich foods, the choice is actually one between life and death. 

Oh, how much easier it is to commit suicide by fork.
