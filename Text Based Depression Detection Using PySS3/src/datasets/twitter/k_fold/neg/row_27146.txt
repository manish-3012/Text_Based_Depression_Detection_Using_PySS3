Made a bad judgement callI'm 22 m living at home with my mum unemployed and lonely went out with my one good friend who's in a relationship one thing led to another and she ended up telling me she loves me and slept together now it's awkward afterwards and I know I fucked up a friendship doesn't help when I get upset my mind goes into overdrive and I hear thoughts of suicide been like this for a while now thinking of doing it on Thursday if I do I just want someone to know that I'm sorry for everything I've done wrong and hopefully people can remember me for the good times
