I really donâ€™t want to die but I feel like I have to.I donâ€™t know what my intent is in making this post. Maybe itâ€™s just to clear my head and organize my thoughts. I donâ€™t know.

I really donâ€™t want to die. I want to live so badly and be happy. I have so much love for this world and the people in it. But I feel like Iâ€™m broken somewhere in my head. I go through phases of feeling like Iâ€™m on top of the world. Iâ€™ll go out and see friends every day, get super involved in my hobbies, and have so much energy. But then it comes crashing down. I crash. A few weeks ago I was so happy but then suddenly Iâ€™m not. I havenâ€™t left my room since Friday when I got off work. Iâ€™ve only left my bed to go to the bathroom and grab the food I ordered. I KNOW I can be happy and weightless because Iâ€™ve felt it, but as soon as that high ends I feel so hopeless. I donâ€™t know how long it will last before my brain decides to work again and let me feel happiness. Itâ€™s been like this for as long as I can remember. Just these horrible fits of sadness that last for weeks or months.

Iâ€™m not good enough for this world. Iâ€™m a terrible daughter, sister, girlfriend. My boyfriend shows me SO much love and I just canâ€™t express it the same way he does. I FEEL the love for him, I just canâ€™t express it. I just keep taking and taking and taking from this world and contribute nothing back to it. I donâ€™t want to die but I am so tired of being a leech to society. Last night I wrote my suicide note. I tied a dress to my shower rod (canâ€™t reach my fan) and tried to hang myself with it but couldnâ€™t fight the instinct to get it off from my neck when I couldnâ€™t breathe anymore. Iâ€™m so tempted to find a way to reach my fan so I canâ€™t just untie it when I start to panic. It would be so easy and I would never have to feel this way again. They would understand, and if they donâ€™t, theyâ€™ll move on.
