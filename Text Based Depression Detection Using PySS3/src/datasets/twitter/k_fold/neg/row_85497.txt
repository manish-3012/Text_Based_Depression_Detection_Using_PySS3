Depressed without a cause.I've been depressed for maybe 3 years now, I don't know what triggered it, but I sometimes feel I cannot take it anymore.
I've also been considering killing myself for a long time, and some months ago through my ex I managed to get a fake prescription for clonazepan(klonopin, rivotril) 60 pills of 2mg each.
My plan was to buy them just in case and to take them with a lot of alcohol if the time came when I just couldn't handle it anymore.
But as a couple of months passed by i took some to sleep on some tough days. I didn't take them oftem, but in a couple of drunken nights i seem to have blaked out and gotten really drunk mixing them.
I even gave some to some friends on one of those black outs.

So here I am thinking about killing myself, but only have like 50mg of clonazepam...

Too scared it's just not enough.

For those who are going to tell me to just get help, I'm currently going to a psycologist and have a lot of friends. But nothing anyone tells me ever helps in any way...
I have no real problems... I' m just fucked up in the head somehow...

I don't know what the fuck I should do... But i cannot keep been like this, sometime treating people like shit with no reason, I cannot fucking concentrate to study anymore. I can bearly control my depression at work, a lot of the time thinking on killing myself...

Why the fuck can't I just be just alright?
I know there's plenty of good stuff in life...
But that doesn't change how I feel, I could even say it make's it harder as there is a lot of things I would like to do, but I just can't handle my depression.

If anyone has any experience on mixing alcohol with clonazepam(klonopin, rivotril), could you pm me?

And don't worry I still should get some more.
And as I don't want to involve anyone I know in case they blame themselves, I sure ashell don't have a clue how to rise the number of tablets.
