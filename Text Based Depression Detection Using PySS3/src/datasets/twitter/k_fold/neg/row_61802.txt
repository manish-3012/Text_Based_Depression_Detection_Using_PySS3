I'm not sure why I'm even writing this...I've been depressed for almost 4 years now and I'm on medication but I still just don't see the point in living. I'm going into my 3rd year in university right now and I'm doing so bad. I used to be good at school but now I just can't remember anything. I don't have any friends. I don't mean I have some acquaintances but we aren't close I mean I have no one but my boyfriend. I don't see the point in finishing school because I'll never get a good job. I'm just bad at everything and I'm tired of being sad all the time. I'm tired of being a burden to everyone. I'm tired of being bad at everything. I'm tired of living. I just want friends or to be smart or something. 

If you read the whole thing thank you.
