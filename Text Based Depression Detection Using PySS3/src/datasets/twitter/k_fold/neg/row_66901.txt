I tried my hardest I really did!I tried socializing more, exercising more, cleaning myself more and my dirty room as well but none of it helps! I'm sick of hearing the same old things from my psychologist, she doesn't understand the crippling loneliness and depression I'm going through, if it was just as easy as going out and putting a smile on my face then I'd be cured ages ago but no, I am ill and I have been for years, let's face it it probably wont get much better in the future either. If I kill myself they'll call me lazy and selfish, but I tried my best I really did, waking up every god damn morning, having to force a smile for the teacher who never appreciates me and trying to fit in with groups of people who didn't even want me there. Honestly I'm so sick of it all, why me, why!!!!!
