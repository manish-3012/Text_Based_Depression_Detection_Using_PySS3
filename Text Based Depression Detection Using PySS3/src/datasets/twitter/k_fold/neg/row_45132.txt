It doesnâ€™t get better.All I want is death. I donâ€™t even feel human anymore; all I feel is pain. I cannot find or justify any reason to keep fighting. Years of meds and therapy are not helping. Numerous hospitalizations do not help. I canâ€™t even stand being in my skin or being awake anymore. I wish I could find someone to put me out of my misery.
