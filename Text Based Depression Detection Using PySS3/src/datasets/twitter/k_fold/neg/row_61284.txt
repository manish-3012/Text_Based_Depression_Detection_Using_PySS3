Its over?!for my whole life, my whole fucking life, I have done nothing. I have cared about nothing, I have pushed all responsibilities and regard for other peoples well being to the side. I did all of this because my mindset, for as long as I've lived, has just been, "I will kill myself before I face any consiquences" i cant even word this i feel like my head is leaking all over the fucking floor and spill ing and spilling.. 

my mom is crying in her rrroomm because I was just not doing any school work. my teacher notified her that I have not attended any classes or subbmitted any work since school started. I dont even care, i thought she knew that already. she said she would help me with the work but then she relised just how much ive missed and she started panicking so i started making fun of her. why why ehy would i do that&gt;?&gt;? not funny not funny... no.

this is sersiosly the end.. not now but fucking soon. i dodnt even have a ffull plan I want help but i know if i get help I am giving up on having a normal life, because they will put me in the hospital for the rest of my fucking life and treat me like a degenerate.

holy shit this is actually it it it. maybe i should just leave now, i need to stop being scared and i need to stop holding on. everything is blackl and white please oh my fucking go get me out of my bodyl. 

. i dont want to do this i wish i could be happy i wish i could be who i want to be but i cant. this is the worst ive ever felt, im so sorry for making this post im really sorry
