No point.I'm in a dead end job. I cannot pay my student loans back or get a job doing what I actually want. I have been abused my whole life by different people. I have C-PTSD so my dead end customer service job is on thin fucking ice because I can't handle people. I just want it to be over. I want the pain to stop. I think about hurting myself non stop. My brain is so broken. I don't have a family and I know in my heart my death wouldn't affect anyone but me. 

How do I end it?
