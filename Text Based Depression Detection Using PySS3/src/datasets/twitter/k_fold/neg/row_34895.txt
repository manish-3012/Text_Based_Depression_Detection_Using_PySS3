As negative as my mindset is, I like to see it written. Because at least it's there to see.My life is a big pile of almosts, of very filtered happiness and poor choices. I'm tired, I don't know the last time I was happy without having my mind bombard me ruining everything or having another worry to spoil it. In a way I know why it is, I don't like me, so not to say I hate myself.

At times I wish it ended already, because at times feeling better for a while and then coming back seems like a mockery. I wish something would kill me so I could stop thinking I can do better. Fuck me, I'm just fucking sad.
