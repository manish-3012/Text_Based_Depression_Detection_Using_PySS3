backed into a cornerI'm in my late 20's and have a few unpleasant medical conditions, including long-standing trouble with anxiety, dissociative disorder and major depression. I also rent from relatives who either abused me or helped cover up the abuse, and circumstances are such that they spend a certain amount of 'social' time around the place. Although the abuse is officially in the past, in practice it means that it's just switched over to 100% mind games and gaslighting. I've tried every feasible way to make the situation work, none of which have made a damn bit of difference.

The hell of it is that this is *already* my last resort.

The local vacancy rate is steady at about 1% and a studio apartment costs most or all of my monthly disability cheque. My health issues prevent me from A) working, B) living with room-mates or C) living without my therapy animals. 

Relocating is also out of the question, since all of my support networks are here and I'm dependant on public transit.  My current city's the only place for five hundred miles where I can get any support and treatment for my physical issues (one of which also happens to be legal grounds for discrimination in most parts of the country).

It feels like the walls are closing in on me.
