Well does anyone care or am I just alone as always I thought I would just lay everything out on the table, because fuck it.  I am a 14 year old girl and I'm posting here today because I'm tired of lying and saying I'm ok and hiding shit so here I am reddit feel free to judge.  A few months ago I started to cut not to deep and only when I'm sad....but I'm sad everyday so it doesn't seem to matter.  Like most people I have self esteem issues, I'm over weight, awkward, and I've never had a boyfriend which some may say isn't a big deal at my age but feeling unwanted and unattractive is not fun.  I've been severely depressed for a while now and my family kind of notices, although there way of showing it is calling me fat and calling me miss happiness.  Now school.  I hate school everyone at it.  I don't have many friends and the ones I do have don't care about me and I'm hiding this whole thing from them.  Lately I've been considering suicide it just seems like if I was gone no one would notice, maybe for a while people would be sad and then everyone would move on.  The only thing that makes me happy is photography and my cat but all my pictures suck and my cat hates me so why am I here living such a meaningless life.

EDIT: thanks for all your kind words it really ment alot to me I think I might stay on earth for a while because someday the world might need an awkward cat loving photographer
