I hate being ignored and thats what I always end up being. I am so tired of being myself.I know a lot of you might read the title and think, may be I am full or uninteresting or jealous or a bad company, or other mean stuff which honestly I have heard a lot of time as presumptions. 

But all I will say most of what your ideas about me are not true. Yes I can be uninteresting and annoying as I am being right now, but that only happens when I am up to the neck being shoveled around for other people. I am no one's priority. Hell, I ain't even some one who matters to most. 

I don't wanna commit suicide either. But at these times which happen like every week because I have no one to talk to, I don't wanna be myself. I don't wanna exist for these times when I sincerely hate myself for just being so damn unimportant.
