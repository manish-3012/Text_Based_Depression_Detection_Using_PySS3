I'm talking to a friend of mine right now and she has been hinting at killing herself all evening. I have tried everything. I have tried talking her down for hours, I've sent friends to go to her place and see her (I live too far away to do so myself)... She wouldn't let them in at all. She told me she even wanted them to take her cat away because "he couldn't understand" but that the only reason she didn't have them take her cat away is that she'd need to open the door. She said she wasn't going to kill herself because she's too weak to do even that, but then five minutes later she says she'll do it again. I said I'd call an ambulance for her but she said she knows her rights and that she knows "what to say and how to act." I'm at a serious loss here. Is there anything else I can do?

Sorry for how disorganized this is. Thank you for any help you can provide.
