I am trappedI'm trapped. Trapped in my body, trapped in my life. God I can't fucking take it anymore. 

All these thoughts switching about I should kill myself and not kill myself. The fucking pain I feel is something out of hell. I'm such a shitty person. I'm such a disappointment. My boyfriend is fed up with me and he's the only one I'm here for. 

Im so scared I wont change quick enough for him. He snapped on me last night and said so many hurtful things. He's been lying to me. Saying I'm not annoying and that everything is fine despite me telling him I just want him to communicate with me so I know if I'm bothering him. He said I'm so annoying and he's done with me and he told me to fuck off. 

It hurts so much. 

I don't want to kill myself but at the same time I want to so badly. 

It would end every single thing. Every emotion, every problem, every burden I put on others. My mom, my grandma, my boyfriend, they all tell me I'm nothing but a burden.
