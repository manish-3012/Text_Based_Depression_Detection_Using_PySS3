i feel hallowevery single day without skipping a beat, i think about just ending it. either walking into traffic, hanging myself, or overdosing on xanax and falling into an everlasting doze. what is the point anymore? how have i managed to ruin my future so drastically already. iâ€™m an idiot. i donâ€™t want to be in pain anymore, iâ€™m talking to a therapist but i donâ€™t know, feels like the damage is already done. i donâ€™t want to be here. i wish i succeeded when i overdosed, i wouldâ€™ve even i didnâ€™t go into shock and if my stepmom wasnâ€™t to have come downstairs. why the fuck am i trying so hard to stay alive for all of these people who donâ€™t care to change at all. no one fully comprehends how much i wish to be gone, they all think iâ€™m just really sad sometimes. i donâ€™t think anyone would ever be able to and iâ€™m glad but also at the same time i wish i could speak to future me for guidance because i feel so lost and gone already
