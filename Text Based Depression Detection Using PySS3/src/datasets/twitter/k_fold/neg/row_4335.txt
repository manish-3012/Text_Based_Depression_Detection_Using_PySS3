My family pushes me to the point of killing myself.My family pushes me to the point of really killing myself. I can no longer bear their attitude, their sarcasm and their disparaging behavior towards me. They drive me to the point of suicide. They won't give me room to be with my thoughts, and they constantly force me to be happy.

I can not be sad or look sad. if I do that, they look at me weird. There must be a laugh. 

I can not pretend anymore. They ignore me, and my pain and problems. My heart beats gigantic at the moment and my breathing is faster then normal. It gets worse every day. When they talk about superficial things, my hairs stand up straight. No five minutes of rest to put my thoughts in a row, every time I have to talk, laugh, pretend to have fun. while I am very suicidal at the moment. I want to be alone, only with my thoughts, I want to die, I really can not stand it anymore...
