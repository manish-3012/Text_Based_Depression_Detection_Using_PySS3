Well, I guess I'm just waiting for the right time and placeI thought I promised myself that I wasn't coming back but I guess that was just another lie. I finally found myself a gun and am just waiting for the right time and place. It's not technically my gun but the people I live with should do a better job hiding their firearms. Its a small revolver and as I understand it a shot near the temple should be lethal more often than not. So yeah, I guess this is really it. Time to put up or shut up, so to speak.
