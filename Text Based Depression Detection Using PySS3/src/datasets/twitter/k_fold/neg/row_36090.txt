28, been with a girl for 12 years, can't live without her.In the past 180 days I've got from loving husband to getting divorced. She doesn't trust me. I've never been with anyone else in my life, and I feel like I can't live without her. We have a 4 year old, I don't think I can take life without them. I don't want to live without them. I hope my son grows up happy, and well. And maybe she'll find someone else.
