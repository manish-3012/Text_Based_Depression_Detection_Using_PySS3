I tried writing down a list of reasons why I should die......and then I realized, after reading it over, that my reasons just weren't good enough.  
Each reason was more emotional than logical. I wasn't hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpayable debt. I wasn't an incel, though I hadn't fucked in almost two years. I wasn't demented or brain-damaged.

Every reason I wrote was trivial compared to death.  
Goddamn it
