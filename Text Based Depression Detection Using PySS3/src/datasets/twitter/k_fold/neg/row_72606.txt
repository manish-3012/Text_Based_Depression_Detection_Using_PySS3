I don't have the will to live anymoreA bit of background story: I like a girl but there's someone else. We both asked her out, I got rejected but the other guy was kinda left hanging (she didn't say yes nor no). Me and the girl was cuddling yesterday (we were alone) that if the other guy was here, she'd rather cuddle with him instead of me. This triggered me to hell and back and decided that I'd end it all since her sentence destroyed my already tiny will to live. 

I don't have a dream, my family would be VERY disappointed if I talk to them about this so I'd rather not, and all I do is waste money and food and living space that could otherwise be used by some other person that knows what they're doing.

I know it sounds silly to commit suicide over a girl, but admitting defeat seems like an easy way out from the agony of a life I'm living right now.
