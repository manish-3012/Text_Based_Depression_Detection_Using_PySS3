I want to live and I want to dieI feel all giddy and warm inside, and I also feel like life isn't worth living anymore and I just want it to end peacefully. I think the giddiness is the effect of the antidepressants I'm on and have been taking regularly for almost two months now, but my life and mind still aren't anywhere near where I'd like them to be so I still feel passively suicidal. This feels like an emotional rollercoaster and I just want the whole thing to end.
