Hi...my name is Mayda and i want to diemy life since birth have been an inner struggle...till the age of 4 i had extra electric waves in my brain that almost killed me yet i survived it with the loss of a left ear and a damaged inner nose leaving me for the rest of my almost 30 years old life a subject for mockery over my voice or inability of hearing well which resulted in me being a shut in person who does not enjoy the company of others....growing up in Egypt in a strict religious community did not help me but made me feel contained...as soon as i finished my worthless Egyptian university degree i had an eye on fleeing that hell place before being forced into military service "country rules" which i did not want for i despise violence to the core...at 2014 me and an old friend hooked up and ended up online dating which we both tried our best to get me out of that hell hole i lived in and after a lot of hassle crying frustration and pulling strings there was no way for me to leave but to marry her and move to her country hence being in Germany now...ive been here for close to a 2 and a half years...i can not say i love my wife for i do not know what true love is but i believe that was a fair trade...love for a future...which didn't really happen...the fact that i needed to learn a 4th language "german" to actually be able to live here added a whole lot of new type of pressure on me...my shyness and hesitation to talk or meet new people increased with the lack of enough language knowledge...what made it worse that a mysterious illness stroke at me that made me unable to spend more than 10 minutes without visiting the bathroom...it took doctors 2 years to finally find out that i am lactose intolerant which i did not have where i was before...in which i felt useless to the wife i had and a burden to her and myself at 2017 i met a friend online from USA and i had no intention of getting romantically involved with her...still am not bottom line after i paid for her visit here she just decided to ditch me for she thought i wanted more than a friend status which was absolutely false...she was the only friend i had in the last 8 years and it just ended badly that i literally lost hope in having a friend...i spent the last 6 month at my apartment avoiding any need to leave it i do not want to interact with people i lost faith that good people actually exist specially in a place full of white people who see a brown skin short guy is odd...i came to Germany full of hopes of a new life a different start....a reset for my horrible life in what i will continue calling hell hole but it have been nothing but a different type of hell and with all what u see in the news recently i am terrified of even leaving my apartment more for i do not wanna be branded anything...i have no courage or confidence to pursue any education even though i would love to study computer programming but being almost 30 years old makes me believe i am too old to learn anything new...i lost hope in finding a friend i have absolutely nobody to talk to but my wife who has been trying her best to keep me well but i feel i am nothing but a huge burden to her...a lot of times i feel i am nothing but a huge waste of the very air i breathe...ive been in therapy for almost 8 month now after that former friend crushed me for my suicide thoughts were much more than it is now but all i hear from my therapist is accept your fate...be happy that u have a better life than others...then what about those who have a better life than mine...i did not control where i was born or all the illness i encountered throughout my years...i try very hard for everything i do or work in and without result...my hard work is pointless to everybody...i am separated from my family because i would go to prison if i go back where i came from for being a military deserter...i believe i got no future in Germany or Europe generally for i look sound and act differently...i feel like i emit an aura that pushes people away from me even though i am the nicest guy i know...i believe if i have no future and i always feel like a waste of the very air i breathe then what is the point of going on...i wake up everyday trying to find a reason to go on let that be a video game or a tv show or maybe something i cook
but what is the point...
