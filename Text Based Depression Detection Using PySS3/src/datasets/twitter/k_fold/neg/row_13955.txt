i can't do this anymorei dont know why im writing this, i guess i need to let it out.

im killing myself tonight i know i am. i cant tell myself to keep going, it will get better or any other stupid shit anymore. it isnt true. it never gets better, i'll never feel okay. i can't make anyone happy. i have nothing to give anyone. 

my mind hates me and my body disgusts me. i wish i was never born. everyday i feel it coming and now i cant stop it.

im scared. but i know its right.
