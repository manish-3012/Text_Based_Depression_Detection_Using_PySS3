Gonna spend most of this night alone. I don't want to be lonely.My parents are going out with some of their friends in an hour and something, so I'm alone for the night. I feel helpless, like nobody wants to spend time with me. I could invite a person, but right now I don't want him to be with me. There's also that other person I could invite, but I think too highly of him to burden him with my problems. My girlfriend? She's too busy for me, and that's okay. I don't mind that. I just feel helpless. I guess I'm just going to play some games or read something. Or maybe... I could just finish it. I got a knife in my room, I experimented with cutting and it felt good. I'm not afraid of death, I'm more afraid of what'll happen to other people if I actually do kill myself. I think to myself that maybe it's people's attention I want, and that brings me down even more. I just don't know what to do :(
