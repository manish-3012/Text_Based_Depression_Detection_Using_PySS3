Why live if you always hated?I mean literally everyone hates , avoids me just because my ethnicity. I'm not kid, I'm 19 years old guy and life is one nightmare for me. I live in baltic country where everyone is pure white. My parents are white too, brother sister - white. I managed to get grandfather genes and born with dark features (he is from Pakistan). Life is horrible ,because people mistreat me wit gypsy( I really look like one of them , even I have white skin). Gypsies are hated all around the world , but here it's impossible to even live. They live in their groups , they don't give a fcuk about that. Every day in the news you can see : gypsy stole, gypsy killed , gypsy sold drugs and so on. Most horrible thing is that I'm completely normal guy , I didn't even thought people can mistreat me with them. My main suicide problem is this , of course I have more of them , but I believe this reason alone would courage me to do that.. I want to live , I want to live so badly , but I just can't :(
