Im so ugly I'm ready to go ahead and end it. Got a knife. Got a note. One more reddit thread for shits and giggles.So I'm a male 15 and absolutely obsessed with my appearance. 

A couple years ago so i could fix my round ugly circle face I decided to lose weight. Shit worked pretty well. Got those defined cheekbones and got a shit ton of attention at school from girls. Life was good.

 Well the doctors didn't like this and declared me underweight. And sent me to rehab for a month for anorexia. Made me gain 20 pounds. Came back home today. Look like fucking shit. Face is as round as the fucking moon. 

I'm also 5'6'' and both my parents are 5'5" so I'm basically fucked. 


I can't deal with my appearance any more. It makes me this upset. 

the sad thing is theres a lot of things in life I used to enjoy and look forward to. I have a bright future and talent to spare and goals. 

But it isn't worth it to me with all this bullshit. I've already been on like a hundred medications and told every doctor in the world this and no one has anything for me. Everyone just tells me to accept myself the way I am but I can't. I'm not going to go through life without that privilege of being attractive and living the easy life. It isn't fucking worth it. 

So I got a knife and a note. Anyone else want to try and convince me of something I've made up my mind on?
