I'm readyA little backstory here: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sbjo6/2_weeks_to_rekindle_love_in_a_relationship_what/

I just posted that earlier today, but I've been feeling like ending my life for a while now. But I realize now that if these 2 weeks with my girlfriend don't work out, I absolutely have nothing to live for. 

My life, compared to others, is probably great. I have friends, family, good education, etc., but I'm just fucking miserable. Im miserable knowing that this girl probably will not love me no matter what I do in the next 2 weeks. She was and is my life, and if she isn't around I have nothing to live for. 

I don't want people telling me that there are better things out there, and that there are so many things to look forward to. I just want this girl, who was my life, to be with me. Without her, there is nothing better, nothing to look forward to, nothing.

After these two weeks, if nothing works out, which it probably won't, I know what I have to and want to do.
