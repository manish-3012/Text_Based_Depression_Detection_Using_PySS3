just some crying shitI hate myself. because I'm asian and ugly. I have no fucking talent, no self-confidence, no good parents, no social skills, can't concentrate on anything more than 5m, can't try my best blah blah blah blah
I hate my country, my culture, my friends, my house, teacher, school, money, government, people, society, rich, smile and perhaps my parents, too
but I like western. white people, their culture, their fucking great policy and whatever.
yes i know some of you will think europe and america is not a good place to live but for me that's just heaven.
I want to be a white, living with well-civilized people, no study more than 12 hour and more.
but i'm just filthy ugly short fat depressed asian who has social anxiety.
I think death seems better than live like this. If there's gun around me i would shoot my self as soon as possible.
I cry everyday. why did i born in this country? why this parents? why asian? why i'm so weak? why everyone's so happy? why i can't smile everytime?
oh, but I won't suicide for the moment. i got no gun, no courage.
that's all. It's fun that my first long piece of writing in english is about 'i hate everything i wanna die i'm ugly' whining shit.
I don't want to see 'life has good undertone you'll be good blah blah' things. I just want to express what i'm feeling now.
Thanks for reading, sorry to waste your time, now go back and cheer someone who suffer from more important problem than me.
