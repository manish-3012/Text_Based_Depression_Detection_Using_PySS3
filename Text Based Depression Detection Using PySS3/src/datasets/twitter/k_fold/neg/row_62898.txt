In 3 days, this will all finally be over! - UPDATEA couple weeks ago I [posted about my plan to commit suicide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6l79si/in_3_days_this_will_all_finally_be_over/). I wanted to give an update on what happened.

I decided I was going to hang myself (previously I had planned to OD on benadryl). I got the rope set up and put around me neck, but when I pulled it tight, I freaked out. I asked my roommate to drive me to the ER and I subsequently spent 11 days in the mental hospital.

I was just discharged this morning. I'm not sure if I made the right choice going to the ER, but regardless, I wanted to let you all know I'm still alive.
