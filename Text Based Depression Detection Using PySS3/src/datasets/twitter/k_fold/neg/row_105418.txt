its my 21st birthday todayive been so isolated the past two years my social skills are completely stunted to the point that i cant even hold conversations with my friends or family without sounding nonsensical or stuttering to shit, went into catastrophizing mode over all my friendships and cut contact with basically all of them before i had the chance to ruin my relationships with them, and am completely financially dependent on my parents due to my being too mentally unsound to hold a job. celebrated with my parents alone today and felt the full weight of my burden on them as a jobless friendless fuck up. i should be grateful and i am, but its still so hard. to feel like i deserve to be here, and to feel like i dont just make the lives of my loved ones harder by existing. but i guess i am still here, and for my parents i will try to hold on a bit longer. cheers everyone, hope today has been good to you all
