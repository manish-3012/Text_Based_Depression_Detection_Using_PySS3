Two months after my last suicidal thoughts, I relapsed.I see all the suffering on this subreddit, and I can't help but feeling like a crybaby. So many people are having it way harder than me and are still making it everyday. I feel so fragile and stupid.   


It's been two months since I last had any suicidal thoughts or thought about self harming. And this morning, I wanted to do both. I wanted to swallow pills, I wanted to cut myself. I did neither, because I got afraid once again. Which is good. Being afraid prevent me from doing anything reckless. 

Yesterday, I was drunk and texted my ex. He answered, called me on the phone and we a had a nice chat. Then we hung up, and I sent him a text "Holy sh\*t, I still love you". He hasn't answered, which I expected but still was disappointed about. (It's a complicated story, we're together and not together at the same time but it's not the point).  


I hate myself for sending that text. I knew it would make me feel awful. I still did it. I've been crying for six hours straight yesterday, woke up of a three hours sleep and started crying again. It's been two hours now. I'm so exhausted that the dark thoughts came around "Suicide is the easy way, just take the pills. Just cut yourself." It hurts. It's been almost two months since I last had them. I didn't miss any of this. 

I feel like a dummie. I've hurted myself in the dumbest way possible. I know you shouldn't feel like that: ashamed to the point of wanting to end your days. I feel trapped. If I hadn't sent that text, I wouldn't feel so bad this morning. If I hadn't sent that text, I wouldn't be crying over it. If I hadn't sent that text, I wouldn't have relapsed in those dark parts of my mind. 

I'm verry sorry for ranting Reddit. It's just me, being useless and disgusting me again.
