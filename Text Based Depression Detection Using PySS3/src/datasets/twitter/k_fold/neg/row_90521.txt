I feel like killing myself would be the best thing to do for my family.I had a fucked up childhood. I was emotionally abused and my dad genuinely didn't give a fuck about me. Now at 26 and with a 16 month old boy.....I just started crying when I wrote that. But I still have mixed feelings. I feel like, if I just kill myself, then I won't be around to fuck him up and make him turn out like ME. But I then if I'm not around, he might turn out worse than me. I love him SOO much. If I knew for sure that killing myself WOULD give him a better life, I'd do it. Just for that. I just don't want him to be like me. I hate myself. I'm fat, I have nothing going on in my life, I literally have ONE friend. ONE! I just go to work, come home, eat, go to sleep. Everyday is the same fucking thing over and over. And my wife and I are always arguing. Well not always but quite often. She's always so stubborn and hard headed, I don't FEEL like she has any compassion for me anymore. She has said something similar to this before. She has dealt with my depression for so long. 

I just don't feel like it's every going to be better than it used to be. Honestly, the only reason. The ONLY reason I'm still alive is because of my son. I love that boy so god damn much. I just am unsure if I can give him a better life than I had. I just don't know.

BTW I put a gun up against my head, pulled the safety down, and put my finger on the trigger. Just to see what it felt like. I don't know if that helps you guys know where I'm at.
