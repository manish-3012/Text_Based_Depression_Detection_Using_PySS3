I wish I had the courageI keep waiting for things to get better but for the last 4 years things have only declined. All my once friends donâ€™t care about me anymore. My family is happier now that Iâ€™m away for college so I have no one.

I keep trying to stay hopeful that one day things might get better and I wonâ€™t be so lonely but time after time, Iâ€™m disappointed by my expectations.

I think the only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because Iâ€™m too scared to actually commit to death. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore
