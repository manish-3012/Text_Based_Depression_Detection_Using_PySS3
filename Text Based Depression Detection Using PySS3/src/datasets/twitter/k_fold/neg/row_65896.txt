Iâ€™m tiredI donâ€™t even know what to say. I wanna die. I had no one else to tell this to so yeah. Iâ€™m kinda tired of being alone and having to do all this by myself and I really just want somebody to tell me everything is gonna be okay. Iâ€™m tired of hiding my feelings from the few people in my life, so that they donâ€™t leave me. I JUST WANT TO SCREAM TO THE WORLD THAT I WANNA DIE. I literately just need the attention. Iâ€™m just done.
