Life is Inherently AbusiveI've been unable to break free of this thought process lately. I split up with my fiance who I had been with for 9 years because I realized with the help of friends that her mental illness had been causing her to grow toxic and at times full on abusive. But here's the thing, there was no INTENT to be abusive.

I started to realize that if we apply the same logic to life, it's inescapable that life shares structural similarities to abuse. Even being born is being brought into a world where suffering exists without your consent. The rest of your life is a mix of good and bad, but let's face it, "the good days are worth it, you just have to push through the bad!" sounds like every abuse victim ever.

If it is a moral imperative as a person with self-respect to leave an abusive relationship, why isn't it also a moral imperative to leave life itself? If one looks realistically at life, the conclusion that you deserve better is inescapable. They say "better off alone than with an abuser". Well, I say "better off not existing than existing in a reality where suffering exists".

I'd love to be wrong about this. Please, somebody, tell me where I'm wrong.

Suicide takes an awful lot of courage and effort, and I'd rather not have to. I'd rather not have had to leave my fiance either - it took months to build up the courage, but it was the right thing to do... and unless I can figure out a logical argument that shows how life is different, it seems like death is also the right thing to do.
