cant stand itas of now i have no responsibilities but still i dread existing another day . its horrible, it's exhausting, i feel like theres a live bomb in my hands and if i dont destroy something now then they'll just blast into pieces

i want to be gone! i cant do tjis anymore i dont want to do this ever again i dont care how happy i'll be or successful. existence is purgatory
