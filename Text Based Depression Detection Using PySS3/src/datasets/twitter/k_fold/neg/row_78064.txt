as usual, i'm up because of crippling anxiety and worry.there's virtually no reason i'm alive besides hell and not to disappoint 2 online friends. i see hate everywhere i go from the people who are supposed to love god and his creations. life sucks. I'm going to fail. i just want a visit from god. a hug from said god. advice. anything. but I'll be going where the air is sulfure.
