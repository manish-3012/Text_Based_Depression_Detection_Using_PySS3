SoonI don't want to be me anymore. I am horribly ugly, and a lot of people say that there is more to life than being ugly, but my appearance is extremely important to me. I'm not going to kill myself right now, but I am planning to kill myself soon. I'm not pretty. I will never be pretty. I am attracted to people who are a lot better looking than I am, and a relationship will never happen. Not only that, but every single trait I have is worthless. It's going to happen soon. I am planning for it to be on the 23rd of this month.
