Emotional SuicideIâ€™m not gonna beat around the bush anymore. Honestly, At this point Iâ€™d rather die. I just donâ€™t see the point of living in a world where Iâ€™m considered weak because I cry. Texting someone multiple times before they respond means Iâ€™m not worthy of a chance, and loving people unconditionally means: Iâ€™m willing to be taken advantage of. Everyone â€œunderstandsâ€ shit, because theyâ€™re to worried about their own fucking problems. Well, thatâ€™s until youâ€™re dead. Then everyone wants to look back to glorify everything youâ€™ve done. But the real question is: Who really HONESTLY took the time to understand me?
