I feel like I will end up killing myself real soon.I would have done it today but as I sent out a goodbye post my friends did message me, and it hurt knowing I'll be leaving like this. I prepared or tried to prepare for this though, I wanted to distance myself from everyone so it would hurt less but I don't want to hurt them, but I don't want to continue living. 

I guess I just want to let this out somehow, knowing there's never an easy way out and no one wins in this situation, yet I will do it anyway. If this gun doesn't work I'm going to be very disappointed as I won't want to stab myself to death, here's to hoping it works and isn't defective or something.
