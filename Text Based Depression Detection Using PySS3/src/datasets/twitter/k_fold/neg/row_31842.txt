I've thrown away everything no one needs to seeI am 100% ready to kill myself. I don't have the heart to let the people I love know how much I love them, because I know they will know something is up. I don't know what I'm doing here. Guess I needed to put it out there somewhere. Nothing feels real anymore &amp; there's a certain feeling in my veins that won't leave. I don't know. Am I stalling by posting on reddit? Maybe. I've lost myself and I don't know how to deal with myself anymore.
