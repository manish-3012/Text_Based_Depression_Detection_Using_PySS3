Maybe tonightI'm in a weird headspace. I'm thinking about going like 50 times a a day. But also thinking about not doing that. I don't know where to go from here. Just had a very complicated break up. Lost my job before that. I'm just tired. Working my ass off for shit pay and being disrespected. There's really nothing I want to be here for anymore. I've started doing one on one therapy for the first time in my life and it's weird. I don't know if it's for me at all. 

It's -30 degrees celsius outside. I wanna take a shower and just sit in it and let hypothermia take me. It'll be a brutal way to go but it'll be over in minutes. I might...wait til I see my therapist this Friday...idk
