I feel less than dirt and want nothing more than to dieIâ€™ve had this problem my whole life where I was â€œtoo annoyingâ€ for people and I really want to end it. My social anxiety and depression are so much and everyone always ends up leaving me because of that. I just vent to the point where theyâ€™re apathetic and donâ€™t care if I live or die. 

My bf and I broke up yesterday very explosively then I convinced him to come over and we had a really nice time. We got in another fight this morning bc he said something to hurt me and couldnâ€™t see why it hurt me so much. He told me he lied about loving me, that he hates me and will always hurt me and drive me crazy and that he doesnâ€™t want to see me again. 

I just feel like EVERYONE hates me and this just further proves it. I truly donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll have anyone again. He was the one person to stick by me for 5 years and even he canâ€™t stand me and apparently hates me. 

I feel so trapped bc of this virus shit like I couldnâ€™t even kill myself bc of the quarantine.
