Is it okay to ask a friend for support?I see him as my only friend, but he isn't good with that type of personal negative stuff and I'm not safe how much time he wants to spend with me in general (I have the feeling he doesn't want spending much..) I feel like I need him for support (distraction) and I don't know if I should ask him.. I don't want to say im suicidal yet, so I would only ask him for support.. Should I do that or not?
