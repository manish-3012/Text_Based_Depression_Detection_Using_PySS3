It bothers me that my family/gf are the only things stopping me from killing myselfI'm not sure if this is the best place to post this, as I'm not currently worried that I'm planning to commit suicide, but it bothers me that the only reason I'm not is because I know that it will hurt my family (specifically parents and grandparents) and girlfriend, and they are really nice people that I don't want to hurt. My own will to live though is gone. The main reason for this is my insomnia, as I've been sleeping &lt;10 hours a week and the doctor prescribed medication is not helping.
