Totally lost and alone. I need to speak to someoe, preferably a girlI'm going through some crazy relationship stuff with the only girl who made me feel like I mattered. I feel so lonely and empty. I hardly open my mouth to speak to anyone anymore. I know it sounds desperate, cause it is, but I need someone to vent to and fill the void I'm feeling right now. I can't even bring myself to call the hotline, cause it doesn't feel real, you know? But I don't want to exist and I can't end it but everything hurts right now and I feel like I'm going crazy.
