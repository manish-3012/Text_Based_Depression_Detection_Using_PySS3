Hey guysHey I've been struggling super bad over the past few months. Throwaway for obvious reasons. Lost my job, very close to losing everything else. I'm so scared. I barely sleep because I'm trying to hold it all together. I feel like if I can just make it through these next few hours and days I'll be ok. No one knows I'm struggling this bad, not even my family. The other day, about a week ago I almost made an attempt and wrote a note but I stopped because I have siblings. A lot of people in my community look up to me ( not a pastor but am prominent in a faith based community)so if I did this it would hurt a lot of people and make them question their own beliefs. I'm just really exhausted and don't know what to do.  Sorry if im using the forum wrong I just need to vent and be honest somewhere.
