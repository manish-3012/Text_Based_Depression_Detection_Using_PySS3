Hello guys, I am still here and now a proven loser.Well I always did tend to make false promises. I won't hang around for too long, but I am still here. (Yayy??) So far, some days have been harder than others, today I could not get out of bed per usual and skipped two classes. As I made my way to my third class, I got an increasingly amount of death stares (or so it seemed) from complete strangers (how lovely). Or maybe I'm letting my anxiety get the best of me?? Afterwards, I went to eat some really delicious pho (getting out of this sad place tends to be the highlight of my day). Eventually, I went back to my apartment to nap and woke up to the usual lonely darkness (feels like the physical embodiment of abandonment).  Lately I have been ignoring my mother's calls, which is terrible in itself, but it has been hard listening to her voice let alone speaking to her. On the contrary, listening to the Smiths has been very easy.  

I do not have any major assignments due soon (as in tomorrow) so I need to find ways to keep myself busy tonight even though I should start studying for finals. So here I find myself. 

I don't really cry anymore. Just when I realize how deep I have gone and how bad this has become. I guess I am trying to say this is getting far too familiar for me. People blankly stare at me? I should kill myself tonight. I feel ignored in class? Maybe I should not bother anymore. I let others cut me at the bus stop? What the hell am I doing.

The world is moving, but I have been abandoned. 
Everyone is making new friends and trying new places. And I am here. Alone in my room. 

No one is going to really save me, no one wants to save me.

Additional Incoherent Nonsense:
Fuck it, everyone deserves some fckn sympathy. No one deserves this bullshit. No one deserves walking around with so much weight. I just want to walk around ignorantly happy and enjoy it. Nothing more. Someone get me out of here. I don't want this anymore.
