Wish someone would notice my painI try to give people hints and try to let them know what Iâ€™m going through but no one seems to care. I know that itâ€™s my own fault for not coming forward with how I feel and not telling someone but talking to people is hard enough as it is for me. I couldnâ€™t imagine telling someone how much I wanted to kill myself and how dead I feel on the inside. I just want someone to talk to about how I truly feel. Iâ€™m too scared to tell anyone because last time I sort of opened up about my feelings they told someone else and cut me off because they didnâ€™t want to deal with me. So the only person I had to talk to about stuff didnâ€™t even want to deal with me anymore. Now Iâ€™m all alone and the drugs Iâ€™ve tried arenâ€™t doing it for me anymore. Music always helps but itâ€™s hard to find happiness through music when all of my favorite artists are dead. At this point the only thing I want to do is kill myself. I sleep as much as possible because itâ€™s the closest thing I have to not living anymore.
