I'm fresh out of hope and i want to die.These past few years have been absolute shit. I keep on thinking that im gonna find a way, that ill finally improve myself and everything is gonna get better. But i feel like im just contantly walking in fucking circles with this shit. Nothing has gotten better. I cant keep any promises to myself because i promised we would make some changes but nothing has fucking changed. 

I know i should be thankful. After all, so many people have it worse. Im just being dramatic. I shouldnt be feeling this way. Im too young to be like this. But i cant fucking take more of this shit. Im obviously not strong enough to bury it all deep down, like my mom says she does. Where the fuck can i expect to go in life when im fucking lazy and incredibly unremarkable? 

Im sorry. I dont know where else to put this. I dont know who to tell. 

I dont want to keep going anymore.
