Why is suicide not the answerWhat if youâ€™re a walking sack of shit. What if youâ€™re ugly and dumb. What if youâ€™re existing is causing you to be miserable. You feel like you shouldnâ€™t have even been here. Why is that selfish. Why is it selfish to do something for your self. What if this is your only way out. Why canâ€™t I end my pain without having people angry.
