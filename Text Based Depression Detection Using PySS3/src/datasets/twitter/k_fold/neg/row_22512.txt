The light inside of me has died.I come from a wealthy family. I have friends (although only a couple), a family, and a roof above my head. I have everything I could ever wish for, and I'm suicidal and depressed. I was diagnosed 8 months ago, and it has only gone downhill. I've self harmed, which is the only thing that helped me feel relieved for even just a minute. I've grown cold and heartless over the months, and I feel only anger and despair. There's no happiness left inside. It's ironic, in a way, considering I was the happiest kid in the class just 4 years ago. Then my mother died, and I moved to America. I've lost everyone and everything I've ever cared about. My father, if you can even call him that, did not take into consideration me or my brother's feelings during the move. He never asked us, as he knew we would say no. He hasn't cared. My dad remarried and they sent me to therapy 8 months ago, thinking I would get better. I haven't. No one will even blink an eye when I do it. It would almost be funny, that is, if I could feel happy. No one will care.

Goodnight, my friends. I will succumb to the night, and wake up tomorrow, and likely go through with it.
