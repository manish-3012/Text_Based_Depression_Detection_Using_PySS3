Got discharged for not being good enough and now there's no reason I shouldn't kill myselfWas discharged from therapy for not being fast/good enough at it, and that was basically the only thing going on in my life. I've been unemployed for over a year and a half, and still living at home at the age of 24. All I am is a drain on money to my mother so there is literally no reason not to kill myself. In fact, it would be selfish not to.
