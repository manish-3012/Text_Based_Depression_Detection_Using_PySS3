damnso there I was really wanting to kill myself but I knew I had to live just a bit longer I had some oxy from a few months ago when I was addicted to drugs but I wasn't addicted to oxy because I accidentally overdosed on it and so I never took it again but I had one pill left it was my last one because my dealer is on vacation and so I said fuck it and took it I had the best night of my life and then today I slept 6 hours after coming home from school. but the thing is Im not sure if its oxy thats what my dealer told me so because I've run out I realized that we had a shit ton of oxy in the medicine cabinet except it looks different ima try not to overdose this is the only think keeping me from ending it so fuck it.
