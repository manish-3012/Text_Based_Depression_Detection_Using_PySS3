HidingIâ€™m so tired of hiding.
Hiding my sexuality. 
Hiding my deep, deep sadness.
Hiding my passive suicidal ideation.
Hiding my incredibly bad general and social anxiety.
Hiding that every day/night I consider overdosing, or slicing up my arms. 
Hiding how much I actually struggle.
Hiding how much I need to collapse to the ground in tears. 

Iâ€™m just so exhausted.
