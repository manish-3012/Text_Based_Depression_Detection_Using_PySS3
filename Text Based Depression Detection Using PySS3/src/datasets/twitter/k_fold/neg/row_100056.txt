I wish I could just disappearI have many issues with myself, i also have issues in the family, i am not really mature for my age, i live in a hopeless country, i have no real future, i have no real qualifications, i have no real dream or goal in life, i have no happiness. I wish i could just die, but i dont want to leave my family in pain. I wish the world comes to an end so i can die and not have to worry about people hurting over me. I wish people in my family stop being hurt. I can only type away my feelings, nothing will really change. It never gets better. I will probably be a very poor man in future, one that disappoints family, and one that will never really be happy. I wish I could just end myself. I am not scared of dying, but I am scared of hurting family with my death. I dont know how long I can get through this. I wish I just get killed. This is hopeless. Im 20
