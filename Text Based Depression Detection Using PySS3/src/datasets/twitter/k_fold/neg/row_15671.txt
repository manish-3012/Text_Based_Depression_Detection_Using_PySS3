Killing myself tonightI'm very thankful for the kind words on my last post you guys managed to keep me alive for 2 days. But I'vr been crying my eyes out since this morning and I realized I really and truly can't live with the never ending constant pain. So I do indeed have to kill myself tonight. All your kind words were greatly appreciated â¤ Mental illness is the absolute fucking worst,  it kills you.  Wishing that someone suffers with mental illness is even worse than wishing death on someone. Wishing death on someone that person just has to die,  but mental illness kills you every single day, its like your mind is constantly torturing you. I wrote individual letters to people, and I'm going to put them in my mail box because my family checks the mail box everyday. I don't want a note right next to me
