I now realize inevitably I will just end up killing myselfIt's inevitable, the only thing that makes me happy is hanging out with friends, driving a nice car, and wearing cute clothes. I have a ton of credit card debt, I'm trying to save money, but I need to get a better paying job, put in more hours, and not hangout with my friends. I'm on day 1 of having no social life because all my friends live 30 miles away from me, and so far I'm getting depressed. We're about to hit another recession (or worse another great depression), I know there is absolutely nothing I can do to try and prepare for it. Yet the funny thing is I don't wanna die, I wanna live a happy life, but it doesn't look like I will, especially in today's economy.
