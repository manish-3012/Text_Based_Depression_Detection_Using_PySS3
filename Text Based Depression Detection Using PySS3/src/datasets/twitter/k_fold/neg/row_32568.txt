Itâ€™s really, all I think about.A throwaway, because friends follow my account and I donâ€™t really care to hear â€œare you okay?â€ 

Itâ€™s all I really think about. 
I donâ€™t plan for the future, because I donâ€™t see myself living that long. I never have. Even when I was younger, in high school. I never planned to get this far. 
Any time I think about passing, Iâ€™m young and itâ€™s at my own hand. Thatâ€™s simply the way I want it. 

Iâ€™ve lost about 9 people to suicide in about.. 10 years now. So, really a suicide almost every year. Friends, cousins, grandpa, even my principal. Iâ€™ve started to believe itâ€™s me. I average about two deaths a year (suicide+natural)

Today, I was at my grand fathers funeral. 
Instead of grieving for him, I was jealous of him. 

Iâ€™m young. 23. I binge drink nearly every other day, at least half a 26. 
I abuse drugs, when I can get my hands on them. Specifically Vyvanse. Any sort of stimulant. Even if it feels empty still. 

Iâ€™ve distanced myself from my family so well, I can go weeks without interaction. 
I have two friends, theyâ€™re neat. 
Well maybe, because one of them is incredibly depressed and some times verbally abuses meâ€” Iâ€™m sure to make himself feel better. 
But their happiness is not worth living with my misery. Maybe thatâ€™s selfish. I genuinely donâ€™t wish to hurt people. I just donâ€™t want to continue. 

I have an ex boyfriend, he comes around about once a monthâ€” whispers sweet nothings, and then vanishes again. 
Itâ€™s my own fault, when my child hood best friend hung himself this past summer.. I didnâ€™t really handle it well. I just tried to escape my own reality, rather than deal with his death, I searched for a new reality. 
I cheated.
I was being selfish, and searched for something that didnâ€™t feel real because everything else was too real. Iâ€™ve always had a talent for avoiding things.
So my boyfriend left. Thatâ€™s fair. I donâ€™t deserve him, I shouldâ€™ve just been an adult and handled my shit. 
I was just in pain so I went around hurting other people. Thatâ€™s pretty lame.

So now After 3 years together, a few different apartments and a dog, Iâ€™m a mere cum receptacle. A toy. An ego boost. Iâ€™m familiar space for him to retrieve into. He comes home, gets his fill, and then leaves to enjoy his life being single. And trust me, heâ€™s enjoying it.
While my heart aches, every moment, every day. 

I realize thatâ€™s all I am to anyone though ever, just a means to an end. Used to make other people happy. Iâ€™m comfortable. Iâ€™m support. Iâ€™m always there. I make people smile. My ex says Iâ€™m â€œso lovableâ€.

I donâ€™t want to be that dumb bitch that kills herself over a boy, because thatâ€™s not what this is. 
I cannot stand living with myself. I feel bad for my mom, because my mom has a big heart and feels things incredibly deep like no other human. Iâ€™m sure everyone feels their mother is unique. 

I drank a ton of tequila last night, and took more than a few clonazepam. Which was dumb, I know. 
Did I mention Iâ€™m bulimic? Yeah so any time anything hits my stomach my body now instinctively pukes. 
Itâ€™s like pavlovâ€™s dogs. Classical conditioning. 
Being bulimic saved my life lol thatâ€™s funny. 

Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t want to be. 
I want to be buried in red.
