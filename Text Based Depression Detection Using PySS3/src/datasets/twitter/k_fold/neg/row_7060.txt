Why do we live?Hey,
My friends call me Aby , I'm 23 and I was diagnosed with Autism , Psychopathy (non aggressive) , ADHD , OCD , Anxiety and Panic Attacks , but my last 4 shrinks were unable to answer this question for me in a way to make me get going , so I ask you : Why do we live?

I had a lack of drive for a very long , mostly based on my analitycal  personality and dissecting everything to the point where my knowledge could no longer dissect it and that made me realize , my life , along with 99.999% of the planet live just to live. Each generation only a handful of people shine , and my odds of getting there are fairly low and it would be dumb to dedicate my life to an inprobable endeavor. I just can't face the fact that I'm supposed to live just to sustain myself with no higher purpose. I find it deameaning just to live for the sake of living , make a couple of mini versions of me that are likely to have worse genes than me (thanks to the involution that is happening based on adapting the medium to us , instead of adapting ourselves to the medium and the dilution of the strong genes with bad genes thanks to the limitations on natural selection we incur in the current society) and live happy that I did nothing. I feel hardly any emotions for anyone else , so I can't feel good about myself by doing "volunteer work" thinking that I make the world a better place , cause the people I helped are even more worthless than me , hence helping them carry on their life is futile.

So ,
Why do we live? Why should I live?
Even with an elevated IQ I can't answer that question by myself , be it from lack of knowledge or not having the proper train of thought , and maybe one of you guys holds the meaning to my life.
