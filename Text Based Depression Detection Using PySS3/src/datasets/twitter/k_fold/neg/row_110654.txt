I have driven myself into a deep, deep hole and then filled it in with cement and I want to stop trying to claw my way out   Typing out why I feel this way seems pretty pointless considering there is no combination of words I can put down to truly allow another person to understand the way I feel, but i'm going to do it anyway
  
   The reason I have come to the conclusion that I must kill myself soon is because I will never accept who I am no matter how much therapy, medication, or other type of help I pursue. I am a gay 20 year old male who from an early age realized that my sexuality would be what defined me to almost everyone in my life. When I did allow myself to express myself in small ways kids do I was ridiculed for it by my peers. After a short while I realized that if I stayed quiet and literally didn't speak or move I could effectively shield myself from criticism. So, during those crucial childhood developmental years when we learn how to socialize and express ourselves, I didn't allow myself to participate at all. I have never told anyone what music, art, movies, t.v. shows I really enjoy. I feel as though I have no identity. I never developed one. I am so utterly ashamed of myself which has led to a deep anger that consumes me and I find myself having to refrain from breaking things at all hours of the day.

   I am so terrified of ridicule that I have become increasingly isolated over the years. I am down to 2 or 3 friends and I feel so emotionally detached from everyone around me that I am not sure I can even call them friends. I experience panic attacks on occasion that are so severe I lose my balance, have blurred vision, and am convinced that I am going to die. I had to drop out of college earlier this year because of anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I am incapable of connecting with others despite therapy for 10+ years and at this point I have absolutely not desire to. I've been on various medications which don't help. I haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg here. There's just too much to write down. My own family says they feel like they don't even know who I am. They're right. I did an awful and incomplete job of explaining this all but it boils down to this:

I will never accept that I'm gay. I have tried everything I can think of to alleviate the symptoms of depression and anxiety i've been dealing with for over a decade. I have no identity and ability or desire to be with other people. I sometimes don't even feel like I'm a real person. I see years and years of hell ahead of me and I'm too weak to face it. I will probably go through with it by the end of this year. If you got to the end of this, thanks for reading.
