"Usefulness"I am always told that I am a very "useful" or "helpful" person. This is, of course, meant to be complimentary, but all it does is show how non-essential I am.

These aren't words you use for people. The toaster with extended slots for bagels is "useful". A bell boy taking your luggage up to your room before it's ready is "helpful". Although *technically* a plus, they don't hold any intrinsic value. The usefulness is in the action getting done, not in the act.

Compare this to fun people. People who tell jokes or horse around or understand how to really socialize. That's someone who makes memories and forges connections. People are gonna say "I'm glad I hung out *with x*, whereas for something like me it's "I'm glad my homework is done".

So am I useful? Very. And as I result I am very replaceable. I have nothing specific to me that matters because all of it could be done, perhaps more efficiently, by a tutor or a pyschiatrist than I ever could. If people would seek help from those individuals, then they wouldn't have to deal with any of my own baggage.
