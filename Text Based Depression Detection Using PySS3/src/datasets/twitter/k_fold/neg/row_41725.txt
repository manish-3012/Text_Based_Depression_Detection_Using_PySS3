Itâ€™s time to be realistic.Sometimes life just doesnâ€™t get better. Not everybody gets a happy ending. Some people are cautionary tales. Some people are sacrifices. And some are expendable. Itâ€™s just a matter of doing you want to spend 80 painful and meaningless years for the possibility of the life spark that history has shown you time and time again will never come? Whatâ€™s the point of life if all the things you as an individual care about and find important is not available or accessible to you? Whatâ€™s the point when you everything about who you are and what you do is wrong? Iâ€™m just starting to wake up, and stop living in this lala land that everyone is entitled to their happily ever after.
