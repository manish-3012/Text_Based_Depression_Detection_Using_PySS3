Friend wants to die, and I'm depressedI'm not in danger myself, but I'm super depressed. A friend in another city has decided that she doesn't want to live any longer, and I can't do anything to help her. She isn't planning to kill herself, but she plans to just let herself die. 

She was a victim of abuse for several years before filing for divorce. He retaliated by working to get her visitation rights taken away. She can't afford a lawyer, and has Asperger's, so it would be easy to create a situation to justify taking away those rights. 

I just wish I knew the whole story, or that there was some way I could help.
