Feeling cornered and unstableI've been really unstable these past few weeks and I'm finding it hard to cope. I can't go to school because I can't afford it at the moment. Working a at a dead end job with more than half my paycheck going to bills then the rest needs to be saved up for gas to go to work. One of my relatives opened up about 4-5 credit cards under my name and racked up a couple thousand dollars worth of debt. I don't even know where the cards are at.. I just get call after call and incessant letters in the mail demanding money. I know my family barely gets by trying to pay all of our necessities and we all live paycheck by paycheck. It's really scary honestly. I don't know what to do and I'm so overwhelmed by everything that's going on. There's always something that we need to fix or pay for and we're always stretched thin.

Recently I opened up to some friends but it's come to a point where I pretend to be okay so that they don't feel burdened by me. They've been there for me through a really rough 2 weeks that I had and I know I'm lucky to have them but I don't want to keep being a killjoy so I pretend. I feel so empty, lonely and honestly extremely inadequate to be living in this world. I can't seem to be happy or truly appreciate anything anymore. Lately I've been planning out suicide scenarios and end up being too chicken shit to actually go through with it. But the urge to carry a plan out is still there and getting strong with every failure. Haven't tried going to a therapist or seeing a doc or getting meds because I can't afford anything. Talking to people is all I have and honestly I don't know if that will work any more. It's so hard to wake up in the morning and just use all your effort to try and function like a normal human being when there's nothing to look forward to and nothing to be confident about.
