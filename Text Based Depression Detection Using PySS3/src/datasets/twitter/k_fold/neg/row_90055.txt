No one will help me.I've done nothing all day but lay in bed crying and fantasizing about what I would say in a suicide note. I've been trying so long to get help, and no one can/will. None of the suicide lines/chats even answer, and on rare occasion they do, they can't do anything other than say meaningless lines like, "Your life is worth it, without being able to direct you toward any actual help.

I can't fucking take it anymore. I have no money and no support system. I wish I could just cry myself to death.
