Are suicide hotlines free?SW, I feel like I really just need someone to talk to.  I don't want anyone to know how I've been feeling and I feel like I can get through it, but everyday for the past month all I can think about is killing myself.  I don't know why.  I just want to be gone.  I don't want people to think differently of me and if people found out I was suicidal my life would probably be thrown into turmoil.  I want someone who doesn't know me to talk to, without anyone finding out. Help?
