I'm very close to the final day I've set for myselfA few months ago I decided when I was going to kill myself. I set my final day to be Friday, July 31. So many conflicting feelings. So many contemplations, I wanna get away from what life has to offer. I don't see myself as worth anything and I don't think that my death would cause much unrest. And even if it did, I wouldn't really care about it since I'd be dead already.

I hate the fact that I exist. I'm a failure of a human being. I wish I was dead. So I wouldn't have to hurt anyone ever again.
