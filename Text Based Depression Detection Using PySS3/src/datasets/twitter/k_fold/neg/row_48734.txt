I need a miracleDo you ever feel like you're life isn't amounting to anything? Like all you ever do is try and be productive and it's not working out. Like your family doesn't care about you at all. And you're just stuck there being alone especially at night when you can't sleep and it's taking a toll on you. It's mentally exhausting. And I've been thinking about suicide a lot. And I mean a lot. 
I've done it 3 times before and all those never really worked out. And I'm just scared but at the same time it feels comforting knowing that I have control over this part of my life that if I decide to do it no one's gonna be able to stop me. So I'm here wishing for a miracle.
