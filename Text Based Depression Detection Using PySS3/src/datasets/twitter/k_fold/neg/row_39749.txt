*sigh* whatâ€™s the point?My meds arenâ€™t working anymore. I am getting severely depressed and itâ€™s frustrating. I went to see a doctor who just upped my dose of anti depressants that donâ€™t work for me. WTG doctor. i hate everyone and everything. My mom told me I should get friends and I told her no. I donâ€™t want anyone to have to care about me.  Iâ€™m not worth it. Iâ€™m not worth anything. Iâ€™m just an ugly POS. Nobody would ever love me. I donâ€™t want to be on this earth anymore. I donâ€™t have friends or a boyfriend to begin with so why start now?
