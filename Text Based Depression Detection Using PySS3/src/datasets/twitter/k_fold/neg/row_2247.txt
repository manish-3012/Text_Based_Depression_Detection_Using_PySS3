Girlfriend broke up with me last night. Hitting me harder than I thought...First relationship in 5 years...lasted about 8 months. Putting myself on watch because I'm having suicidal thoughts but I don't dare tell anyone in my life since it could affect everything. 

All my close friends have wondered away...all my friends are virtual. Life sucks. Am alone. Don't really see a point in trying.
