i recognize it's just an imbalance of chemicals but can i just give up already?i get that my life isn't as bad as others, i get that this depression will possibly go away, and i get that i can get help. but can i just give up already? i hate this endless pursuit of trying to better yourself. gonna turn 30 next year, and i'm not saying i've seen it all, but i think i can wrap my head around why people like to live a long life. they're wired to obtain more and better... of anything. they pursue happiness in all forms. i'm just not wired that way, and it's getting a little cumbersome trying to rewire my brain to become a working part of society. i just wanna give up, i just want to allow myself to slip away. why can't i just give up??
