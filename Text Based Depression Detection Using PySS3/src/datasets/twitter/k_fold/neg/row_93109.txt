Suicide seems like the best optionI suffer from Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) after taking Prozac for a short amount of time. Itâ€™s been two years now and my mental state has completely diminished. I spend most days exhausted and in pain and unable to focus on anything along with anhedonia. Iâ€™m a 27 year old man and to be left impotent nearing the prime of my life is soul crushing. There is no known cure and most doctors vehemently deny this condition is even real when thousands suffer from it and there have been countless suicides. I canâ€™t imagine living on for years with this alone and unable to find a woman and have a family. Iâ€™ve pushed all my friends away and my most of my family is dead.  Im an addict and alcoholic alone in a city where I know one person whose becoming more and more of a stranger. SSRIâ€™s have stripped me of my humanity and left me a shell of a person. I canâ€™t even cry anymore. I realize the gravity of my situation but everything is just so numb and the only thing that sounds viable anymore is ending it.
