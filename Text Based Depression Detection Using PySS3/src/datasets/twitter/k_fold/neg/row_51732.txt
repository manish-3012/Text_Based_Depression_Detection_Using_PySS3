consumed by hatred and self loathinghow I wish I had been born in an earlier time, when the world was still beautiful. there was so much ugliness in the past but my God it had to have been better than this 

I hate life. I hate people. i hate myself. I just want to make the hurt stop. why doesn't it ever stop? I just want to die
