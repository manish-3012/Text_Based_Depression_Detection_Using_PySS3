Think it will probably be a spur of the moment thing either before Tuesday or in between 1st -10th juneI tried again to get help. An urgent referal was put through to my mental health team. Yet it's been 10 days and nothing, no letter or phone call. Fuck all. Saw my doctor yesterday an emergency appointment and she has sent ANOTHER urgent referal.

Just can't take it anymore.
