It never gets better. I'm tired of it. Just when I think I'm doing better something else happens.Hanging by a thread. Sitting in a bath with a cocktail of pills beside me and some booze. I've done my research. I know what to do for it to work. Life is meaningless. It's a tragedy that life was wasted on me. Could've been put to some use.
