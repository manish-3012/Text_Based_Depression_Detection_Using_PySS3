Is it time?My ex could make my family leave me with information and pictures of me. I love my family and donâ€™t want them to abandon me.

I never thought they would before but they have hurt me a few times after breaking up with me but blame me for a lot of it. We had another interaction recently and it has sent me on a downward spiral. 

I want to kill myself because someone I trusted so deeply has broken that connection we had. What if they leave me and I loose them forever. Suicide feels like the only answer.
