I feel like itâ€™s not a matter of IF Iâ€™ll kill myself but rather WHEN I kill myselfI had some intense suicidal thoughts many days this past week but theyâ€™ve subsided now. It got pretty bad at some points and I started researching gun laws and making plans in my head of how and when. None of that happened but this is the most intense itâ€™s been in years. Idk, Iâ€™m feeling ok now. But idk how many more years I can take of this. Eventually I might actually follow through.
