Why shouldn't I kill myself?Let's be honest with each other. Nobody on this planet is actually happy. If I die and there is an afterlife, it can't be worse than this. If I die and there's nothing after this life, well, that's obviously better than this life. I guess I can't see a reason to stick around. #merrychristmas #seeyouontheothersideifthereevenisanotherside
