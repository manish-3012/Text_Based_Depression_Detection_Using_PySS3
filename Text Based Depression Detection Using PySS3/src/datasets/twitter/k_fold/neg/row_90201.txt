Life isn't worth living like thisI can't go out in public without getting super anxious. Like i feel like i'm going to die. I feel like everyone hates me and wants to hurt me. My chest tightens up so bad from being anxious and i get tremors in my hand. My throat closes up so i can't speak up. I keep thinking it'll get better one day but it's only been down hill. On top of that i don't have any friends so i feel like i'm mentally deteriorating. I don't have people to talk to. Its gotten to the point where i just try to have conversations with myself i'm that desperate. I'm going insane i'm talking to myself. It's come to this.
