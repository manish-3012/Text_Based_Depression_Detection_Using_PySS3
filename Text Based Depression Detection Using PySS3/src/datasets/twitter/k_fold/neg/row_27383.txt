A simple thingI just want a simple thing - to hug someone and cry, not worrying what they think about me making their shoulder wet, or if they want to cry with me - that's fine to. For some reason, I've been wanting to do this for a long time, I am not quite sure why, but it is what it is. It seems like that would be comforting, a gesture of our mutual trust and closeness, quite a wonderful thing. Btw, I don't need your pity or anything, just wanted to share this somewhere, dunno if this a right sub to share, but I did have problems with suicide, if that's what you need to have on your CV to post here lol
