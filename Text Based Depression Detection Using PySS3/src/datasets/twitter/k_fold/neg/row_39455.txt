(15f) i don't know what to do anymorefrom an open perspective, my life actually looks pretty good right now. i have decent friends, i'm going to a good school and not failing, and i have access to technology. compared to most people, my life doesn't seem that shitty. but sometimes, the expectations simply overwhelm me. i want to work hard for my parents and my siblings so that they can retire peacefully

my parents expect me to be the very best by getting all A's and doing well in the SAT, which is only normal for a parent to want. it's just so hard to be good for everyone else. i can't anymore. at this point, i'm not motivated to try and it's difficult to do simple tasks like waking up every morning. i was clean from self-harming for almost 4 months, but everything changed in the summer. now i can't go a day without self-harming or contemplating suicide. 

i just don't want to be a disappointment. it's so fucking difficult when you get critiqued for everything you do. when people ask me how i am, i always say that i'm tired. i'm tired of having to live in a repetitive cycle of bullshit, unable to fulfill anyone's expectations of me. i'm so damn tired. not only am i not good enough for other people, i'm not good enough for myself. i don't have the right to feel this way when there's others with more difficult situations. 

i don't know if it's worth it to suck it up and live for the sake of my friends, or just selfishly end it all. i attempted twice, it didn't work out, and now i'm just lost.
