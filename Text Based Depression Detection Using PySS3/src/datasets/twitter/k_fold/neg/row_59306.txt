I don't want to commit suicide, but i cant stop these thougths...I'm 19 and i'd always been weird, shy and kind of stupid, i used to have a lot of trouble in school for these reasons wich made me have very little self steem. My family is kind of dysfunctional, so i used to be with constant anxiety over what might happen next. 

i want to get better and be better but i just cant seem to get my life together. I don't have friends because i'd ruin every relationship i had, i dont want to bother my parents right now because they have other problems and my sibling wouldn't undertand it. I havent left my house in months and i really feel like i'm losing my mind.

If any of you were in this situation i would really like to hear any advice you could give me, i know that it wont change my life in a day but i want to start somewhere. Thanks.

I'm sorry for any typo, english is not my first language
