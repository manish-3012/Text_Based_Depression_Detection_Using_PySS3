I don't know if I'm gonna make it to ChristmasIt seems every week I shift from being a functional human being half the week to extreme depression the other half. I'm chronically unlovable. The people I used to talk to about this don't reply to my messages anymore. I feel like everyone who knows me ends up avoiding me.

I started getting suicidal thoughts from when I was three. I know I'll never find someone who actually loves me, I know I'll never make a positive impact on society, I know I won't be able to hold a fulfilling job for long.

Every day I think about buying a rope and going to the hiking paths nearby. Noone to stop me, noone to judge me, noone to act like they care before they realize this is actually something I deal with daily.

I'm just really scared of surviving.
