UPDATE: I didn't go through with it.Hi everyone. Yesterday I made a post announcing I was going to kill myself that night. That post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4mnjre/going_to_kill_myself_tonight/). I reconsidered. I was feeling intense anguish and I figured if I killed myself I wouldn't get the chance to see if it got better. I'm still kinda stressed but I'm doing better than I was.

Thanks to everyone who was looking out for me. I'm trying to sort out my money worries with a few people who can help.
