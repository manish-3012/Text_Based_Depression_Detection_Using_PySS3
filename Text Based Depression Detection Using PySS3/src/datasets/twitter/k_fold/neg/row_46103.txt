I think it's time to throw in the towelI am a well established redditor and know a lot of people on here in person, so this is my throwaway, and coincidentally,  speaking of throwing things away, that's what I have decided to do with myself. Life is just too fucked up and hard recently. I've had it bad since a very young age, (brain cancer at 8, sexual and physical abuse, etc.) but I don't think I'm willing to try to hang on anymore. Negatives keep piling up onto me with no positives, which is no way to live. I'm done trying. Fuck life.
