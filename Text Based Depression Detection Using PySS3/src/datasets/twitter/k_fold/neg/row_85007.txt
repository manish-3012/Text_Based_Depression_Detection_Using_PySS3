a dilemma?been struggling with being depressed, suicidal, and not getting better for most of my life, yknow like a lot of people here. came close to just doing it plenty of times but I can't really say I've attempted. more like, had a plan in my head but obsessive thoughts never let me because it was never the right time. like, it's december that'd be so disappointing to do it now. or, c'mon a new episode/season of that thing is coming out in less than a week. but this time the timing would actually matter. not just to me, but my family and someone I haven't even met yet. gotten to the point where if I meet that person, I won't ever be able to do it and I'll be stuck living a sub par life. the person is my niece. my sister is pregnant, I live with her, we've never been close until now and this would devastate her. she's due in may. I've googled if grief can actually cause a miscarriage, and pretty much everything says no, but even if she doesn't the grief will hit everyone pretty hard. will my sister be so grief stricken over her brother that she'll have trouble taking care of her baby? will it drive wedges between my family members? killing myself will be easy, the key is sitting in my fridge, waiting. but will the decision be? I don't even know why I'm posting this. just getting my thoughts out? I can't help but feel bratty when I talk about myself.
