Don't want to be foundSo if you wanted to commit suicide, but didn't want to put people through the pain of finding your body, what would be a good way to do it?

I think drowning yourself at sea, dying in such a way as you tumble down a mine shaft or burying yourself wouldbe the way to do it. Any other ideas?
