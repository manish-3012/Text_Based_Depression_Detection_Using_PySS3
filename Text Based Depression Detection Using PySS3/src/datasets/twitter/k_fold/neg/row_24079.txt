I'm done with this shit...Every day, I get deeper into a spiral of loss of control and direction. Everyone in my home oppresses me, and hates me for having Asperger's Syndrome. They don't have to say it. I can tell. Every damn time I screw up, they scream, and they hate me, and they ask why I would do something that's super obviously stupid when I don't think like they do. I have little to no friends, and I weird everyone else out. I'm expected to keep young children and another autie in line, when I can't even keep my own tongue in line. I'm alone. I have no friends. I have no family. I'm just a fat, lazy lump of space who deserves to die, because every one hates me anyways.
