my family thinks iâ€™m graduating university thursday, iâ€™m not. canâ€™t ask for help because iâ€™ll look manipulative.itâ€™s been two years of constant suicidal ideation. iâ€™m extremely bulimic and depressed. i was supposed to graduate university may 2018 and fucked it up. then was supposed to in december. fucked that up. my graduation ceremony is supposed to be thursday. my entire family is â€œso proudâ€ of me for finally graduating. i learned from the university that iâ€™m not. i didnâ€™t turn in my dissertation &amp; i failed 2 classes this semester. i was living alone and absolutely ridiculously depressed. became a minor alcoholic. binge/purged up to 20x a day. did a lot of coke and smoked a lot of weed. self harmed a lot. and did NOTHING the last semester of university. i cannot tell my parents that for the 3rd time in a row iâ€™m not graduating. they will disown me. thatâ€™s basically a fact. iâ€™m living with my grandma right now so i canâ€™t even outwardly express how much i want to die i have to keep it low key. i canâ€™t ask for help because theyâ€™ll just think iâ€™m manipulative and trying to hide the fact iâ€™m a fuck up. but itâ€™s been years of this. iâ€™m just done. i truly have nothing going for me. i donâ€™t have close friends, my family lives a 12 hour flight away. they know iâ€™m bulimic and self harm and depressed and even when though iâ€™ve called my mom and sister before when i was sobbing and suicidal they have never checked up on me. iâ€™m just tired. i donâ€™t care about myself or anyone or anything. i live next to a beautiful forest. i want to sneak out tonight with a bottle of vodka and pills and fall asleep somewhere quiet. my familyâ€™s going to think iâ€™m an asshole but who cares iâ€™ll be dead. just kind of mad iâ€™m gonna be dying fat, ive gained 10 lbs in a month, went from 91 lbs to around 101. oh well i want to be cremated anyways so no need for a pretty corpse
