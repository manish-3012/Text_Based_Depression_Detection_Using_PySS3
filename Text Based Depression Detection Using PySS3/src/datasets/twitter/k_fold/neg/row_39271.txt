Is there a point?I'm 16, struggle with borderline personality disorder (at least that's what my psychiatrist told me), depression, and anxiety. I have no friends, I'm behind in school, the meds they give me work for about a week before making me feel like a fucking zombie. I go to school online, so I have no RL connections outside of family, and I'm too much of a nervous wreck to make many friends. I fuck up the friendships I have by being distant or too clingy. Nothing makes me happy anymore - I used to really into art and video games but it's useless to even try at this point because it's just frustrating. My parents struggle to pay bills, fight a lot and are both really depressed and it makes me feel like such a burden. I'm always in my room 24/7 because everyone in my house is either asleep or too busy.

It feels like there's an empty hole in my chest and I'm fucking terrified. I don't know what to do.
