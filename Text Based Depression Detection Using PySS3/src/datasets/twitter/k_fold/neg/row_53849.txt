Need a little helpI'm 28 years old. I've been mentally ill since  I was a teenager. The illness drove me into a lot of places I didn't want to be. I saw things, did things, had things done to me that I wish I could wipe from my mind. And I'm sitting here trying to resist the voices telling me to just off myself already.

I'm switching meds. The doctor told me it could get bad, that paxil was one of the roughest to go off of. They didn't tell me about the impulses. Its not thought out suicide, its have a passing thought and be halfway to the office to get your gun before you realize what you're doing.I had to lock everything in a safe and leave it with my cousin before I could feel comfortable that I wouldn't do anything stupid.

Its hard. I didn't know it would be so hard. And I'm looking for help not knowing what sort of  help I need.
