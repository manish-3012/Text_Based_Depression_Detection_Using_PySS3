The cure for my autismI'm 21-years-old. I'm female. I'm also not straight so I'm fucked. I have autism. Although I'm very high functioning in the way that I can speak normally &amp; such, things still really suck for me. I've been looking for a job since I was 16. No luck at all. I tried to go to Community college, but I have really bad scores. I would have to take Math 046. People that tell me they think I'm intelligent don't know just how stupid I am. Seeing a psychologist lately has made things worse for me. She told me people notice that I'm different &amp; then asked me about what I thought it would be like being in a relationship. The truth is I wish I could be in a relationship so that I could experience someone wanting me around. So I could experience being loved. But I'm autistic &amp; I'm short &amp; look like a 12-year-old child. Women want someone taller than them usually. Guys scare me now as usually the only men interested in me think I'm underage &amp; the ones I thought were normal sexually assaulted me. Things are looking bad for me. I'm too stupid for higher education. I can't get even the most terrible job(I applied to be a janitor countless times)so there's no way for me to be independent, &amp; I can't even get a date not even online. I can't make friends. I can't stop thinking abut killing myself. I've thought about it for almost all my life. I've tried therapy &amp; everything, but the fact of the matter is there really is no negatives in me killing myself. I'm not hurting anyone. My family doesn't care, I have no friends, or anyone who cares. It's not as if the world needs me in anyway. I'm no savant, I have no talent in anything. I'm just consuming resources. I really should just kill myself.
