I donâ€™t owe it to anyoneMy family, my boyfriend, my friends. Theyâ€™re all selfish fucks who want me to stay on this world just for the sake of saving them from pain but what about me? What about my pain? Iâ€™m a broken piece of shit and I always will be and I donâ€™t need to stay alive just because other people want me to. I never asked to be born and I want a refund
