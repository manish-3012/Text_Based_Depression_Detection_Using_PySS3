is there any future for me honestly?with bpd i canâ€™t even decide what i like at this point, i canâ€™t figure out who i am. 

with no tangible outlook on the future on what i wanna be, who i wanna be, is there any point to even go anymore? is there any point to suffer?

thereâ€™s light at the end of the tunnel but itâ€™s false hope to me.

iâ€™m trying my best not to go back to my bedroom today.
