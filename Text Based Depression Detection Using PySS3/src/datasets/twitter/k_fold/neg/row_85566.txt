I'm so tiredThe last time I attempted was 10 years ago. I thought I was getting better. I had a boyfriend who I love more than anything, I had finally made some real friends, and my relationship with my father was doing much better. There were still a lot of things wrong - I still suffer from PTSD and a personality disorder, my mother still abused me and I still struggled, but it was... better. I still struggled a lot with thoughts of wanting to die, but I don't know. I had a reason to keep going - my boyfriend.

Now everything is falling apart again and I'm not sure where to go from here. I might have ruined my relationship of 8 years, I lost my best friend to suicide last year and I'm still not over it, and I have nowhere to move to, no family that can take me in if my boyfriend decides to leave me. I'm broke as shit since I had to leave my job due to the pandemic, so I can't pay the rent by myself and my father is in a retirement home now so I can't stay with him, and I really am realizing how little I have still. I started thinking about suicide again last year, but I'm really at my breaking point now. I don't want to be stuck in a hospital again. Nothing in there helps. I just... want everything to stop and I don't know what to do. 

I just want this to be over. Even my close friends say that the amount I've shit I've been through almost sounds fake because it's so much. I just can't keep dealing with this. The only thing stopping me is how devastated my father and probably ex-boyfriend would be, but I don't even know if that's enough anymore. I'm just so, so tired. I just want this all to be over finally. I've wanted this to all be over for so long. I just want to sleep and never have to wake up again. Trying to fight my way out of this again just seems like too much. I've been fighting since I was a kid. I want to stop now.
