I want to call, but fear my careerHi, my  depression is really beating down on me today and I want to pick up the phone and call the hotline but I don't want to lose my job. My job as a security officer requires me to carry a loaded gun on a daily basis and I don't want to be disqualified for calling. I have 12+ hour day today and need the help. Is there a suicide text service?
