My suicidal experience on shroomsOn Friday night me, my bf and a friend of his who was stopping for the weekend took a bunch of truffles. It was her first experience with magic mushrooms. I ate the most out of the three of us (because I take antipsychotic medication, which I guessed was blocking the â€˜magicâ€™), after a delayed reaction I eventually had quite a trip... 
I split into several separate visible personalities, they cycled taking it in turns to control my body, then I had a lengthy conversation with a man in the bathroom that I was hallucinating. 

When I re-entered the lounge after god knows how long in the bathroom my bf and his friend were in a deep conversation about relationships (sheâ€™s not long come out of a serious long-term thing), they were talking about complications, motives, emotions... everything.
- I tried to contribute to their intense convo, but was bluntly cut off and told by my bf that I was making it all about myself -as usual-... 

Following this I had a series of realisations; 

â€¢ I donâ€™t think deeply... or enough - about anything. Iâ€™m very blank inside, empty and cut off. Hollow. Dormant, vacant. Stupid. Dumb. Whereas, it seems most other people analyse everything and see complications in things that surpass me

â€¢ I thought to myself -my bf and I donâ€™t talk like that... they were having a REAL conversation, with turn taking, a back and fourth discussion, exploring each otherâ€™s feelings through past experiences and reasoning things out, helping each other understand other people and each other 

â€¢ I was practically an animal in the room, a pet, a dog. My lovely bf stroked my head from time to time to acknowledge my presence and let me know I still exist in his world... the world

â€¢ Neither of them could see my face, I was lay down on the floor silently crying (we were all sprawling out). I was jealous at their deep meaningful connection -this was more than a conversation, I could tell, they sounded like soul mates

I felt like the mushrooms were allowing me to think like other people think normally, probably on a daily basis - I was able to listen, understand and comprehend properly for the first time in my life -unlike my regular thoughtless, boring, self obsessed, oblivious mind. I thought about how different I am to everyone else. How I donâ€™t fit in or work properly in this world. I am lacking something vital, in my head. I thought about dying. I wanted to kill my self. I wanted to not be here anymore. Not to exist. I was hurting like never before. I left the room and the sadness crippled me into strange shapes, I silently screamed until I could barely breathe.
