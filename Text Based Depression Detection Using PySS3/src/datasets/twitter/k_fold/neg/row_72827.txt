I'm thinking of killing myself because I don't see my life improving.I haven't lived the worst live imaginable but I can't stand living anymore. I want to pain to end, without causing more pain. I have no friends, I get abused like crazy at my job, my family hates me and I'm going bald at the age of 21. Going bald has affected my confidence, I always wear hats and refuse to look at myself in the mirror. People keep telling me to get over it, which just angers me. 
I have never had a love life, not even a kiss. I have no qualifications because I wasn't smart enough to get into a university. I don't see my life having any sort of improvement. I'm not good at anything.
