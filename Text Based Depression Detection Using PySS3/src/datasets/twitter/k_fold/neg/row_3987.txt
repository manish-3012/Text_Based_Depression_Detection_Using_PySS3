Well, here we are again.So, I decided to go out tonight to one of my favorite bars. Just to get out of the house and be around people, yâ€™know. And get drunk, of course. Iâ€™m by myself, however. Which Iâ€™ve done numerous times before and have been fine, but tonight Iâ€™m just feeling like a loser who doesnâ€™t have any friends. Iâ€™m kind of regretting coming out at all. Sigh. I guess Iâ€™ll just drink the loneliness and depression away. And hope the suicidal thoughts will be kept at bay. Cheers ðŸ»
