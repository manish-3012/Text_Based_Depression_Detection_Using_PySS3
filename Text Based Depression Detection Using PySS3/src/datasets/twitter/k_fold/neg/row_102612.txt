Sad.I want to die, but thereâ€™s two people in my life who care about me. My mom, and my only friend. I canâ€™t tie a noose to save my life (pun intended) so that doesnâ€™t work. But I already made my own creative way. Plastic bag, duct tape. 
Step 1: I put plastic bag over head 
Step 2: I tape it so tight I wouldnâ€™t be able to get it off when my brain reacts.
Step 3: grab scissors because I donâ€™t want my dog, my mom, or my only friend to miss me, and how pussy do I have to be? Only 3 living things in this world care, and one of them is the only 1/3 people in my family besides me. My dad and brother hate me, and so does everyone else. You wanna know whatâ€™s even better? Since my life is so fucked up, I donâ€™t believe in god, so if they are real, Iâ€™m fucked. At least if I go to hell my demon of a personality (that I inherited from my dad cuz genes suck) will be at home. Everyone at my school thinks Iâ€™m happy, but Iâ€™m a fucked up mess of a thirteen yr old.
