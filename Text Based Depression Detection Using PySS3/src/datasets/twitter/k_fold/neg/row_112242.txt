Even being awake is too painfulI'm a 19 year old girl. I don't want to die. I'm terrified at the idea that I will one day be gone regardless of anything I do, so I feel like I need to take control of that and decide when my time is. I was abused for years by my dad and sexually assaulted by another man but people don't believe me and somehow I seem to get the blame for these things. Even being conscious is unbearably painful. My heart feels heavy and my body feels numb and I feel trapped in my own body. Everyone says I'm very pretty and I'm very philosophically and artistically intelligent and I feel like I have the potential to do amazing things- even change the world, but none of it seems worth anything. I can't use those things to do anything worthwhile because I'm stuck in the body of someone who feels pain just being awake. I can't even hold down a minimum wage retail job so how am I ever going to progress from there? I am alone in this world even though I'm not and that's the scariest place to be in. I have been to A&amp;E before telling them that I'm suicidal, only to be told to go home and treated like I'm wasting their time. If anyone has any words of comfort at all it could make all the difference, thank you.
