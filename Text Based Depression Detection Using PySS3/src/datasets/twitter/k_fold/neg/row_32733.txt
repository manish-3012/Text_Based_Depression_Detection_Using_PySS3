Climate change and Anthropocene mass extinction is gonna kill us all anyways.Cataclysm DDA still allows me to at least partially vent my depraved and violent urges so I don't act out and keep myself contained.

My friends and family still care about me, difficult as it is to care about them back.

I don't need to commit suicide. I feel like both myself and everything about the world is spiritually dead and we're just getting ready to get recycled by whatever fucked up demiurge let this reality get so bad to begin with.

So yay, I guess. Pain is the new pleasure.
