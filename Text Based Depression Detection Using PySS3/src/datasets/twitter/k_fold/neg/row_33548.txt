24, college graduate, can't find a decent job for the life of me.After about three months of unemployment and 200-plus applications, I finally got a new job... as a warehouse associate that regularly requires me to lift 40 - 70 lb boxes all day long.  Not that I'm looking down on warehouse associates (some people like it and it can pay well), but it's not for me, and I'm worried about seriously injuring myself on the job.  It seems like my life is destined for this type of work and for my degree (in a marketable field) will go to waste.  Why shouldn't I just end it right now?  I've been thinking about this for about six months, and I'm losing more hope by the day.
