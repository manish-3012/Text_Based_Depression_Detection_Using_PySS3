I can't stop thinking about suicideI feel absolutely hopeless. My thoughts have made it difficult to do anything and heres why: A few years ago when I was around 18 I downloaded some images of underage girls I found off the internet on a phone, I don't remember what I did with the phone but it's gone, most likely threw it away a long time ago but I absolutely don't remember what I did with it. A month ago for some reason I remembered having this phone and the images I downloaded and started freaking out, tried looking for the phone but can't find it. I wanted to find it so I could ease my mind over the possibility of someone finding it and me getting in trouble for what was on it. This one fucking phone has been haunting me for the past month, I can't get the thought of not knowing where it is out of my head, the possibility of someone finding it and me getting in trouble. I can't think about anything else and these thoughts have fucking consumed me. Not knowing where that phone went is destroying me. My OCD makes me think about it continuously and the thoughts wont leave my head. It might sound dumb but I'm strongly considering suicide over this. My therapist and psychistrist both know of the situation and have told me to just forget about it. I've been prescribed antidepressants, anti anxiety meds but they don't do shit because the thoughts are still there. I had this phone about 3 years ago so it's been about that long since I've seen it, for some reason something triggered me to think about the phone when I completely forgot about it until just recently. I'm not asking for sympothy I just want to write my story because this will probably end in me killing myself. I realize what I did was wrong and you can get in alot of trouble for that type of thing but I was young and stupid and now who knows where that phone is or what happened to it? It's killing me. Does anyone know how to stop thinking about something over and over again?? I've seriously lost hope.
