Is this just a bunch of teenage kids?These posts all look like "my mom and dad just don't understand" or "I'm 17 and broke up with my girlfriend and have nothing to live for". Like if someone was really having problems, this is just a place for someone who had a minor break-up or is mad at their mom. I mean, it's cool. Breaking up with your girlfriend sucks, man. I am sure you're 18 and she was the love of your life. Or your dad was so mean he told you to get a job, or whatever. Just looks like such a laughable joke looking at the whining here over virtually nothing.
