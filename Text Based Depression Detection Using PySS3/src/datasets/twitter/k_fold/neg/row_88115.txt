I just cannot handle this anymoreI browse this subreddit religously. I think i hate myself for it but its the only place i feel like i fit in. Im sat in the middle of a club typing this right now and even though and surrounded by people and my best friend is next to me, i feel totally alone. I want to run out on the street and dive under a car. I wish this was just a bad mood swing but everyday on the walk to work i wish god would hit me with a fucking lightning bolt. I swore i would never end my own life, couldnt do it to my mum. I owe her too much. But waking up every morning and wishing i died in my sleep is getting too much. I hate myself for hating myself. I feel like i always try to be nice and do whats right, like karma will come around right? Well its taking its sweet fucking time.  I literally stared smoking in hopes it gives me cancer, so far thats the only thing it feel like im getting any progress on in my life. Im just sort of saying the first things that come to my mind, but im sick of laying this on my friends amd family, they have their own problems. I have no idea where im supposed to go from here, and i dont think i care, honestly didnt think i would make it this far to start.

If you read this far i feel like i just need to say dont fall into the hole i have. Do what makes you happy otherwise itll all come crashing down. And i might have never met you but i would sit down and have a drink with you righr now if i could. I wouldn't wish this feeling on my worst enemy and i sure as shit dont want any of you people feeling it.

Please just be happy, no one should feel like this, im so sorry if you do. Please just be happy.
