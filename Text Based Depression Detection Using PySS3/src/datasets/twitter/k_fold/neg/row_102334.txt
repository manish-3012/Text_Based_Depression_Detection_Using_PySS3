Killing myself might finally quiet my thoughtsI over think everything. I'm constantly thinking about how other people feel and how I might have hurt them. Life is so stressful and so heavy when I'm constantly worried about how the people around me feel and if I'm being the best I can be for myself and for them. I just want to disappear and never have another thought ever again. I don't want to take medication because two people I knew started taking anti-depressiants and then they killed themselves, so I'm afraid that they will alter my mind and I will no longer be able to control myself. I don't want to die. I really don't want to kill myself, but the only place I think I will actually find peace is in death where I won't exist.
