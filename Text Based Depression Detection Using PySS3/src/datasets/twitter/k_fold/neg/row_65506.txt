Whats the Reason for me to be hereI am very stressed and I can't calm myself down. I had 14 friends when I started on high school, when I said I was Muslim.. I only had 4 friends and I wonder what I have been doing wrong. I've done nothing wrong and why do people hate me too much because I am muslim :(

The country I live in is christian and I have nothing against them. High school is giving a lot of homework and extreme stress on gym. I do not have time on saturday or sunday. I don't have any time to do anything. I only have 7 min free thats why I'm writing this. I am the unluckiest person, I am depressed and life is boring 14 years old. My brain is not working so you may think what did I write or you may not understand.
