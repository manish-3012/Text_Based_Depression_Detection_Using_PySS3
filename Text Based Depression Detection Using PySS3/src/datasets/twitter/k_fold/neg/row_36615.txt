For fucks sake! why do so many people want me to live?!I hate this place so, so much. I don't want to be here at all, but so many other people do want me to..why? You don't even know me. I really don't matter at all. I'm just a waste of space, and you know that too. Just why? Why do so many people feel the need to keep me alive? It's so confusing to me. They probably don't care. They're probably just saying that because that's what they're "supposed to" say. I don't get it. 

This is actually more of a rant lol, but I just had to get this out there.
