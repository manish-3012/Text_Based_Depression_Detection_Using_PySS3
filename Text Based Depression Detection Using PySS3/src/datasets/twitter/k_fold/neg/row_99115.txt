I finally understand what it feels like to believe the world would be better if I was never bornThe first time I thought about suicide was when I was 12 years old, 10 years ago. My whole life I've struggled with depression and anxiety, however despite the ups and downs often intensified by trials and trauma, I've always prided myself on standing back up after I've been knocked down. 

Over the years, the frequency I considered suicide has fluctuated, the worst of times being at 16, 20, and now at 22. In the past, these thoughts were purely based on feelings of intense sadness, defeat, and the loss of hope. This time though I feel like I can understand George Bailey's honest belief that the world would be a better place if he had never existed. 
I recently ended my relationship with my long term boyfriend as I believed it was the best decision for myself, while he was left devastated and alone. Yesterday I let a friend's completely valid honesty upset me, making him feel bad for telling me the truth. My mom recently shared with me her feelings of regret for working four jobs as I was growing up, causing her to miss important moments in my youth. At work, I feel alone and unappreciated, but continue to stay as finding a job in my city as a student that pays enough to cover rent is nearly impossible. 

I know the suicide hotline numbers, I have a therapist, and I know my life is full of people who would love and support me if I shared this struggle with them. The problem is that I'm so exhausted of feeling the way I feel, that the thought of even life's simplest tasks seems unbearable and impossible.
