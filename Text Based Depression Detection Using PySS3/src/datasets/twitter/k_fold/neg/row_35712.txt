AloneI've dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression my whole life. In my depressed state I've fucked my life up. I'm failing school (I'm in my thirties), my wife isn't sure if she wants to stay with me, and when I confided in her that I've dealt with depression for years, she thought I was making it up as a way of excusing my actions. All I wanted was support. I'm taking all the steps I can think of to take - I've started therapy, I've been working hard at...well, working hard. I'm trying to do everything I can to be the man she can see a future with, but I'm afraid that no matter what I do it won't be enough. I can't sleep at night, I can't eat, and when I do my stomach attacks me. The only thing I have to look forward to in my life at the moment is the hope that my wife will one day trust me again. Like I've said, I've dealt with suicidal thoughts my whole life, but they've never been as strong as they've been the last few days. Sometimes I just with I had the guts to swallow a handful of pills and be done with this life. In the short term people may be sad, but it may be better for them in the long run.
