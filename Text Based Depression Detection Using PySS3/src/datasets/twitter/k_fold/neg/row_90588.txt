Im 16, with chronic pain and want to end it.Growing up, I always had health issues. Since I was born I had seizures but have been seizure free for 9 years. When coming off of seizure meds I gained a lot of weight. Fast forward to 2014 I believe and i get in a car accident causing me to have bulging disks in the C5-C7 area (upper spine/neck area). This triggered my fibromyalgia. I now have constant pain that has progressively gotten worse. 2 years ago I had to do online school because it was too hard to do anything. 1 year ago I tried going to actual school, but i had to stop because stomach issues developed. I now canâ€™t eat without pain, breathe without pain, walk without pain, everything hurts. You may think â€œjust take some pillsâ€ well I tried. Many. Even narcotics, but we found out I have dumping syndrome which means my body digests things way too quickly so by the time it gets to my intestines itâ€™s not even fully digested and out of my system very quickly, so pills take on average 30 mins to an 1 hour to work, well by then itâ€™s already out of the area it needs to be in. So I have 0 pain relief. I have lost all of my friends because of this, I have online friends but itâ€™s not the same. And they wonâ€™t admit it, but my parents resent me for this. Itâ€™s small things of â€œwell we canâ€™t do this because sheâ€™s in too much painâ€ or when I ask to use the wheelchair I get many grunts and complaints. There is no point in living a life where Iâ€™m stuck in my room, in pain, with close to no chance of getting better.
