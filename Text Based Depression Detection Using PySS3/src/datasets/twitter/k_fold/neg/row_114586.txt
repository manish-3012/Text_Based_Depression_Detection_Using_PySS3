Lonely, worthless and no solutions.I am only 17 years old, yet my dad passed away when I was only 2 years old, my stepdad, who has been with us since, battles with cancer now and I suffer from Ulcerative Colitis and acne on my face, neck, chest, shoulders and back. I have never been complimented other than by my family members. I have never had positive turning point in my life, like relationships or set of good skills.

 I have never been kissed, I have never had relationship, but I have tried twice after lots of mental preparation but rejected both times. I do have some friends, but they do not hang out with me outside of school. I am social and find myself fun. I would love to date, but no one has ever been interested in me. I've not thought of myself as an ugly boy, other than now, because of the way I get treated and ignored and I hate pictures of myself. 

I even posted some of my best pictures to photofeeler and got 20-40% attractive even on pictures I thought were very good. I am 180 cm tall, blonde, thin built but broad shoulders and I go to gym, but progress is slow and not noticable (I've been there 7 months now). I had one friend I thought I could talk to and she said that I can talk to her about anything, but she is too busy or ignores me. She also just says those basic things that do not help me at all, like that everyone sees beauty differently, yet she dates the most handsome boys in our school. I don't want to wait for someone special, I want to be treated well and admired by even one person. I don't want to kill myself because it would break my mom and older sisters who have suffered enough.

I've also gone to 2 different psychologists and have psychiatrist appointment coming up, but I don't see them helping me at all, they can't change the way I look or how life treats me.
