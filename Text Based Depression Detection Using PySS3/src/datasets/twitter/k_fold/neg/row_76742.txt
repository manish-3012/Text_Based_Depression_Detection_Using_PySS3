I AM NEVER HAPPY AND I WANT TO KILL MY SELF BECAUSE OF ITIm never happy.
Even when i am happy something bad always happens making me depressed.
My whole life has been a roller coaster going up and down.
I have people trying to fight me, i have some many lost family members that i could talk to but they passed away, i have so many problems in my life that's why im always depressed and sad amd have suicide thoughts and now i just want to end it all.
If im not happy by april 22 i will kill myslef.
I won't even care anymore.
I will just forget about everything.
(April 22 is my birthday)
