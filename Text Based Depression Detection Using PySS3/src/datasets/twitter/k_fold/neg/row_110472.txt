I have to die. There is no way to get through this besides death.I cant hold on much longer, and even then soon thats not going to be enough. I had my first real depression at 16 begining sophmore year. I absolutely hated public school and couldnt take it anymore. I would have rather died or take whatever consequence over going. But my parents supported me, got me counseling as soon as they could and got me into a ged program for school which was the best way for me to learn and i ended up graduating with my ged that same year. My depression was completely gone at this point, and 4 months later my parents want to move 20 minutes away to the town my dads resturant is to be closer to work, which is a small ass town with only about 7k people in it and hardly anything that isnt a bar or resturant or bank. I was pretty excited for the move at first, as i could walk to and work at my dads resturant almost everyday and just general excitement about moving into a new and better house. But it ended up being the worst thing to happen to me, i didnt realize how miserable this town would be for a 17-18 year old with no license and no friends. I worked at my dads resturant around 20 hours a week for about half a year after moving, and for the first couple months i saved most of it but after, i spent every single dollar earned on weed. I had literally nothing else to spend it on that wasent food, bowling, or clothes and the closest thing i could save for was getting my license which was 6 months away. I moved 35 minutes away from the town closest to where i previously lived and where all of my friends and school was, and none of them having a license and a car at the time. Ive been here for over a year now and STILL havent made any friends that arent a coworker (they arent very fond of me. I couldnt get yo know them outside of work) despite alot of effort. There was nothing else to do but work, come home, smoke and play games. At first i was fine with it, but as those first six months went by it got really stale and i started to fall into depression again. I worked less and less, when i had weed working felt pointless because its just weed money and i would rather just stay home and smoke. But then when i ran out, i would actually go most days im supposed to but it would still felt pointless because i would have to work but wouldnt get paid untill the friday of the next week and work just to come home after and have literally nothing to do but play the same games. And then just spend what i earn on weed again anyway. Eventually, i stopped working completely. So because i made 0 actual friends in this town , i still couldnt get my license because i never got to do drivers ed, and still none of my friends owned a car and a license all i could do was sit home. Almost all day everday. Everyday felt worse and worse. I got to a point where i would do something i never imagined i could ever do, but i didnt care anymore, whatever would help me feel better or just numb me i will take. Ive stolen over 500$ worth of money and things and countless amount of alcohol from my parents, which they expect me to eventually pay all back. I feel obligated to.... Ive lost all motivation. Entirely. I never shower anymore, never take care of myself, dont eat a third of what a average person should be eating. My life is going to be straight suffering in this place untill i move out or am kicked out.  But i have 0 intrest in going back to work or just living as a human being as long as i live here, and if i did i would still have to pay back the money i stole. I turned 18 last month and just got caught stealing another 120 from my parents last week, they already told me i was on thin ice with me stealing from them , theres almost no way its not the last straw. They already told me i have to pay rent once im 18 but havent made me yet. Its only a matter of time before im kicked out, i have no place to go, no experience,no motivation, no will to live. Nothing makes me happy or excited anymore. Not even getting high or anything when i am high. Im a piece of shit who would steal from the people who have gave me everything ive ever needed and supported me through everything. Theres just no other way around this i have to die. Im not mentally strong enough to make it in this world. Ive battled this for almost a year and its the exact same thing it was when it started. I have no strive or motivation for my dreams and for what i need to do to live. Im waiting untill after christmas for the sake of my family and maybe ill find a solution before i end it. I doubt it. It makes me really sad it has to come down to this but there is no better option. There is no future for me.
