Sometimes I wish I were a little more suicidalI often feel that I want to die but I'm never suicidal "enough" to make an explicit plan. It's unsatisfying to think about killing myself while also knowing I won't have the balls to get there. I don't think my existence was really ever worth it, but I can see myself living miserably for many more decades just because I don't have the guts to end it. I wish I were more suicidal so I could just get it over with.
