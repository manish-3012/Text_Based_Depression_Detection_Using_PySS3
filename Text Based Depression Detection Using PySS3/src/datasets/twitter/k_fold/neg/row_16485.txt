Wind it downThe list for not being here gets longer. Lost the only good job I ever had, moved away from family, got divorced, kids living far away, living alone, going to give away my dog, or just leave her outside, running out of money, not working, exhausted, depressed, living in the place I lived when I was married, it is filled with garbage and nothing. I hate my existence, I just need a way to make it click and get out. I hope tonight. No use prolonging this. Fuck god for not helping. Fuck me for being stupid.
