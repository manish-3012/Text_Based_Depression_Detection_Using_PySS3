Please Don't Feel Guilty About Reaching OutI posted last night, but in case people were asleep and didn't see it, I'll reiterate what I said. I'm a 23 year old guy who battles his own depression and takes medication to manage it. I have coping skills, but one of the very few things that makes me feel better is helping others with depression and suicidal thoughts. I used to feel so invisible and I still feel lonely at times, particularly now when I can't see any of my friends. Please don't feel guilty for reaching out for help or just wanting a friend to talk to. It's normal to get lonely, it's normal to get depressed. I'm not perfect I've made tons of mistakes in my life, but I just keep fighting and reminding myself every day that I have something to live for. Something to look forward to when I get out of college. Someone out there that will love me and will appreciate me instead of make me feel guilty. If you need a friend or just someone to vent to, I won't judge you and I won't call the police if you tell me you want to kill yourself. I'll listen and just try to help. That's what human beings should do, but so many are just afraid of caring about someone other than themselves. I'm here to talk
