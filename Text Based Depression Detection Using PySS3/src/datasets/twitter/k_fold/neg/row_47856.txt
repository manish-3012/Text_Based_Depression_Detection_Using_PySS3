I feel like my life is worthlessI feel like life is pointless and I see no options, I lost my keys to my shitty old truck and this the time now I can't even drive it to a mechanic to fix it and the only locksmith around wants to $850 to make a fucking key and drive out for it. I'm broke don't have money for anything, my family is even poorer I'm am. I'm in debt because of the money scam called college, I can't find a job because the covid has shutdown the economy, I feel like jumping off a bridge I just can't stand this horrible crushing feeling. 

Please someone help me, I need to talk to someon
