I took a box of pills and threw them up.I haven't attempted since my teens. I was reminded by my brother how pathetic I am, how my illness has literally ruined our family and I took the box. Lol, as if a box will kill me. I've know that this never works from other times.

Mum's like "so we're going to have to get your stomach pumped now?" and I realised they'd have to take me. Not gonna try to kms and bring my family down with me. Dad told me to throw up. 

So I did. And my brother and I made up, he actually talked to me honestly. But now I feel empty. I want to tell my friends so they know I'm in a bad place but that would just be emotional abuse. 

I'm very lonely. I am aware I am pathetic, attention seeking. I feel incredibly nauseous.
