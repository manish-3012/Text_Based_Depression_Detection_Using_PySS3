I don't know what to doI need help. I've been contemplating suicide for the past few years but lately it seems like the only choice. I don't want to go into specifics but lately things have been really rough, and I've been seeing a therapist but I can't go on medication or anything and it's not helping. I'm pretty drunk right now and I just cut myself for the first time in about a year, and I'm already very ashamed of it. I just don't know what to do anymore.
