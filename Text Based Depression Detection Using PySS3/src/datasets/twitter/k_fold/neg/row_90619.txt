Ready to throw the towelNo one willing to help me , care for me or love me ... Ä° had made many stupid decisions in the past because a situation in the past really traumatized me . When i was 4 or 5 year old ,my grandpa commited a crime and went to jail ... this gave emotional trauma i can barely could get out .
Because i was loving him ,he was a good grandpa 
he passed away from cancer  8 years ago and i still miss him ...now i got no one , no girlfriend or nor a friends ,no one cares ... iam so alone ...
As i said before my life is beyond the repair . Ä° just want to throw it and end this sick exsistence ...
My relatives getting jops , getting marry and graudate from college , i am failing in everything just a 21 year old unloveable garbage . Ä° really want to punch the universe in the face ! iam sick of dissapointed in everything.
