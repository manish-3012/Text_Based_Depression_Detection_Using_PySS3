Why the fuck do I even bother?All day I've been attempting to work on helping myself be better about approaching my thoughts, dealing with my anxiety and depression. I had managed to ease things enough to where I could finally feel the weight being lifted from my chest. I spent the rest of the day at work relaxed and feeling in charge of myself for once. I've never felt so calm in my entire life. 

And the second I get home, my Fiance explains that the only thing that keeps me calm, I can't do at work anymore. No more being on reddit at work, no more talking to people that calm me. Nothing. Not until we're all caught up. 

Considering how stupid my boss is, they keep dumping work on us and then complaining that we're not working fast enough. I don't understand this. My Fiance tells me that this is how the world works, it doesn't matter how overwhelmed we are, we have to get the work done. 

We got into an arguement, (granted I know I can be hard to deal with...) but what he said really hurt. 

"You don't realize what I go through dealing with you. Shut the fuck up." 

I just...I'm not in a good place mentally. I know I was wigging out over something so stupid and....I dunno....

Right now I'm planning on giving him a true break from me...

If I'm so horrible to handle...maybe I should just vanish from his life...then I won't be his problem anymore. Then he won't have to deal with someone as pathetic as me. 

I'm so tired of being someones burden.
