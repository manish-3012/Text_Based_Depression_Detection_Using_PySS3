I donâ€™t know how to tell my boyfriend about my struggle with suicidal thoughts.I [20F] have been struggling with anxiety and suicidal thoughts for a while but have just recently sought help through counseling. Being one of those people who believes they have to appear strong and perfect in front of everyone else, itâ€™s been hard for me to tell my family and impossible to tell my friends (including my BF [20M] of one year). I think heâ€™s figured out that I have issues with anxiety but I have yet to tell him about the other struggles Iâ€™m facing (mainly suicide). 

I read a post about someone who was contemplating leaving their SO bc of their history with suicide. I have never attempted though I have had moments that have come close and Iâ€™m terrified this would scare away my BF. Being far from my home right now for uni, I need my BF more than ever for support. I love him dearly and honestly see us spending the rest of our lives together. I believe he deserves to know the truth especially if their comes a time in the future where I really just need to discuss things with him. 

Is now the time for me to tell him about everything? How the heck do I even approach a conversation like that? Him leaving me might honestly push me over the edge. Iâ€™m a coward and Iâ€™m terrified of what consequences might come of this. 

TL;DR Iâ€™m afraid my boyfriend might leave me if I tell him about my suicidal thoughts and donâ€™t know what to do
