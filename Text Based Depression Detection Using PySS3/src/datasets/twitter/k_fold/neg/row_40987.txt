iâ€™m so tiredi feel useless, like i have no potential in life. iâ€™m stuck as a senior in high school and my grades are dropping like crazy. i have no motivation to do anything. i donâ€™t feel like i can tell my mom because it would break her heart. my medication does nothing, and no one cares. my friends would all move on in like a month. if i wasnâ€™t such a coward i wouldâ€™ve done it already. i just want someone to care about me, and to feel like my lifeâ€™s of value but iâ€™m done trying.
