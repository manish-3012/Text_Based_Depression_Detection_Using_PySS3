gonna go jump tonight just wanted to get a few words outhey gonna go jump and kill myself tonight, itâ€™s been okay so iâ€™m just gonna vent itâ€™s okay nobody cares about me anyway so it wonâ€™t make a difference 

nobody cares 

literally all my friends barely even acknowledge me anymore or try to help me and theyâ€™ve just given up on me and they literally just plan shit without me and i fucking hate it they used to be my rock and now theyâ€™ve just gone and left i feel so alone iâ€™m so alone

and the tall man is back iâ€™ve always been hallucinating of the tall shadowy man who stands at the foot of my bed and waits for my awareness to dip for me to feel safe but now even with the lights on i can see and feel him i canâ€™t move anything other than my fingers please help iâ€™m so scared iâ€™m so sad i just need to die

itâ€™s so overwhelming itâ€™s like a blanket smothering me and choking me and i canâ€™t breathe and it feels like iâ€™ll never be happy again because nobody fucking cares, nobody is going to respond to this or even acknowledge iâ€™m there and even if they do iâ€™ll just be a burden to them like iâ€™m a burden to everyone 

i can feel the tall man looking at me with his eyes and it scares me so much i just want to die i want to run away and jump to my death but iâ€™m so scared if i move the tall man will get me in this isnâ€™t bait or whatever iâ€™m legitimately scared

i want to fucking die im so alone no one cares about me iâ€™m a burden iâ€™m so useless iâ€™m so stupid and bad at everything and i canâ€™t ever accomplish anything iâ€™ll be left here in the middle of bumfuck nowhere as my â€œfriendsâ€™â€ failed charity project i donâ€™t matter to anyone i want to fucking die 

even counselors and teachers think iâ€™m a fucking burden like they have to talk to me like iâ€™m stupid and braindead and i am iâ€™m so useless iâ€™m a pain in the ass i want to fucking die im so alone please someone help
