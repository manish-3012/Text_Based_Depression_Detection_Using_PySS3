Saturday nightâ€œThey're crying out for help, and don't know how else to get it. These people don't usually want to die but do want to alert those around them that something is seriously wrong.â€ 

This is how I feel. At this point I wish i didnâ€™t have to die but i feel like i have to. I donâ€™t want to be alive and i donâ€™t want to be dead. I want someone to notice iâ€™m hurting and i want someone to care.
