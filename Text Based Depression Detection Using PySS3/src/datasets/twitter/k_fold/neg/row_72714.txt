Not fully, but yeahso slitting one's wrist surprisingly does not hurt as much as I thought it would. I went lengthwise rather than crosswise with a feather shaving blade.. It doesnt bleed much, but I didnt go as far down as the main vein. I thought it would hurt badly, but it doesnt really. I feel more laughter at the ludicris thought than anything else. My wrist is bleeding and all I need to do is go a little bit further . . . what is preventing me from doing so? I have no zest, or zeal for life, life is miserable and an unending torment. Life is hell
