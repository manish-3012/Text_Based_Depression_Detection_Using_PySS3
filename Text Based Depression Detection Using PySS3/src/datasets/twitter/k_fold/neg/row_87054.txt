Not scared to kill myselfI use to be scared of killing myself. Recently my depression has gotten to a stage where I just don't care. You could steal my stuff you could steal everything I had and I wouldn't care. Could stab someone in front of me I'm too careless. I've noticed recently I use to be depressed and cry now I'm just at a stage where I feel nothing. It's like blackness as an emotion. Just nothing there. I'm exhausted. I posted before about getting help and my situation but nobody on Reddit really gave me advice or help. I've realized it's useless. Kinda just waiting until I get my hands on a gun or the right prescription drugs then I'll probably do it. As long as I die quick I'm fine with it. I've thought about going to a hospital for depression but I can't find a hospital that'll allow me to stay over night as well as let me use my electronic devices. I have a long distance girlfriend and if I'm getting help I would want to be able to at least communicate with her through text. I'm 18, no job, broke can't even get my own SSI money my grandmother is abusive and has her name on it and I don't know how to get my own SSI money. I'm kinda lost and fucked and I'm just waiting for the perfect time to end it. I posted here because I have no reason to keep going. I thought I'd express myself one last time
