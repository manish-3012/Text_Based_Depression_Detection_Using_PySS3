To /u/Ryfflex - if you are still out there. Please let me know.About a year ago I made a post on this subreddit looking for someone to talk to.

A user by the name "Ryfflex" contacted me. We talked, for a couple of months off and on before my life had gotten too busy and I hadn't had time to check up or get back to you.

I know that you were in a very dark place yourself and that you have since deleted your account (you had mentioned it was a throw away) but I just want to know if you are still out there and if you are still 'okay'.

I know you browsed this subreddit a lot and you always checked up on other people and talked to a ton of others, now I want to check up on you.

Hopefully you have made another account, and hopefully you are able to see this. I just want you to know that I am still here to talk to.

Let me know how you are buddy. Hope to hear from you again soon.
