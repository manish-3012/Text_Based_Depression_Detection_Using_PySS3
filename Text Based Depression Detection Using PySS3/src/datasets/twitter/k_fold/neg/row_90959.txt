In two days.I made a post a while ago, saying I was planning on suicide for August 13th. Today is August 11th, and nothing has gotten better. In fact, my situation has gotten worse. I simply wanted to say to everyone who pushed me this far, fuck you. I hope you're all happy now. Because in two days, I'm going to die.
