16M, most useless boy (not man) to ever beI can't fucking do shit. My entire life is basically just homework, video games, food, verbally abusive parents, food, and video games.

I can't do anything right. I'm such a fatass and ugly POS and I don't do anything about it besides complaining. But I can't do anything else! I'm so goddamn chronically lazy! If anybody else had my body, they'd be hot and awesome as shit. But not me-I just don't do anything.

I've already planned to kill myself at college, fear's making me a little skeptical. Plus that romantic part of me that refuses to admit there is no hope for me. 

I'm the most useless, cowardly, ugly, worthless, pointless, fatass piece of shit I've ever met. And I don't have the ability to improve.
