i always see stories about how people can't kill themselves because it'd hurt their parentsbut the idea of my shithead mother finally realizing what abusing me for years straight does makes me want to do it more. the only bad part is that i wouldn't be able to see her face when she walks into my room to complain about some dumb shit only to see my lifeless corpse.

i fucking wish i had a mom who actually cares like most of you do
