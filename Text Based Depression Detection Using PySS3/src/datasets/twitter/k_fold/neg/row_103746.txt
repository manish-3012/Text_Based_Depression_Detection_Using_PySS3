I want to die. I want to numb all of my pain.But I'm scared too, because numbing the pain and ending my life is two different things. Numbing is to no longer feel it, and if I end my life, there is no longer anything. No more of nothings or somethings or anything. No eternal bliss, no darkness, no silence, no thoughts, nothing.

I just want to not feel this way. I truly just want to be normal. But I can't. I just want to stop how I feel. I want to be happy. I wrote a suicide letter today and I want to do it but I don't want to die too. I just don't. But why should I wait any longer. It has been the same for the past 5 years. Nothing changes the feelings always come back. It always does. Why should I try anymore.
