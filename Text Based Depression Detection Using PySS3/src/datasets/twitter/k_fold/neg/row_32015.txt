every breath is painful decline, death would be the epilogue to this endless storyits less of a watch and more of a decay, this whole suicide thing. i've been at a decay for a long time and over the last year, i've used sites like this one to figure out what i could do to get better. countless posts, many without response and at this point, i don't understand why i just don't give up. i've grown impatient.

truth be told is, i can't wait to give up. i'm giving up soon, just i'm not sure when. can't wait, it'll be awesome. awesome is the word that comes into my mind, because i just want to stop hurting.

this is a disease that will never go away. this is a life that i don't wish to live. it hasn't been long compared to some, but its long enough for me. i can't afford hospitals, therapists don't listen, medication doesn't work, there's just not enough time. 

i understand that after life comes nothing, but nothing is better then this.
