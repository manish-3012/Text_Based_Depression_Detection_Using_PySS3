Iâ€™m in between staying around to avoid having others grieve over my death, and doing it because I know Iâ€™m a burden.I have a couple autoimmune diseases. When I was a kid I was super sick, but no one ever believed me (â€œgirl who cried wolfâ€). Diagnosed with lupus at 11. At 23, some of my family still doesnâ€™t believe me. Itâ€™s been hard for me to work because of my treatments, Iâ€™ve been so sick lately. I just feel like a burden to everyone. I felt like a burden ever since I was 10, attempted my first at 12. I have done a lot of micro overdoses in my life to, I guess, get a taste for death and Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m ready, and know exactly how much to take for a successful attempt. 
Iâ€™m not just a burden because Iâ€™m sick, but Iâ€™m too much to deal with. So much so, Iâ€™ve nearly isolated myself and usually push people away because of past experiences where Iâ€™ve let others down. Iâ€™ve sought out help and treatment for years, nothing really has helped. The only reason I probably havenâ€™t fully went through with it is because of my twin, but sheâ€™s been getting distant and I hope it means she doesnâ€™t need me anymore because i am so close to going through with it.
