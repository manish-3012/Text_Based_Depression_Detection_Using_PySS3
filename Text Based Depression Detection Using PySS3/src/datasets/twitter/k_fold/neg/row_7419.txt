I don't want to live any moreStress and anxiety is just becoming too much for me. My entire life I have been bottling up my feelings and problems. I have never expressed feeling with anyone and I have never talked to any one about my problems. And now I have even more problems. I just can't take it any more sometimes I wish I could disappear or that I have never existed at all. I have tried running away a couple of times but that has never worked out.
