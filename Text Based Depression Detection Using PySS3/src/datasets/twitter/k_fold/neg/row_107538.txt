i feel lost and tireddont have a lot to say. thought my life was going to change for the better at the start of this year when i got the chance to pursue my desired field (env-biotech) in one of the most prestigious institutions. but prejudices and discrimination seem to follow me everywhere. i cant keep on ignoring it forever. nobody wants me here and nobody me back home either. i wanted to do something worthwhile, prove to others my worth, prove that i too could dream and achieve big. what a foolish person i was. people everywhere are the same. you're not deemed worthy of anything if you belong to a certain community or look a certain way. ive lost all interest in studies. ill fail this semester, which will only go to prove to some that i never was intended to do big things. i feel like everybody wants me to commit suicide, almost like they're encouraging me to do it.

i dont know what else to say. just wanted someone to know how i feel. just wanted to let this out. i did everything i could. i tried. now, i dont know what else to do but kill myself.
