Life just feels flatI am a 32 year old father of a 9 month old and my wife has just threatened divorce again. We were supposed to go out to a wine tasting and they aren't doing tastings anymore cause of the covid and somehow the whole day is ruined and it is my fault. I feel like no matter what I do o cant feel anything for anyone. I feel so alone and just cold. I would kill for a friend but I feel like I dont deserve it anymore. Even my daughter doesnt make me feel how she shouldi just feel so dead inside
