Endless CycleItâ€™s like when Iâ€™m on the brink of attempting to do it, something good happens to bring back hope that Iâ€™m going to be okay, and then I feel alright for a while, until suddenly that horrible sinking feeling hits again and I just want to end things once more. And then something good happens, and it just repeats. Itâ€™s so exhausting.
