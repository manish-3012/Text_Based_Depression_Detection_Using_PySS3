roommates are out of town tonight, counting down minutes until i'm off worki could list the reasons i feel like i can't cope today, but who cares.  people have easier lives, people have worse lives.  i just have shitty coping mechanisms and the grey cloud is too thick now and i feel like i can't breathe.  feel like i've been having a heart attack for the past hour.  i leave work at 5 and feel like i'll make "bad" decisions once i get home.  no one is there to talk "sense" into me.  i guess i need help
