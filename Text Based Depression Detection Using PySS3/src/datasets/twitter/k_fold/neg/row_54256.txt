Need someone to talk toIs anyone willing to chat me? I feel fucking tired of everything and I donâ€™t want to risk calling a hotline because they donâ€™t help, they literally donâ€™t think about how much worse your life could be because of the actions they do.

I have a bar in my closet that is strong and stable and I have a dog leash that Iâ€™ve been fantasizing about tying around my neck and hanging myself with all day. Iâ€™m alone in my house, my housemate wonâ€™t be back until morning and even then we donâ€™t really speak or see each other. Itâ€™s cold, rainy and I have nothing to do but harm myself. Try to at least...

Fucking hate this life and more than that, I hate myself for not attempting the way I always tell myself I want to. Why canâ€™t I be successful in this? Why canâ€™t I do it?
