Why.My husband is a polite, kind person toward everyone. He has a child with someone else. He literally told me that he wanted nothing to do with her. He messaged her for 3 hours yesterday. THREE. And at the very end: "goodnight and sweet dreams". I don't remember the last time he told me that. :'( I am so broken.

Maybe I am making this more than it is. But it hurts so much. It just hurts.

I have been wanting to hurt myself all day. I have been hysteric.
