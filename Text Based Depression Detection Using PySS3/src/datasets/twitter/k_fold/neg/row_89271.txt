School causing me depression and suicidal thoughtsTo start this I want to inform you that I am 14 male in 8th grade. I started feeling depressed 2 years ago and it has never gone away but it wasnâ€™t that bad. Half way through 8th grade it started to get very bad, I got to the point where I started cutting. I then had a week of brutal arguments with  parents about trying to homeschool for the rest of the year. (Which I won) So I am a 14 year old home schooled child. I never had many friends and my mother is an alcoholic. I want to kill myself because I feel like it is the only way out. I have thigh about trying to drop out so the burden of constant homework and grade would stop and I could enjoy my life before Iâ€™m an adult. My parents donâ€™t seem to care but I am scared of failing and causing permanent damage to myself. I have tried telling my parents but they brush it off every time. What can I do? Iâ€™m getting closer and closer to the edge at this point.
