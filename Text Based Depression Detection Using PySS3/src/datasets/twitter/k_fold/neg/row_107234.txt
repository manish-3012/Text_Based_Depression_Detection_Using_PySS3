Reading Tara Condells note and i feel so fucking similarI don't know how to, nor am i interested in articulating what exactly is going through my head right now but as far as i can tell, I've been handed this life. Like, i think i have below average intelligence and I've been treated like shit all of my life. Im also extremely isolated and a lonely person. I was raised by parents who always told me to work hard but i honestly think they were just burnouts when they had me. Whatever, no issue in blaming them. The thing is now im a burnout. I just really feel a connection to her because it sounds like she was going thru similar shit. Like I've earned none of this shit, im just fucking white. I literally think I'm lazy and stupid because I've never really accomplished anything. I just pick it up, get overwhelmed, drown in it, obsess, then it's like 10 years later and I'm still talking shit. Just ... Decapitate me or something lol like I'm just a fucking snowflake. Except I'm really short and look fit so whatever.. damn, fucking sucks being stupid and addicted to my phone. I'm broken.
