I just want helpI wanna cry while writing this. There is nothing that actually makes me happy for more than 5 minutes and every time i think something will make me happy, it gets taken away. My family laughs or ignores me when i cry and when i told them i want to see a therapist, they told me i was fine. Im only 13 so i don't know if im being spoiled or acting like this for attention. My life goal is to make it to 15 and every time i try to get my friends to understand, they always think im joking. I cant even talk to anyone.
