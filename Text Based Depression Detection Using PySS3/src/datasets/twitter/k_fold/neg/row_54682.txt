venting, also my story.Been feeling like this since I was about 9. Felt useless, bullied people to take out my anger, as it was 'funny'. god i'm a fuckup. the worst decision of my life was to ever bully someone.  it's come back to bite me. Turned on by my friends, lost everyone. found out I was trans, can't live as who I want to be. 13 and I want to down alcohol so my organs fail and I die. I don't know why we're on fucking earth.

I'll probably fail in life, as I'm about to go into a school where I know I'll be bullied.
