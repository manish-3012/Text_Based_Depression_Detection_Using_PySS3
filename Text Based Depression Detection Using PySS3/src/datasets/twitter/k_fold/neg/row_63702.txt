Every day I regret not killing myself when I was youngerI'm mildly intoxicated so this will probably be pretty long winded because I'm just drunk enough to not care that nobody wants to read this garbage but idk anyway I've been pretty much suicidal since I was about 12 years old but never really *seriously* you know, like I'd never really do it, I just don't want to live anymore. I'm 21 now and all I do every fucking day is going to my shitty job which isn't even a real job my dad just sort of created a position at his office because I literally could not get hired fucking anywhere around me and I go in and work for about 4 hours or less for minimum fucking wage it's basically not even worth the fucking gas to drive there and back but I can't fucking quit because I'm already completely financially dependant on my parents and I'll be fucked if I just don't show up I have to be doing something productive other than sitting around watching Netflix all goddamn day but in all honesty I can't take this fucking job anymore I just hate it so fucking much I don't want to go in every fucking day I just dread it and my only real option is to get my pathetic ass back to school because I quit after 1 semester because I was too depressed and my grades were real bad and I can't even fill out this form in application I don't know what im supposed to fucking do with my life what the fuck do I do? I'm just supposed to work till I die but I'm just a pathetic miserable piece of shit that can't even handle a fucking 20 hour work week how the fuck am I supposed to get a real job and fucking be on my own I'm just not cut out for this whole living thing I just don't think I can do it all I want is out all I want is to just stop and lay down and just die but I can't and I'm too much of a fucking pussy to kill myself but it's just the only fucking thing I can do besides going to this shitty "job" that I have every day until I fucking die anyway it's all so god damn pointless and I just don't want to keep doing this and I feel like I'm just fucking drowning and I'd so much rather be dead than to keep doing this day in and day out even if I do anything productive I've wasted so much time already everyone else my age is getting actual jobs or having kids and getting married or whatever but I'm just here living with my mom just trying to figure out how I can fucking die and make it look like an accident I'm just not cut out for this whole living thing I just want someone to put me out of my fucking misery why couldn't I have just killed myself back when things were just starting to go downhill god I fucking hate myself so fucking much
