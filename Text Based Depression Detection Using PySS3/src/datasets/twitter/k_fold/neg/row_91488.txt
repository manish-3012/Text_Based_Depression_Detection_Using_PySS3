it's 6am and I need to get this off my chestIt's currently 6 am and I haven't slept yet. I have to get up in half an hour for school again. I have an almost four hour long exam in the morning and I've had. No. Fucking. Sleep.

I just had all these thoughts racing through my head again. I have to go up to school now I have no choice. I've had about three panic attacks tonight, the last one lasting about 10 minutes. I haven't felt this shit in so long I swear and it's only gonna get shitter. 

My mum's gonna fucking kill me. I'm gonna fail all these exams because I couldn't even fall asleep. Why won't my brain just shut the fuck up for once. FUCK.
