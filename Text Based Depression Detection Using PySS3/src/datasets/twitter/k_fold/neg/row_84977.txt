Have you ever thought that you found the right group of people, friend you thought you could trust and like only to find out that they been lying to you and talking behind your back.Hello I live in North Dakota. I was always consider the weird and strange kid/person,but I am very cynical. and pessimistic of people.When I was in my early teen years, I had a lot of family problem and abuse which led me falling into a deep depression that lasted around 10 years( which I tried to kill myself 5 times with authorities stoping me every time) . I kinda wasted those 10 years crying and trying to find meaning in my life. While in this phase of my life, I found what I thought were true friends.These guys/gals gave my life something to look forward to during these dark times and I will always be thankful for that. I been friend with them for over 7 years and ever  since my depression was declare dead or at least over. But recently, my friend accidentally showed me his texts of a group chat I wasnâ€™t a part of. A group chat all about talking shit about me. This chat was made in 2012, when we all first met. I learn that my relationship with them was fake. They just either wanted to talk to me because I was so weird that it entertained them or they wanted something from me like 10 dollars or answer for some test. I got mad and cut all connections with them.But I feel so alone now. If feels like I have a giant void in my life after removing the guys, but everything I look at them from an old photo or see them in a donut shop I feel betrayed and broken. I lost myself and I lost to what little I held on with life. I beginning to get suicidal thoughts again. Is there any tips in getting rid of this feeling of loneliness,broken,and betrayed.
