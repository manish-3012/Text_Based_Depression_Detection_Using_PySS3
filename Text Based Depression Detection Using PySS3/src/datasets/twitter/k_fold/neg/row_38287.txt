Will moving away help?Hi, I've been diagnosed with MDD a year ago, but it was developing over the years and now I'm just feeling the crushing effects despite one dumb year of my parents pretending that they care about the disease itself. Right now the situation is that I'm skipping uni (like I did a year ago as well), but I can't let myself tell the truth again, so I'm thinking either suicide or simply running away from these places where I feel miserable. I was wondering, will the change of places make me feel at least free from the institute of family? I'm just not sure that once I'm on my own, this anguish will disappear. I don't care about the difficulties that come with leaving home, I'm willing to die if it goes all wrong after.
