It feels like there's no point anymore.Every little thing sets me off. Every little mistake I make. Everything. I do something not good enough, no, not exactly perfect, it's all a failure, I'm a failure... I shouldn't have to put up with this mental anguish every day, every time I try to do everything. My brain is just telling me I'm worthless and nothing I do matters, I really don't believe it, but after so long I do. I really do. I hate myself for how much of a wasted potential I am.
