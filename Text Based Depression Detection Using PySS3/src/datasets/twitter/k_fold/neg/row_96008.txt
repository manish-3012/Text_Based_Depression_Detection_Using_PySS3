My diagnosis makes me evil and undeserving of lifeNot only do I believe it myself, but I am reminded of it when I go online. Or when i am refused help by doctors or psychiatrists.

I have no hope anymore that things can improve. I feel like I can't breathe anymore, like my lungs are filled with cement and my skin is covered in burns. Every second feels painful and right now I would do anything for it to just stop. Please just stop.
