Wanna DIE?Hey,

Guys 

I see many people suffering out there, do you even know the value of life? You people only get once chance to prove yourself that when God created you, 
he believed in YOU,

There is a purpose for your existence, there is mission, I don't care if somebody loves you or not, if you're homeless or whatever. I just want to tell you,

You can do ANYTHING in the world if you just BELIEVE. Be a LONE WOLF and Survive and WIN THIS.

You deserve the mountain, Don't kill yourself, Kill your Inner Demons, Who is letting you think this way and laughing, Seeing you how weak your mind is,
