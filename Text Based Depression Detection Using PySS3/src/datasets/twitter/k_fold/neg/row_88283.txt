Self harming?I am posting into this subreddit to try and avoid stupid comments. I have self harmed by cutting myself admittedly not that bad, but I have on my arms and legs and the most recent time I even went to on my neck, my issue is my boyfriend thinks it's stupid and 'learnt behaviour' I've explained to him that it's a way of having control of the pain I feel, but any time I do it he just gets annoyed with me, what do you guys think about his opinion?
