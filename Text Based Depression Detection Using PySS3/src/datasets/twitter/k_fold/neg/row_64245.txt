Why should I keep to it if it never makes me feel anything.I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ve ever felt anything. Iâ€™m in large amounts of medication for many of my mental illnesses, I have gone to therapy for about 8 years now, and I still feel as suicidal as I ever have. Nothing ever really gets better even if I try to make it better, and even if it did get better it would never be enough to make me actually feel anything. Why should I live if nothing means anything, Iâ€™ve never felt any concern for anyoneâ€™s life or materials and i just want to know what should I live for? Why should I stay here. Everyone always seems to say â€œbecause youâ€™re a human lifeâ€ or â€œbecause it DOES get betterâ€ when all of these things are lies or things that just apply to them. Iâ€™m just curious of why I should live.
