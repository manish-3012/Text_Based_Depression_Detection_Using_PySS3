Nothing makes me happy anymoreI have to much ptsd from countless bully/abuse situations in my city. I cant leave my city cause i have family that need support. I dont have emotions anymore. Have to physically PHYSICALLY  force smiles.  I want to die. Dieing doesnt seem sad to me. Seems like a fresh start or peace no matter what yoh believe in. I have no reason to be here anymore. I hate the world we live in now, seems like everyones just digging their own grave. I just dont care anymore. I wish i could end it right now and have my family know its a good thing for me. Its what i want for peace. I have so many mental problems i dont even know where to start. I dont know how to talk to people anymore. What do i do now?! I just want it to end. I dont wanna go to some facility that doesnt even help. Nothing will help me. My whole life has been constant mental pain. My whole life i feel like ive had a curse following me that just makes me the target of every type of abuse possible. I truly am a good person. I never hurt people. I go out of my way to help everyone and make their day a bit better. Man. I just dont see the point of continuing life if all it is is torchure.
