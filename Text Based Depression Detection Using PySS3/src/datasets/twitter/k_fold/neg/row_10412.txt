Donâ€™t gambleLost all my money on horses. All I needed was one horse to place 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th to win Â£1,300 but he finished 6th. Now Iâ€™m completely broke.

Thereâ€™s nothing for me to live for anymore, the only joy I ever get out of life comes from drugs or winning bets. Iâ€™m 21 soon and have fuck all to show for it. Let this be the dent I leave on reddit before killing myself. Gambling and drugs get you nowhere, learn from my mistakes and donâ€™t gamble.
