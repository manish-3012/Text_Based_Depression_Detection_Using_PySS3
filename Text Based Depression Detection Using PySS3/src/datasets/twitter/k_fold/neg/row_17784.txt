The girl i loved left me and i cant do it anymore.So i dont know where to start, i never thought i would wright something like this.. Im new to reddit. So im 18 i have alot of problems. All my friends have back stabbed me, all the girls i loved broke my heart, i have a heart condition/lung condition that gives me extreme pain, i cant get a job or go to school because people want to jump me (for literally no reason) i feel like i have the worst life ever and on top of that the one girl i love to death that keeps me alive left me, she was my everything, she had my back through everything. We spent every second together. All i want to do is take my life but every time i try i coward out. I have no one and dont know what to do. Im mostly looking for the courage to just end it. What should i do?... (I already posted this but didint really get a answer) i hope someone can give me courage to end it, i wish i had friends so they could tell her how hurt i am... I just cant stop crying or thinking about her..
