I want to dieNo one cares about me, no one invete me to go somewhere, I've always been fooled for my appearance and mostly because I basically can see only with one eye, I'm always a second / last choice in everything and whatever I want to succeed in something I just fail, I just cant live anymore like this I always cry in my bed and the onoy little soul thats been helping my this whole time, my cat, has cancer now and Ill be left alone forever after he is gone...
