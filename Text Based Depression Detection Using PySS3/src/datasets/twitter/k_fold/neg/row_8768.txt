It's getting harder and harder to hold onIn the past, I've dealt with depression that felt like something was just weighing me down ... it was like it was just difficult to be motivated to do things or hard to enjoy and experience certain moments. Suicide used to be out of the question either because of religion or because I knew how much it'd hurt people I know. Recently, though, I just feel genuinely sad for no reason. Every day feels like it's getting worse. My whole body aches, my parents are getting frustrated because I'm not handling things well, and anyone I know from school doesn't care enough to help. I feel like I've given up on finding love or anything and have submitted to being alone for most of my life. I used to worry about how all my friends or peers would cope with my death, and now that doesn't even feel like a concern to me. I would feel bad for hurting my parents but realistically anyone else who would notice I'm gone would forget about it in a month or two. I've tried reaching out to friends, I don't feel comfortable reaching out to family, and I don't know where else to go.
