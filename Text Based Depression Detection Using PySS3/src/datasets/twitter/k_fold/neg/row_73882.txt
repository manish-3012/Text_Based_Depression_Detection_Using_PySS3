How Do I Kill Myself?I don't remember the time I last felt anything resembling joy, my agonizing gender dysphoria makes even looking myself in the mirror feel like being kicked in the stomach. I feel empty all the time. I need a way out.

I've applied to a gender dysphoria clinic in my province, but they've said I will not get HRT before I feel better. Literally nothing but changing my gender would make me feel better. 

How do I make the pain stop? I feel like death is the only option to this pain, as the therapists don't want even want to help me with my depression.
