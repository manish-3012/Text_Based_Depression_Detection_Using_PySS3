My friend seems suicidal and he's scaring me help!So, im just going to put this out here becuase i need help, im 15 and my friend is really scaring me right now. im a sociopath so im not very social, this doesn't mean that i dont care when people close to me die. its just that i dont have empathy. when i hear about a mass shooting i dont feel sad unless someone i know happened to die in it, theirs nothing i can do about this but my friend is acting suicidal. i need advice. i haven't been talking to him directly because im just emotionally stressed right now but my twin sister got a text from him saying, "I bet anon wouldn't even care if i died, he'd probably just say, "yeah cause hes stupid!"" hes been really worrying me. my sister sent him a suicide hotline number and told him to call it im really scared. Please help!
