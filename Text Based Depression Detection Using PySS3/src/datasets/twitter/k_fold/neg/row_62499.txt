Don't know how I'll live if girlfriend commits suicideI don't really know how we are going to get through this. My girlfriend has given up on life, she is very depressed and is giving up on all her dreams. She is a uni student who might have to retake final year for a course she hates and with pressure to do well from her parents (more herself pressuring herself). She's doing this course to be able to get a job and stay in the country as she is an international student. But she hates having to do things she hates to do the thing she actually wants to do, and sees no future without pain. She has OCD depression and anxiety so is rarely in completely good mood.

She says she has set a date for killing herself and will finish off things in her life before she dies. I'm trying to help her but I feel like I can't do that right.

I'm terrified. I (20M) also have bad mental health, and I self harmed through teen years with multiple suicide attempts. I have no dreams, no skills, no enjoyment in life. We've been dating for a year and a half, and I feel we are perfect for each other. I dream of growing old with her. For once I have a reason I want to live rather than just a reason I need to live (don't want mum to be alone in life). 

I don't know how I'll live without her, or live with guilt of failing to save her. She's the only thing in life I enjoy. I'm so scared of losing her. I'm already a mess and she hasn't even left yet. I want to just end if before she does so I don't have to have more pain. It's my fault if she dies, I'm clearly a worthless boyfriend if I can't help her enjoy life.

I don't know what to do, I'm tired of this life of all happiness getting taken away. I don't know what to do anymore, what's the point in trying for anything all it leads to is more pain. Everything hurts. I don't even know why I bothered posting this, we are probably just both doomed.
