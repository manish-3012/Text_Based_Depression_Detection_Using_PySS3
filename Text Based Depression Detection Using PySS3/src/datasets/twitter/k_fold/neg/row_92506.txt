Alternating between wanting to kill myself and dreaming of a life where Iâ€™m better/happyIâ€™ve been I guess acutely suicidal for a few weeks now. I think about it all the time and know what steps I would take to do it. But every time I try, Iâ€™m held back by the idea that maybe things arenâ€™t as bad as I feel they are and that if I put in the work, I could really change my life for the better. 

But then I remember how depressed I am and how i havenâ€™t been able to put in the work for a better life and doubt Iâ€™ll ever be able to, so it eventually cycles right back to suicide. 

I donâ€™t know how to get out of this back and forth and just take action in one direction.
