I don't knowI'm scared. I don't know know what to do and I'm scared and alone.
U just want to die but im scare of what's next.
All I ever wanted was to be loved and to be happy. I don't deserve that, it's the only explanation I have for feeling after trying so hard for so long. 
I'm just scared now... but I can't do this anymore.
