I want to end it... I am 16 years old and a sophmore in highschool. I have never had a real girlfriend or have had a girl interested in me. I'm treated like shit by most people even though most claim to be my friend. I have one really close friend who listens, but I ruined that to. I thought I loved her I told her that. She said we should remain friends. I know she's right, but I feel unwanted now. I am shy and can't talk one on one unless I know the person. I can talk in groups, and can be fun. Whenever I hang with either group of friends, there are two, I am treated shitty by both. They make me feel alone with them. She was the only one that got me. I am not attractive and am now atheist. I see no reason to continue my existence except to not bring sorrow upon my parents. I feel lonely, ugly, and unwanted. I feel like next week I will grab a gun and end it. I'
