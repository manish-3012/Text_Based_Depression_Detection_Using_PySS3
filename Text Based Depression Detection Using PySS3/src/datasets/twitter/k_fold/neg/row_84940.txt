suicidal urgesI just finished 2 weeks of taking an anti depressants (Prozac) and the psychiatrist said usually it takes 4 weeks for it to kick in. 
I have crazy suicidal urges and fantasies daily.. has anyone noticed this as well while being on anti depressants? 
Also, I find it extremely difficult to leave bed.
