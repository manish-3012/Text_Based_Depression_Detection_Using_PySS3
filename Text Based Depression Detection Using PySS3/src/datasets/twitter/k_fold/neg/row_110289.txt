Struggling to find a reason to wake up in the morningI feel like my days are numbered. Iâ€™m not doing anything, not completing any tasks, not engaging in any hobbies because Iâ€™m reaching the end. 
I lost my girlfriend at the worst possible moment, and I was at fault for the argument that led to her breaking up with me. I feel intense shame and guilt and self disgust. 
I have been depressed and anxious all my life, and because itâ€™s easier to just put your problems off, I havenâ€™t done anything about it. Iâ€™m on meds, and I have a therapist. But I just donâ€™t like who I am, and Iâ€™m really fucking lonely because I canâ€™t make friends. My girlfriend was my best friend, and helped me to get out and see the world/people more. She really gave me some kind of hope for the future.
Weâ€™ve been spending the nights in her bed again. Having sex. And she tells me she wants to get back together â€œin timeâ€ but I also found out just fucked some other guy and talks about how much she misses him and shit. I donâ€™t know when â€œin timeâ€ is, but I hope itâ€™s soon. I canâ€™t keep drinking myself into numbness, I canâ€™t keep feeding myself xanax every time I think about the horrible shit Iâ€™ve done and the person I hurt.
I just want to hold my dog and fall asleep forever. I hate being me, I hate seeing myself, and I hate the hand I was dealt. I know there are tens of millions of people who have it worse off than me, but I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy, and I know itâ€™s just from bad brain chemistry. I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t have the cops come put me in the hospital for a day every week. 
I want things to go back the way they were, or I want to blow my brains out.
