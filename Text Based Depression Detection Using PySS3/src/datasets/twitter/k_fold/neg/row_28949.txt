Actually worthlessI have been more and more coming to the conclusion that I am useless.  I'm a young adult; around my 20s. I haven't accomplished anything but a basic education. I've worked before in fast food restaurants, but I had to stop due to a health problem. I now can't really work because of this health problem. However, I am doing uni. 

The uni is the only thing going for me. I can't work and I have to see my father and mother, who are both very tired and have physical pains from repetitive work, go out and cover my ass. Me and my fiancee also broke up, because of various problems. I thought that after I went back and focused on what I was doing it would get better. But no. I have noticed my lack of ability in all forms, such as in English, maths, basic knowledge, skills in videogames, music (I play guitar), editing, basically everything.... All the things I like doing don't bring me joy and I suck. I sleep about 14 hours a day and whenever I wake up I just want to die. I just don't feel like life is worth it and I'm definitely not anything that needs to be alive. I can't be bothered to go anywhere anymore and life is on autopilot. Even my friends are calling me out on my lack of abilities on games. I feel tired of being alive. I think that I should put the effort and get better at things and try to continue, but I feel like I can't be bothered. I just don't get joy from it anymore or maybe I'm so sad that it doesn't matter.

When I was a kid I believed that I was going to be good at something. However, that could not be further from the truth. I am so mediocre it's insane. I am a terrible human being also, coward and afraid of everything regarding my future. I just want this all to be over. I don't feel like it will ever get better. 

Does anyone feel like this too?

I thank anyone who took actual precious time from their life to read this. I don't even know if this is the correct subreddit to be posting this, but whatever.
