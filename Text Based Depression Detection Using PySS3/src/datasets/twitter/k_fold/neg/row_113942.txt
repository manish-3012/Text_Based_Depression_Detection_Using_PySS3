Im getting medication on the 27th but have been on nothing since june. What are good ways to copeI can function more or less normally but i sleep a lot. Like 9-10 hour nights + naps. I fucking hate how long it takes to get medication here. I am working out regularly and getting my heart rate up. I have roommates i can socialize with. But im worried. If i had a gun next to me for example (which i dont) i could pull the trigger.
