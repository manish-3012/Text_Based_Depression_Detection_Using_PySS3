Just a rantI donÂ´t know what to do anymore. I used to be one of the best students from my class. But now IÂ´m barely getting through the first year of high school. My grades used to be the one thing I was proud of but now I feel stupid and worthless. IÂ´m not good at music or art or writing and even worse at sport. The only thing keeping me alive right now is the anxiety of failing the suicide attempt and hurting my friends. I have tried to get help but the most I got was 6 months of medication. IÂ´m just so lost in this world.
