I lost the only motivation and the meaning of life.It has been 20 years since the first time I wanted kill myself, what's worse, I lost my only motivation and started to question if I deserve to live anymore. 
I had hope, but now I don't have it anymore. I feel intimate emptiness and meaningless. I feel sorry for my family and people who care about me, if there's any. 
I haven't eaten for long time, I barely feel hungry, I feel sick to drink water. I feel sick when smelling any food. I feel sick to be happy again.
