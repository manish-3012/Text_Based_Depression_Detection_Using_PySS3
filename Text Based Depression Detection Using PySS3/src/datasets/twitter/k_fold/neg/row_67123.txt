I think I'm going to do somethingI just don't care anymore. Like, there is absolutely no point in struggling through every day if it's just going to end up like this again. I've got a stockpile of medication that I can take and I want to take it. The only thing stopping me is that my flatmates would have to find me and that's just not fair. Or even if I go and find a bench or something somewhere, it would be a stranger. And then that makes everything worse because I realize I don't even have anyone to turn to or anywhere to go at a time like this. I don't know what to do
