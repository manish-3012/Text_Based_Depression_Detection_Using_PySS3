I know I need help I just don't know what to do, where to start, if it's even worth itI don't know where to begin, I've been having major issues for about 3 years now with depression, I dropped out of school, haven't told my parents, haven't told my siblings. Recently I've begun to have other medical issues that have made me physically ill and have been talking with doctors about that but I don't like my doctors at all and nothing has come of it. I have not told them about my depression. I am feeling hopeless, I feel sick, I feel tired all the time, my hands hurt all the time. I can't focus on anything, I feel like my eyes are sunk in the back of my head sort of if that makes sense. I've known I need help I just don't know what to do. The end will be near if I don't do something soon. I just don't care really, I care enough at this instance to write this, but 90% of the time I couldn't care. The only reason I'm on here instead of out buying supplies to off myself is because I missed the bus. I just want help now. I feel like I want somebody to "tattle" on me like a 3rd grader or something, or would just put me somewhere where I could get full help and feel comfortable or would just confess everything to everybody so I wouldn't have to own up to it myself, I don't think I can at this moment.
