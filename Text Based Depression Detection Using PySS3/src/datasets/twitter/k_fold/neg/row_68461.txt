15, failed suicide attempt, looking for any distractionMy story isn't as sad or meaningful as the ones on here. I'm a spoilt 15 year old boy with no friends, an ugly face, bad personality and far less than average intelligence. I'm always lonely and things have slowly been falling apart in my life. I drank bleach today but spat it out before it got to my throat. I still swallowed some. It doesn't look like I'm going to be killing myself anytime soon, seeing as I couldn't even bring myself to drink chlorine bleach, so I just want to know what I should do to distract myself for the next few years. Be it drugs, meditation, books ect.
