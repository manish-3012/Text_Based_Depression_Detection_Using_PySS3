Goodbye i guessI don't even know what the fuck i should do anymore. I feel like i have cornered myself with my bad choices i have nowhere to go. At this point the handful of nice people on the internet i have met are the closest thing to friends i have. Making a post on Reddit about this is a fucking stupid choice but i didn't really know what else to do now.  I'm going to end this fucking mess i call life.

At 3 am UTC+3 tonight i will close my eyes for the last time. Goodbye.
