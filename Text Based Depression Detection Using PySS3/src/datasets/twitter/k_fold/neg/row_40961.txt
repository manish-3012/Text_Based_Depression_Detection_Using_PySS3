I can feel my mind losing itselfI keep having flashes of me saying something cruel and humiliating and I don't know why or how to stop it. I have no idea what I'm doing with my life, my mind feels like it's constantly on fire i can't have a cleared mind at all I tried meditation for about  a week and I couldn't do it it's just not happening, I don't feel at all connected to the present, I have no interest to do anything, I'm losing my ability to form sentences and I can't look in the mirror without getting upset
