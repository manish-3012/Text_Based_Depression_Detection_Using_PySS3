My only friend died todayYeah it was a house spider and yes itâ€™s pathetic but heâ€™s always on my salt lamp just crawling there. Doing nothing. Making shadows on the walls. I caught him flies and nats. I talked to him. Heâ€™s a spider and isnâ€™t complex enough to understand but he was all I had. I loved to have him tickle my hand and he spun his prey in my hand. It was so weird but he made me get over my fear. 

My cat swatted at him and it was too late to make her stop because he was already dead by the time I came into my room. Iâ€™m so fucking destroyed and lonely. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m so pathetic and so fucking stupid but I loved him and even called him Lupin III because thatâ€™s my favorite character and the third spider that I became friends with. The rest I let outside or in my garage to live away from the hell but I couldnâ€™t leave Lupin. Iâ€™m so lonely. Iâ€™m so lost. 

I have no reason to even exist anymore. I miss him so damn much. Heâ€™s a fucjing spider but he made me feel safe. I woke up to him eating a fly that was probably buzzing around and I felt so thankful. Iâ€™m so lost.
