I daydream about suicide.Daydreaming about suicide calms me down but makes me sink so much faster. I wish I'd just get into a car accident had kill me so my family wouldn't have to deal with my suicide. 

I also daydream about my spouse physically abusing me or raping me. I feel like I deserve it and the thought of pain makes everything else feel less. 

Can someone just kill me please? I want out.
