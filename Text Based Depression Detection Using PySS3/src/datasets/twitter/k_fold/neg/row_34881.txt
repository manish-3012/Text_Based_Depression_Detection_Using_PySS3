can't think of a titlemale. 18. no job. don't go to school. no social life. making it by one day at a time. know that i should see a therapist, but don't. i know i need to do something to change, but can't. i also want to know the easiest way out, but know you won't tell me. i know i probably won't do it, but how long can i keep going? posting this isn't going to change anything, but i still will anyway. you will tell me you care about me, but you don't. you care about the idea of you stopping someone. that's why you're here. again i don't know why i think this will help but it's out there...
