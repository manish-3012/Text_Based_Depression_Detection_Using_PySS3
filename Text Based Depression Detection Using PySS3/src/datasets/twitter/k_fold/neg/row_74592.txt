Not sure what to doWell... everyone was right after all. I am autistic. Iâ€™ve been ostracized all my life, never knew what was wrong. I always said that it was just being raised by a borderline and a narcissist. Or I just needed to put myself out there more. Or I just needed to find new people that werenâ€™t assholes.

I struggled through college but actually made it out. I got sober. Iâ€™ve tried several jobs in multiple industries. It always worked out the same. Getting fired even through I was making more calls, working harder than my peers, etc.

The pills donâ€™t work. DBT doesnâ€™t really work when your â€œemotionalâ€ mind isnâ€™t actually wrong. Everyone really does hate you.

Iâ€™ve tried to pull myself up by my bootstraps. Actually made decent money this year (gambling/stocks). But I canâ€™t function in society. And this doesnâ€™t really seem like itâ€™s gonna get better.

The only option I have left is to become an official recluse and stop trying. Frankly I would have been better off if I had done that in the first place. And then whatâ€™s the point in life? Live till my parents die?
