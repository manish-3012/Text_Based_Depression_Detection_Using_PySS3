tired of tryingiâ€™ve tried to deal with my depression on my own for at least 8 years now because i cannot afford to seek medically attention and i am exhausted. i hate waking up every day and feeling completely alone. i have no one. i am unlovable, uninteresting, unmotivated. i have nothing to live for and really never have. i want to kill myself every day but never seem to have enough courage to just do it. all i want in life is to feel loved and appreciated, but i canâ€™t remember a time when iâ€™ve felt that way at all. it feels like i will be alone forever. i just want to rest and be at peace.
