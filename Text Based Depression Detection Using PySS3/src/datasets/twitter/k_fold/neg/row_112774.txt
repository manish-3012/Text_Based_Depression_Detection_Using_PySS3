when you live everyday knowing itâ€™s only a matter of time until you finally decide itâ€™s going to be your lastevery single day i wake up, look in the mirror, and instantly want to end my life because of my skin conditions. and every single day iâ€™ve also promised myself to wait until tomorrow to see if itâ€™ll be any better; itâ€™s never any better, itâ€™s always worse. my condition has just been going further downhill by the day, and i am a recently 18 year old girl who should be out enjoying my life, but iâ€™m bed bound because i am so suicidal and humiliated by my face and my skin. i just have no hope anymore. i have wrote copious amounts of suicide letters every single week for the past 9 months, and nothing has changed. nobody seems to understand how draining it is to be mentally and physically in pain everyday whenever i see myself in a mirror or even think about how i look. because of my condition, i know i will never live a happy life again, and itâ€™ll just progress as time goes by. i just see no point, i have no aspirations and i canâ€™t even leave my house. i am seriously so close to completely breaking, i havenâ€™t felt like a human for so long now that i canâ€™t even remember something i said an hour ago. i am constantly on edge and unstable because my thoughts are just filled with self loathing and suicidal thoughts. i have to physically hit myself to try to stop myself from ending my life. say, iâ€™ll be in my kitchen and i just canâ€™t shake the though of stabbing myself to have it all over with so i have to physically try to restrain myself and itâ€™s torturous to live like this every single day. iâ€™m so unhappy, and i have nobody, and i mean nobody, to help me. i donâ€™t want anyone to say iâ€™m not a burden, because i know i am, and iâ€™m a burden on my family and myself too. itâ€™s unfair for me to have to live like this everyday, and i canâ€™t keep trying to continue when i have no purpose at all. i even recently lost my job due to my skin condition, and iâ€™m now having to leave my education because i canâ€™t attend due to my mental health. i am past the point of saving, and i wake up every day knowing that one day will be the day i decide to make my last.
