I didn't die today but I want to try once moreFuck. Yes, I didn't die. I had the rope around my neck and a chair, I tried to go slowly and just jump off but I did not. My leg kept on going back on the chair. I was standing like a lunatic with my whole body shaking, the rope is so rough, it squeezed my neck and I still feel it on myself - two hours later. I got terrified that I was going to struggle and or I won't die before my mom comes back from work. Fuckfcukfcukfcufkcfuckfuck, I don't know what do to. I want to try again but for sure I need more sleep and I need to calm down. I don't want to be alive but I'm so scared. What is happening to me? I want to turn off my survival instincts.
