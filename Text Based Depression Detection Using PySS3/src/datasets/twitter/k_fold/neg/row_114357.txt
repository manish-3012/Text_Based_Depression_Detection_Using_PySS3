How to get help? I mean intelligent help.Hi. Iâ€™ve been here sometimes and nowadays my suicidal thoughts are more frequent than ever. I constantly think how life, people who knows me and my cat (Nayru) will be afterwards. I already wrote a note but I plan to write others.

Anyway my question is how do I seek help knowing that Iâ€™m suicidal? I fit the more vulnerable profile (30â€™, LGBTQIA+, Orphan, unemployed, thief record, alone 22 hours a day) but I am optimistically assuming I have a 80% chance of survival. Maybe 70%. But itâ€™s clear I have to do something about it. Iâ€™ve been doing some statistics reading and listening to podcasts of people who knew suicide victims but what is the next step towards getting rid of suicidal ideations? Tks and peace.
