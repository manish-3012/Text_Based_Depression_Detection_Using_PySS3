They always say talk about it. Who am I meant to tell?I feel like killing myself most days. My life feels empty and the pointless. I don't know the point of going on.

I can't tell anyone that wouldn't think I was being dramatic. And they're probably right, because there's nothing that bad happening to me. Definitely can't tell work or they might think I was crazy or fire me, then I'd really be fucked. 

I guess that's why I'm posting here, at least then I'm telling someone.
