I deserve to suffer.I deserve to experience nothing less than utter torture and agony. I deserve no release, no enjoyment, it is horrible for me to ever experience a single shred of happiness. I'm sure everyone would agree if they knew who I really am. Death would be too much of a mercy. I see it as a great tragedy that I will never be able to suffer for all of eternity. That is just proof that this universe is unjust. I'm so so sorry for my existence. I can never apologize enough.
