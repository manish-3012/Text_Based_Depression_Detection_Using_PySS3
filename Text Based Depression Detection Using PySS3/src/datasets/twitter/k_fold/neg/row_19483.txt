What to do when someone is suicidal and refuses all forms of help?Hello, a family member who lives states away is suicidal. He keeps posting really depressing/suicidal things on Facebook, and then deleting them a few hours later. I spoke to the people (and family) around him in his state and they said they have tried to help him but he flat out refuses. They invite him over, tell him to come over or call any time, etc. On holidays they invite him over and he says he will come but does not show up. His friends tried to take him to a hospital but he refused and drove his car away while drunk. He keeps saying there is nothing left to live for and his passions arenâ€™t recognized.

None of us know what to do. Substance abuse runs in the family, and death via substance abuse has occurred in the past. He has had a rough early life but now heâ€™s about 35 and he has had a stable job and place to live. His roommates want him to move out since he refuses to get help and they canâ€™t handle it anymore.

Iâ€™m not sure if there is anything any of us can do to help, so I wanted to ask for advice.

Thank you!
