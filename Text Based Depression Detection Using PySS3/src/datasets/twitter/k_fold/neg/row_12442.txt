Cool life broi feel so useless. i'm 30 and i can't even get a stupid fucking pizza job. i'm a fat fucking idiot with no skills and no fucking clue. i fucking hate my life, i hate the future, i hate the present, i hate the past. i'm sick and fucking tired. i wish i was dead. see you tomorrow for another fucking day of this fucking bullshit
