I canâ€™t keep goingIâ€™m so lonely. When I see people talking to each other, I brake down and cry because 
I will never have someone to talk to. I lost all my friends and I canâ€™t talk to people without shutting down because I donâ€™t want them to talk to me because Iâ€™m a bad person. I plan on killing myself this Thursday. I have no energy to keep going. Iâ€™m sorry everyone.
