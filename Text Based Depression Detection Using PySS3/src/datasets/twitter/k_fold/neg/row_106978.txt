Yeaaa fuck so Iâ€™m here againFfs why canâ€™t I just acquire an ounce of motivation to do anything productive in my life. Itâ€™s so fucking hard to do anything I want or need to do at this point. It takes me days or weeks to even just send a single snap to a friend. Iâ€™ve been distancing myself from almost everyone except one person and Iâ€™m actually kinda happy I did tbh. Iâ€™m so behind in all of my schoolwork. Nobody really knows anything about me at this point. Oh well, we will see what happens ig
