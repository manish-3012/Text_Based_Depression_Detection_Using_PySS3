Can someone help me?My suicidal thoughts have been getting worse and worse. Two nights ago I almost did it... I have never come that close before. I had pills, alcohol and a razor blade. I didnâ€™t do it though. But now I want to take advantage of the fact that I am not actively trying to kill myself, and find some kind of inpatient/ partial hospitalization program to go to. I just get so overwhelmed and have no idea what to look for. I have asked a few people close to me but I donâ€™t think they can help me. So does anyone on here know where to start? What to look for?
