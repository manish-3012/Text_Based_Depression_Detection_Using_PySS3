Iâ€™m going to kill myselfAll I do is disappoint my parents. I canâ€™t do anything right. Iâ€™m a failure.

As Iâ€™m writing this, my mom called me and scolded me for missing a homework assignment. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I canâ€™t imagine the disappointed look sheâ€™ll have when she gets home.

Iâ€™m just a useless piece of shit. I have to kill myself today.

I donâ€™t know how, but I have to.

I canâ€™t take it anymore. I donâ€™t deserve anything.

Goodbye.
