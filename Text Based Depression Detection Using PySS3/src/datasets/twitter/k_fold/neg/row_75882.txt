This is my last post everI have decided to do it. I canâ€™t live with the person I am anymore. I donâ€™t know when yet, but I am going to stay off reddit after this, and live my last few days with family and friends. To the people that I know IRL that read this, you didnâ€™t and wonâ€™t try to stop me. To that random guy or girl reading this, idk why Iâ€™m posting this and you probably donâ€™t wanna read it.

I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to do it yet, I know where my mother keeps a glock, might just use that, but I would prefer to feel the pain, pain that I have caused others in my life by just simply being there

Even now, typing this, watching the blood flow from my wrists and thighs, feel confident in doing this, within the next week. 

And to the person who told me to do it, I hope you got what you wanted, and to the other people who have harassed and bullied me, I hope you have also gotten what you wanted

I will be signing off for the last time in a few hours

(Iâ€™m not looking for people to try to talk me out of it, just saying my goodbyes to the community that kept me alive this long)
