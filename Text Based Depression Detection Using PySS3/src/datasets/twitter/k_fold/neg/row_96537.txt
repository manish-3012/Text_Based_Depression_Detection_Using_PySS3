I'm Sorry.I really think I am going to kill myself tonight. I have some pills and honestly it seems like the only way i'll ever feel okay. I only ever feel anxious and depressed anymore, I can't remember the last time I was actually truly happy. I am trying so hard to get better since being hospitalized in February but it feels like since than everything has just taken a turn for the worse and I can't get out of it. I self harm all the time, I just had to quit my part time job once again because of anxiety, I am going to have no money to go towards University next year, and i'm just done. I only have on friend, and I happen to be in love with but he likes someone else so that' shitty. I am convinced that my life was never suppose to happen. I have absolutely no purpose being here. I can't get over the sexual abuse I experienced from my dad as a child, my mom is so disappointed in me for having to quit my job. I'm just a disappointment now and i'm done. I just cant keep carrying this pain with me any longer. I feel terrible because i know that there are people in my life who genuinely care about me, and I love them all for that, but i'm so far from who I use to be and I can't be saved anymore. I am a burden to everyone I know. I'm sorry.
