Iâ€™m Slowly Killing MyselfI hate posting on here, I often just delete old posts in fear of what the universe will think of me if I left them up. I feel so hopeless and Iâ€™ve had so many intense thoughts of suicide, wanting to do it and when I tried to do it before. I have been in a really bad down slump for ages, much longer than usual and Iâ€™ve been taking handfuls of pills every night for months, it makes me sleep nearly all day and leaves me feeling nothing, my brain is just in a state of blur... Iâ€™m so so sorry, my younger self knew this was coming but he would still be disappointed in me :(
