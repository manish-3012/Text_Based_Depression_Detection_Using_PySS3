I don't know what to do anymore, I'm so completely lostI finished high school on monday, I have nothing planned. No careers I can go into because my depression and anxiety was/is so bad that I dropped two of my four courses and did really, really bad in the two I kept. 

I've been throw into the world with no plan, no where to go. I'm getting worse every day, all I really think about is suicide and how I'm not ready to be an adult. I don't know what to do, I'm too much of a coward to take my own life but I know it will happen some time soon. 

I don't want to work to live, I gain no enjoyment from things, I have two eating disorders on top of everything else. 

I have no one, no one knows how bad I am. I help whoever needs me but I never want help in return.

One day I'll gain the confidence. One day I'll finally have my peace.
