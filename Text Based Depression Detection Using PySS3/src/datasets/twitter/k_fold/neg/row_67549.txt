I outburst to my father and my brother about wanting to die; they basically ignored me and have not done anything about it to help.21 y old college student living with my parents. Did very well in high school, and I wanted to pursue Mathematics since I really liked it, but my dad pressured me into pre-medicine (which I later dropped.) COVID came around and forced me to stay at home. The pandemic, online classes, missing my friends/professors and face to face interaction, and an over reliance on the internet and my computer for education/entertainment has led me to feel somewhat anxious and depressed these past few years; grades began to slip, but I didnâ€™t fail anything thankfully. My family doesnâ€™t care about me that much and still wants perfection even though Iâ€™m not perfect.

I unintentionally got into an argument between my family because my mom (who i love dearly) has often been mistreated and yelled at even because sheâ€™s an unemployed housewife. When I brought it up that we should still try to be nice to her and shouldnâ€™t pressure her to do things she doesnâ€™t want to do, my brother got defensive, and we began arguing. My father eventually hopped in. This led to a heated discussion between me and my brother/my dad, which lead to my dad saying something along the lines of â€œyouâ€™re the reason why things are so messed up here.â€ I immediately screamed, backed away and cried.I yelled and screamed more than once that I wasnâ€™t comfortable with living here, how my mom deserved better than what we were doing, and that I really wanted to die and have thought about it for quite sometime...

... and they basically just brushed all of that off.

I couldnâ€™t believe it. All they said was itâ€™s not religious, I was too sensitive, â€œI should just pray more,â€ and that it would look bad for everyone here. Thatâ€™s how important I was to them; not as a human being or a son or a brother, but just something to make them look and feel better. I could tell from their eyes, tone, and laughing demeanor that thatâ€™s all they cared about. I felt horrible. And although I do consider myself as sensitive, I refuse to accept that as an excuse for such shitty behavior. 

Eventually, they just left me to my room hoping I would calm down. But I swear if I had something to instantly take the pain away after my dad told me that, I wouldâ€™ve done it.

I wish I could do something for my mom and I. Save us from this terrible oppression and house without love. Idk what to do, but thatâ€™s all I have to say about it.
