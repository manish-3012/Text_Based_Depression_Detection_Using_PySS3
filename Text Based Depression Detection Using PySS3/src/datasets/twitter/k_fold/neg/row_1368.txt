I feel lost.I want to tell a friend of mine that I love her, and I'm scared that if she doesn't feel the same way, I'll think about doing something really stupid on impulse. As I am now, I don't want to leave, I have people I care about and I have things I want to do.

I don't want to go the rest of my life without telling her how I feel, but if she doesn't feel the same and it screws up our friendship, I feel like I might end up doing something really stupid. She's one of the only close friends I have.

I was two steps away from getting run over by a car on accident last week, and it really scared me. I didn't know what to do, or how to tell her.
