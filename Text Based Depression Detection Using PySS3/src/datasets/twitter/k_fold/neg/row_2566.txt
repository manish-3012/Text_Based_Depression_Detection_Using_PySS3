Just need a place to get this outI recently turned 26. I feel like these should be the best years of my life. Instead, all I do is work, pay bills, and buy groceries. I never do anything entertaining or make good memories. I have one close friend left that actually cares about my existence, but she has a busy, active life and isn't always available.

After trying college for like the 4th time, my grades were shit and right now, I'm not in a place where I want to go back in the fall.

I'm 6 months out of a harrowing relationship. I got emotionally abused and manipulated in every way possible. I've been trying to date again, but every time I put myself out there, I get passive-aggressively rebuked; made to feel like I'm not good enough for their time.

Really just wish I could work up the courage to drive my car off a bridge. I do not enjoy any aspect of being alive.
