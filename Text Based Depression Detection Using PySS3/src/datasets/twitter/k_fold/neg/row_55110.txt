Iâ€™m starving and dehydrating rnHavenâ€™t had anything other than juice once in the last week and less than a cup of water, surprisingly Iâ€™m still alive. Eating under 800 cals daily too. My weight is dropping quite fast, so I guess itâ€™s working. Iâ€™ve been to the psych ward so often that they wonâ€™t admit me anymore. This is hell. My father and step mother put a lock on the window in my room and are getting an alarm for the door. Iâ€™m leaving once the alarm gets installed. Between the cold, lack of food, dehydration and over exercise, Iâ€™ll be dead soon. Iâ€™m ready for the pain. 

Thank you for reading :) ily all
