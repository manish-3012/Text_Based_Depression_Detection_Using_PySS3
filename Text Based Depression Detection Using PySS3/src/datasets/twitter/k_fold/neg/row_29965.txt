My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me. I'm lonely, suicidal, and depressed.My girlfriend broke up with my yesterday. We were together for 3 years, and spent 6-10 hours EVERY day skyping with each other. I feel so lost without her, she was the closest person I've ever been with and I still love her - but she doesn't love me anymore. 

I miss her every single hour of the day, I haven't eaten in 2 days and I'm in ruins. My life is spiraling down, my school is forcing me to get a GED or else I'll get into trouble because of my attendance and I'm always in pain because of what has happened. 

I have no friends in real life, I've had to go from a normal high school to a 4 day, 4 hour school so I could be with her more often - she was essential to my life. I did everything for her and she left me within 4 days of me finding out that she kissed her male friend.

I'm lost and I need help. I don't know what to do.
