Changing my name and dying in another country?What if I want to go overseas, kill myself and never have my family find out I'm dead? Could I officially change my name in Australia (I'm Australian) and put down no emergency contacts so a morgue would just cremate me once nobody claimed my body? 

My family fully expect me to leave and never come back anyway as I don't get along with them and they always wanted a girl. They'll do anything for my little sister and nothing for me. I tried to kill myself last year and after getting out of the psych ward they refused to pay for a therapist (they're fucking loaded so there's no reason not to) and offered no emotional support so I take that as a sign I'm better off away from them forever. My sister is 9 and has a $250 an hour therapist for "shyness at school" so fuck them.

Edit: sorry about the throwaway but this probably isn't the best thing to put on my normal account.
