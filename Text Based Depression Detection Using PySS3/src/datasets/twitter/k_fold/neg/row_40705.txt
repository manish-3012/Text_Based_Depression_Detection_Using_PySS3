questionso I'm planning on doing it, and i don't really want to talk about it or anything.  But I just want to know whether a suicide note and will written by hand or on a passworded electronic document will hold up in court if I were to leave my assets to people who were not part of my family for example a charity.  And if I were to not leave a note of any sort will my assets go to my siblings or parents?  Should I go get a lawyer to have a will written?

edit* forgot to ask about what happens to my car loans and other debts? will my family have to pay the rest off?
