I'm So Tired, and I Really Shouldn't Be.I'm 22, in college, and have been in therapy off and on for seven years. I've been diagnosed and re-diagnosed I don't know how many goddamned times, but this time, I think they finally got it right. I'm on meds, have a good psychologist (and did last year, too). 

&amp;nbsp;

My psych PA is an idiot, but I'm filing a complaint because she is literally incompetent, and I'm not letting her do anything major with my brain chemistry. She'll bork it even more than it's already borked. 

&amp;nbsp;

So why am I so fucking tired? I'm so young, but I feel like an old woman that just wants to restâ€”close her eyes, go to sleep, and stay asleep forever. I have all of this going, access to all of this (despite being American and it costing an ovary and both arms). I hate taking seven and a half pills a day, stabilizing and de-stabilizing, changing meds, dealing with new side effects and withdrawals, failing myself and my family despite not really having any ties to them emotionally. I hate myself in general. I don't want to do... this anymore. I'm tired of existing.

&amp;nbsp;

The bipolar disorder is killing me, especially with the rapid cycling. Baseline, depressed, baseline, hypomanic/manic, depressed. All within a week, a few days, a day. Borderline Personality Disorder mood changes from happy to empty/lonely/angry/suicidal. The overwhelming, unnecessary, time-consuming worrying over everything that comes with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The obnoxious neurological symptoms that are literally caused by the other psych problems, stress, some med reactions of Conversion Disorder, which is so rare that no one has anything better than "take your meds/go to therapy" for treatment. The stimulants for ADHD that you adjust to so damn quick. And the stupid fucking phobia of vomiting that make meds even harder if that's a potential side effect. 

&amp;nbsp;

I had a shit childhood; it fucked me up. Hard. I can't say it didn't. I've had it better than others, but I've had it worse than others. Probably why I feel so little for most in my family. Probably why I can go so long without seeing my dad and feel so little guilt. I can go weeks with just texting my mom, or seeing her at week for an our or so once a week or every other week and be fine.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a boyfriend, unfortunately long (very long, like seven hours ahead long) distance, that I fell flat-on-my-face in love with despite thinking I couldn't feel anything anymore. He's wonderful, taking me for who I am, crazy, suicidal ideation, fucked psyche and all. He's says I'm not a burden, that he's happy, that seeing me happy makes him happy, butâ€¦ how am I not? As for failing someone, I hate myself most of all for failing him. I'm only delaying seeing him further by not graduating this Spring as I would have had I been on track.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm going to go to grad school there, or somewhere near there, and get the fuck out of here. After that, we're going to get married, and be happy. Plans aren't concrete, sure, but things are going well, and if they continue, this is the way it's going to go. It's something to look forward to at least. A brighter future with someone that can make me smile, that can make these bouts fade for just a while.

&amp;nbsp;

I just have trouble remembering that, keeping that in mind. I have to get through this last year of undergrad. I can hardly function anymore. My thoughts keep going back to, "Fucking hell, just please, stop breathing in your sleep. Please. Just stop waking up." I've been considering actively taking my own live more and more lately. I'm a clinical psychology major; I have several contingencies in place for this because I ***despise*** psych hospitals. One shit experience. Never, NEVER, again. I refuse. â€¦I'm afraid they're failing though, and I just can't take this anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm so tired of waking up. I've had more and more bouts of active suicidal ideation lately. These times where I've seriously considered "having an accident with my meds," or going with another planned method. I've planned several times over the years. I've been at least passively suicidal since I was... eh, 15... maybe earlier. I can't remember how long it's been anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm just so fucking tired, and I can't sleep enough to make it stop. I can't sleep enough to hit that chance event that I stop breathing to have it said that I didn't do it; to say that I didn't kill myself. I'm always hoping some fuckwit driver hits me and kills me. A drive-by shooting and I'm the only one killed. A mugging. That I can save someone and my life is taken in their place.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't want to do that to J. I love him very much, and he's learning to handle suicidal ideation, the mania, the CD episodes, all of it, but I just don't know if I can do this anymore. I'm close, so close, to saying fuck it, finishing my last letters, and saying goodnight for the last time. 

&amp;nbsp;

J, if you see this, I'm sorry. I never intended for you, too, and if you're on /r/SuicideWatch, too, please please come talk to me.
