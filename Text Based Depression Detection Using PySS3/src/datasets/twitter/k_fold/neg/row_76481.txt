People should be educated about how to help suicidal peopleIâ€™m tired of listening to its going to get better and you are looking for a permanent solution for a temporary problem. I know itâ€™s hard but costs nothing to go on internet and educate yourself if you truly care about someone. 
I was sent this link here and it opened mind I posted it in every platform I have:

Unfortunately for me is too late to educate the only friends who could possibly help and support me. This is probably my last hours. I had an awful day and Iâ€™m on the edge but Iâ€™m going and hopefully not in vain to show people that they can support suicidal people itâ€™s much easier and rewarding than walking away or expecting therapy can do all job. THERAPY IS FUNDAMENTAL but is NOTHING without LOVE &amp; SUPPORT.
