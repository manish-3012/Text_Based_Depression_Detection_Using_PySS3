Rant about shit life yeyðŸ™‚So.. I really want to end my life, Everyday I wake up,eat and play videogames. My grades are shit and if my mother find out about them Iâ€™m going to get in serious trouble. I can handle the hitting and her taking away my phone but I canâ€™t stand being screamed at. Iâ€™m so terrified of exams, I literally text other girls in my class to send me the answers to the homework and I barely understand anything. My sister is silently judging me because I keep asking her to give me homework answers. I barely talk to my friends about anything outside of school, most of the days we ignore each other and they have other friends and I always ruin my relationships with other people because of what I define as morals so I know itâ€™s my fault things are like that but I just feel so lonely and each time I try talking to someone online I just sound retarded af. I stopped doing the only hobby that I enjoy because I donâ€™t get noticed by other people and itâ€™s almost like itâ€™s forgotten and I eat so much shit that I look like harry from harry and the fucking Hendersons and Iâ€™m not willing to do anything about it because thereâ€™s no point. If I get I fail or get anything less than 90% then Iâ€™m going to do it. The only actual reason thatâ€™s keeping me from doing it is because I donâ€™t want to end up in hell, but Iâ€™m not a good person and I have the morals of a prostitute so either way Iâ€™m going to spend eternity with satan. This post was useless and apparently I canâ€™t talk about how I feel without sounding like a person with a single digit IQ. I pray to god and sincerely hope that the next time Iâ€™m falling asleep is my last time.
