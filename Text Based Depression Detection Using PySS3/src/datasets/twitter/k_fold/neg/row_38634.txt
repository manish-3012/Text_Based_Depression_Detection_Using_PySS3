I'm doneI'm to fucked up to continue living.
I've tried so many times,I've gave it my best,but I just can't continue anymore,I just want to find peace of mind and it seems that I can't find it in life.
I'm just letting this as my goodbye note here on reddit to thank everyone for everything.

Goodbye and hope you guys have a great day.
