Hair loss - canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™ve been depressed for 10 years now and on anti-depressants. Thereâ€™s many factors to this, but one of the major ones is self loathing to the point where Iâ€™m incredibly socially anxious. 

Over the last year Iâ€™ve started to lose my hair and gone from a full head of thick hair to very thin flat and receding hair. Over time this is has made me very down and upset and Iâ€™m to the point now where I canâ€™t bare it any more

Iâ€™m fed up of people telling me to shave it or â€œlots of men go baldâ€ because while they are only trying to help, itâ€™s different for me. Being so image conscious it upsets me more than it would a lot of men. Further more I donâ€™t have the face shape to look good with a shaved head

With my depression and anxieties, this really feels like the last straw and I just donâ€™t want to be here any more. As dramatic as it sounds and probably sounds pathetic to most, is rather be dead than lose my hair. 

I have no friends to Raleigh round me and support me with this and i want it all to be over

Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m writing this, sorry for the rant
