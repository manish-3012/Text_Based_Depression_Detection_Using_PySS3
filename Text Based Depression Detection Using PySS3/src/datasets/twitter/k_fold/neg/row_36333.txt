I don't want to kill myself. I want to erase myself from existenceIf there was a button that would erase every trace of my existence I would press it in a heartbeat. If I kill myself I will just traumatise the unfortunate souls who have to discover my body. If I live I'll just live like subhuman trash for the rest of my life. 
Nothing would change if I never existed. I'll be gone and that's it. No mourning, no over-priced funeral, just nothing
