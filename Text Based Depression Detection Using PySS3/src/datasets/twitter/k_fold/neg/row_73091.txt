I want to kill myself so badly, I have no futureI have failed at everything in life (including at trying to kill myself) and donâ€™t really have a reason to go on. Iâ€™m dreading my 25th birthday at the end of the month and donâ€™t want to spend another year being a failure. I want to jump off a bridge or a parking garage though the first time I tried two years ago I got caught and hospitalized. I did try to give life a chance and see if I could do an intensive outpatient program recently (the alternative to being hospitalized) though apparently I â€œdonâ€™t meet the criteriaâ€. No way do I want to go back to the hospital, last time my suicidal thoughts and depression were exposed to my family and I was humiliated and degraded. I hope next time I will be successful at my attempt.
