HurtingI wanna scream and let all the anger and hurt out. The bad days are so bad. I wanna punch the wall and let it crush my fists. I wanna take razors and run them over my skin. So much hurt inside. Maybe if I bleed they'll escape through my wounds.

The bad days are so bad. Where are the people that care. Why can't I talk to them. Why am I so scared to talk to them. Why do I scream for help but say I'm okay to people.

I hate my body. I hate myself. I hate everything about me. I hate my existence. I want to claw my skin off. I wanna hurt on the outside I want to feel my skin sting I want to hurt and scratch at myself until I see my flesh. I want to hurt on the outside maybe then I can forget about the hurt inside. 

The bad days are so bad. I want to isolate. Run away. Starve. Rot. People will forget they always do. I'm nobody. Nobody.

It hurts so much why does it hurt so much. Why can't I escape. Why am I so fucking defective. Why am I crazy.

I hate myself. I'm this fucking close to hurting. Let everybody see how hurt I am. Let everybody know that this is how I feel. Maybe they'll care then.
