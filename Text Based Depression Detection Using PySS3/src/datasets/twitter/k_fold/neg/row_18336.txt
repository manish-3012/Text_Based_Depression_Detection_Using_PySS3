I've came to a conclusionI feel so alone right now I cant believe I want to die this early in life I need someone to talk to so bad and the funny thing is that 1 or 2 people might see this and keep scrolling I hate this so much I want to die theres so much going through my head I cant even write it all I'm so tired of saying I want to kill myself I just want to do it but im too young to get anything im getting my friend to give me some of his pills I dont know if im just going to get high and trip or if im going to die I dont know how many im going to get I know I need help i cant find it anywhere im done caring about how my family is going to feel when dead i dont care i cant take this anymore i feel it building in my chest all the time i cant cry anymore i cant feel lost and alone anymore i dont care if i go to hell or heaven or if I vanish I hate everything about everything when I get those pills I'm going to take them all and see what happens I hope I'm dead so I leave this world behind
