Iâ€™m the cause to peopleâ€™s painI lost my best friend to suicide two years ago. I was at the scene, she did it while I was in the kitchen. I was the last person she was with and still I couldnâ€™t see the signs.

Prior to her passing, I had lost four friends in my friend group to suicide. It was one after the other, and I couldnâ€™t cope in until now I still canâ€™t. All of them were of the same group. 

People actively blamed for me for their passing because I was technically their closest friend. 

Whenever I try to talk to my current friends and my family, donâ€™t call me stupid or dumb for having suicidal thoughts. People have called me a burden for having these thoughts. Some people even made me feel like a burden whenever I express them. 

â€œYou have everything you canâ€™t be depressedâ€

â€œYou are worrying us, stop having these thoughtsâ€ 

â€œYouâ€™re depressed cause you want our attention, thatâ€™s what I believe and youâ€™re in denial of that factâ€ 

my own parents and my remaining friends have said that and made me feel that way. I donâ€™t have siblings. They are all I have.

I call the hotline just to have a listener some days. But its never enough. Because I know, they will never fulfil the love I yearn for which is from my loved ones. And knowing I am a burden, makes it more credible.
