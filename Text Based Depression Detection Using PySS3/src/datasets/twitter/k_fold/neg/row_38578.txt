Day 1 of 15Today is the first day of my last two weeks. If I cant find a reasonable solution to my problems I'm ending it. I've had many people tell me how I was not alone and that I can get through this. I also have people telling me I'm not a psychopath but what you don't realize is that I am faking all emotions when I'm around my family. This is to not bring up any suspicious behavior that would constitute calling the authorities. The chances of me getting a job that supports me and a family is slim to none. I've brought up the fact that I'm both depressed and suicidal with my school, my dad, and my mom. All of the people whom I've talked face to face with tell me that 1. I'm making exuses 2. I'm being overdrawn and 3. To give it time and it will solve itself. I have waited 4 years for something to change and no one has even asked me how they can help. The blame is always put on me and I'm tired of it. I'm putting the blame on someone else for once.
