Iâ€™m slowly giving up. Sick of crying every single day.I have a bad relationship with my fiancÃ© and Iâ€™m sure he hates me. Iâ€™m not sure exactly what I have done but he constantly says itâ€™s my fault heâ€™s always angry. Iâ€™m an angry and whiny person, canâ€™t do anything right. Iâ€™m upset at most things. Just ready to give up. I cry every single day because I literally hate myself so much. I feel like Iâ€™m reaching my limit. Iâ€™ve been through something that has made my mental health worse. I am slowly getting to a place Iâ€™ve never been before. Iâ€™m tired, guys. Tired of it all. How does it end? Iâ€™m never going to be satisfied. Everything is bad. My head is terrible.
