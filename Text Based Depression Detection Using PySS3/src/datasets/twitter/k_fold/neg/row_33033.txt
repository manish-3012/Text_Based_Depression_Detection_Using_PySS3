Unwanted in life. Will be in death.Everyone says I'm a good friend. But noone asks me if they want to hang out. No one messages me. Everyone assumes I'm busy or they just don't want me to be around. Even my fiance has said he needs space. Even he hangs out with my friends without me. 

It's be better financially for my parents. My siblings don't need a loser like me in their life. 

I wouldn't have to worry about pointless bullshit like finding a job or paying off my tuition fees or trying to keep up friendships when it seems like noone else wants to. 

I'm just tired. And I should be used to it. But it still upsets me.

I told my fiance that I want to die. What do I get? 'sorry you feel like that'. He knows how it feels and all he comes up with is that. 

Maybe I should just end it, seeing as noone cares anyway.
