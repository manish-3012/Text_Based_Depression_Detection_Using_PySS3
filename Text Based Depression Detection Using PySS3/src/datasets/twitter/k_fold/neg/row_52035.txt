Lost All My FriendsIâ€™ve been struggling with mental health issues for a long time and when I am in a dark place I have a bad tendency to lash out at those around me. I think I have finally pushed away the only friends I hadnâ€™t pushed away yet and now have no one to talk to. I did not think I could ever feel as lonely as I do right now. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to about anything really, no more prospects, no more aspirations or hopes. Not really sure why I am even still alive. I am planning to end my life sooner rather than later at this point. Iâ€™d appreciate any suggestions for the most efficient/painless method. 

Thanks
