I don't see the point. All I do is lay in bed. If I go outside I run out of breath. If I eat anything, I get insanely hungry. If I play at my PC, I get tired.Where's the quality of life? I strongly believe that I would have been better without meds. I would've just felt depressive and a little bit anxious. But now I have stretch-marks, and 2-3 meds I'm addicted to with no way off. I'm a government-paid druggie, that's been shaved of any high.

I'm thinking of switching to ziprasidone, but I'm honestly not hoping for anything. I just want to die. My life is dead and over with. It has been getting worse for years. I no longer believe it can get better, and you can't tell me it will get better. I just want an end already. I don't understand how people with other terrifying diseases are selfish for wanting to die. I'm not selfish for wanting to kill myself, everyone else is selfish for wanting me alive.
