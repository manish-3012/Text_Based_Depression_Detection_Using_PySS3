The reason I am depressed told me to kill myself..Itâ€™s always because of a relationship isnâ€™t it. After not seeing her for a year, she told me to kill myself mutiple times yesterday. She knows about my mental health issues, should I give her the satisfaction of it happening? I know iâ€™d be letting people down, but I would dead, it wouldnâ€™t bother me? I took myself to A&amp;E but there wasnâ€™t much they can do. There never is. â€œIt takes timeâ€ but in this time itâ€™s getting worse
