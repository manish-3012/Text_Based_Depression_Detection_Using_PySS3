Star Wars helped me todayI was hanging out with some friends and realized that I am 100% replaceable. For whatever reason I just really felt like the odd person out. I could make 0 effort to see them again and they would be fine.

I am lonely pretty regularly but in that moment I felt loneliness like I haven't felt in a few years. I went right back to my old habits of suicidal ideation and started planning out when and where and how. I had planned something with them because I was feeling down but instead of helping, somehow it made it worse.

It feels so hard to make deep connections with people when you're older and I'm not even that old I think. But there it is. 

Today I was talking about the next Star Wars film with my brother and re-watched the trailer. A flood of happy emotions came back. My heart swelled. I am so happy and yes really looking forward to seeing Rey and Luke and Leia again. Even Kylo. I am definitely going to make it to December if I keep this in mind. I think I'm going to start watching the trailer every morning.

I have the despecialized editions playing right now. It is really making me feel so much better. As long as it is on I am distracted from myself. 

A year ago I was doing so well. I thought I had really changed. It's so hard being in this place again. It makes my hard work feel pointless. Like I am always going to end up back in this place. 

The effort required to keep myself from ending up back here is too much. I feel like I will never have enough energy.
