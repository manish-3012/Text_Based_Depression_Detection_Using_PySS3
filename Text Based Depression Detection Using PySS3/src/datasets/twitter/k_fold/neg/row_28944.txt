I had a panic attack today, cried in the car and battle my suicidal thought and wonder if I am cursed to have a bad life and there is no justice in life, teachers don't care about you and always try to make the bullies apologize,not help you in particularI had a panic attack and a bad one at that and cried a bit

I constantly live in the past or more like my past haunts and some people from class have told me that they hope I die alone and other worse stuff

I wonder if people hate or dislike on the street cause some curse me, i mean those who curse me speak badly about me to other people

I concider my self very plain woman but do not have social graces and am very vulnerable and have been bullied..since i can remember and hate my self for it and being weak

I am afraid that i will always be bullied, my dad gets very upset when i tell him that i want to k\*\* my self

My teacher in middle school never cared if another child hit me and i never hit back cause i knew i will have problems, later when i decided open up with my bullying story i got called sexual slurs for not defending my self and being still a target since hypothetically if i hit back i would have got rid of the bullies. Well, it is not exactly like that, some bullies hit you back even more

I am tired of being a target and a victim for bullies just for being quiet, shy, and having no friends, it is not my fault that people do not want to befriend me, why don't they accept me into their group so I won't be bullied eh?

I believe strongly in justice and do not want to live in this world
