HelpI have no fucking idea what i'm doing and I can't handle it anymore. I'm 16, my girlfriend is 15 and she's suicidal. I stay in the relationship mostly because i'm almost her only support she has. It's not worth it for the pussy, and I don't feel an emotional connection. A short chronology of her life would be as a young child her bio dad sold guns and coke, and beat the shit out of her. This fucked her up really bad, so she went to therapy, and was alright for a little while. Then, she got into an abusive relationship, and the guy raped her. Add this in with a verbally and emotionally abusive stepdad, and she's getting night terrors all the time and barely sleeping, and now taking about taking a bottle of oxy and letting that be that. I can't handle her and school at the same time. I go to a prep school i'm in ap classes and I have my sat and act coming up, with ap exams and finals coming too, so i'm busy literally sunup to sundown with that, so i'm losing tons of sleep. I've been super stressed because of this and made the mistake of venting to her today. Bad move, she's now more open about her worthlessness and desire to die. I told her mom that she needed help 2 weeks ago, and her mom yet to mention it to her. I would be guilt wracked if she died, but for the sake of my own mental state I need her out of my life. What do I do?
