i have never been financially stableto preface, i am 20 years old and have had 3 real jobs before, all of which i was making just above minimum wage. i barely have a highschool diploma, so my education is very restricted. i have no job right now and haven't for almost 2 months now, and i quit my job because i was on the verge of suicide every single day and i could not fathom going to work another day. but here i am, with 56 cents in my bank, no job, and already in debt with people i've had to borrow money from just to pay my bills. i have the worst fucking anxiety about applying to jobs and having interviews, like i just want to sit here and cry and just not even have to deal with getting a job. but now it's almost christmas time and i want to buy a few of my friends gifts, but i can't because i have literally no money and it makes me so fucking angry at myself. even when ive had jobs, it's NEVER enough money to pay for my bills, like idk. i've just been in the worst fucking position the past 4 years since i started working, and i've never been happy. i just want to die to avoid this whole fucking mess
