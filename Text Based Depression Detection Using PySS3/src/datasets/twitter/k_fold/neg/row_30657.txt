Really don't feel like it's worth living anymore 23 (m) years of shit, just when things look like they are turning around it all comes tumbling down. 
Stuck in a shit job, the only brightness I had in my life decides I'm not even worth a text to explain why she won't talk to me anymore.
Only decision left is to find a way out that won't be too messy. It really is sad that no one will even notice or care. 
Forgive my rant but reddit was the only enjoyable part of my day, how appeopriate if this is the last thing I write.
