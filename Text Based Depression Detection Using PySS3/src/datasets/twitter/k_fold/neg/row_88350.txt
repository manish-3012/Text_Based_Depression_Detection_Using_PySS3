How do I tell a stranger on the internet to not kill himself? What do I say?Sorry if this isn't appropriate for the subreddit.

 I'm not suicidal. Not at all. Or depressed. But there's someone who is. I know nothing about him. I found his comment on a meme app I have talking about how euthanasia is legal in Switzerland and how he was gonna go there. I jokingly asked him why he was going there and expected a joke in response. He told me he was going there to be euthanized. I got serious and asked why. He's told me so far that there's no point in living if his entire life has been miserable and it's highly likely the rest of his life will be awful too. He said simply that he was just tired. Just sick of it. He couldn't get joy out of anything anymore and he feels like he can't talk to or be around his friends anymore. Apparently he has therapy later and physio a few times this week. 

All in all, he's just "not in a good place physically, financially, mentally or emotionally". I really do want to help this guy but I have no idea what to say or how to get through to him simply because I don't know him and I'm bad at advice. What do I tell him? What do I say? Thanks in advance.
