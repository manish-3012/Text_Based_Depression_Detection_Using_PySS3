My numbness is what keeps me goingThat and my fiancÃ©e. Being able to just push through the day until itâ€™s time to sleep has been the way I lived life since I was young. I swear I can feel my fiancÃ©e distancing but I think itâ€™s me. She understands how I feel, she gets me more than anyone ever has. Sheâ€™s been there since I was a preteen so when things get rough I always turn to her. I donâ€™t want to anymore, I feel like Iâ€™m becoming a burden. Every day is getting harder to live, every breath i take now a days is shaky and heavy, itâ€™s like every second of every day Iâ€™m hyperventilating. I thought I would be able to do it as an adult once I left my family and stopped feeling guilty of leaving them. But now thereâ€™s someone I actually care about in my life, and the thought of causing her pain hurts me more than anything. Living is rough. But the thought of leaving her alone is even harder.
