itâ€™s so hard to not think abouttw: self harm

ive been left with this topic alone for years. i never had the courage to tell anyone about my genuine desire to just not exist anymore. i hate hate hate being vulnerable to people because it just makes me feel worse. 

three years ago i had this really bad episode which still leaves me a few scars i can see to this day. not really noticeable but its still there. and i havent told anyone about it. everytime i look at it, it reminds me of how i havenâ€™t gone anywhere with these bullshit thoughts, and that iâ€™ve made no progress. everyone says this but i genuinely feel so alone. i have no one trustworthy to rely on and it just really sucks. cant even tell people im supposed to be close to.. i feel so cold and empty yet somehow it still really hurts. because i do want to feel but at the same time i dont because nothing ever goes right. ive been feeling like shit for years and have came to no peace in my mind. cant even remotely love myself. idk how far im going with this but i just needed to vent. im probably making no sense. i dont know how my life will end, because as much as i fantasize and consider ending it, i just cant do that to my family. what a shitty thing to do on my end. so yeah, im feeling trapped here. its a hellhole. nothing is really getting better yet i read these posts and still tell anyone i meet to keep going. what a complicated person lmao i hate myself :))
