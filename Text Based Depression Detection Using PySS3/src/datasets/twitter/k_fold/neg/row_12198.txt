AlienI am who I am because of the trauma Iâ€™ve experienced.   I canâ€™t forget it.   I have no reason to change. 

Society does not understand, they want comfortable lives.

Everyone has left me.   That is traumatic enough.   Itâ€™s compounded by decades of trauma before that.  

The girl I loved is purging me from her life finally - finally kicked me out of her Netflix account now that itâ€™s been 4 months since she stopped talking to me.   She deleted the song I showed her in the car one evening 9 months ago from her Facebook.

Thereâ€™s no use learning why, the damage is done.   I want to fix it still, but Iâ€™m a fool.  She does not care about me.   No one does.   I still love her.  She is an amazing person.   But it doesnâ€™t matter - sheâ€™s like the rest of the world.  She wants to be happy and comfortable.  

I am an abrasive asshole at the least.   I have no one left.   Iâ€™ve passed the point of no return.   The stress and intrusive thoughts are too great for me to function, because I have no more purpose to work toward or hope for the future.   Iâ€™ve endured 30 years of hell and pain.   

I need to make relationships where people treat me well so I can learn that itâ€™s okay to feel comfortable with people.  But that has not happened.  It had gotten worse.  

I am done.  I want to finish my will and sell the things I own first, but I am too dysfunctional.  I am afraid eventually I will end it before then.   I slept with my pistol last week.   I donâ€™t want to go that way but I need to remember that death and peace is close.   This is entirely too painful and there is no reason.  It is nonsensical.   She could have at least told me why, she could have at least talked to me like she promised she would.   

I am a mess, I am a failure, I am cursed, I am done.
