Why does this feeling ALWAYS come backFucking again, I'm back and ready to die. Why is my brain just so shit??? I really want ect to see if that will finally make this horrible dark tornado disappear from my life permanently. I cant keep Living with just temporary fixes to this problem. Does life feel this way for everyone or do we just have really shit luck ??
