Anyone else always feel suicidal at night?Every night usually when i'm laying in bed waiting to fall asleep i feel overcome by feelings of isolation and loneliness. I've never had a girlfriend, or really even a close friend because of how strict my parents are. Never been allowed to have a phone with data, or hang out with freinds and I basically stopped using social media because of how they would monitor it etc.etc. Overall I just feel really disconected and unwanted. I honestly dont know why im even saying this seeing that no one here actually cares and even if they did it would never lead to a meaningful or intimate relationship.( Also my lack of social skills makes me afraid of speaking with people online). I understand that having a girlfriend wouldn't fix all of my problems but I still always crave the affection and attention that I see people in relationships get and give. And I know that even after I move out, it will be a long time before I can have the kind of relationship I really want. So honestly why bother?
