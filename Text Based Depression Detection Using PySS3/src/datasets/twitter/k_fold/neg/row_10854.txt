Don't do what I am planningI have been living in a torturous mind for years. The last couple years have been even worse for me. I am trapped in this mind, with no way out. I don't handle medications well, actually make me feel worse, and everything else I have tried, hasn't worked. My whole body is shaking, my mind is heavy, and I am just tired. I need it all to stop.
I have a few things to do, and then I will be gone. Thank you, everyone, for your support, but this is really the end. I still have a few days before this will happen, because I do believe things can change, but I'm not sure it's going to be enough. The pain is unbearable, and I just don't want to keep fighting anymore. 
If I was younger, I could see a reason to keep going, but not now.
Take care.
