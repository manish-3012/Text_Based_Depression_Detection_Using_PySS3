Something like 30% don't respond to treatment. Then how many actually improve long term?Why am I wasting my time if I'm not going to get better, it just makes me feel worse. What if treatment doesn't help me because I've already decided I want to die, I've already accepted that I'll not get better. So even if medication and stuff does help, I might be fucking up my own chances. 

I can't engage with life because what's the point, it doesn't mean anything If I'm not planning on staying here. I think I'm only reason I'm still letting people try and help me is more so that I can prove to myself that I can't get better, I always doubt myself on everything so being totally sure would help me. At first I wanted to be able to be like you can't say I didn't try now I don't really care. 

No one will help me end my life so I've got no choice but to continue with care, at what point will people start saying yeah fair enough we can't do anything else for you. Just let my fucking die.

Just thinking about shit and rambling so I this is probably a load of rubbish to read.
