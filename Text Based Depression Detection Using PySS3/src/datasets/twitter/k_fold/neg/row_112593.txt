Desperate for something to keep me hereI turned 18 in January and I genuinely feel like I'm not going to make it to 20 maybe not even 19. Everytime I find something even little that helps me it always gets taken away. I have a heart condition that could pretty much kill me whenever. I feel like even if I did find something to keep me happy that would happen. There's no way to win.
