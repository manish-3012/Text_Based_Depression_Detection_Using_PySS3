Sexually dysfunctionalI have failed, over and over again, to have sex.  I can't seem to broadcoast to the guys in my life to stop hitting on me.  He said I asked for it.  I told him not to touch me.  I couldn't stop it from happening again.  How do I make them stop?  I don't want it, I tell them I don't want it, but they won't stop groping and touching and grabbing.  

Last time a guy hit on me, I jumped out of a moving cab. My face is fucked up.  I will literally shoot myself in the face, I can't figure out how to make this stop.  WHY WON'T MEN STOP.  I DON'T WANT IT I BEGGED HIM NOT TO THEY KEEP TOUCHING ME. 

I can't make any of it stop.  It's going to happen again.  It's only a matter of time.
