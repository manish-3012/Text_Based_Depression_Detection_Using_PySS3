Why am I the way I am?I constantly fuck up and embarrass myself. I don't understand why I can't be a normal human being. Why do I have to do things that are so incredibly stupid all the fucking time? When things are finally going okay I dig myself deeper into a pit of despair. I can't wait until I die so I can save myself from the embarrassment and humiliation of my own fucking life.
