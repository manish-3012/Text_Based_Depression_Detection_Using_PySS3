I just want to end itI used to be a straight A student, Now I'm a senior in college, barely got C's
And because of lockdown, I'm stuck at home all day. I hear my parents yelling each other everyday, my sister hates/avoids me.
I feel like I'm the cause of this problem.
It's obvious that I'll live a boring life with a job I hate
I just want to end this suffering.
