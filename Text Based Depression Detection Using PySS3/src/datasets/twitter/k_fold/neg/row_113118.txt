I canâ€™t stop myself from loving this fictional character itâ€™s destroying my lifeI started liking this character in 6th grade this character caught my eye right away. I had no real friends in 6th grade this character had changed my life for the better back then. Now itâ€™s doing the opposite this character is the only thing that makes me happy no matter how hard I try I cannot find other things or people that make me feel the same way as him.. I want to love this character till I die it helps me fill the void no one else can fill.. I hate myself for being so pathetic I know he will never be real that makes me so miserable everyday.. itâ€™s gotten to the point where I canâ€™t start my day without hearing and seeing him I donâ€™t know how to stop I canâ€™t stop having breakdowns if I canâ€™t see the character.. itâ€™s already ruined my social life I donâ€™t ever want to hang out with anyone I just want to spend all my time with this character.. I really donâ€™t know what to do..
