My girlfriend wants to die, I am lost about what to do.As the title says....my girlfriend wishes she was dead. She has tried to kill herself on verios ocacions, last was last night, but she stoped herself after talking to me, because i started freeking out, and was about to call her parents, which were also in the house, to get them to stop her. 

She has a whole range of mediacal conditions, and a very troubled childhood....i am nos sepecifing more because she comes in here often, and i do not want her to recognize this. 

She is completly against psicologists....sometimes she freeks out, and starts saying she want to kill people, somtimes even includig her parents. Then she cant remebre. We think this may be a double personality, because she really does not sound like herself at al, she goes into a kind of trace.....

I do not know what to do. No one knows, except one of her  bestfriends, (who i called, looking for help, after she told me she was going to kill herself some months ago and stoped answering my calls). If i tell people about this, she will hate me, because i am the only person she trusts to say this things too...and she will feel incredibly betrayed. First time she tries to kill herself was about 5 years ago, when she was only 13. But i am honestly ok with her hating me, if it means she will be happy. She tells me to stop trying to make her happy, because there is no way i can single handedly save her, but i cant. I love her more than i love myself, and there is no way i give up. I just dont know what to do.

Please help.....does anyone have any suggestions?
