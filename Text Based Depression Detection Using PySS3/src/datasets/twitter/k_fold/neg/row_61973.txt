My friend.So im at an utter loss of what to do. My friend is fixated on ending his life and nothing i do can help. Hes given up and doesnt want help cause he doesnt want to continue fighting. I cant accept his death. The thought just destroys me and leave me in shambles. I cant lose him. He is the one that i love and i cant let him hurt himself more. Please i just need someones help. If he were to go through with hanging himself, i dont think i could live with myself. Please god someone just help me. Im literally sobbing while typing this
