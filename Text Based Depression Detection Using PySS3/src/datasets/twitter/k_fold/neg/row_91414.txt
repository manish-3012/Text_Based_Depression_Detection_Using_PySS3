You know how some people have first aid kits, earthquakes kits, etc.?Well I have a dying kit.
It's pretty simple stuff. A bottle of water, a bottle of pills, some travel sized liquor bottles, chewing gum, a pencil, a puzzle book/books to read, and a switchblade are all you really need to go out in style when that especially unbearable wave of suicidal feelings eventually hits.

It's tolerable on most days, but as time goes on that feeling gets stronger and stronger so I might as well be prepared right?
