BodyI lost over 25kg, still canâ€™t like my body.
Still not comfortable in my own skin.
I want to starve myself until my ribs show, until my arms are thin and my stomach is flat. 
All I want is to be thin.
But then Iâ€™ll binge, and I keep getting bigger, all I want is to be so small that it captures the attention of people and makes them worried.
