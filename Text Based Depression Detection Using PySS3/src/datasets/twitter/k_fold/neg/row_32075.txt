Please help I dont want another panic attack I'm scared of panic attacksI have to kill myself for my own safety. I hate feeling that way. Sometimes it's better to not exist. I can't handle it anymore. I can't handle this home. It isn't worth my future. It is just going to ruin my future. I will never recover. I can't get away from the pain. I don't want to hear yelling anymore. I don't want to feel threatened. It threatens me when she cries, when she says something is going on I don't know about. She points fingers and breathes heavily. She smiles sarcastically. I try to slow my breathing. My bones are frozen in place. Is it Jeff? Is he planning on hurting us? What if we are homeless? We have no support. We have no money. I can't handle being murdered. I can't handle being touched again. I don't want to leave my phone behind if I go to a shelter. That's my support. At least I can write where they won't see it. Maybe I can talk to someone. What does it mean? "Not today." "Today is a really bad day to be stressing me out." Is it true? Why does she say it every day? Her fear seems genuine. I have to support her. I can hardly breathe. She doesn't realize how much it scares me. Everyone scares me. The unknown. The vague. Everything. I just want to control the little puzzle pieces and gears that run the world. I have to for my own safety. I feel sick. I am so unsafe. What's going on? Will I have my escape?But the only escape is to kill myself. They don't understand that I don't want to. I have no choice. I have to get out. I have to get out. I can't. I'm trapped. I'm not allowed to be alone. I have the kids. Where will they go? Where will she go? I can't live on the street. I need my phone. It makes me happy. My only friends. The hotline at least. I need Jeff to not hurt us. I don't want to be hurt. I'm scared. I'm so scared I feel weak. Was she threatened? Do we have to run away again? It's contagious. I will turn my loved ones away from me so it's easier when I'm on the street. No one would miss a homeless bitch. I have to die.
