Fuck a title i cant even see straight or breatheI really fucking wish i was stronger. How can one minor thing i didnt think would affect me drag me as far down as it did. Im full of rage and have a huge hole in my heart. I have done what i needed to do, but then i saw something that broke me. I didnt expect to see that. God damn i cant stop crying and even worse i have no one to go to for support. I wish i could just pull up to my bestfriends house and get a hug and get distracted. But what friend? I have none. Everything that happens i have to go through on my own. I have to deal with everything alone. It fucking hurts. I cant breathe. I havent eaten all day and im going to be sick.   I just want to fucking disappear once and for all, go to sleep and never wake up. Anything, just fucking kill me already. I have gone theough this pain and i thought i was over it, i thought i didnt care, then suddenly my heart breaks again? Fuck this shit.
