I feel empty and used upI'm turning 19 next year and I'm gonna go over what's wrong with me:

I'm a kissless virgin (I've never even come close)

I'm ugly as sin and awkward looking

I have a small frame and I'm short especially for the place I live in

I have a small penis with phimosis, really REALLY bad hirsuties coronae (Trust me you're not gonna find anything that looks like mine on image search), and I have damaged my sensitivity with porn

I'm incredibly stupid and terrible at literally EVERYTHING I do, the best I can be is mediocre, I'm pretty sure I have an IQ of 70 or somewhere close to that number

I'm a loser with no driving license, no goals, no future

I have a fucked up violent and straight up psychopathic imagination and mind, with really bad anger issues, manipulative behaviour, and other awful things

I have no close friends at all and I've never had a best friend

I've only fallen in love with one girl EVER and she hurt me badly, no other girl is as beautiful as her and it's been months since we last spoke and I still think of her practically every day 

I want to check out of this life!
