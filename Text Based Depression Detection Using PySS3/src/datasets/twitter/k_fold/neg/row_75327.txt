I feel backed up into a corner, and I'm terrified.I'm Bipolar II with OCD, depression, and for the past year or so anorexia. I'm 21, and living with my parents. Turning 22 in a week, feeling horrible about it. I essentially haven't left the house for the past 3-4 years because my anxiety and self-hatred. I hate myself, I have no drive or ambitions. I can't remember the last time I did. I think I'm asexual. I have no passion. I'm terrified of everyone, everything. I only talk to my parents and have stopped seeing doctors because they frighten me.

I've been on every cocktail of mood disorder/antidepressant drug you can think of for the past 7 years. I gave up with them because nothing helped. My weight is very low but I refuse to actually acknowledge it. Tried to see a new talk-therapist for the first time in half a year and she said the same thing as the last two -- I should be admitted as soon as possible to an Eating Disorder unit until stable. I think that's ridiculous and I can't even tell you how much that terrifies me. I would rather die than deal with that place. My parents up until now have let me just live here with them but now they're convinced that I need to be put away. Because nobody will talk to me about my mood disorders until the "anorexia" is helped. I just don't want to think about it or talk about it. I have never felt so scared in my life. I feel trapped. My only two people in the world were crying and begging me to go.

Last night I decided that if after my promised physical checkup results in the 4th medical doctor wanting me to go inpatient, I will kill myself. I feel so horrible for my parents. They told me if I killed myself, it would be the end of them. I'm too afraid to care. I'm a horrible daughter. I'm disgusting. I would give anything to just push a button and be dead.
