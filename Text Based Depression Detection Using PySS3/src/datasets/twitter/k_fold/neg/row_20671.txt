I am contributing to the decline of the worldDo you know those articles and studies that claim "Young people today are technically less educated and less skilled than the previous generations", "Young people's purchasing power lower than ever before" and "Sex, dating, marriage and child-bearing among the youth is lowest than has ever been recorded"?

I'm the reason for that. I am one of those uneducated, broke, lonely losers. I am one of those unsuccessful and unskilled folks. I am part of what people called a few years ago "the lost generation".

And I am so, so sorry. I made horrible mistakes and I wish I could fix everything I broke. I made the world worse by failing to meet standards that many other people met without difficulty. I am truly sorry for everything.

I am unworthy of being an adult. I have failed to prove my skill as a grown-up and I have failed to prove myself reliable or trust-worthy. I am an old child, a pathetic old baby, and I feel so guilty and useless for it. Time and time again I keep considering that suicide is the only choice after this.
