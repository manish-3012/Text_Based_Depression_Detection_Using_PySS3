I'm tiredI don't know anymore, I have so much to talk about, but I have no one to talk to. I should just kill myself already, no one will miss me, absolutely no one,no one even noticed that time I was gone for a week,even the teachers forgot about me........I transferred schools, no one misses me, I thought I could have a fresh start. It just made me realize how worthless I am, I should have killed myself, why did I chose to live.........I should if died.......
