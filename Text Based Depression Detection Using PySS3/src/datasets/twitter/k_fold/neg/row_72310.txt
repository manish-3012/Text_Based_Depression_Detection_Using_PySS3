My rope arrived early.I used YouTube to learn to make a noose pretty easily. Will take some time to use it though. Things to do first. Gotta write a will. Gotta stop all my subscriptions. Gotta clean my room. Write letters to my family and old friends from school. Iâ€™m gonna try to make my death the easiest it can be on the people that know me.

Itâ€™s depressing really but for a little while I honestly felt like I was getting better but now Iâ€™m stuck in a chair and I canâ€™t cope like that.
