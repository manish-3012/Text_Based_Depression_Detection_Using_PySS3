Recurring thoughts of suicide, not intense, but could be. How do I make this stop?I am the average 21 year old having issues finding value in myself during my time of growth.  I find myself depending on others for my happiness sometimes, and I'm still learning to be happy for myself.  I have had a bad history of suicidal thoughts, leading to 2 apprehensions by police due to intent of suicide, a restraining order, and multiple visits to the ER.  These events occurred over 2 years ago, I am much better now, but I still get the occasional thoughts of worthlessness and suicide.  Not as intense as my previous episodes, but I'm having a bit of an accompanying issue now.

It's the usual relationship issues, where I fear my sig. other will leave me, due to my insecurities.  She knows of my dark past, so nowadays I try to keep these thoughts away from her, as I know it affects the people around me, so I keep it to myself.  I don't want to burden the people around me, and this has to be something I tackle by myself.  

I guess I came to this sub to seek comfort or advice, because lately my head has been a hell that I have been battling by myself.  I have been seeking help at my school's resource center and I have been seeing the school counselors and therapists, which have been helping, but when I'm alone and sitting here sinking in my thoughts, I drown.  I constantly fear the worst, and right now, I fear losing my girlfriend because of these insecurities.  I feel like I'm losing her when she sees that I'm down, and I can't explain what I'm thinking because it will affect her.

I feel that I'm stuck in a loop where I end up facing things on my own, and I drown in this hell where all I think about is how much this world would benefit from me not being here.
