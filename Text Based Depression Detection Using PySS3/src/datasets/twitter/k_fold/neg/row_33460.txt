i really need help...Hey all,

Im currently 25, i have a bachelors degree in Animation and a masters in Animation and visualization that i studied with Animal Logic in Australia.

Now you may be thinking wow - i bet this guy is in some fancy job right now....

Wrong... i can't even land junior positions or even internships, i have constantly tailored and updated my portfolio for studios and just about everything in between.

I even sacrificed so much to travel to Vancouver for Siggraph 2018 in hopes of finding work- yet here i am.. i now work as a cleaner... for 21$ an hour..

Im here asking for help, contacts, ANYTHING. because i honestly don't know if i should even try anymore , at this point id rather just be dead.

I know reddit is a place of "Anonymity" but below will be a link to my portfolio - which contains my full name ect..

Please, if you can, any help would be appreciated.
