When the emptiness strikes, my common sense diesHere I am, drinking once again alone infront of my Computer.

Another weekend gone to waste.

I dont know what to do. I have zero fun with anything. I dont want to play Video games all day but thats all I have. I am pushing my last 2 friends away, have been avoiding them for the last two weeks. I cant stand any company anymore. I *want* to be alone, I dont desereve friends. I have no one to talk to, on the other hand I wouldnt know what to talk about, its all pointless, a waste of time.

There is this wave of emptiness that gets me every evening. I cant focus on anything, my thoughts are everywhere but not where I need them to be. I want everything to end
