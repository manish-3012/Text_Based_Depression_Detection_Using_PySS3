Just tiredBeen severely depressed/ suicidal for several years now, Hospital/ ICU stays, and several years of therapy and really I am just tired of people trying to convince me that life is worth living. I just want this all to end. I am so very tired of struggling each day to do the right things only to watch other people do all the wrong things and end up better off than me.
