I donâ€™t belong anywhereFuck itâ€™s always been this way. Never had a friend, never talked to anyone unless I was forced to, and I try to avoid all people as much as possible. Why the fuck is this world designed in such a retarded way? The ones who hate life/socializing should be given jobs to do at home/basic income(to avoid wage slavery) and when they feel that they donâ€™t want to be a part of the shitshow anymore then let them have a peaceful and painless suicide whenever they want. Itâ€™s not hard, itâ€™s just society being idiotic and not recognizing that not everyone gives a fuck about the retarded game of â€œlifeâ€. 

Every fucking day that I have to live in this stupid  world makes me lose my mind even more. Thereâ€™s nowhere to go in this world if you hate people and hate being a fucking slave. I guess Iâ€™m fucked. Life is fucking bullshit and Iâ€™m sick of it. Why even have a society if people are going to be living in dogshit conditions? Having all of this technology and money doesnâ€™t mean shit if I still feel like dying. I wonâ€™t ever understand fucking life.
