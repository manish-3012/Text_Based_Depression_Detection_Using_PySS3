My girlfriend just gave me 2 weeks...I'm literally texting this is the bathroom and trying not to sob.  She has struggled for so long and tried so hard and tonight she said that she wanted to truly end it all.  We made an agreement when we first started dating  (3 years ago) that if either of us wanted to brake up with the other that we could say no for two weeks and then we had to accept it.  It was a cute little thing just to say that we really couldn't lose the other.  But now after about an hour of crying she said I had 2 weeks before she would brake up with me and end it all.  I honestly have no idea where to go with this. She did therapy some over the summer but they only gave her lexapro for anxiety and nothing for actual depression.  I don't know what to do where to go or how to help.  I want to get her medication to help but if she is serious about the 2 weeks time then I don't know how.  Please anyone help.
