Being alive is my biggest mistake. Since the mid 90's I found myself toying with the idea of killing myself. I used to think that if I just took it easy and pressed forward things would get better and these feelings would pass. Since things are far worse now and have caused me to become even more mentally ill I've decided to kill myself. I think the main reason I want to die is human nature. I hate being around people and there is no way to get out of the rut I'm in without being around someone. I don't even know how to talk to people anymore. I find having a conversation with people to be painful. Other than that I was severed with an eviction notice last month. I have to move out by tomorrow. I don't have any family left so I'll be out on the street in a world I deeply hate full of people I can't stand to be around. I believe that I was put in the wrong place. I do not have the ability to connect with others and find their emotions and needs to be unreasonable. It's not like I'm special anyway. There's 7 billion people on this planet. I can be easily replaced by someone who will connect with others and contribute to society instead of just be a drain on it. It's illogical for me to stay alive. I will do nothing but stand in the way of my own and others' progress. 

I'm going to post this, wait 15 minutes to see if anyone replies and then blow my head off with this shotgun.
