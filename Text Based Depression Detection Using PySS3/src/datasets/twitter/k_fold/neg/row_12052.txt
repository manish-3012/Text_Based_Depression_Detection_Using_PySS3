I feel so hurt I just want to die.The only think stopping me is Iâ€™m too scared of the pain moments before it. But I hate myself. I feel like no one cares about me outside of my family, and though Iâ€™m never bullied I never feel value. Girls only look at me because Iâ€™m an attractive guy but then inside I feel lame as hell. Once they see that Iâ€™m quickly left in the dust. My friends rarely if ever reach out to me first, I always feel like Iâ€™m keeping these relationships going. I feel exhausted and Iâ€™m only 19. 

I want to go back to when I was a kid. I feel like now Iâ€™ll get a burst of attention and feel loved and then Iâ€™ll be left in the dust. Whenever I struggle it seems no one cares and itâ€™s me vs the world. I donâ€™t want these feelings. I think the worst thing right now is not having a textbook best friend, Iâ€™ve always wanted one but I donâ€™t. I try, but Iâ€™m growing so tired no one understands. Everyone just says make more effort to give love but Iâ€™m getting so so tiredðŸ¥º... 

If there was a painless way to die Iâ€™d do it right now except for the fact that my family would be devastated. Crap, thinking of that just makes me feel sadder and cornered, I feel like I canâ€™t escape. I canâ€™t afford a therapist and even if I could I donâ€™t want people to know my struggle... everyone sees me as the handsome, tall, kind friendly guy.
