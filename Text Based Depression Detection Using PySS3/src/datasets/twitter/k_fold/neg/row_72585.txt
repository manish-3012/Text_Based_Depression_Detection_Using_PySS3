If not today, then sometime soon.Every attempt to make improve my life is met with failure of some sort. Something almost always goes wrong and my patience is already threadbare as it is. 

I canâ€™t speak on the phone without feeling panic. Iâ€™m terrified of driving. The worst is being unable to feel completely at ease doing anything, even the most menial tasks, without feeling intense scrutiny, perceived or otherwise, and feel like a complete ninny. No matter how hard I try to succeed, I fail.

What point is there when youâ€™ve been mocked and derided all of your life. I thought it would end at adulthood; naÃ¯ve, I know. 

I canâ€™t control my panic when put in a stressful situation. My kind goes blank and I canâ€™t function.

Iâ€™ve been so close to just swallowing the entire contents of any bottle of pills close by and hoping I die. 

At this point, itâ€™s either suicide or possibly homicide. 

Iâ€™m well medicated but that does nothing to take away the intense feeling of self loathing. 

Iâ€™ve had these feelings for far too long. 

My existence was a terrible mistake and if not today, I will eventually rectify that.
