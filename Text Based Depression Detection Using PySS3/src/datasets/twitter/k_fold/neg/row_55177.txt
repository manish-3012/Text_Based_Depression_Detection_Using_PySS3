Tired of being a loser. Dread having to spend 30 more years slaving a way on a 9 to 5 job.I'm tired of working. I've worked hard for almost a decade now but with little progress. I don't want to spend my life slaving away on a 9 to 5 job, only stopping when I'm 60. What's the point? I'm thinking just working another few years, retire, have fun spending all of my savings then kill myself once I'm broke.

My life could have been a lot better if not for my parents. I was meant to enter the most prestigious university in my country. I could have had high paying jobs. I could have saved at least five times the money in my bank account. I could be living the life I want. Instead, now I'm a loser working in a shitty job with a shitty pay bound to do this job until I'm 60.
