This belongs here. Won't be coherent. Fear of drowning and everything's wet. 


I haven't breathed in years.


Wrong side of the bed since '91.


I'm scared out of my fucking crooked soul and I can't handle my life anymore. I'm terrified she'll learn how crazy I am.


When I was a kid I've told myself I'd go a year without crying, since then I've realized I can't make it more than a month without thinking of killing myself.

Fuck. Does anyone else exist?
