I feel somewhat calm making a plan before I kill myself.I plan to do certain things on a bucket list before killing myself. Iâ€™ve accepted Iâ€™m beyond redemption and beyond a chance at happiness. Friends betrayed me, I feel like Iâ€™m the worst person in the world and I think thereâ€™s no chance for me to make new friendships or seem like a good person to others. 

Iâ€™ve made mistakes just as anyone else but I think Iâ€™m just beyond fixing. People that have hurt me have told me Iâ€™m the worst person and I can never change and I will always be a bad person to exist in this world. I want others to be happy and if it means me leaving this world, so be it. Iâ€™ll start slowly cutting off whatever friendships I have left over time so hopefully they can just forget about me and leave me alone. 

Iâ€™ll try to achieve something noteworthy before Iâ€™m 26. I want to do at least one good thing before I leave.
