HelpHi. I am new here on reddit and I'm sorry if my English sucks bc it's not my first language. Anyway, I created an account here after finding this community and I just badly need some help. This is a long post so pls bare with me. I am actually struggling with suicidal thoughts, I tried to end my life for so many years. I would like you guys to know things that I haven't told anyone, because I am afraid what might happen if they knew. I think the occurrences that happened in my life that I will be listing down might be the trigger of these thoughts. I've been struggling with it for years, it's so long that I lost count. Here are these occurences:

-When I was younger, I used to play a lot with other kids in our neighborhood. There were times that we (me and my younger sister), would play inside one of our friend's house. My friend who I would just call "Jem" has two older brothers who would I just call "John" and "Nick". You see, John that time was atleast 20 years old and I was like 5 or 6. He would often play with us kids when we were at their house. Then there was this time when I was playing house with Gem (just the 2 of us) and then I heard John calling me, so I went near him. Then he told me that he was going to show me something then held my hand and took me somewhere, which is the bathroom. Inside the bathroom,(idk if I should tell these things but I want to go all out to open up about this bc I still have nightmares about it) he took off his pants and also mine. He then held his member and told me so many times to try and lick it which I refused because I was actually confused and don't understand the situation I was in. He then grabbed my right hand and put it on his member and told me to massage it. Fast forward, I was very confused and I didn't know what to do bc I was just a kid back then. He then told me that I should keep quiet about it bc he will go to prison and he will kill my parents. That day I remember when I got home I was thinking about what had just occured but still couldn't get an answer and I only understood it after a few years because my brain kept on bringing my memory of it up.

-The second event took place when I was slightly older, I was I think in sixth grade that time. My mom and dad have always fought in the past few years because my dad was a womanizer and would always go home drunk at least 3 times a week so my mom would get mad at him. One night they had another fight, I was actually used to it by then so I would just sit on my bed and stare at nothing while I wait for their voices to subside. I think you should know first about our living conditions that time so you'll understand why my dad had to sleep on our bed (me and my sister's) that time. You see we used to live in a squatters area, we were poor but we get by every day. Our house was made up of wood that have rotten away, inside we have a double deck bed. The upper bed was for my two older brothers to share. The lower one is our bed that I share with my sister. Then our parents would just sleep on the floor and if you're curious with the bathroom, it's outside out house (a makeshift) that we had to share with some our neighbors. Anyways, that night my mom insisted to me that my sister should go sleep with her on the floor bc she didn't want to share a bed with my dad, I agreed bc I understand their situation. My dad then slept beside me on the bed and I fell asleep after a while. Suddenly, I woke up in the middle of the night when I felt someone touch my legs then my thigh and then upwards. I was just frozen in my bed as my dad touched my body, I couldn't move. The next day, he acted like nothing happened and I couldn't even bare to look him in the eye. I kept silent about it because I was afraid it might ruin our family. 

-You see, I was a fairly smart child when I was younger so it wasn't impossible for me to get to a very 'decent' high school for achievers. My highschool life was fair enough during my freshman year but during my sophomore year, I wanted to run away from that school. That year, I started dating one of the most popular boy in school (might sound like the clichÃ© in movies but it's true, i promise) so I was very happy. I would just call this boy "Mark". Mark was popular with the girls and had this ex-gf who is in the same class as ours. You see, I thought it was all cool until this ex of his who I would call "Jane" and her friends started threatening me. They would follow me home and just say rude things about me. There was a time where they even threw things at me, calling me a nerd and stuff. They wpuld make fun of my appearance and would always laugh at me. You know, usual bully stuff. But I was a kid back then and I couldn't bare it anymore so I broke up with Mark (which was very painful to me that time) just for the girls to stop doing those stuff to me. I didn't tell anything about it to my parents. And the bullying still continued until I was in my third year.

-Ok so this will be the last one that I am willing to share for now. I graduated college a few years ago, I'm in my 20s rn and I took up Sociology as my major. I graduated early because I took advance classes a few years back. When I was in college, my mom would always be the one to be left at home because my dad and brothers go to work, and me and my sister are at school. I will always be the first one to arrive at home and that's when I started to notice my mom always texting with someone. She was always smiling when using her phone so I got suspicious and talked about it with my sister. My sister then agreed with me, she told me that she actually saw my mom texting with a guy. One day, I didn't have any classes so I was just in our room (mine and sister's, we moved to a more decent neighborhood) and heard the door in our living room open so I went out there. I saw my mom and a guy that I didn't know entered our house. I asked my mom who he was and she told me the guy was a friend lf hers from highschool. My mom then told me to go back inside our room, I didn't want to so we got into a fight. She grabbed my hair and proceeded to drag me inside our room (I'm 4'11 and a very thin woman so it was easy for her to drag me) then she locked me up inside. I was crying the whole time while idk what her and that man was doing outside. This time tho, when my brothers got home I told them about it and they confronted my mom. She was crying and begged us not to tell our dad because he might hit her.

There are still other things that I haven't told here but thank you for reading this. I have also been beaten a lot by my dad when I waa younger, not only me, but also my brothers and sister. I'm just struggling rn and don't know what to do. I know that I shouldn't end my life but it's really difficult to not listen to the voices that I hear.
