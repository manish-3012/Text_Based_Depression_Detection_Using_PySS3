Cant handle the truthMy parents are sick. 
My father suffered brain damage from a heart attack. My mother has diabetes and cannot walk anymore. She also has some form of dementia, and will not do anything. 
I am a financial burden to them. 
I go to school right now, and am very stressed out from school and knowing how they are. It has been more than traumatic for me for what happened to my father. 
I also just feel like my life has been meaningless and I don't care what happens to myself anymore. 
I let myself go so much, I let go of all of my standards. I have severe anxiety and I can't handle the rushing feeling that I have to destroy myself. Often I imagine hurting myself. 
Now I have this collected feeling that all of my life must be resolved by my death.
