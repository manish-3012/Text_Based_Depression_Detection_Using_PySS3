Suicidal PartnerI was out with my partner last night.  We had a bit to drink and came home.  I don't remember the end of the night, just laying in bed hearing him cry and puke.  I was in a state where I was so tired I couldn't even move.  This morning he told me that when he gets that drunk he thinks about how he's going to kill himself one day.  Not soon but eventually.  In the moment I knew I didn't have anything to say.  So I kept quiet.  I know I'm unable to talk him out of those sort of thoughts.  Later in the day I told him it upset me that he said those things, that I knew I couldn't change his mind about it but it made me sad.  He informed me he thinks about suicide everyday.  He thinks he will kill himself around the age of 32.  

I guess this post is just me trying to figure out how to cope with hearing this, and if there is anything I can do or say for him.
