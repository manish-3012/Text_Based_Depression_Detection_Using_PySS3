â€œIâ€™d rather hear the same thing 100 times than go to your funeralâ€No you wouldnâ€™t. Sure you donâ€™t want me to die, but eventually you realise mental illness isnâ€™t a cute quirk but more a living hell. As soon as the person youâ€™re listening to acts in a way you donâ€™t like you stop listening. Supporting a mentally ill person isnâ€™t easy but donâ€™t walk away later on because affirming everything they believe about being a burden and people being fed up is worse than being alone to begin with.
