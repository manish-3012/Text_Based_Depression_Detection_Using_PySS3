My spouse came home drunk...And called me a stupid, worthless, useless piece of shit. 

Usually those are things I call myself. And when he tells me I don't talk to him enough and I share how I feel about myself he gets upset. Upset that I feel those things and that I'm not happy. That I'm always sad. Miserable.

So he came home drunk, which is not a common thing...and called me the things I call myself every day. Doesn't matter that we have an amazing child. Doesn't matter that he's put up with me for 10 years. He's right. I'm terrible.

I'm never here because I want to be. I wish I had no reason to stay.


Eta: this happened last night. He ended it with telling me to sleep on the couch and came down at 6am to apologize and add "I'm not proud of what I've said". I didn't sleep and just asked if I could get some rest in my bed. Now tonight as I lay restless the words are so loud and repetitive and I can't stop crying.
