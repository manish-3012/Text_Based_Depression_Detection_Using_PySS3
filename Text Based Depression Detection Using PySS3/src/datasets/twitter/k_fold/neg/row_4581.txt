I want to vent, but at this point I'm just tiredDon't waste your time reading this post, go read someone else's. I'm worthless, too mentally exhausted to talk, and my suicide is inevitable.

I could write several books on all of the reasons I want to die, but I'm just tired. I'm tired of all the people that insist I can talk to them, but then just conveniently disappear when I try. I'm tired of this shitty world and all the shitty, manipulative people in it. I'm tired of being hated by fucking everyone. I'm tired of knowing that the world would just be better off with me dead.
