Out of time.Times up. I'm 31 years old, and still can't do for myself. Everyone says I should just do as they want,  and continue to sacrifice every bit of  myself to their comfort.  No... just no. I can't take it anymore.  My entire life is full of abuse and benefiting others at my own expense, while I suffer for existing. I didn't choose to exist, yet I am being punished for it.  No, I don't have another 30 years for life to "get better." Within the week i am attempting, whether or not the world likes it.
