I need help and I feel like my brain is meltingThis is a crosspost and I'm sorry about that

This post might be word vomit and I'm sorry. I haven't slept in a while. I have asperger's and avoidant personality disorder. I absolutely hate myself and I'm not cut out to function in the real world. Every day on my campus is unbearable. I'm a joke of a human being. I shouldn't be allowed to leave the house. I hate myself so much. I remember every embarassing moment I've caused and it creates this ball of rage in my stomach. I started self-harming again due to this. I've created a massive burn on my lower leg and it's so bad that I think it's caused muscle damage that makes it difficult to walk on it. I'm a walking disappointment. I wish that a car would run me over. I'm so sorry for existing and I wish that I had the courage to kill myself. I wish that I could stay in bed forever so I didn't have to subject the world to my absolute joke of a personality. I'm sorry to everyone who's had the misfortune of talking to me. I hate my personality so much. I can't fucking function. I hate the world but more than that I hate myself. I'm a horrible human being.
