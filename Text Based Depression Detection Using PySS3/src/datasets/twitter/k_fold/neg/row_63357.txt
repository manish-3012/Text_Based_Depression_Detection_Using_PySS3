Iâ€™m 18 and Iâ€™m so scared of the futureIâ€™ve read about people in their 20â€™s who are failed and pretty much were like me at 18 and could never recover. I donâ€™t wanna fucking be a loser at 24. I just want to end it before I become a fucking adult loner with no life and no job. I donâ€™t wanna be that creepy old guy on reddit or games with no life talking to teens. I want time to stop so I can be this young age forever but I canâ€™t. I know that Iâ€™ll be a degenerate, leeching off my mum in a few years with no life. I canâ€™t take my current life anymore and I feel like I deserve punishment for everything Iâ€™ve done but going on for longer is just unfathomable for me. When youâ€™re in your 20â€™s you donâ€™t have an excuse for anything, and I donâ€™t want to ever exist as one. Iâ€™m done with my life. Time is relative and for me time goes by so fast. Iâ€™ll be 20 in no time and I have to stop this. At least I can make up for my sins and avoid the inevitable if I die. Life canâ€™t torture me anymore. I deserve whatâ€™s happened to me and the only way out is death.
