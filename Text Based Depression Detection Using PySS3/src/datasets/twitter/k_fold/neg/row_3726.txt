I don't think I can commit to it but I am constantly thinking about itSo ever since I started college I began falling behind in pretty much all aspects of my life. I wasn't making any friends and I was doing poorly in all my classes (never formed a study habit). It continued for a year or two and I was hiding my grades from my parents. It got bad enough that I eventually had to tell them and I medically withdrew and transferred closer to home. I thought a fresh start could help and not having the burden of those lies would allow me to get on track. Now I'm another year in and I'm doing it again. I don't want to kill myself but I do feel that dying wouldn't be too bad. I know that school and all that isn't anything to kill yourself over and it isn't the end of the world but I have no motivation. I want to make something creative, I have videos that need editing, ideas that I want to flesh out, etc. but I just am either too lazy or unmotivated to do any of them. I'm starting to give up on college and know that the only way for me to be successful is to focus on these creative endeavors and make something out of it. I just can't start working on them and I don't know why. I just fall back onto playing video games instead, even though I'm not even having much fun playing them. I enjoyed writing at /r/writingprompts on down time at my last internship but I've completely stopped doing that too. I feel like everyone around me is moving on to bigger and better things and I'm just in this inescapable rut that I've created for myself. Anyways It's ok if no one reads this or responds I just kind of wanted to write it all out but in case anyone did read through the whole thing, thanks.
