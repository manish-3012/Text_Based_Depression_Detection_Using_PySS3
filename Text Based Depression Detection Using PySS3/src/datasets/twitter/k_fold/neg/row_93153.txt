I give up tryingSixth form is absolute shambles, I donâ€™t give a shit about succeeding anymore. I was never happy about staying in the first place, but I feel like the teachers arenâ€™t listening. My head of year has broken promise after promise saying that she would make sure there would be extra support for me. Am I talking to a bloody brick wall? â€œDonâ€™t worry!â€ she says. â€œThere is no need to panic!â€ she says. No changes has been made. Iâ€™m still so lost with what to do with my fucking life- schools only glorify the smart subjects. Then thereâ€™s me, the stupid dyslexic getting shit grades that occasionally likes to draw. That isnâ€™t anything useful, nobody cares about art and you canâ€™t succeed with it. Iâ€™m months behind with my work, please god I just want it all to fucking end I hate myself so much. I have thoughts of wanting to cut, but I have nothing to get the deed over with. I just want to die in my sleep and run away from this shit
I seen my gp after opening up about self harm- he is a good guy, but long story short he said â€œjust catch up with your school work and youâ€™ll be fineâ€. Bastard. I felt even more trapped. He said this is something thatâ€™s been going on for a while, a few years in fact. But nah- hasnâ€™t really done anything 
I want to die nobody helps me- when people try to give support nothing helps 

Iâ€™m so sorry for this chaos I know nobody cares
