My Parents Deserve To DieMy parents ruined my life and they deserve to die for it. I have no empathy towards them and I would feel absolutely no mercy, pity, or remorse if they were burned alive. It's time for me to end my life. They need to take responsibility for their actions. They are pathetic, disgraceful people and I would take everything they have just for myself because they don't deserve any of it. By virtue of them being Americans and raising me in the US which is the worst country in the developed world and a disgraceful country, they've already committed a crime. It's time for things to be fixed and they are complete sociopaths that deserve to die. Burn in hell!
