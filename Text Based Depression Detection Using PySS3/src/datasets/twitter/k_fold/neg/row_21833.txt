He loves me.And I still feel like killing myself. I have a wonderful fiancÃ©, an incredible stepdaughter, but I still want to die. Maybe it's only the booze, maybe it's just being drunk enough to admit my innermost thoughts to myself, but I want to die. What is wrong with me? I've been talking to Google for about twenty minutes now and nursing a bottle of vodka for an hour and a half. I know my cat loves me. My fiancÃ© loves me. My (future) stepdaughter loves me. My parents love me. So why do I feel so sad? Why? What is wrong with me that despite my otherwise perfect life I should feel so miserable? Why do I miss my ex-husband? Why do I miss someone who treated me like shit, who spent all of my money, who destroyed my confidence, my self-esteem, my ability to be self-sufficient? Do I even miss him or is it the vodka? What the fuck is wrong with me?
