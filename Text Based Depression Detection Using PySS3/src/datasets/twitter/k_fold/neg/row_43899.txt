People would be better off without me. I don't want to be selfish.I feel as if people have grown tired of dealing with me. My pathetic idiocy has become too much for everyone. I want to set them free from that, from me. They may not know it's better that way but sometimes I feel as if it is. They deserve to be happy more than I deserve to breathe. They deserve to be happy more than I deserve to see and hear and feel. I find myself cursing my heart, it beats in vain. I stress people out. All I do is anger and hurt. I destroy peoples love for me. I can't keep anything complete and beautiful. I ruin everything. It doesn't matter that I don't mean to. It doesn't matter how I did it, what matters is that whatever I experience I destroy. I destroy it for everyone else too. I don't want to be that person anymore but I don't know how to change. I am a waste of this vessel. A waste of skin, bones, blood, tissue. A complete and utter waste. My body is perfectly good and I can't help but waste it. There are good, beautiful people in this world with bodies that betray them yet mine is in good condition. I don't deserve it. I truly deserve to die for the good of those around me. I am tired of suffering and they're all tired of me being around. Everyone wins.
