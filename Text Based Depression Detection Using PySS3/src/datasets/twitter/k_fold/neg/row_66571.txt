Life is so fucked up; Even if you want to leave life, you have to put in so much effort.Suicide has been a dream of mine for many years but itâ€™s so hard to attempt.

The body is just too resilient. The brain tells you that itâ€™s risky, not worth it, and distracts you with happiness. Cells are miraculous as they fight so hard to keep you alive. If I wanted to jump off the cliff that I want, I will probably survive and become paralyzed. Iâ€™m not familiar, nor do I have access to firearms so that would never work. All other methods will cause too much pain.

Fuck life but Iâ€™m probably going to die with itâ€™s consent, not my own. I read pessimism to understand my suffering, thatâ€™s all I can do. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever commit suicide.
