Should I check a doctor just because i think suicide would be the easiest way out?So yeah some background info:
I am kinda happy with my life i got lots of friends and a caring family. Thats why i know I would never kill myself but I am convinced that suicide is the fastest way out.
I dont belive in an afterlife so if I am right its just a matter of time until i reach it.
