Losing the will to fight.So at the first of the year I broke up with a women that I loved even more then myself, as I was advised to do in a pyramid scheme, because I was working 78 hours a week and not making more than 240 dollars a week. And she cared for me and told me to get out. But I refused to listens because I saw the guy at the top make 15k in a week. So I yelled at her in rage. And I kept listening to these guys until about august, I am still working for them, and at this point I am homeless and living off the street, but the only thing that is keeping me going is maybe one day I will see her again and we might be again, in September I broke down and almost jumped off of a bridge, but I swear I could hear her. So I called someone and my father who I told to fuck off because I wanted to be rich in this job picks me up and takes me to his house. Now I am really close to being near her again but I don't want to cause her pain, she is with someone new and is moving on. But the more I come to accept reality the heavier I get the hard it is to move, the more I start to believe that it's impossible and the more I feel as though I failed every test I was given. I tried to move on in the past but, I can't not this one. She is where I went when it was the darkest, but the closer I get to crossing her path again and see that she moved on. The closer it's becoming easier for me to jump off a bridge. I am not seeing away out of it. I know what is said suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem, but I can't see an end to this problem. What do I do?
