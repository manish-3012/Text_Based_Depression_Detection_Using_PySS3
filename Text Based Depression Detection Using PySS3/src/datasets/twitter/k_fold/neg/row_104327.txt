Spiritualist cult 'healer' manipulates people to their death.Reposted from sanctionedsuicide

I was dragged to a spiritualist healer years ago - as a sceptic, by a friend in his fifties concerned for my state of being, who knew I was suicidal. She and he were part of a cult in Australia known as the 'Centre of Light'. He gave his 'spiritualist' friend a summary of my childhood sob story, for the purpose (little did I realise) to manipulate me to suicide as a sacrifice. I felt like I couldn't recover from the PTSD I ended up with from childhood, but why not follow his advice and go to a spiritual person, even though I don't believe in anything.

It was a week after my father, who I was really close to, had died. This 40 year old woman, told 20 year old me, whilst channeling 'Jesus', that the physical emotional abuse I'd suffered (not from family) at six years old was 'my fault', my karma for being bad. That all the times I used to get punished, for what other children had done (I was the quiet scapegoat nerd, every day from six to 12 years old) I deserved. That I deserved it when I nearly died, after five older kids had smashed my head against concrete. That the fact it had made me suicidal, with multiple attempts every year, running away to try to starve myself to death most days as a six year old, I deserved. That what I'd felt at eight years old when I tried to drown myself, to escape being punished for what other children had done, meant I was bad in a 'past life'. That I'd had my house raided and everything stolen because I deserved it. That I was obviously evil, and I had to be punished, indefinitely apparently, and all the various archangels agreed it was my 'karma' and that I was guilty as sin.

I don't think I was evil as a kid. As a kid, I used to give my toys away to other people, and even stick up for the bullies who bullied me, and get bashed for it. I love animals, and always told other kids off for abusing them - then they'd bash me instead. I don't think I'm evil now, but then, psychos never do, do they? I used to get told I was evil every day, as a kid, while I was forced to do cleaning/work that other children had scapegoated me for. Then these delightful children - who I suppose are good, because they had no karma and weren't suffering - would destroy everything I'd cleaned up and worked on to get me in trouble again. And I'd try to kill myself over all the abuse and beatings from them, and the adults they lied to. But apparently my karma is bad, so I deserved it when I tried to kill myself at 6, 7, 8 etc.

That was the 'spiritual' help I had, in my quest to treat my suicidal feelings. I'm posting this as a warning - if you want to live, do the obvious and stay away from anything that could possibly turn out to be an evil cult. Anyway, I didn't sleep last night, and I'm still feeling suicidal over what fake Jesus said, strangely, so I might go eat some chips now, and try dying later. See you in hell, Jesus.

Posted this some hours ago on sanctionedsuicide - I just felt like, since I'm going, I'd post it here. So reddit can be the only witness to what happened. Because no one's going to know why I died, except the cultists my ghost shall hopefully haunt. Well, good luck everyone else, and thank you for reading.
