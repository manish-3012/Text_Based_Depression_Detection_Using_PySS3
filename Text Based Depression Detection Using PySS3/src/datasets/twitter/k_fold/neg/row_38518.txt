I feel so lostThis is my first time posting here so im sorry if this isnt how it works. Ive been depressed ever since I can remember being a teenage and im 21 now. When i was 17 i tried to take my own life by taking a decent amount of ambien xanax and a couple hydros (I was just trying to take as many pills as possibe) my mom and sister found me in my room and the rest of the night is blurry from there. Ive never been able to share my emotions or how i feel im always to embarrassed and feel like my problems dont matter to anybody so i bottled everything up my whole life and I shut people out and turned to drugs to self medicate. Even after my attempt I still kept taking xanaxs and coke and smoked a bunch of weed and drank a bunch which never helped. And now im in college and people ask my about my life before i moved here and I struggle so hard with my memory to remember anything before my senior year of highschool years of my life just erased which just keeps spiraling me into my depression.  Ive always been suicidal but I put on a fake smile and nobody suspects a thing and if i have to keep fighting this myself I dont know how much longer i can take it I always have my bottles of anti depressants and anti anxiety right next to my bed and im always tempted to wash them all down with the vodka right next to it. Especially recently iâ€™ve been feeling so down it comes in episodes and ill just spiral out of control. Im sorry this post is all over the place I have a hard time getting my feelings out and ive never posted on bere before.
