Failed suicideI've been suffering from severe depression for the past year and a half, and I just woke up, home alone, from a failed suicide attempt. At the moment I feel no emotions whatsoever, but i know that tomorrow, if i don't get some help, I will most likely try a much more "successful" attempt, and I feel like if I were to call someone, like the suicide hotline, to get help, I would just come off as "too calm" or something like that. It's really hard for me to put into words. I guess the rational side of me knows that it's terrible what I'm trying to do, and it would affect my friends and family severly, but I feel like this is my only way out of this hell on earth that I'm in right now and I don't know what to do. I just have so many problems right now, whether they're self inflicted or brought upon me, that I can't take life anymore. Please help. I feel like this might be my last chance.
