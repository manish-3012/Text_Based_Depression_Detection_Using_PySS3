I'm so tiredthe past three weeks ive had so many days where i actually didn't think I would make it out alive. it doesn't help that I'm undiagnosed with my mental illness(es) and I don't have any professional help because I cant afford it. Today I had my first ever session with a free (sponsored) therapist and she asked me to talk about things about myself that I liked and I couldn't think of anything. I spent 30 mins trying to come up with things and she kept saying these are all things you dislike. Well, that's the point. 

A girl in my college committed suicide a few months ago. My situation isnt nearly as bad as hers in terms of financial stability, social standing, etc but I keep thinkingâ€“ i get it. I don't see a way out. It would be so much easier if I wasn't around. truly. what would I miss out on? The positives of life? Theyre too few and far between to be worth all this pain. Ive been lying in bed crying for two hours my head hurts nothing is worth this.
