i hate being alone but I hate being around people morelike im lonely and sad. but being alone is better than the shame and embarrassment and awkwardness that comes with trying to talk to people

whenever anyone tries to start a conversation I have no idea what to say. i get so nervous and i feel stupid and i hate it. i just want to be left alone so I can be miserable in peace. lesser of two evils or something idk
