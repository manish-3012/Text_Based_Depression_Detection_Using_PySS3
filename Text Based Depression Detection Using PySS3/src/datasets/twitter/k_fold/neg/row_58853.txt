Response to a stickied pistI saw a man in need

And my sweat began to bead

I loved for once in my life

That another was in strife.

I typed away

To take away their next day.

Hopefully I will one day see

What it is that drives me.

Until then i shall last

On the suffering of those past.

Pray for my soul and yours

That we win our spiritual wars.
