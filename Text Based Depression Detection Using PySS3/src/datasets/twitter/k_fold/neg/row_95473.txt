Every day is harder than the last.I'm just so unhappy, and I don't know why. It's absurd to be so unhappy. I have a significant other, a stable job, and friends. My life is fine. But I can't help but pick at all the negatives, all the little issues that just seem to pile up into a massive, suffocating boulder on my chest. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I'm just so fucking tired all the time.

At work, all I feel is the exhaustion of dealing with constant rudeness and belittlement. At home, I can't escape my own head. I'm trying to start a secondary career so I can finally escape my current workplace, but I genuinely believe that it won't ever take off. I believe I'm going to be stuck forever. And with each passing day, I drown more and more in the mud of my own thoughts. *You're not good enough.* *You're not talented enough.* *You're not worth the skin you inhabit.*

I'm tired of being tired for no reason. I've been on antidepressants for about six months now. They aren't helping, but stopping them makes everything worse. I don't know what to do anymore. I just don't think I can handle much more of this.

I don't know if I want to die. But the thought of living and continuing this charade turns my stomach.
