Should I go into inpatient again?I came to ask if for advice on if I should try inpatient care again because it somewhat helped last time, I'm just scared things might get worse there because I know I'm gonna have a huge breakdown.


Small rant -
Being on medication for the rest of my life to be "normal" makes me so angry. Why couldn't I have just been normal? I had to be the one in the family with the fucked up brain? Fuck this shiiiit.
