It seems that people don't care enough about certain peopleI just feel like there's not enough empathy and understanding in this world and especially for those people who feel like no one cares for them. It just makes me so angry that I'm not sure I wanna be here anymore. I want to change the world but that just seems like an impossible task. I just wish people would care more for those who feel neglected and not cared for. Everyone deserves to be loved. That's what I believe but it's really sad when some people are just treated like shit and that they don't even matter. It just makes me so angry. It really makes me not want to live in a cruel world like this one.
