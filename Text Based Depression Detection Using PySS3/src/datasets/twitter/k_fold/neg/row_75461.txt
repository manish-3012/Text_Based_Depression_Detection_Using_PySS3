26 going on 27, MtF. I'm surrounded by people who love me and am so lonely I want to die.I can't reasonably take this anymore. I live with two, soon to be three lovers, one of which I've been with for 7 years. They all love my very much and treat me very well; spoil me, even. Recently one of my partners found a new friend group, after our old one fell apart just due to people drifting away. I am incredibly nervous around these people for no reason, and two of them are coming to visit in 2 weeks. I want to be friends with these people but no matter how I try or what I say, I can't get that feeling of happiness, contentment, fulfillment, and validation that I assume is supposed to come with interacting with people you like. Even my lovers who spoil me rotten, I can't get any good feelings by spending time with them. I've been like this for nearly 2 weeks, and I can't handle this anymore. I NEED to kill myself, but I have no decent way to do it. I feel so miserable and pathetic, and I don't even think this message will even be comprehensible. I just... I need to die. I NEED to. I will never feel loved and appreciated no matter how much people love and appreciate me, and if i'm just going to have this void in my heart until I die, I want to die sooner rather than later.
