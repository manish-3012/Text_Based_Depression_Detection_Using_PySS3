Can't stop the intrusive thoughts. I have a plan.I'm not OK.  The last time I was this not OK, I checked in. But I can't this time. There's too much responsibility, too many people I'd disappoint. I can't lose my job. I can't do this to my husband.

I also can't stop thinking about how much better things would be if I died. I'm so tired of the pain. I am worthless and don't deserve to live. The world would be so much better without me in it.
