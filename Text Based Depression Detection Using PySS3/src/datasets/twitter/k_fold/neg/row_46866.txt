I don't know what to do. Please HELP!I've struggled with depression, low self-esteem and social anxiety since I can remember. I've been dating a girl recently who I've become very attached to and she no longer wants to see me which she told me yesterday on Christmas Day. I've planned my suicide and wrote a note for my family and now I'm just trying to pluck up the courage to do it. The girl refuses to speak to me so I'm making no progress towards resolving the situation. She wants me to move on and find someone else but I don't want anything other than HER love. I plan on stepping in front of a car but I really don't know what to do. I've struggled relentlessly this past year with psychological pain and I feel like I'm starting to lose the battle for my own happiness with my own mind. I feel like no matter what good things life bring me I'll never be able to happy and I'll never truly be able to enjoy life. I also feel like the people who surround me a swimming and bobbing on the surface while they are watching me drown helplessly. I just wish I was one of those social-able, funny, charismatic, good looking and good with people, but I'm not.

Another thing that adds insult to injury is that people often tease me for not being good with girls and being a virgin and I laugh it off but it's something that really gets to me when all the people who surround me are happy and I'm not, its hard.

Thanks for any advice.
