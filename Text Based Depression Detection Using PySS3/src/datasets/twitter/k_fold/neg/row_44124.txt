Telling someone that people who choose suicide are week and selfish is not ok.I was in my kitchen with my family (mother, sister, brother and stepfather) and my sister brough up the topic of suicide and self harm. 

This happens a lot and I feel like they do it on purpose to throw it at me because I self harm (been "clean" for a few months now) and they always make backhanded comments. My stepfather like to say to my sister "So you feeling suicidal now" and she laughs and say no I would never. And things like that happen a lot.

So I can't remember what she said but my mother replied "Anybody who killed themselves are cowards and selfish people who take the easy way out" and everyone got so quiet and made a point too look at me and I remember feeling so small and attracted and insignificant and how much worse about myself I just instantly felt. And she continued "They don't think about the people around then and how much damage they do" 

Is this ok?

Am I just dramatic? 

I know to some people it doesn't seem like much but to me it felt like everything because they know. I just felt like the earth could swallow me whole or I could crawl into a hole and just disappear.
