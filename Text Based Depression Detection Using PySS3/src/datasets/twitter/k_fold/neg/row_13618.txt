too unmotivated to even kill myselflike god i hate being alive and i hate feeling and i really wish i could just end it. but damn i canâ€™t even get out of bed to do my homework, or even just play a game. how tf am i going to be able to jump off the roof, or tie a noose, or take 3 full bottles of pills? self harm doesnâ€™t help and iâ€™m always disappointed with my cuts. so iâ€™ve given up on that. basically iâ€™m just stuck in limbo with a shit ton of depression, crying, and responsibilities with way out. like iâ€™m being punished for my actions, i guess.
