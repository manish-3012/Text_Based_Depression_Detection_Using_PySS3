Rilke just saved my life (for now)I read the following poem and it gave me hope. What I take from it is that life will guide us trough a path of feelings and that is a journey worth of enjoying.  

&amp;#x200B;

Let everything happen to you.

Beauty and terror.

Just keep going.

No feeling is final.

\-Rainer Maria Rilke
