Stress reliefI'm being mentally destroyed by people I thought I could trust, I've never been a real "talker" but I'd seen some stuff on here and saw how it had helped some people and I just wanted to say, I've been crying myself to sleep on the daily for around 3 years now and I've recently started cutting. It's a great way for me to relieve stress and I know it's really bad but I don't want to stop. Help me please.
