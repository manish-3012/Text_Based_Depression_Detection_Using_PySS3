These are the accident happened to me more than half year ago. 
I canâ€™t stop crying in the night from that day. And this accident also affected the relationship between my husband and I. Last Sunday felt so
helpless and hopeless about my life after quarreled with my husband. After my daughter fell asleep, I back to my room and tried to suicide by hanging myself. My husband saved me after half minute I kicked down the chair. Now I am still feeling not very well and have thought of suicide. I know I am not a good wife and mother. What can I do to make my life back to normal?
