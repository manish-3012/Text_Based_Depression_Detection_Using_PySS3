Feeling really do or don't latelyMy depression has escalated to the extreme. I used to consider myself as a person who wouldn't do it because of the family and other loved ones I would leave behind. But there's so much guilt built on that I started not to "care" anymore. Last night I was just seconds from asphyxiating myself but I had a 10 minute argument with myself. I convinced myself that this was all just a "game" and that the moment I cease to exist, everyone else would too. In the end I stopped myself and just self harmed instead because I needed a release. But now another night is coming and I'm afraid I might be on the edge again. I've already given my sister the belts but I don't know I might get extra creative and desperate tonight. Does anyone relate?
