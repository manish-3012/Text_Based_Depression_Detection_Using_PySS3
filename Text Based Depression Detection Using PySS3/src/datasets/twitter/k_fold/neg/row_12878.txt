I keep feel like killing my self.I keep researching the best, painless way to kill my self. I can't take my life anymore, I don't do anything but wake up, eat, go sleep at like 6am every fucking day, no going out, only to doctors appointments. My anxiety, panic disorder, depression sucks, I've started therapy but I have no hope what so ever. Life sucks, I don't fucking socialize and I regret all the decisions I chose in high school and college to be in the career I am. I quit my job due to my shit fucking anxiety. Nobody knows how it feels, only my therapist, I open up to her but hide it all at home. 

I hate life. I need something to stop me feeling like this. I'm too scared to tell anyone, even my therapist as they will tell someone as obviously they have to.

I also suffer with dyspraxia, which makes me a clumsy fuck, what a mess i am, anxiety, depression, panic, dyspraxia. No wonder nobody likes me...
