September 3rd is my date. I can justify no further delay.I am utterly and wholly empty. There is nothing inside. I have no hopes, no dreams, and I'm starting to realize I never did. I live and have lived entirely as a product of inertia. Simply rolling where I was pushed, incapable of influencing my own speed or direction. But now friction has finally caught up to me and I must stop.

I have the things I "want". I do not work yet I am financially secure through social security and basic planning. I have friends who appreciate and like me. I have hobbies I can participate in regularly. If I bothered to try, it's entirely possible that I'd be able to get into a relationship. 

There is nothing I want to buy. My friends seem alien and bring me no joy. Hobbies feel like empty distractions. A relationship would prove only how alone I am. I feel like a ghost, ever hungry damned to never be satisfied by any food as I walk the earth. Did I make a deal with Devil in my youth and simply forget?

I have no hope of improvement. Medication and therapy have proven ineffective. Diet and exercise feel like Sisyphean tasks. Even medicinal doses of hallucinogenics have failed to deliver results. I am broken in some fundamental way.

There is no cure for being me.

The only thing that can save me at this point is my own cowardice.
