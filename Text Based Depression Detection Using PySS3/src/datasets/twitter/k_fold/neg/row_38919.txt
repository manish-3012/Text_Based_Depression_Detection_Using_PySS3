I'm scared of myself, and what i've become.It feels like my mind is decaying.

Â It feels like I'm going insane.Â 

I might be going insane.

Iâ€™ve been snapping at people i love, iâ€™ve been yelling more, i feel hopeless, i feel stupid, i fucking hate everyone but at the same time i want friends. I want a family, but I already have one. I want people I can talk to, I want people that love and care about me and talk to me but I don't. I might. But i donâ€™t. Every single goddamn day, I hope and dream for something, like anything to come and save me, or help me. I hope and fantasize about some magical person coming and putting me into another realm where I can be happy, or give me powers or something that lets me be who I want to be. But magic isnâ€™t fucking real. Thereâ€™s no way I can be happy at this point.

Iâ€™ve been sitting inside of my room, I've been staying in the dark, rotting, doing nothing but listening to anything I can find and crying my eyes out. Sometimes I donâ€™t even know why. Iâ€™m so fucking mad. Iâ€™m so sad. Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t want to die. But I feel like itâ€™s the only way. The only way I can be happy, the only way I can be free, the only way I canâ€™t get worse and hurt someone. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. But iâ€™m so, so angry, all the time, at the littlest things. Just this morning, I got pissed because some birds were chirping a bit too loud. I get pissed at my cats meowing at night. Iâ€™m so, so scared. Iâ€™m so mad. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die.

I want to have a happy life, I want to know who i am, and iâ€™m young, iâ€™m thirteen, i have a chance still, but i feel like iâ€™m going crazy. I fantasize about situations near impossible for so long I nearly feel like theyâ€™re real. I think about people from games or youtubers i like talking to me, and i sometimes almost respond back, or laugh, out loud in the real world. I think I'm becoming a monster. Iâ€™m so scared. I feel like the universe hates me. I feel like I was only created by god to be a punching bag, like I was made out of spite.Â 

Iâ€™m trapped inside of my own head.Â 

Someday Iâ€™ll die. I remember I came up with a date and age to do it. I was going to do it when iâ€™m 15. I forgot the date. At this rate it might be sooner. I hope itâ€™s sooner. Iâ€™m too much of a chicken to do it, i think. But when the time comes- and it will, i think i wonâ€™t be that scared.

Sorry for repeating myself, and this mess of a confession.

I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening to me.
