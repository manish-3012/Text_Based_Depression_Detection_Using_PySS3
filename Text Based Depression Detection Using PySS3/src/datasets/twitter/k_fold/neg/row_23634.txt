This has got to be itI browse this subreddit a lot. I'm on imgur a lot, I've bought plenty of people food that they wouldn't be able to afford themselves. I give advice to people on here and to people on imgur and it's advice that I need to give myself, but I won't take it.

I'm almost 23, I'm in my last semester of university after dropping out for a bit. I just don't see the point. I didn't ask to be here, and I don't want to be. It's dumb that suicide is looked at as such a shameful thing. It's not shameful. I didn't ask to be created, but since I was, should I not have the option to end it?

I'm a good person, generally. I have a huge heart and I want to help everyone and love everyone. I do, I actually try and do that. But inside I'm dying. I'm slowly dying, and I wan't to expedite the process.
