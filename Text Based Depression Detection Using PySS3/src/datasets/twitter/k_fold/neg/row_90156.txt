No sleep till you're deadI'm completely convinced I'm allowed no sleep ever now.
Living with my SOs shitter family for the past year, with NO WAY OUT, has left me with no sleep. They never ever let me sleep, not in the night or day, no naps, no breaks, just work work work. Then my SOs shitter kid who NEVER sleeps either keeps me up all night then is a horrible rotten POS all day. In which NO ONE helps me with either. Have to take leaves from work to deal with SOs other kid who is in online schooling. So I'm stuck here forever with no way out. Work like a slave, get no rest. Just get sicker and sicker in the body and head. There's literally no way out but death.
