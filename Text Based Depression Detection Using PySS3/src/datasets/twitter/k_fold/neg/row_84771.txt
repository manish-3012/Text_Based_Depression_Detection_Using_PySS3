Some days are good, most days I don't want to be here any more.Recently I've fallen in love, the situation is extremely difficult and confusing and I'm unsure how to handle everything. I know how I feel and how she feels but it doesn't make a difference on me feeling unable to handle everyday life.

It's as though I'm stuck in a place where I try to better myself not for other people but to be a better me. Non of it matters though, no matter how hard I try to be the best me I can so that I am happy nothing changes. On a day to day basis the thought of suicide crosses my mind so many times I'm unsure how to handle it all anymore.

Whether it be a gun, overdose, crashing into a object at speeds I know will end all the pain. I don't want to be here any longer and I'm not sure what to do anymore.

The sad thing is I know she loves me. And she isn't the reason I'm feeling this but I'm scared because how can someone I see as perfect see me as perfect aswell when all I see in myself is disgust and hate. I've never known how to love myself but I've been able to love others so much I get lost in what seems like an endless void. I'd do anything for so many people but can't do anything to help myself and it's the most terrifying thing I've experienced, there has been so much pain and sorrow in my life in the past and I've tried forgiving and moving on but daily I think of the past and the terrible things that have happened.

This is the first time I've said anything to people who aren't close to me, and even then I've only told a handful of people how I feel. No one seems to get it they just think it's their fault and they should have been able to see it. But they are wrong, nothing that anyone else could have done would have been able to change or avoid my pain. I just want to know how I can handle this and avoid bringing anyone else pain by my suffering, I don't want to hurt anymore and I don't want anyone to hurt but it's all just to much for me anymore.
