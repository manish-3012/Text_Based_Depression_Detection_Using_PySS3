I have called the suicide hotline and used crisis chat a few timesI am looking for a solution, not comfort. The hotline and chat have both only been able to provide comfort, which was useless for me because I have only used logic to justify suicide.


Every time I reach out is a desperate attempt to find someone else that has stumbled down a similar path towards making a real positive change in the world. One person doesn't stand a chance, nearly everything stacks up against them to make even a local change. I don't know what I could possibly say to find that kind of person anymore. I am exhausted. 

All I can see that I can do now is to serve an example to not let your dreams be dreams. I will build my plane and fly it, or die trying.

Fuck. Everything is dripping with greed. Spending my life trying to sort out alternatives and lifestyles that benefit everyone and make sense... just to have people look at me like a fucking nut. Apparently not wanting to take advantage of people is an alien concept to this world. I can't find words for the disgust it brings me.


I believe I am beyond help. I'm mostly just putting this here for myself so that I can say I tried. I don't expect a change.


It's scary stuff. I can't talk about this sort of thing because I am terrified that if who I am speaking with actually understands it, they will fall into the same conclusion I am currently at. I'm going to try not to think about it now. Not much use though, seeing as it has been on my mind every day for years. I am so tired.
