I keep doing so many mistakes, I don't know how long I can go on like this anymore.Maybe someone will read this. I apologize for any bad english but I'm simply not a native speaker.

Hey /r/SuicideWatch/. I don't even know why I am writing here, maybe I just need to tell this someone. Like the title says I'm someone who does so many mistakes in his life. One of the most serious was probably hiding my true self from everyone I love for so many years. For many years now, around 7 or 8, my life is a up and down from day to day. 

But the reason why I'm writing this is something that happend yesterday. I dont have many friends, i would say there are only 2 guys i would call that, but yesterday I realized that I just forgot the birthday of my very best friend, which was the day before yesterday. This might sound very insignificant to some people but this one friend was like an anchor in my life, since we met the first time. I've often been at the ledge of life and ready to end it all, but this one person always dragged me back and even made me and my soul smile in these dark times. So yesterday I had a total breakdown, I couldn't even sleep that night, I felt like the greatest sh*t in this world and wasn't able to think about something different than this.

Than today I talked to him again, and he was like nothing happend. But I can't understand how he is even able NOT to hate me for this. I am the worst person in this world, disappointing every single person I know, but nothing ever hurt that much.

Now I don't know what to do. Do I even deserve to live on? I mean, I will disappoint him again some time and many other people too. Also I don't think I'm an enrichment in their life in any way.
