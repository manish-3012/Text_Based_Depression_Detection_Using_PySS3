Just scared the fuck out of myself.I know I only posted a few hours ago but developments. Also I'm mindful of the rules so I'll be incredibly vague. Maybe unnecessarily so, just erring on the side of caution. 

So, with my chosen method it's possible to practice, and there are certain things you want to happen if it's death you're looking for. I've tried in the past and made no progress, which is exactly what I was expecting now. I thought I'd just be disappointed again and then go to bed. Instead I think I got it right this time, and I may have snuffed it had I not aborted. This was a practice, I didn't intend or expect to get this far so it shook me up a bit to say the least. Starting to feel sick too.

I've let someone know which I may or may not regret later on, but it's about 6 in the morning where I am so I just wanted to get this out and have someone see it now.
