Giving it 1 last weekI am lonely.  I have searched for love in church,  online apps, school, speed dating,  through friends, lounges but have found no luck.  I am seriously considering suicide. Please help me. I honestly don't even know how you could help me. I've given myself one more week to live. I really don't want to die. I just don't want to be alone anymore. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
