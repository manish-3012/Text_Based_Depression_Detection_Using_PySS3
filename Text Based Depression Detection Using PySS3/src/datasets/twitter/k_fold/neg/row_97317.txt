My mental illnesses make me a bad person who no one wants to be around, makes me wonder if anythings worth itIt feels like every attempt i make to be happy either fails or backfires horribly. I was optimistic as a kid that everything would work out in the end. I was a bullied and lonely kid ever since early elementary school. Im not bullied anymore, but im still very lonely. Im aware that the few friends ive made ultimately dont care about me as much as they care about others, and even if they did ill just be replaced eventually anyways. Im no ones favorite person, and i doubt i ever will be. Even the one girlfriend ive had got sick of me after two months and left me to get with a friend of hers that shes always cared about far more. She told me i was toxic and manipulative, and after lots of thinking about it and wondering what i did wrong i think its because im mentally ill. My depression, anxiety, and ocd has caused me to become a manipulative person out of desperation for attention and love. I feel like im an awful person who cant make myself better unless i feel cared about, but the only way ill feel cared about is if i become a better person who people want to be around. The only options i can think of is to die (which i cant do because my parents will be sad) or accept that ill be alone forever in the end and just become a shut in who never talks to anyone. Im just lost and idk what to do anymore except hope that maybe someone will come along whos willing to put up with my demons, but i feel selfish for wanting that because it means id just be a burden on them overall. I dont necessarily want to die, i just want to give up. I wish i could find something to convince me to keep on trying.
