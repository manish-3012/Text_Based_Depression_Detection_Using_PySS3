2 years ago I tried to kill myself2 years ago (I was 14) I tried to commit suicide. I was at home alone, my sister and mother had gone out and my father was not there. I just woke up, I felt terrible, lonely and sad and so without thinking twice I took the box cutter that was in the kitchen and went to the bathroom, I sat on the floor, I was going to cut my wrist, since I was stupid I couldnâ€™t cut myself because I put the blade too close to my hand,(I donâ€™t know how to say it) and after that I was scared and I didnâ€™t cut myself anymore, who knows why I didnâ€™t try again. I'll never said that to my family and my sister, I was to scared. Even today I want to kill myself, who knows what will happen.
