my will is brokeni realise i cant escape the situation i am facing. it consumed me and my will is broken. i have no prospect of improvement. i neither imagined nor wished to end up here. these are probably the last weeks im still alive. i neither realise the scale of my burden nor the the weight of what will happen. consider this a goodbye.
