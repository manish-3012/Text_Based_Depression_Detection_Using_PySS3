I feel like Iâ€™d be happier if I was born just a few years earlier.I was born in 2005, but I wish I was born in 2000. I feel like Iâ€™ve missed out on so many things. I know this is all r/lewrongeneration and shit but I just feel like Iâ€™ve had a bunch of experiences taken from me. Just in general it just feels... wrong. Everyone says â€œwell you can have experiences like that too at your ageâ€ but honestly I canâ€™t. It seems like 2008 was a good time for so many kids but I was only 3 then. I feel like Iâ€™ve missed out.
