I am so so stupid - I just want to dieWe have to prepare for a huge exhibition at work today putting out tonnes of furniture for an exhibition - only I slept through my alarm and missed when everyone came to pick me up! These are people who I consider genuine friends and I feel like everybody is just going to hate me and think I did this on purpose, after all it is the hardest and longest day that we have at work. This has never ever happened to me before, I always show up on time and prompt. The worst thing is that the day before was my birthday. I called up (and so did my mum) and told them I was sick the night before but they'll probably think I was up getting pissed and didn't bother to tell them. I have loads of unread messages on my phone and I daren't even open them and respond. I just want to leave this world. What do I do??
