Kinda obvious why I'm hereI've been dealing with bipolar depression for a few years. My best friend killed himself around a year and a half ago, and I've talked to his mom a lot since. Seeing her suffer and knowing my mom would suffer similarly if I killed myself is the only thing preventing me from doing it. Sometimes I feel like that pressure ironically causes me additional duress. 

Edit: I don't really know why I'm posting here. I'm sitting in my room alone so I guess I want to feel less lonely. My thoughts are a bit jumbled because I turned to drugs before reddit when seeking help.
