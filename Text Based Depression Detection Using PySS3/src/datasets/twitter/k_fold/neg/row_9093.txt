I guess i just want someone t hear this.It's hard to talk about things like this with anyone really. I feel lke I cant talk to my therapist because he might have me locked up or something. I cant talk to co-workers. That'd be a terrible idea. I certainly cant talk to my family, they'd worry. So.. I guess if you all are ok with it I just want to post it here.   


I'm 35 years old. female.. can't have kids, never married, hardly ever dated really. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was bout 12-13. I was told by people at the time that they'd go away, that it was just hormones and being a teen. They didn't. I struggle with dark thoughts probably at least once a week, sometimes more than that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on a variety of meds. HRT being one of them (which goes back to the whole cant have kids thing. I dont want to expand on that, though. I don't even like kids. Or at least, that's what I tell myself. I don't know how true it is. I'm not and never will be a mother so I can't say I know what that is like.) I'm also on antidepressants, and they have helped me. I probably wouldn't be here if they hadnt. It's like a fence around the rooftop, preventing me from going over. I kind of hate it, but I'm glad its here. I think?

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a small town in the southeast. I was born here, and I moved away a decade ago to chase my career. I've drown myself in my work life since I was in my early 20s. Because if I didn't, I'd bury myself in video games, or books, or drawing, or anything that'd prevent me from having to look at myself. I suppose. I moved here after my last job went sour. This town is difficult to find gainful employment in if you are not a nurse or work for the military. My parents aren't getting younger. And I thought it'd be a chance to get closer to them, plus to escape my last job. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, this whole post is going to be scattered, because I don't really know how to format it, I just want to get these thoughts out. Maybe if they come out of my fingers they won't spend so much time in my head? IDK. 

&amp;#x200B;

I bought a small house not too far from my parents, we've always been a very close family. I was an only child, and they had a lot of trouble having me. When they finally did, I had all kinds of health problems. (allergies, asthma, apparently malformed internal components that prevent me from reproducing.. maybe that's for the best anyway.. I've already had some surgery for this, I'll be having more soon. I cant sit here and say that couldn't be worse though.)  My house is down a long poorly lit road where deer seem to cross every day. I've nearly hit them several times, and I've seen people who have hit them. The road is only 2 or 3 miles long. Every time my parents come to visit I'm worried sick about them that they're going to get killed in a car wreck with a deer. But even then, I know that they're not going to get younger. They're on a slow health decline that will ultimately take them away from me.  I've never really been close to anyone else. Ya know, I may have dated a dozen or so guys in my life. The longest relationship I've had was about 7 months. He broke up with me because he was getting a lot of pressure from his family to have kids, and.. well.. that wouldn't happen with me. I mean, sure adoption or whatever but like I said, I don't really like kids.. right so, I have no idea. Either way that relationship ended rather abruptly about 2 years ago, and I haven't even tried to date since. I gained a ton of weight, I lost all of it and then some, and I'm trying to be healthier, but I'm a depression eater and I seem to be in a dark hole right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I look out the window and I see the grass dying, the trees dying, the sun not really coming up all that much, the warmth gone.. I see my parents health getting worse, I see them struggling financially and I can't help them (I do what I can, but I cant REALLY help them.)  I mean, its not like the past was sunny and wonderful right, but I had some good moments, here and there. I can't say I've never smiled, or never seen happiness, though its always been short lived. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always felt broken. Like, I'm not supposed to exist? I mean they had trouble having me and when they did I was broken. So, I guess I've felt undeserving of anything that good that has ever happened in the first place. I constantly find myself thinking that I'm a bad person because of thoughts or feelings that I have, and I'm constantly self-analyzing, which then makes me feel guilty for being self-centered and narcissistic. I've always beat myself up, starting around 12-13, I would basically mentally abuse myself for every little thing I could. My hair, my weight, my grades, my social status.. it was a bigger deal than it is now, but now I still beat myself up for anything I can find. My boss is kind of abusive, too. He says all kinds of sarcastic stuff to me, makes my job a lot harder. But I internalize it and make it my own, and make it personal. I know that I do this, but I do anyway. I feel like I deserve it. I feel like they don't do enough to hurt me. But.. that makes no sense.  


I do talk to my therapist about this kinda stuff, but not ALL of it. Like, if I told him that a few weeks ago I had made a noose from networking cables, but stopped when I learned ceiling fans can't hold weight, he'd pretty much ruin my life by throwing me into a facility. I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about these kinds of things. If I need to edit this I guess tell me. or you can edit or whatever. That's the 2nd closest I've ever come to really doing anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

And.. I mean my life isn't bad. It's not. I'm not sleeping on cardboard behind the mcdonalds. I have a home, a job, I have some savings, I have a fairly new car, and a lot of luxuries. I should be happy. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

I see these tv shows, hear music, etc. Where people talk about being "free" and.. it upsets me. But in a weird sort of way. Like, I almost feel envy? Like, often I find myself feeling envious of people who have been able to go through with it. I've always felt like a coward for not being able to. I wind up at the brink and I step away, and then I kick myself for weeks for being a coward. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 35, I've obviously stepped away a number of times. I've come closest when I feel over whelmed by things that are out of my control. The way I've put it to my therapist and the people in my life that won't leave me or suddenly have a reason to get off the phone or off chat etc. when I tart talking about it, is that I'm "looking for an exit." I can't find a way out of the situation except for this. But, it doesn't seem to get easier. I've got a few grey hairs these days. Not many, just a dozen or so probably, but it's still a reminder that, all the pain and problems my parents are having and as much as I worry about them, there's nothing good on my horizon. Ultimatley they will be taken away from me and then I'll get to a point where I'm always in pain and treated like a hated stereotype, or a political football under "the elderly" umbrella. I work for a company that helps the chronically ill in hospices and nurisng homes. I don;t work directly with patients, but I hear about them, and sometimes they will call me by mistake and I hear what they're going through, and I just feel helpless to do anything to help them, or utlimatley myself. A lot of these folks have kids that pay for their care, that pay us. I won't have that. I don't really even deserve that.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel guilty. Very guilty. Even reading over this I feel like I'm a narcissistic ass. Why is everything about me? Why do I have to make myself the center of everything? I don't deserve that kind of attention. I don't deserve anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember, at my last job, after my manager quit and was replaced by a guy that absolutely hated me, and changed my schedule around to basically put me in hell, I fell into a really deep depression. I gained 30 pounds in only a few months. I remember right before I got the offer for the job I'm at currently, I had finished up with a customer in a really tall building. They had a 9 story parking garage. and I walked to the edge and leaned over the wall, and stood there for a long time, looking at the ground. Eventually, I turned back and went to my car. I remember, what stopped me was that I wasn't SURE that it would work, even that tall.. the narcissist in me also felt bad about having a closest casket, and the fact that I hadn't left a note. I hadn't told anyone. They wouldn't understand. The news might report it, maybe they'd say I fell and people would ignore it and the world would keep rotating and no one would know my feelings, no one would understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I even deserve to have someone understand? No. Again with the narcissism. It was all about me. MY job MY funeral, MY note. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think, out of my entire life, I've had my means "in my hand" about 5 times. Anything else has been ideation, research,and bemoaning of laws. Like, I've never understood why people wont let you just do it. I know it hurts people. That's a big reason that stops me. My parents suffer so much and I know they'd be devastated, even though I dont deserve the kind of love they give me, not at all. It'd hurt them and I dont want to do that. But, more than that, its basically illegal. The only ways I've found are painful or ave a high chance of failure and that stops me. Why am I required to exist? What right does someone else have over me to tell me I have to be here? 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought earlier today, like, maybe I can holdon for them, and, maybe after that I can just go. But, I still wouldn't know how, and I'd be breaking my promise to them that I'd try to be happy. Thats all they've ever wanted for me was for me to be happy, and I've failed them again and again and again. I cant be happy, I'm not capable of that. 

Well, I've stopped crying at least. Why does this help? Why would it? I've written notes many times for the same reason. It seems to help? Is it just venting? Am I just a piece of shit thats spamming and wasting everyones time? I'm sorry.   


Ya know, I've called hotlines before. 2 or 3 times, mostly in the last few years. I've had to have several surgeries, and they're taking pretty much whats left of me in a few months. Part of me almost feels optimistic, like, maybe then I can try to date again? The doc seems pretty confident that it'll be the last. (I mean, what else can they do? No ovaries, no uterus I mean..) I'll be on these hormones for the rest of my life, though. Or, I guess until they decide to just take them away from me. I don't guess I'll be in pain anymore though, like, cramping, 

&amp;#x200B;

I had more but, I'm gonna stop. I've dried my eyes. My sinuses will hate me for an hour or so. I have to hold on past this. Sometimes I just seriously wonder if I can. But for not having a way that I know would work I know I couldn't go through with it anyway. I worry about the possibility of an afterlife. I want to think there's nothing. Ya know we come from nothing and go to nothing. Just, poof. You don't feel anything because you aren't there TO feel anything. It's comforting to me to think about that, but then I worry, what if I'm wrong? What if all this stuff about eternal hellfire is real? IDK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mods if.. this needs to be deleted or something, please do. I don't want to hurt anyone. I'm not trying to troll or anything. I'm just a damned mess. I shouldn't exist, and should never HAVE existed. But.. I mean, like if this is at all triggering or anything like that just ,remove it. I don't want to hurt anyone. It's bad enough that I've let everyonein my life down much less adding hurting someone else to it. I've sat here like half an hour now debating to just delete this entire thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

OK.. I just had to write that. I need it, I guess I need someone else to hear it. I'm sorry. Like I said just.. delete it ifits bad. I dont want to hurt anyone I just needed to write that down. These subjects, ya know no one will let you talk about them. They tell me to "be grateful" like I'm not. or they make up excuses and leave. I dont like this either. I'm sorry.
