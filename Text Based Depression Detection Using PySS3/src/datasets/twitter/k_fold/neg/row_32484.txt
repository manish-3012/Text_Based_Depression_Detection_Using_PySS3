I feel like there no point in me existing anymoreI grew up feeling no love or affection from my family. Recently found out that the person who I thought was my mother is someone else. My real mom was in my life at some point but was posing as someone else (and is no longer in my life), and I have no clue who my dad is. 

I grew up suppressing my feelings and emotions and was never allowed to express myself. And now I feel like a prisoner in my own head, sometimes feeling like I can never get out. I have a huge hole in my heart that can never be fulfilled, from a love that I never received. 

So whatâ€™s the point, whatâ€™s the point of existing when it feels like I have no one? When it feels like this pain can never be healed?
