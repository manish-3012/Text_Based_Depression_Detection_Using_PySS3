Some advice pleaseThis is a bit of a weird one, some background first; I have suffered depression, from moderate to severe, throughout most of my life. It is under control at the moment and I am on a small dose of SSRI's (10mg Citalopram/day). In addition I have just stopped drinking (it's been 7 days today and my intention is a least 6 month alcohol free and then I'll see if there's a place for it in my life. 

As part of this process I been using quite a lot of Hypnotherapy tracks (a couple of hours a day) to reduce my connection to alcohol and also some others that I have discovered to relieve depression and build self esteem.

Now although I have had suicidal thoughts and ideation in the past I am currently not in that place, yet during one of the sessions last night I somehow sort of trolled myself and an internal voice said out of the blue "Kill yourself" and I really freaked out. Now I have become kind of obsessed by it and whenever I try to listen to the tracks I am afraid that it is going to come back and of course every time I think about it I hear the voice again. I don't want to stop using the hypnotherapy as it really seems to be helping but I don't want to program myself to kill myself either! It has started to invade my waking thoughts as well.

What is going? I am having some kind of psychosis? What can I do about this?

Apologies if this is the wrong place for this but I just didn't know where to turn.
