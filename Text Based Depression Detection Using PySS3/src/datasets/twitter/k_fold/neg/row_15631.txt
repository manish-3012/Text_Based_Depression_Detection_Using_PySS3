I feel uselessI used to believe that everything will work if you try hard enough , the fact is world is not that simple , now that i know the harsh truth i feel so useless and all my effort and time are wasted . Im pretty much not good at anything , it took me 12 hours to learn when other only need 2 , i thought that was fine until the pressure and stress finally get me today . Social , finance and relationship , i have none of those , all my confidence is gone now . Reddit community , please help me find reason of life once again :(
