Sitting in bed next to my wife and the only thing I can think of is taking all these sleeping pills.I just can't take this shit anymore. I'm done. I just want to keep putting these sleeping pills and whatever other pills I can find down my throat. Just not wake up. Just be done with the bullshit. 

Fuck it. Everyone says "it'll be better tomorrow!" No it won't. I've been through that shit. Rarely is it better.  As a matter of fact it can always get worse.
