I just can't take it anymore - when I get hope I get put down againI am in my late 20s - I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for years, since childhood. It comes and goes but lately I've been especially depressed. I have a physical disability that allows me to be self sufficient but is quite pronounced, affects my mental and physical well being. Nonetheless I have attended university, I have a stable job, good friends. Materially I don't struggle.

But lately I feel like I just wither away, both mentally and physically. I don't know if it's the depression or the side effects from meds, but I feel like I have gotten dumber, I have trouble concentrating. I've changed meds, mentally I've felt really better but it made my physical condition worse. I have accepted that's the price I will be willing to take.

Well today apparently one of my limbs decided to give out and there's a pretty big chance it's osteoarthritis or something similar and permanent. Can't really know because COVID will make a trip to doctor now quite impossible.

I am done fighting. When I feel bad I always try to cling to the hope that stuff will get better, that it's just temporary. But won't, I will just slowly die and get more debilitated both physically and mentally. And it seems that now apart from mental pain, I will also have to add physical pain to the list. I won't watch myself go on benefits, become a burden and turn into a shell of the potential I had in life if I didn't lose in the genetic lottery. Better go out while I still can, while I still live a relatively normal life. It will probably suck for my family for a while but eventually they will get over it. I am just tired of constantly fighting some part of my body, be it brain or something else.
