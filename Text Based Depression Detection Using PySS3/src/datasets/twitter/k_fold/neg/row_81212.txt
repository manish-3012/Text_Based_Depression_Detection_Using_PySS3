Here's where I am.My family and friends know about how Ive been feeling. well, only one of my friends knows that I want to kill myself, the rest probably just think Im sad or depressed. I feel like Im getting closer to killing myself. I originally wanted to leave in mid September, but I cant see myself making it past May. Just the other day I started writing letters to 10 of my close family and friends for when I leave. 

I really feel like Ill do something soon to end my life, I really don't want to fail at it like alot of attempts go for alot of people. Im just scared for whats comming up i guess. I shouldnt want to kill myself, but the thought of me 6 months from now felling the same way I do now would be the driving force to do it as soon as possible
