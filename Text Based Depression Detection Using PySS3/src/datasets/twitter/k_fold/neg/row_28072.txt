The villain in my own story.This is my first post on here... And possibly my last. The thing is, I can barely explain why I'm so upset and depressed. I know I am not alone- I have a group of wonderful friends- But I often feel that I am, if that makes any sense. I am an only child with divorced parents and I'm in seventh grade. Yeah yeah, everyone calls me stupid for thinking this way when I'm "so young". My best friend recently moved to another town and I feel as if we are drifting apart, and my other best friend (whom I also have a crush on) is noticing that I am not my normal self. He tries to help, but every time I try to explain... He does not know what to say. I screw things up a lot, so I always beat myself up for being the "bad guy". I almost lost my friend who moved away a few years ago when I made up a lie to try to impress her (for some stupid, selfish reason), and another friend of mine I just lost because apparently I am insensitive. I guess I'm just terrified of losing my best guy friend because of my stupid actions. Is there any reason for me to be having these thoughts of killing myself for no reason?
