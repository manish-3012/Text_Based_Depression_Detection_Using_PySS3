Negative reaction to lowering depressionToday I felt less depressed, which made me feel worse.  The last couple of days Iâ€™ve felt so bad that I had firmly decided to kill myself.  I bought some of the equipment necessary and set a time and place.  However, today I woke up feeling less depressed.  Hope started to weasel itâ€™s way back into my thoughts, and I started to have fleeting moments of maybe things will work out,  maybe I should just keep on keeping on.  I hate these thoughts, my decision to kill myself gave me so much peace.  My pain will be over soon, I donâ€™t have to keep on trying, I donâ€™t have to watch my life sink any lower than it already has, I can just sleep and drift into nothingness.  Currently, the thought of dying is starting to seem like a fantasy, which makes me feel trapped inside my hellish existence.
