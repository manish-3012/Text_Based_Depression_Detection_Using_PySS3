Why I want to commit suicide.I'm 18, I have a minimum wage job and cant move out of my mothers house. I'm forced to live with my 28 year old manchild brother that lives off covid relief checks. He manipulates and mentally abuses me, he knows my anxiety holds me back from defending myself and when I do, my mom blames it on me. 

My brother is a druggy, and my mom knows it but allows him to stay. I have no family in the position to take me in whilst I work and save up money for my own future. So, I'm stuck.
