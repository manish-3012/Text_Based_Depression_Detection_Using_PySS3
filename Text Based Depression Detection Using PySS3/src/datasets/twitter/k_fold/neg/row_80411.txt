How can I attempt suicide in a way that won't actually kill me?I don't want to go into very much detail. My situation is dire due to a number of factors including persistent depression, anxiety, and a lifelong disability that prevents me from working and poses challenges that forbid a normal life.

I live at home with my father, with whom I have a horrific relationship. I was given an ultimatum on New Year's day: I was to leave the house by the end of Augustâ€” the start of the fall semester.

I live at home close enough to my university to commute by public transit. I am unable to drive because of my disability.

My father has, of course, refused to pay for the costs of on-campus living. Being severely disabled I do not anticipate being able to pay back the loans I would need to take to live on campus, so I simply decided to not go through the application process to live at the university. I have no means and the university financial aid office has been unhelpful.

If my situation is not resolved peacefully I will stage a suicide attempt, or whatever I need to do in order to draw attention to my horrid state.

How can I pretend to end my life in a way that I could be easily saved when found?

I don't know what else to do. I'm too disabled to work, too depressed to keep going, have very few friend and my only family hates me.

Help.

I might resort to end it all. I convinced my psychiatrist to prescribe with Valium. I have been hoarding the pills, not actually taking them, in order to end it all if need be.

-A desperate soul.
