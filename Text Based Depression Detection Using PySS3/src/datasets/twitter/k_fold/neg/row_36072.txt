Alone and push everyone awayI thought I was alone before but I didn't really know what being alone was until now. I truly have nothing and no one and I think I did that subconsciously so that it would be easier to follow through with what I've been thinking about for years. 

I have nothing and no one and I'm praying that someone I love will reach out and give me a sign but I don't think it's going to happen. They're gone and I'm no longer a thought in their minds. 

I deleted my social media, and I've made a bunch of preparations. No one event has happened recently to trigger these actions so I think I truly am close to being ready for it to be over and to take my life.

The only thing I am able to think about in these last moments how I still ache to be loved and accepted and cherished 

Rage against the dying of the light.
