Do we really want to die?I've been depressed and suicidal for so damn long.
I think about killing myself everyday. 
But the thing is: I haven't done it yet. And deep down I feel like I shouldn't.
Mainly because I dont want to leave some good people behind. But also because the thing i really want is a better life. 
Death would just be so sad. This shit is difficult man. 
Sometimes I get these glimmers of hope but they fade away so fast. And just like that im the sad fucker i've always been.
Life seems cruel and unfair, the world feels doomed and I feel meaningless and pathetic. 
Everything seems like wasted potential.
Im sorry for ranting people. 
Whoever you are i hope you figure your shit out. 
Maybe write in the comments what makes you decide to stay?
Do you think there is something out there that would make life worthwile for you?
Everyone's thoughts would be sincerely appreciated.
Take care of yourselves.
