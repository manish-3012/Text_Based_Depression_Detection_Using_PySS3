What can I do? I feel helplessFor the past month or so everything has gotten worse. I have no confidence in myself and I wake up everyday crying. I have this sharp pain in my chest most times and I feel like screaming. I silently cry most nights and loathe waking up the next day. Iâ€™ve been seriously thinking about ending it. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be happy again. I get help from some friends who are amazing but then it goes back to normal after a while I just feel so dead inside... what should I do?
