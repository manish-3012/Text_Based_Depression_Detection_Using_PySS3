im going to delete redditAfter 1 month in Reddit. Now I realize that Reddit can't help my problem. There are some people support me in this app, thank you my friend. but it didn't solve my problem, im still useless, didn't have a job, didn't have skill, burden to everyone. I hate the fact that im stupid and have low iq. I didn't fit in anywhere, im always being a joke and being a loser. There is nothing I can do about it. I wish i can be like everyone, have a girlfriend, have a good parents, have a job, be smart and intelligent guy. But im not like that. I hope someone could just fucking kill me already. 

Bye everyone.
