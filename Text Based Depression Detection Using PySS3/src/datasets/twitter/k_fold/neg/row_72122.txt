Our mental health system sucks
Today was a bad day for me, I won't go into detail, but I called local psychologist and therapist offices in my area. 
I just wanted an appointment sometime in the next week. 

Apparently all of them (10+) have waiting lists, some are months long. I didn't tell any of them I'm starting to idealise suicide. Like yeah okay, maybe I should have right? So I did. I called one of the first ones I tried before, they obviously didn't recognize my number as when I told them the truth then suddenly, magically there was an opening for me to see the doc tomorrow.

Why do I have to be considering suicide before I can get help? Would it not be more proactive in getting people the help they need before getting to that point?
