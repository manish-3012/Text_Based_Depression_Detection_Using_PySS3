Just trying to find hope.Hello Reddit, I am a 21 year old male who has tried to end my life before. I took way to many pills and went to the get my stomach pumped for a week, that was three years ago. The way I look at my life now is has improved, just in all honesty my mind hasn't changed. I am in a cycle, just life really isn't all that great. Just with Fake friends going around, shitty ex girlfriends, knowing that there is nothing out in this world. I mean let's face it, all we are meant to be doing in this world is to live and breed. Yes we have hobbies and mindless things to distract us with, but in the end that is all we are meant to do. Life is a very, very cruel world my friends, I am trying to be strong but in the end I am weak. Also let's be honest to the fact that if I did die only a handful would actually miss me, I would just be a ghost to other peoples eyes. I get that is selfious to think but it is the truth. 

My issue I am having is yes of course i could get help or you guys can talk me out of it. But I know this thought process will come back it always will, always have. I always thought when I was little I would be something big in the world that I would influence other peoples lives. Well maybe this is it, maybe when I die that people around me will become something greater than they are in life. 

Guys I know all of what I am saying sounds pathetic and I "shouldn't be so low" it's hard... it really is. I thought about just running away from this life and starting over but what is the point? To be more in debt then I already am? I am in pain, instead writing this all to a family member I am writing you guys. I just don't know how much more I can handle this, just to pretend to be happy around others or distracting my mind for a few hours to then see that nothing has changed. I just really don't see a point in life. 

If anyone reads this I want to personally thank you, you made my day.
