Don't want to exist anymoreMy post is probably nothing different from the others here but it scares me that so many people feel the same way. If I talk to any for 5 minutes, I know I will find out something about them that will convince me that they deserve to live and be happy. But why is it that we can't do that for ourselves? Why can't we love ourselves? We would never let our friends be harsh on themselves but we're the worst to ourselves. To the point where we spend night after night wanting to end our existence. I don't want to be myself anymore. I don't want to live. But I'm too scared to do anything about it. I have no motivation or drive for anything in life. Nothing excites me, death seems like the only answer. I write this as I cry uncontrollably in the middle of the night, waiting for this to be over.
