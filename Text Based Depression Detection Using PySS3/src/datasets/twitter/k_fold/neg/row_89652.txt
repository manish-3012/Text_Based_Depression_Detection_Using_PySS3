I'm afraid to tell my therapist that I want to kill myselfI don't want to end up in the hospital. It would just cause more problems than it would solve

Plus, I don't want to put my therapist through that level of stress. She told me once she would stop being a therapist if any of her clients killed themselves.

But I don't know what to do
