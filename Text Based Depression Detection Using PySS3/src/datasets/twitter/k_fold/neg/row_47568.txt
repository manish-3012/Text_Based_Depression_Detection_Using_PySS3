Am I selfish?I've been battling with mental health problems from as early as I can remember and I've attempted suicide before. My boyfriend always tells me I can talk to him and that he's there for me but I feel selfish telling him anything. I feel like I'm burdening him and that if I tell him these things he'll only want to stay with me out of pity.

Right now it's 1am and I've been having really bad suicidal thoughts and I cut after stopping for a month. I really want to call him and just talk to him right now but I feel like it would just be too much for him. He has to wake up at 6am for work so if I did wake him up I would feel terrible.
