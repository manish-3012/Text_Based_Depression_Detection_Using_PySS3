Mixed emotionsOver the course of the last few weeks my life has been a living hell. I donâ€™t have a job and have applied to over 20 and canâ€™t get a call back, Iâ€™ve call them and they usually give me the run around, one job gave me three interviews to then say I wasnâ€™t qualified enough in the end.  ,My cell phone broke and when I took it in they said I have to pay 300 to get it fix the signal antenna stopped working , itâ€™s not worth that much. They wonâ€™t send me a new phone until about a week so now I have to use a back up phone that crashes every five minutes and canâ€™t make calls, when I try to answer phone calls 50% of the times it drops them. My car wonâ€™t pass the smog cause it need to be driven more but the plates are expired. I have to pay 150 on the first but I have 20 bucks to day name. My father car also broke the AC that he needs since we live in the desert and he uses that car to drive Uber/Lyft, I want to help him but canâ€™t so it makes me feel worse. 


 I honestly think shit keeps piling on my plate and nothing can go right the more I fight against it the more things go wrong. Iâ€™ve been thinking about ending it soon but I canâ€™t seem to bring myself to it. Any advice.
