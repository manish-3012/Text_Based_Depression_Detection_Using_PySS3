Of course people donâ€™t seek help when suicide is treated as a moral and personal failingCatastrophic state of the world's mental health services aside, if society at large views suicide as shameful, I will keep it to myself. Donâ€™t they love parading around in shock and awe when someone ends their suffering, insisting they had no idea and would have assisted if hailed.

They claim to care, but that care only appears after another's suffering becomes their own. Even then, they refuse to educate themselves on how to properly assist. Instead of true concern, they opt to trample over us with demeaning "it gets better/everything is temporary" rhetoric, guilt trips, or wild accusations of instability and thoughtlessness towards our loved ones. Their supposed compassion doesn't extend beyond their own noses.

So many are quick to crucify the suicidal when they themselves have never dealt with anything of that caliber, preferring to marinate in their self-righteous Just-World fallacy of "Suicide is for the weak". Although I would never wish it on anyone, I withhold my pity from those who, once cruel, suddenly find themselves personally afflicted and sympathetic.
 
Suicide is "my body, my choice" taken to its greatest logical extent. No one is entitled to decide whether or not I am justified in ending my life, because no one knows what it's like to be me. I alone am the arbiter of my pain.
