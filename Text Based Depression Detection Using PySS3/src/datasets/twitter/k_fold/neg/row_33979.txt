I tried everythingI really did tried everything, I spent money on things I like, tried to have fun, went to parties, did everything I used to like doing and all I feel is nothing. 
I can't explain how just one thing ruins my life and mood and hurts so much. 
I have friends, I got a nice house and lovely family but I can't take this no more. 
I ended up a 4 years relatioship more than one year ago and I still didn't get over it and I never will, girls try to mess with me and I just feel nothing, I just want my baby girl back but she will never look at me ever again. 
Last year I had some problems with myself I wasn't feeling fine and since I  spent alot of time with her I started to blame her for what I feel and I broke up with her but she didn't give up on me at first but after sometime I was becoming worst and worst and I really wanted to be alone so I said her I had another girl in my life and made her really believe it was true.. And since along time ago I knew the problem was me and I'm all alone, I just can't get over this, I ruined my life completly, she was my everything, we were 100% made for each other.. Nothing and no one will ever replace her and I can't live without her, I really tried no girl makes me get over it nothing does.. This is my only life and I won't have her in it.. I don't sleep, I don't eat well, im so sick and tired I just want to ended all, everything hurts. I try to take my life as normal as possible but it doesn't help, I go out with friends, play games, talk to other people, use social media and stuff like that but its all momentary nothing helps. I just gave up this week I've been at home since then trying to find out what to say to my closed ones before I go and do it..
