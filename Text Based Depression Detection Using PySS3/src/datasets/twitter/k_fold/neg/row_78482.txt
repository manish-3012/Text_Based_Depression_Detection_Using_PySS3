I have a friend, long distance, saying her brother is encouraging her to kill herself. How do I help?Is encouraging a suicide an arrest? She lives in Ohio and is talking about suicide. She takes CBD as medication and has no more until tomorrow. Both of her brothers are sending her messages encouraging her to commit suicide, she has shown me the messages from both. None of her direct family members treat her well. I've been talking to her all week, trying to keep her calm and distracted, but the thoughts keep coming back. How can I help her?!
