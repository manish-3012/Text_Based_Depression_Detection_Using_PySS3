It's time.I've struggled for so long with being transgender that I finally can't. I want to lay down and waste away. Slowly die in my bed. It's not even being trans that sucks, it's that nobody wants to be apart of our lives in any way. They don't want us to have access to treatments. They don't want us period. 


I'll never be good enough. No matter what. And it's so ok for people to hate us. It's too ok for people to want us all dead. My heart is very sad and can't keep up. It's like we aren't even people to so many. 

I just want to die.
