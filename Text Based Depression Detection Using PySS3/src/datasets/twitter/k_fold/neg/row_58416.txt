I feel like this is the only place where I'll get sympathy sometimesSometimes not even here. I'll get downvoted for simply saying that I've been involved with my Church, and as it being something that keeps me going, it hurts to get treated like I'm less of a person for working at a religious building. If you're curious about my involvement I'll say, but for now I don't care to.

But still, this place is more compassionate than most places. I've opened up about my past when I would bully people before and those on this site tell me I'm fucked in the head or a psychopath, or that I'm just a terrible person. Like wow, apparently self harming and planning to slit my own throat wasn't enough shame for myself huh? Even after I've apologized to these people and have treated them with respect since, I was still treated like I was an awful person. I guess I am. It's like they actually wanted me to kill myself. Maybe they're in the right.

I'm so tired of my shit life. I'm doing horrible physically, academically, I'm a terrible person, I'm not good at anything, I don't enjoy life very much, I don't feel like I deserve to even be happy. Sometimes I just lay in bed because I don't feel like I deserve to feel happy by doing an activity I enjoy.

I want to try and OD tomorrow but I am so scared I'll survive with permanent damage. I just want to die. I want to just end my life.
