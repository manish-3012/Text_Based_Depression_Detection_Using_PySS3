Nobody reaches outI feel suicidal more and more lately. Went though this about 7 years ago and thought it was behind me, but itâ€™s back. 

Iâ€™m reaching out here bc you can just scroll past if you want. Everyone says â€œreach out for helpâ€ but I dont feel anyone really wants to be in contact w me, so reaching out will force them to deal with me whether they want to or not, just to be nice. Why canâ€™t someone just reach out to me wo me having to ask? So now I know nobody actually thinks of me. 

I had an old friend reach out a few months ago to hang out and I thought it was fun, but I never heard from him again after that, so obviously Iâ€™m really not good to be around. All I have to keep me going is my dog. 

No need for anyone to reply, I just wanted to get that off of my chest.
