The more I think about it, the more it seems like the logical solutionIt's weird, I've definitely felt impulsively suicidal in the past, lost in grief. I don't feel that way right now. I don't even really want to die in a way, but it feels like the thing I should do. My estranged mother tried to get in touch with me again today. She called and left a voicemail. I'm terrified of speaking to her. I know she cares in a way, but the judgement of her and my extended family is paralyzing. Not because I'm not doing things with my life, but just because I know it won't be good enough. I'll never not be stupid, ungrateful and lazy to them. They're not abusive though, they're just probably right I never appreciated their support or connected with them in a meaningful way.  
Maybe if I was gone my mother could close that chapter. Her boyfriend could console her and it would finally be confirmed that he knew all along. The conflicts wouldn't have been pointless. If I killed myself it would just make things a lot more black and white. Not a group of flawed people unable to understand one another. Just a girl that was spoiled from the start, in spite of how hard anybody tried to help. They could leave the pain of feeling rejected for no reason behind and just assume that the problem was with myself, not what did or didn't happen in the past.   
Even my loved ones could just move on from my bouts of depression. No more trying to comfort somebody who after months of seeming fine suddenly cries for no reason or only pretends they got out of bed today in the evening when my boyfriend comes home. I could just be a memory from the past rather than a burden that continues to get heavier. I could just be gone and they could all thrive knowing they did nothing wrong ever and I just failed to be at peace with myself.
