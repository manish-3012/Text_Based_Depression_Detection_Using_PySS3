I dont know what to doI always come back to suicide as my only option. I never thought id go through with it but have been drawing closer everytime I think about it. A short story that summarizes my terrible life would start by having my parents divorce at a young age and never getting along as I grew up. Finishing highschool I went into the army only to be kicked out due to an injury I had no control over. Tried college but started skipping class and eventually failed my first semester. Having an argument with my only friends leaving me with none and the first girlfriend I ever had dumped me for someone better a month ago, on my birthday. My family is in another country on vacation and im home alone for 3 weeks. Everytime I think of my life I draw ever so closer to taking it. I made it even worse for myself by scarring my exs name into my arm which after explaining that to girls I try to gain an interest in they just say we should see other people. As the title says I dont know what to do or how to do it. I know I dont have the worst life out there but I dont know what I should be doing to fix mine. I cant afford a therapist or anything of the sort. I dont have any hobbies or interests I enjoy and everyone I try to ask for help turns their back on me. Is there any hope for me or should I just leave this world
