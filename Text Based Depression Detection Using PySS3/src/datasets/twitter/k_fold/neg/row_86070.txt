I need help saving a lifeIâ€™ve posted this in a few places, but Iâ€™m low on information and desperate, and need as much help as I can get.

This is not a joke. I need reddit sleuths, night owls, and YouTube-savvy millennials!

I know this sounds dumb, but I met somebody in a YouTube live chat room, and wether he/she was joking or not was undisclosed... but this person threatened suicide. Went by the name G0Z, as named by the Robles creepypasta. He had a fan art of G0Z, very cute, as his profile picture (Iâ€™m assuming his own), zero (0) videos, and four (4) subscribers. I have a witness and Iâ€™m devoted to finding him! Itâ€™s 3:00 in the morning, and I donâ€™t plan on sleeping until I find him, dead or alive!!!

That being said, where do I ask?
