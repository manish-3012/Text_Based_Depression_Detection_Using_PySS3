I hold my gun to my head for the last time tonight.I can't take it anymore. Being so alone. Every day, it fucking drowns me from the inside out. I see the one I love drifting away to him. She says she loves me but she fucks him. 

It makes it worse that I don't have any friends to ask for help. 

Goodbye, Reddit.
