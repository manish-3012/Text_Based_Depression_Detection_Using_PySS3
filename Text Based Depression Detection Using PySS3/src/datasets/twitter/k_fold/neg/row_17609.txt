I don't know what to do anymoreI feel stuck. There's not really another way to put it. Life hasn't really changed for me in a long time and I don't think it will anytime soon. It not neccessarily bad. It's a great life, but not one i enjoy. I dont think i can answer what would make me enjoy it more though. There's nothing i want. I've tried therapy and meds, and maybe there's a cocktail of drugs out there that can make things better, or maybe i can apply myself better to a plan built from the ground up by a psychiatrist. Or maybe it's all on me, and whatever voice that says im a lazy piece of shit every day is actually completely right. 

I just want to not be sad about life. And i have no clue how to find that.
