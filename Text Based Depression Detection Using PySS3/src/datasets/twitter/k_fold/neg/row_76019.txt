I'm doing it this afternoonI've just showered, shaved, am about to get dressed and go for a walk in the park, maybe get something for lunch.

Haven't eaten anything but my meds in two days now, that and drink a stupidly little amount of alcohol and water after I've gone to bed.

I'm just going to sit under the tree there and write the rest of what I need to write, directly address the people I care about the most, but other than that just say I'm doing this of my own accord.

I hope all of you find happiness somewhere, and I love you, even though we don't know who each other are.

You're so valuable and if you find yourself lonely, there's somebody out there who will be lonely with you.

I'm so sorry, to S and J mostly, I miss being me.
