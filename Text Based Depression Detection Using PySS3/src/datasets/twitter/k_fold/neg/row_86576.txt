Self harmed for the first time todayHonestly, it's surreal. I didn't expect to actually be able to do it. My original intention was to slice my arms open and bleed out but of course that's not very realistic... but there was blood. They're there now, on my wrist. It's crazy, I actually did it. I can't decide if I want more or not. Honestly, I always thought cutters were being dramatic and wanting attention but after I did it I just feel... Better. Like it was a release of aggression and sadness. Of course I'm not planning on totally trashing and scarring my arms forever though. They were light. But- WOW. There is no going back now.
