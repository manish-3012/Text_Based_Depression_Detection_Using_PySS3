I guess I don't really know what to do or who to talk to.I guess some background, I am a 22 year old male--currently in nursing school.  Please excuse these ramblings.  I know there isn't a lot of form to it.  Worked 12 hours today, tired, and currently drinking.

I guess I have been feeling kinda shitty for the last couple of months.  Thoughts of suicide have been becoming more frequent, and I can't get them out of my head.  It started out thinking about what death is really like, realizing it isn't that bad, realizing I would be ok with dying, being apathetic towards being alive, and now not really wanting to live. 

A friend of mine committed suicide in early November.  This was the only time it seemed to get better.  For about a week I had no thoughts of suicide as I was grieving.  Then I had a thought.  "It's selfish for me to want him back.  For him to live in suffering for my benefit?  Of what?  Just for the sake he's still alive?  And if that is true, can I really blame him for what he did?  Can anyone really blame anyone for making the ultimate decision of human autonomy and taking their own life?"

I have a good life.  Finances are ok.  I am in a 5 year relationship.  I plan on proposing soon.  When thinking about suicide, there is one huge criteria I think one has to meet to commit a reasonably justified suicide.  You can't have anybody that directly relies on you.  So essentially kids.  I feel as if my time is running out to control my life.  Once I have kids (which may be awhile, or at least I plan on it being awhile), I no longer have the option of committing suicide.  

I just want someone to talk to.  For whatever reason, the closer someone is to me the more difficult it becomes.  Although I love her dearly, I think my significant other would either think I am lying, over exaggerating,  or trying to get attention--which is the absolute last thing I want--from anyone.  Shit.  When my buddy committed suicide earlier this month I felt like I couldn't even show any emotions because it would somehow take away from his death, or inadvertently have people feel sorry for me.   I have thought about talking to a close coworker of mine, but I don't know how to even bring it up.  My aunt whom I love dearly has stressed to come and talk to her about that sort of thing and how she would never want me to do "something like that", but it just seems too taboo to bring it up.  

The person I have been surprisingly the most comfortable talking to has been one of my nursing school professors.  She is so non judgemental and understanding.  She pulled me aside one day and just out of the blue asked how I was doing with my friend, that she has been meaning to call me into her office, and if I ever need to talk, feel free to stop by her office.  After about 30 minutes of debating to myself, I did.  We talked about my friend.   But there is something deep down I couldn't tell her.  I think his death bothers me not just because I lost a friend, but it was someone who I never would have thought of committing suicide.  It gives it a sort of legitimacy.  All of a sudden what I was thinking about had a real concrete example.  She gave me the number of the counseling center, but I have to drive 60 miles to get to it since I am not based on my school's main campus.  Because she is so comforting and understanding, I want to just go in and tell my professor I have frequent thoughts of suicide--but am really afraid of the consequences.  Will I be brought to a psych ward?  Will others find out?  Will I be deemed 'Psychologically unstable", and can't go to clinicals?

Before leaving her office she said she was going to file a BIT report, (Behavior Intervention Team) but from my last college we used them exclusively for high risk students.  So I think she has an idea anyway, but I don't know.  That was nearly two weeks ago--and I haven't heard anything else.

What I am saying is, I don't know who or how to talk to anyone, I don't know if I want to kill myself, I just would rather not be alive I guess.  I am afraid of the consequences of talking to someone.  I thought all this would subside after a week or two but it just has gotten worse and worse.

Thanks for those who stuck around.
