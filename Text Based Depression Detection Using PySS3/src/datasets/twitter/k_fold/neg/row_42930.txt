I donâ€™t belong here.

Thereâ€™s always been something very wrong with me. I canâ€™t ever begin to be able to describe it to anybody. I hate this body and I hate how I keep on trying to pretend like I belong here. Iâ€™m just a fucking idiot and I never should have survived anything. Iâ€™m so stupid and alien in whatever the fuck this world is , I disappoint everybody because I can only play therapist and give them all my attention for so long. God i fucking wish I didnâ€™t have to come here and spill this, I wish I could be sitting with a loved one right now. Thatâ€™s not even possible because my guilt would eat me up and make me everything worse.. itâ€™s pathetic. Iâ€™ll keep on dragging myself along until nobody is left to want me alive anymore. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s fucking wrong with me iâ€™m just so fucked up, Iâ€™m done trying to keep on believing that iâ€™ll get better.
