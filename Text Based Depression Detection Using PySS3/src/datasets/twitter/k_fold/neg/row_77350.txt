I feel like shit thats been shit onIv been depressed for the past couple of years even on snti-depressants. Im too much of a pussy to kill myself which makes me even more depressed. I know i have so much to live for; i got into one of the best universities in the world, yet i still feel like absolute shit. My ex broke up with me 6 months ago and since then i haven't even hooked up with another girl even though i've tried.My ex was the only girl ive hooked up with and im 18 which is sad as fuck but whatever. Ive really been interested in this girl and i thought we had something but she completely led me on and now i just feel like theres no hope. i dont know if its because of my substandard looks or because im missing out on some important attitude factor (which im pretty sure im not).
