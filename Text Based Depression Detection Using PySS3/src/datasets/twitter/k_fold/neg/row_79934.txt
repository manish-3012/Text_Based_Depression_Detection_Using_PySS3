I can now say I have honestly tried it all, nothing has helped.Its been about 10 years now. I have tried it all, I train 6 days a week, I'm probably objectively in great shape, I have an (albeit unsupportive) girlfriend. I'm getting proficient in a second language like I've always wanted to, went back to college like I always wanted to, learning to play an instrument like I've always wanted to. None of it helps, none of it matters. For years I sat at home and wollowed in self-pity but the last fours years I feel I've honestly given life my best shot, but at the end of it all after all the progress in all the areas I've always wanted to, it adds up to shit because I still hate everything about myself. I've seen councillors too, I don't do drugs and drink rarely, so substance abuse isn't a contributing factor. I don't see any more alternatives anymore. I think I can go ahead now and pass on knowing I've given life a genuine attempt and just couldn't hack it. There's some therapy in this post but it's temporary. I don't know dudes.
