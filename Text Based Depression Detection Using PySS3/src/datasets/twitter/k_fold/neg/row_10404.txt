hi, Iâ€™m a 13 year old male who tried to kill himself on christmas eve.Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a long time.. Iâ€™ve done crisis therapy, talked to family and friends, Iâ€™ve done basically everything that Iâ€™m supposed to do that helps other than antidepressants. but anyways, Iâ€™ve been sad for many reasons, family deaths, animals deaths, my parents divorce, my grandma remarrying to a man no one but her really likes (yes I am supportive and glad he makes her happy). but it was my auntâ€™s death that truly pushed my towards my first suicidal thought. I donâ€™t understand why it was hers because I was never really close with her.. but it hurt me, a lot. the day after I found out I cut my forearm once, then over and over, I sat there for awhile cutting. the best part is that no one ever found out until just now. this kept on about once a week for awhile until I slowly drifted away from this and became healthy again. a month or so later and about 2-3 ended relationships , I was back to cutting. I was cutting on a daily now. and this continued until about the beginning of December, when I thought that I should kill my self. and I could never get the nerves . but on christmas eve my brother slept in my moms room and I was all alone. i slit what I thought was my wrist in the dark and when I felt blood trickle out I thought itâ€™d been done. and I closed my eyes and.. let it happen.. before I knew it my eyes were open again.. and other than missing  blood and cuts a lot lower than my wrist was, I was fine and alive.. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever cried so much.. I cleaned my sheets and blanket , and did some home self aid. I wore a hoody or something to cover my arms. Iâ€™m now dating someone and itâ€™s me one month in two days. Iâ€™m happy and I havenâ€™t thought of suicide since only because of that pain I felt. thank you for your time.. but if you take one thing away from this itâ€™s that anything can be behind a smile. I was suicidal for a month and no one knew it. I kept up a fake smile and kept on moving. watch out for your friends, you never know what their smile has been through.
