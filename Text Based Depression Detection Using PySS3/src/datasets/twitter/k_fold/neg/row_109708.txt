...why do we keep trying? just to suffer?

my thoughts are bad. i am bad. what i want is bad. all i do is worry people. the people that used to love me. there is nothing left here for me. i just want it to be effective when i do it. no hesitation. 

wouldnt it be nicer if i just wasnt a problem any more
