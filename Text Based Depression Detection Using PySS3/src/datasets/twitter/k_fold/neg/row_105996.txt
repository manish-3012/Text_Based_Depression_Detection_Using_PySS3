I want to do it, but I'm scared.I'm scared of leaving my cat behind. I'm scared of what this will do to my family. I just don't want to be alive anymore. I'm tired of life passing me by. I'm tired of girls who say they want to spend the rest of their life with me leave suddenly. I'm tired of not having friends here. 

I wanted to marry her. I wanted to fly her to new york and propose to her. I wanted to start my life together with her. I wanted to have children.  

I just want out. Most won't even know I'm gone. I'm a shit person that doesn't deserve to live any longer.
