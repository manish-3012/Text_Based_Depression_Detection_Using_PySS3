Last rent, I'm doneI'm done. I can't and don't want to live anymore.
My mental health is broken beyond repair.
I hate myself in every way, I'm a fat ugly piece of shit.
I tried to change, to get better but I can't. There is no future for me. Won't have children due to hereditary disease, can't risk to pass it on someone other. No supportive family, and no real friends. Last night I kinda lost the only 2 people in my life who I cared for. People I have known for 20(!) and 14 years, people who I thought I could trust, but no. They lied six months to my face, I don't think I cant trust another human ever again. I'm 26 and I don't see a point in even living for just one more second. University declined me, no job, no hobby, nothing brings me joy anymore. I feel betrayed by life itself and now I can't even watch, listen or read anything, because every thing reminds me of my "bestfriend" and I hurts, 20 fucking years thrown away for a quick fuck. I can't sleep more than 4 hours, and even those four are filled with nightmares. I can't keep going. Startet to cut my legs again so I can feel something for a short moment other than like a giant piece of shit.

I finished my farewell letters
My last will is ready too
My dogs are taken care of
And I got the charcoal, note for potential people on the door, no one other needs to be harmed, I slimpy want it to end

Why live a life without any hope

Farewell
