Back AgainJust coming back again to vent to a wall real quick. 

My depression has built so much anger inside me that Iâ€™m quick to snap at people and assume they have the worst of intentions. I get irritated easily. I get upset easily.

Iâ€™ve been arguing with my boyfriend constantly lately. Mostly about religion. Itâ€™s made me feel that we might not be that compatible after all.

I canâ€™t even muster to say sorry now, I just want to run and hide. 

Iâ€™m even more lazy and have a severe lack of motivation now. I half ass homework, Iâ€™m at the point where I do bare minimum because I donâ€™t have the energy. Iâ€™m even like this with art now, something I used to enjoy I now see as a boring time consuming chore. 

A lot of the time I wish I was dead. Thereâ€™s too much dark in my life
