I watched my dreams die in front of me and now I'm left with no hope for the future.I was training to become a pilot. I had wanted to be a pilot since I was very young, too young to even understand what a job was. I just knew that I wanted to fly. I had 150+ hours under my belt and was very nearly there. I literally was one checkride away from being a licensed pilot. A few days ago, I was diagnosed with a medical condition that prohibits me from acquiring a pilots license, and I realized then that my dreams were dead. Not postponed or delayed, dead. 

Flying was my passion. It was what I lived for. I wanted to make a career out of it. I had been going to college and taking classes relevant to flying for a living, and I have invested a massive amount of time and money in becoming a pilot. The goal of becoming a pilot was what provided me with the hope and motivation to get out of bed in the morning even when all other things in my life were falling apart, and now it's gone. I've been suicidal and depressed before, for other reasons, but now I truly feel like I have nothing left to live for. I don't have a girlfriend, I don't have a good job, I don't have a loving and caring family, and I don't have any friends, just acquaintances. I'm fat and damaged, and nobody wants to be around me for more than a few minutes. I've got nothing to fall back on. I've got nothing left.
