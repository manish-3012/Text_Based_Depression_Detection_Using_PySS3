as much as i tried to fight and reinvent myself i still wish to diecouple months ago, after things went (even more) south in my life, i finally gave up. i felt that i'm too tired to keep on fighting and i can finally give in to my life long depression. you won. i mastered a plan, set everything. then something went wrong with the plan and i took it as life's freaking sign that maybe i shall give it one final push. as i still felt at that point i'm great danger to myself i sought help from only person i had left in my life - only to be told he wants nothing to do with me.  


i went to therapy. not much of a help. yeah, yeah, i can see in better life just how much was my childhood fucked up, how it screwed me up for life and all that. but i'm still worthless, unloveable and in pain. i just want this to be over with.
