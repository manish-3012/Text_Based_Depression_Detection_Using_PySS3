Lost 4 jobs and fiancÃ© due to bipolar, now a sex workerFemale, 28 years old. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 25, upon which news my boyfriend (also fiancÃ©) of seven years left me. 

Since then Iâ€™ve been prescribed various meds and can just about hold down a basic office job before the mania flares up and I lose my job over making admin mistakes. Took legal action against a previous employer but it has happened since then - mental health care around here isnâ€™t great. 

So Iâ€™ve turned to sex work this year, working as a prostitute to pay rent. Iâ€™m from a poor family and canâ€™t live with any of them.

It was ok for a while but recently to pay rent I had to see three guys in one day and ended up feeling like a piece of meat.

Iâ€™m just so tired of it all. I miss my fiancÃ© and the life I could have had if this illness had been under control earlier.
