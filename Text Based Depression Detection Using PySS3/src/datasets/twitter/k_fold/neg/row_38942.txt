I donâ€™t see it getting any betterIâ€™m 20 years old and an alcoholic, I donâ€™t want to talk to my friends I know theyâ€™ll be better off without me. A few years back I slept with my brothers friend while I was drunk and I think I told him the other night but I canâ€™t remember and itâ€™s giving me really bad anxiety. 
I donâ€™t like being sober and I donâ€™t like being alive. I want it to be over so bad, but my dad died in January and Iâ€™ve been only alive because I donâ€™t want to put more shit on my mum. I donâ€™t see any future and leaving the house seems pointless. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore dying seems like the only way out I canâ€™t keep living like this, every time I go to therapy I leave most of what Iâ€™m going through out because I donâ€™t wanna be a burden to anyone. I DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
