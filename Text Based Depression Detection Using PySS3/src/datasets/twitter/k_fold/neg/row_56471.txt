SHould I give out my suicide letters?I've thought about it for a long time running now. I've thought through all the different ways of killing myself without physically hurting other people and without leaving a mess all over everything. I also know that I don't want to wake up in a hospital with multiple organ failures due to over dosing on OTC drugs. During the time that I thouhgt about killing myself I wrote a lot of letters. For family and friends and my girlfriend at the time. 

I AM BETTER now. I still held on to those letters. My friends knew I was seeing someone for my depression. My family tried to convince me not to get help and that "it could be worse" or "don't be so selfish". My girlfriend well she's my ex now, didn't know.  Should I hand out those letters? Or do I toss them?
