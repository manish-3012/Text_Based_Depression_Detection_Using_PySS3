7 or 8 daysIn 7 or 8 days I'll have been single for a year. Feb 2nds the date. Just idk whether or not January has 30 or 31 days. My life turned to shit Feb 2nd. 2 days before was the happiest day of my life. Then I found out I was being cheated on. Then I didn't get accepted to colleges. I got into a shitty job I hate. I developed many substance addictions. I lost friends as they moved on. I stopped being able to meet new people. I became a shell of what I once was. I'm not me anymore. 

In July I said if I was single for a year (Feb 2nd) I'd end it. I guess it's crunch time now. Only 7 or 8 days left. But i doubt anything will go right in that time. Guess I'll drive really fast into a tree. My neon won't save me from shit. Idk why I felt like posting. Just wanted to vent. It was great while it lasted. To bad it won't be anymore. Thanks y'all. Reddit has been fun
