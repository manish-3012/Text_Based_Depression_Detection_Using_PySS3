Planning on killing myself tonightIâ€™m leaving this here as a place to put down some of my final thoughts. Iâ€™ve enjoyed very little of my life, Iâ€™m 20 soon turning 21 and I have no periods of my life that I look back fondly on. Iâ€™m currently attending college which I find miserable for a degree I hate but my father insists I get. 
       I spent my high school years either being alone, working or helping my mother with my grandfather. I donâ€™t regret helping my mother, but I do regret everything else. My mother is an alcoholic, sheâ€™s better now but in the past living with her was a complete nightmare. I have 2 sisters, one which I was never close too, and another who I was but donâ€™t speak to anymore because she went away to college and made it very clear she was never returning here. I donâ€™t blame her, but I do resent her for leaving her younger brother alone to deal with our mother and everything else.
      I was bullied very badly in school and never received any help, Iâ€™m surprised I didnâ€™t kill myself back then. Thinking about it now I wish I had. There is no better for me, thereâ€™s no light at the end of the tunnel. Iâ€™m going to take my fathers heart and diabetes medication tonight and hope I never wake up. 
  Thank you if you read this.
