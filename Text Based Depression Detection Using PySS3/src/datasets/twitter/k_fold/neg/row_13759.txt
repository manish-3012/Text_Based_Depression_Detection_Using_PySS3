My friend (history of depression) just said some really scary things. Help!She's currently sitting with a mutual friend who knows what's going on, and knows more about her history than I do.

Yesterday, she told me about a very vivid dream she'd had the night before about committing suicide. I was really concerned, but talked to her about it a lot, and she seemed to be doing much better by the end of it.

Last night, she had it again. When she got up she took a triple dose of the anti-anxiety meds she is on and followed it with several shots of alcohol. 

Talking to her today (she was crying for most of it), she started saying things like "well it's easy to make it all go away", etc.

Doesn't help that one of her other friends told her to "suck it up", and that she was just being dramatic. I did my best to repair that, but I don't know how much I helped.

What the hell do I do?!? I read one article over in SWResources, is there any more stuff like that?
