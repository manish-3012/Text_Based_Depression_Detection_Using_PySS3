I hate people who smileI don't know how others do it but I started Hating anyone who is smiling or happy or even a bit optimistic about the future. 

I don't know how they do it. I can't even say with certainty that I could wake up tomorrow and get through with it without thinking of killing myself by jumping off a building. 

Anyone who looks like they are enjoying life just makes me hate them by default and makes me even more miserable inside. 
The number of times I felt like I don't deserve to live because I can't even find a single thing to be happy or content with is too fucking high. 
I am not even sure how much long I can take it before I snap. 
Can someone help me? I don't want to be the asshole who ruins others mood,I don't want to hurt anyone else.
