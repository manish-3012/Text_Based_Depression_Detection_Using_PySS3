Whatâ€™s the point anymore.For the past couple of months  I had been dealing with depression, Iâ€™m a super closed person I have no real friends that I talk to share my feelings with and for the past couple of weeks my mom and dad have been arguing a lot. And I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore i used to listen to music to get my mind of everything. Thereâ€™s no point anymore I never do anything I just make things worse.
