For those of you who might be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.How do you all create meaning in your life when nothing brings you joy? None of the things that used to interest me do, and forcing myself to do them just makes me more sad. When I have the energy to get out of bed and try to think of something other than suicide, I come up short.

I just. Donâ€™t. Care. Anymore. I want to die. Luckily itâ€™s some days and not others. I try to remember that. I use a mood app to track my ups and downs.

I am bored of distraction and want to create a more meaningful life.
