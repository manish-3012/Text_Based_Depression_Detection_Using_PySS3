Just wanted to share my story, not sure if anyone will read it but (:I grew up in a pretty broken home. Just like a plot of some show or movie: off &amp; on alcoholic mother &amp; a father with one hell of a temper. Iâ€™m the only child so Iâ€™ve walked through hell pretty much alone. My mom has manipulated me countless times throughout my life, I see through it now. I recently learned sheâ€™s done whatâ€™s called â€˜parental alienation.â€™ She used to treat me as if I was her therapist. I put up with it because I was afraid if I didnâ€™t, sheâ€™d turn to alcohol like she has many times before. Sheâ€™s an entirely different person when she drinks; I donâ€™t know the woman she turns into. Iâ€™ve always said that even though my parents are still alive, I know somewhat what it feels like to lose them. Iâ€™ve woken up to violent yelling &amp; screaming countless times throughout my life. So many times they havenâ€™t considered my utter existence. Iâ€™m covered in scars from self harm. Thighs, hips, arms are completely covered in slashes. My parents didnâ€™t know what they were doin when they had me &amp; I cut them slack because I knew I was their first kid. But damn man, thereâ€™s only so much a kid can take. Iâ€™m 17 now. A few months back I moved in with my grandma because things were so bad at home. I stayed there for a few months &amp; recently moved back home. Things are quiet for now, but the damage is done. They like to blind themselves, play pretend in order to sleep at night. I got diagnosed with ptsd from what theyâ€™ve put me through. When I run out of energy to keep my guard &amp; fake happy face up, they act like thereâ€™s something wrong with me and Iâ€™m supposed to fix it &amp; be fine. I donâ€™t think I can fight anymore. Derealization has really gotten its grip on my mind. I have almost every symptom of psychosis, but of course Iâ€™m not gonna self diagnose. I just donâ€™t know what explains how Iâ€™ve been feeling. Iâ€™ve never felt like this before &amp; I want to make it stop. Iâ€™m constantly prepared for war. The smallest things have turned to screaming matches that last for days, weeks, a month at the longest. The screaming fest that caused me to leave lasted an entire month &amp; started over some shit that never should have even caused an argument in the first place. Iâ€™m pretty sure I have 2 fractured knuckles &amp; 2 broken toes from that experience. I hit walls in order to cope. Things have gotten physical between them &amp; they fail to realize what that does to a kid whoâ€™s been put through things they never should have to go through. The damage is done. They went to jail for a few days when I was 6. I donâ€™t remember nearly anything from that period of my life (and many other years, just gone, faded to black nothingness) because of the trauma. I remember one thing about the day they were locked up. I was bein carried on someoneâ€™s shoulders &amp; looking down at my orange fur-real-friend cat. That cat was the tiny bit of light in my dark mind. Now things are different, Iâ€™m numb to it all. It doesnâ€™t hurt anymore. Iâ€™m just angry. I didnâ€™t ask to be put into this shit, damaged this way &amp; have my issues looked down on. They couldâ€™ve grown the fuck up &amp; realized all this drama was bullshit because they had a child to care for. But nah, I canâ€™t change the past &amp; neither can they. As a result of all the shit Iâ€™ve been through, Iâ€™ve grown into a cold hearted person that I hate. Iâ€™m emotionally detached from just about everything in order to avoid pain. Iâ€™m not the person I used to be. I no longer have any hope for myself. Iâ€™m ready to fly &amp; be free, escape this hellhole we call home.
