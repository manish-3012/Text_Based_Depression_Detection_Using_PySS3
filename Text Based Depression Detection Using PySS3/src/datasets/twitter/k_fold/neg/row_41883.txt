I am trash that must die.It's not working out with my roommate. They have OCD and my cleaning routine isn't up to par. I got depressed and got even worse. Last week they told me I have thirty days to find a new place. I don't want to go, but they already have someone lined up to take my place. I'm disposable garbage. Not worth keeping around. Trash. If I fight them I'll just be making a bad situation worse. I have no control over my life. 

Now I get to move back in with my Dad whose ashamed to have me. I have no skills, barely an education. I'm 27 years old and transgender. Why should you give a shit whether I live or die? Please give me a good reason that someone like myself who has no agency (I have CPTSD) should continue to live?
