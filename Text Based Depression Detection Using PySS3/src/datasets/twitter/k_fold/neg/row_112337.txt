Am such a failure, I even fail my suicide attemptsOne thing ive noticed about myself is that am not mentally agile. I sometimes forget things, I get confused, and retaining things that i have read ( for exams) is a problem. I used to get bad grades in high school math ( I one time scored 0% tbh lmao) This academic inadequacy could not even be cured by swotting, divine intervention requests and consuming margarine with Omega III. I tried to rectify this by playing mind games like chess, sudoku, crosswords  and reading widely... but i dont think am there yet. Good thing is that I have good social skills and my general knowledge is substantial. My dad low key knows that i am quite a dunderhead and reprimands me for this. He always complains about how he wasted money for me to repeat school and still get shitty grades yet I was clearly burning the midnight oil. He took me to college where I dropped an IT course that was difficult for me, I had to change it. It is really embarrassing to confess that you are kinda dumb... but not too dumb to realise that I am like Sisyphus, and it is impossible  for Sisyphus to be happy in the practical sense. That's why I always want to strangle myself but Lo! this fucking survival instinct in me is a bitch.
