Nothing to live forI'm a 16 year old girl and have been having these thoughts since I've been in 6th grade. They've only been getting worse. My life is nothing how I imagined it would be at this stage.  The reason I'm writing this is because I just had a huge crying fit in the bathroom. It's my last day on vacation and I don't want to go home to my boring life. I'm super lonely and always mess up my chances of making new friends. I can't seem to make any friends at my actual school too. 

I have nothing to look forward to after this trip is over. I kept telling myself if I could just make it to this point it'd would maybe get better but I'm dreading when it's over. I have nothing to look forward to now. I'm losing hope. I want to feel an emotion other than sadness, anger, guilt, and regret. I want to feel normal. I never thought I would actually try to do it because I've always been too scared to do so but I don't know anything anymore.
