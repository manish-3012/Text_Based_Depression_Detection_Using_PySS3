PLEASE HELP: I Want to know what is happening!This literally just happened.  Fuck

Found sister on the ground crying - apparently been there for an hour and a half.  Had muscle stiffness in the left arm, where 5 small cuts were perpendicular to the arm itself.  Minor blood. 
 Could feel toes, had muscle weakness.  Her pulse was , I guess, 110.  I could not find it well even though I've had training to take pulse.  Cut arm was very cold.  Other extremities were less so, but still colder than normal.

She's had some rough times and a friend that cut often.  Yesterday, her friend had cut and showed it to my sister.  My sister, I think, also had some anxiety and depression that she hid.  Decreased appetite and socializing weeks before this.  I've had some rough time too - almost cut/killed myself - but I never actually did it.  Holy shit

I don't know.  Just please, someone tell me what is happened.  She said she didn't drink anything, even though statistics say OD is a favorite among females.  Couldn't find the cutting device.

Does anyone know what she did.  I think I know why, I just know how.  What can I do to help?  Am I a bad brother?

Fuck.

[edit]  Thank you all, you don't know how much this means to me
