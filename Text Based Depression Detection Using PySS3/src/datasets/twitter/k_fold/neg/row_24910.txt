I feel stuckIdk if I want to feel better. Thereâ€™s something about feeling sad/bad that feels familiar and comforting. My parents see me as a mentally disturbed idiot thatâ€™s nothing more than a burden. They feel obliged to â€˜make me feel betterâ€™ (not out of guilt or realization, out of fear that people they know will find out how messed up our family is) so theyâ€™re bringing me to social workers, even though theyâ€™re the ones that made me feel this way. Iâ€™ve lost hope on feeling better. There isnâ€™t really anything to look forward to. I guess Iâ€™ll just wait until Iâ€™m ready to go through.
