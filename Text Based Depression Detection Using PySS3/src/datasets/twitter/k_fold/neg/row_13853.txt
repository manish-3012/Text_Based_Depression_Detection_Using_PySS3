I'm just really, really tired.I've been depressed for about 6 years now. My birthday is coming up in about two months, but I dont think I'll make it to 20. I'm just exausted. I've been physically abused, sexually abused and mentally abused for so long that I don't see any reason to live anymore, I'm exausted. My mother has BPD and living with her is so hard, her comments are really hurtful, but I don't have anywhere else to go. My father isn't really present, but he's been trying to be closer to me after I've tried to overdose about 3 weeks ago. I've dropped out of college two times alredy, currently unemployed and I feel like I'm failing at life. Everyone has it kinda figured out but me. Also, my boyfriend left me today after I tried to stand up for myself and tell him that some of his actions hurt me. I was hoping to work on this problem to make our relationship go but he didn't want to compromise at all and would rather let me go than try to work on the issue. 
I'm just tired of trying, I can't keep going and I really want to rest. I can't handle the pain of existing anymore.
