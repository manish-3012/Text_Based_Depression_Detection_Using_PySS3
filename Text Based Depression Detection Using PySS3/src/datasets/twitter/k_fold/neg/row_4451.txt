In America, if you are not inherently attractive or talented you are only worth your social status and how much cash is in your pocketIn other words no one gives a shit about me. If only I could afford to have a life. I probably will kill myself before the end of the year. Money CAN buy happiness. There are studies that you need a 6 figure income to enjoy living in America. I don't even want that I just need a 5 figure yearly income. I wish I was mentally stable enough to work. I wish I never was put on SSI. I wish I could afford to have a life and a fucking identity.
