22 hour countdownI am tiered, I am sick of everything. All is lost, I am done fighting
I am no Saint, I am a Human so I think. So why do I feel like Garbage.
Mistakes I made changed who I am to day. Yet I'm still falling. 
Reminders still be had of past mistakes I made make me mad 
Our sons you must take. because of these mistakes., more falling.
I never got to move on, you did so easily. Fuck you Charly. 
I lost everything I had, now my boy you must add. more and more falling
This mountain only has one more cliff, and I started at the peak. 
Soon there will be no more falling as in the rocks I will land. 
6 feet in the ground, no one can find me now. 

I have nothing more to give. I am tiered from this travil down. 
I want to close my eyes, I want to take that eternal rest. 
I cant krep holding on to this last branch much longer. 

Finally a choice I get to make, 
no one here to tell me how. 
I must do it now. 

Ohh wait, this is my last 24 hour count down. 

Deep rest or internal conflict. One of these is my evil fait. 

seems an easy choice to make. 

Maybe my story will be told first it must unfold, 
The guy that gave the world one 24 hour last call be for the show.
