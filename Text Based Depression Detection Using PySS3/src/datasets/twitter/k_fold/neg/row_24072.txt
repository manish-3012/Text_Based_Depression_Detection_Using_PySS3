Want to Kill Myself TonightI'm 26 and living with my parents. I have crippling anxiety and depression and basically no self-esteem. I don't have a single real life friend and haven't gone anywhere with anyone but my parents in probably 4+ years. I have a job, but can't connect with the people there and will probably lose it soon because I feel no motivation and don't really care. I have two online friends, but they've been growing increasingly busy, so I'm nearly totally isolated at this point.

My parents are verbally abusive. They've never been physically abusive, but they constantly scream at me. I could probably afford an apartment, but I'm afraid of being alone.

I just don't care. If I had my choice, I'd be locked in my room with some form of entertainment, talking to no one for the rest of my life.

I'm posting this because I'm horribly scared of dying and maybe putting pen to paper will help me drum up some courage. I'm an atheist that wishes religion were real. My deepest fear is non-existance, and I'm utterly scared of pain, so despite considering suicide for most of my life, I just haven't gone through with it.

I just want out. I've been through years of therapy from multiple different therapists as my parents tried to "fix me". Nothing worked. I lost contact with my latest therapist during the beginning of the pandemic due me missing a couple sessions and spiraling due to guilt.

I feel so much guilt. I know my mother hates me, hates being stuck with me. She hates the home we live in and feels her true home was stolen from her by my father. She wants to move to the country, but is stuck here as I can't due to work and mental health. She constantly talks to me about how much she hates it here and how badly she wants out. The guilt is crushing. 

In the end I don't just feel that there is no hope, I know that there is no hope on a rational, intellectual level. There's nothing for me to do. Nowhere for me to go.
