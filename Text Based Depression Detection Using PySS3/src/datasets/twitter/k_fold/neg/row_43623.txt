Im killing myself tonight any questions?i have had severe depression for many years, howvever I never had a suicidal thought until I was put on my first antidepressant (zoloft), a year and a half ago. since then my depression has gone to thinking about suicide every day. i am doing great in college (about to graduate with above 3.8 but this constant feeling of anxiety and depression has made life not worth it.
