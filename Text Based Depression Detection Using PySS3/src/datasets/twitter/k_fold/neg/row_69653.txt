I wasn't made for this worldAll I am is a useless free loader that let's everyone down. I'm never going to get a job or make anything of myself. I'm a selfish piece of shit that only takes and has nothing to contribute. I don't want to work hard. I don't want to do anything at all. It would be insane for anyone to want to take care of someone like me. I am dead weight. I am a drain on everyone in my life. 

To top it all off I'm a fucking attention seeking slut which makes me doubly worthless. I'm a terrible person and a deplorable leech on society. People should honestly celebrate when I die because it's a huge gain for all parties.
