I have no friends leftI'm halfway in grade 11 at 17 years old, my second to last year of high school and I realized this. Everything about my life feels off. I try talking to people and fitting in, but it is extremely hard for me. Everyone else around me is going to parties and having so much fun doing things together, having such close friendships that it breaks me a inside. I had 2 friends I loved being with but they moved away over a year anda half ago, and making progress in forming new ones feels impossible. I know a handful people at my school, but to them I'll always look as the overweight guy who has trouble socializing while they have extremely close friends to turn to. I have tried working out to gain confidence but I just don't have any motivation at all in me. I know this seems a bit whiny or unclear but I feel terrible inside. I have been at my school for 10 years, longer than anyone else, and nobody will ever remember who I am. I wanted these to be the best years of my life before everything got serious with afult responsibilities but it feels like everything got turned upside down. I started caring less and less about myself, have trouble sleeping at night and find returning to school in the morning terrifying. I keep getting suicidal thoughts creeping up on me when I'm at home alone and I'm scared one day I'll act out on them. I can count on one hand the number of times I have been outside on weekends with people who aren't my family and it hurts. Every weekend is spent alone at home. I don't think I can lead a life of being alone and never being able to let out my emotions to anyone. I'm sorry if this isn't as serious as other posts here but I honestly have nowhere else to vent and let this out.
