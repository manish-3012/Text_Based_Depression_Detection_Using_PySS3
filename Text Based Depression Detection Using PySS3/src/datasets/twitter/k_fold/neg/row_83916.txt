Girl on a Facebook group admitted to setting a date for her suicide, need advice on how to proceed.I am in a Facebook group dedicated to people talking about the quirks of their mental illnesses. Normally it is just little neurotic things, but a girl made a post today about how she set her suicide date two weeks from today. The first thing I did was message the admin of the group to get her advice on what to do, but she was unsure as well. Next, I went to the girls Facebook page to see if I could find any family members of hers I could talk to so that they could get her the help she needed, but her friends list is set to private. Does anyone have any advice on how I should proceed here???? I have no crisis counseling and can't deal with it personally but I need to make sure this girl gets the help she needs.
