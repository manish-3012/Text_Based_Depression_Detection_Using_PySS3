Now my parents knowA couple of weeks ago I told my sister that I had been struggling with heavy suicidal thoughts, and then she told my parents. I didn't swear her to secrecy or anything, but now I'm regretting opening up, because my family was already worried about me, and now they're even more worried. All opening up did was make everyone's distress worse when I could have just kept it to myself. I can't help feeling it was a big mistake, even though I know they care about me.
