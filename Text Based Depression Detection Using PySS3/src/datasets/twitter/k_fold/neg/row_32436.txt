I had to say this(sorry for english it isn't my native language) I wasn't talking to anyone about this i was alone with this. So when school's were open i was always alone because everyone in my class are bullying my until some guy just started talking to me and said these things "ignore them" "they are Pieces of shit" and he was talking with me about my hobbies and other stuff. so I thought i can trust on him (i can start trusting people very fast) so i said to him that i want to kill myself and walked fast home on the next day everyone was laughing at me and my "friend" was also laughing i was scared of PE because they are always beating me. PE starred they dragged me to toilet and like always they were kicking my belly and head, he was watching the guy i was talking with someone said "oh you want to kill yourself? It would be great" i started panicking until i passed out, teacher said my "friends" told about me passing out
I was silent about everything because i was scared of them i said "thanks" when i got to home i grabbed random pills and ate them after 2 hours i got dizzy and got in coma, doctor said "you are lucky you lived"
I said "lucky... Yea..." I was in coma for 2 months I didn't told anyone about this to this day
