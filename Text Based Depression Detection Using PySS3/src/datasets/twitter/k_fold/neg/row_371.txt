wish I was brave enough to cut my wrists againBeen feeling awful all day slept for hours got up went back to bed woke up at 5pm. Online friend who is my only friend rings me at 11pm shouts at me for being depressed again then hangs up told me ringing me was a mistake. I wish I could just leave this world now.
