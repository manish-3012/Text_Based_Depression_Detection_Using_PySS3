I'm ready to give up.I am so fucking sick of being a part of the 3 person household that has to rely on others for food all year round. I'm so sick of being that kid who has to plan fake answers to "What did you get for Christmas?". 

I'm so sick of listening to every single one of my friends, telling me about all the cool gaming consoles/PCs they received, whilst I'm gonna be lucky to get even a fucking hoodie.  It sucks. It's so god damn stupid. The fact that I'm going to have to deal with this for yet another year hurts so much. 

I don't even have decent fucking family to see during the holidays. I barely know either of my 2 sisters, one of them (23), cares more about getting drunk and having sex every night. Only ever messaging me for her own benefit. The other (22), I haven't seen more than 3 times in the past 2 years, when I only met her 3 years ago. I've never met my brother(16). I've never had the chance to. I probably never will. Even my friends, they all live on the opposite side of town.

My god. I'm 14. How am I expected to deal with all this? How am I expected to 'just be grateful' for what I have? Yes, I am lucky to have what I do. But by literally everyone I'm surrounded by, this is practically considered poverty. It's not fair. I hate this so much. And it's never going to get better. I've been told that shit for well over 4 years.
