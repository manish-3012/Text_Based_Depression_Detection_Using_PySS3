I don't want this pain anymoreI have bipolar depression and meds aren't working. I tried to enroll in an outpatient program and they aren't getting back with me. 
I'm overweight. I'm failing college. I have no money. I have a huge amount of debt. I have no friends. I'm a burden to my husband. I can't trust my parents. My sister is a bitch to me. I can't get out of bed. 

The only comfort I have is that I still have the choice of making all of the pain go away instantly, albeit permanently. This is what I've been reduced to.
