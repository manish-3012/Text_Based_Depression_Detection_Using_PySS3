Sometimes I want to make almost everyone hate meI want to stop helping most people, I want to take my old dream and shatter it, fully abandoning it in the process.

Yes, I know it's selfish and hypocritical, doing this because almost no-one reciprocated me in my entire life... But, if I were to do so, I would be 100% sincere and no longer condescending as well.

For once, not enduring insults, rejection, indifference, pity and fake and/or empty words or promises of friendship... But instead fighting back.

Yet that would confirm that I'm a faker... In a video, a guy said that if you were a good person, but because it didn't pay off you became bitter and angry, lashing out at others, it would mean that you never were a good person, but instead, you only acted like that because you expected a reward.

That's my worst fear... If I almost never did a single selfless act in my entire life for someone else, but instead, most of them were just to get a benefit for myself... Then it would mean I'm a complete fake and I would get a mental breakdown...
