I'm turning out to be not as strong as I thought I am, please help, I want someone to talk toI come from a third world country were depression was never considered a real illness so i grew up to believe that depression is for pussies, but now that my life is falling over my head I think otherwise. It all started when I traveled abroad to continue my studies after highschool, my dad has always expected perfection of me and when I fail instead of pulling me up he would put salt on the wound and starts blaming me for what I did wrong, it all started last fall when the 
First semester of my university began, since im a foreigner I didnt speak the Local language fluently so it was hard to make friends I tried socializing but they just didnt want to have to translate if i didnt understand so I just went with it and made zero friends, I was alone, I would go to the uni everymorning and coming back in the evening without talking to anyone and my dad would call me every 2 weeks to ask how my Studies are going and keep telling me that he's expecting perfection and then hangs up and my mom would call me every 5 days or so just to make sure I was doing my laundry and eating healthy, but I was kinda ok with being lonley, I was always lonley even in highschool, so I thought it wouldn't bother me here in a Foreign country were I know absolutley no one, but then it started to get shittier, now im failing my engineering classes almost all of them and I dont have the nerves to tell my father and because I was really busy studying I have accidentally missed a few chores around the flatshare where i Iive and now they're kicking me out even tho I apologized and did all of my chores, and I still didnt tell anyone about it because I dont think anybody really cares, I keep watching motivational videos online to keep my head up but the harder im trying to keep myself from getting down the harder it gets to sleep every night, and when I thought shit can never get worse, my bike was stolen yesterday which I work on as as Delivery boy, so now my main source of income is cutoff, so in about less than a month I'll on the street with no job, no money, no where to live and worse of all since im failing my uni I'm also gonna get kicked out of it.
I have no one to talk to, I'm really tired, I dont wanna do this anymore, its really hard, I dont know what to do and it hurts so bad to think all of your life that if you consider suicide then you are a soft pussy, but then later on you actually consider it for real, I created this Account just now to write this because the only person who cares about me is my little brother and I dont want him to see how I feel on my main acc so he wont get worried.

Thanks alot for reading this, I hope you will have a wonderful weekend.
