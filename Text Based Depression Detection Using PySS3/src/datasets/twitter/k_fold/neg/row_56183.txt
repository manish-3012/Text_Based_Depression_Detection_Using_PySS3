I'm worthlessLately I just feel like there's no point to life. Today is my senior year field day where I'm supposed to have fun competing against other kids in my class, but so far I've spent that time secluded crying my eyes out. I just feel like I'm not worth anyone's time. I'm someone who doesn't deserve to be happy. Someone who won't find any sort of relief other than to just end my life and not have to deal with the pain I constantly feel.
