the speeding cars and meI'm posting this on my phone as i sit on the side of the highway. The cars are speeding by. IN a moment I am going to walk in front of them. I feel almost peaceful as I say this. It feels better knowing I will feel no more pain. nothing. I am so ready to escape from this life. Pills don't work. Nothing does. He won't ever stop. nothing will get better. I won't even know what hit me. 

EDIT: goodbye
