I need helpI have a gun in my bedroom and I keep thinking of using it. I donâ€™t think I ever would, but then why does it keep showing up into my thoughts? I have PTSD from 13 years of sexual abuse from my dad. I have anxiety and OCD. I had two panic attacks this evening and no friend would pick up the phone. I texted a new friend who is my coworker and now I regret it and think work will be awkward tomorrow. I have a new job I like but Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m not learning fast enough. My coworker says Iâ€™m doing fine but I donâ€™t believe him. I feel stupid for texting him in the first place even though he said he has anxiety and if I ever want to talk I can text him. I shouldnâ€™t have. I canâ€™t keep friends. My best friend she just used me as an ATM and for favors. I stopped it today and ended the friendship. I just feel lost. Depressed. Hungry but too tired to eat. I look at my puppy and cry because I donâ€™t want to leave her if I hurt myself. I scratch my hands instead every time i panic and now I have scars. My hands are ugly. I have a significant other. Heâ€™s at work so I feel like I have nobody right now to turn to. My family forgot my birthday last week; they went to a casino the night of my scheduled dinner and didnâ€™t invite me. A week later my significant others family scheduled a dinner for my birthday and I showed up to a table of 8 and nobody was there, they forgot. I just feel stupid and alone. Every time I have a panic attack I want To dial the suicide hotline but I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t know anymore. I took my anxiety medicine just now. About to eat. Hoping the thoughts go away. Never sure of where this path leads and at what point I need to call the hotline, or keep telling myself to just breathe. I never can calm my self down. Other people help but I have nobody.
