No futureFinals are coming up at my college right now. I have a term paper that was due days ago. I hate college.  I don't trust  any of my friends to do the right thing and I don't want to make new ones. I don't want to drop out because I've spent too much and can't financially recover. I think that I am not motivated to do anything because deep down I think I'm not going to last very long. I don't talk to my parents or siblings anymore and I actively avoid leaving my room. I skip class just because I don't want to see people that I know. I just got a job but have already made up my mind to quit because, once again, this won't help me if I'm gone. I don't ever think about the future and cannot fathom having a real, monotonous, dead end job. I'm smart but I just cannot bring myself to do anything because I see there being no point. In January, I'll be studying abroad in London and already I know it'll be terrible. All of my classmates are perfect, social people and I know that I just can't fit in. The way I see it, if I'm thrown a curveball in the next month, that'll be it.
