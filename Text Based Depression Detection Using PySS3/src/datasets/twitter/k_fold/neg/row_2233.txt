I want to leave this world so badI have given up on this world. Im so sad i dont want to even think about my future cause frankly its lost. Im never going to have a good life. I dont have anyone to talk to at all, the only interaction i get is me just meddeling with other people lifes here on reddit. I think i can give good advice sometimes, but problem is i never ever listen to what i know i would tell someone else. I fucking hate myself and my life so much. I wish it would just end, im not scared of death. Im just scared of the pain. I wish i knew an easy way out, or i could get a gun or deathly dose of drugs. I cant cope anymore. Im so alone and all i want is to be loved and taken care of. But i dont have any of that, im left to myself and i dont care about myself one bit. It fucking sucks to be alive.
