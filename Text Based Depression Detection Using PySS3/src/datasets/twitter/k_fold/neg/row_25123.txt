Eternal AbyssPoem:

Looking limp and pathetic

Not wanting any sympathy 

Too worthless to be apologetic 

Youâ€™ve practiced tying your knot

Even when youâ€™re both open to this and being shot

Downing a bottle of rum 

Makes it easier to go through and succumb 

Filled with every bit of preparation 

Itâ€™s your only worth 

To hang like a decoration 

To those who say they donâ€™t wish any bad 

The news of your absence will bring peace and make them glad 

Those who perceive you as fake 

See meeting you as a mistake 

Set to be gone forever 

Sorry to those that want your head and body to sever 

Ready to eradicate feelings of being a germ 

Itâ€™s time to exit on your own term 

Pushing over the chair 

While thinking back to how you have nothing to share 

Feet off the ground 

Finally able to prevent living to hear another sound  

Dangling from a tall tree

The rope is as sturdy as can be

Flailing like a fish 

This is it 

This is your big wish

Fueled by choking and struggling to gasp 

Failing at every attempt to gain any grasp

Approaching the eternal abyss

After a while you go motionless 

Roses are red 

Simple as said 

Rest In Peace now that youâ€™re dead
