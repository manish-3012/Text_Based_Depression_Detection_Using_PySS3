Iâ€™m so ducking lonelyThe only person I can really trust moved away recently and Iâ€™m noticing that Iâ€™m isolating myself from my friends. I donâ€™t want to do this but I canâ€™t stop. Iâ€™m starting to log out of social media just so I can stop seeing that in left on read and see my friends at parties I was invited to but turned down out of shear anxiety and terror that Iâ€™ll fuck my life up even worse meeting someone who ghosts me. Iâ€™m so scared and tired. I want to change but my body doesnâ€™t let me. I canâ€™t sleep. I canâ€™t think. I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m consciously thinking anymore or if Iâ€™m just going through the motions of everyday life. Anytime I make an effort to make plans with anyone they always find an excuse. Iâ€™ve never wanted to be with someone as much as I want to stay far away from everyone. Iâ€™m breaking. I donâ€™t know if I can keep going on like this. Can someone please fucking help me out of this. Iâ€™m at my last resort.
