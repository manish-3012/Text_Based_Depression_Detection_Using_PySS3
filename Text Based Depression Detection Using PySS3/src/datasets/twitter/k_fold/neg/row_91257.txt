I've been on the edge of suicide for 15 years. Ask me anything.I'm no activist.  I've never manned a suicide helpline.  All of the typical go to things that are supposed to help have failed me. There is still a large chance that I may die by my own hand at some point and I am comfortable with that.  But, I have found a way to think about the situation that always brings me back from the brink.  I'm happy to try to help anyone, whether that be here, in this forum, or through private communication.  That being said, I will NOT "try to stop you".  This life is YOUR life to do with what YOU choose.  If you choose to end it, that is your right by nature.  I simply want to help people struggling with this in any way I can and feel the INDIVIDUAL should get to determine what type of help is given to them.  I hope it goes without saying that I will not judge.  Also, as an FYI, I am new to this group as I just discovered it.  I sincerely hope that discretion and respect are commonplace here.
