Nothing makes senseFuck I feel so stupid and pathetic. If only I could stop falling into this negative feedback loop, obsessive thought cycles. Why the fuck do I have to kill myself? I can't even explain in words how internalized this process is. I shouldn't be living. Everything is all at once and I can't sort it out. I wish I was god.
