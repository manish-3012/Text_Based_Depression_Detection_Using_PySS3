Need an escapeTo start out, here's a bit about me. I have Bipolar disorder and severe anxiety. It's a nasty combo. I've been in treatment (therapy for 4 years and meds for 1) for a while, but I'm slipping. I'm seriously having some bad thoughts.

Things have been getting progressively worse as the years go by. I live in almost constant fear and paranoia. Panic attacks come daily and psychotic episodes are thrown into the mix a few times a week. 

Im a senior in Highschool and all I can think about is how I'll never finish and how behind I am. I think all the time about how lonely I am and how I don't have friends. All of that is my fault though. I've lost most, if not all motivation to get up in the morning, to go to school, make friends, and live a normal life. It's my fault that I'm not working hard enough to help myself. It's my fault that it got to this point. 
I'm about ready to give up. The only thing I think about lately is death and I'm scared.
