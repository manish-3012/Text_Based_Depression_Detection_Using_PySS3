no friends, no life, no motivationI recently moved to a new place and haven't been able to make any friends. I work full time during the day and do schoolwork for my masters full-time at nights and weekends, so I don't even have time to go try and make friends. My old friends from college all have people nearby that they care about and calling them doesn't help anyway - what could they even do from so far away? When i try to talk to my parents about how I feel, thy think I'm just seeking attention, or ask why I don't go see a therapist (which I don't have time or money for). I'm already on sertraline for anxiety, and yea my anxiety is much better, but again what's the point if I don't even have anything to live for? I don't care about my job. I don't care about what I'm getting my master's in (or at least not enough to keep me sticking around alone). I hate how overweight I am and how disgusting I look no matter how long I spend at the gym. I desperately desperately just want someone I can connect with face-to-face. I haven't dated in five years. I feel so lonely and I don't see how life's gonna get any less lonely. So what's even the point? (that's a genuine question i have.)

also if i'm posting in the wrong place feel free to delete this or whatever. I'm not sure how reddit works, i made an account just to post this and see if anyone had any ideas
