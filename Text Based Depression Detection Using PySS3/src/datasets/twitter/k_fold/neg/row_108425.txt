need advice ðŸ˜”okay guys i need some honest advice on what to do with my life. iâ€™m 17 and about to be 18 in a month and a senior and everything is just so crazy right now with the pandemic and growing up. i really canâ€™t blame that because iâ€™ve adjusted to it but honestly hereâ€™s what has been bothering me; for a really long time i struggled with self esteem and i had a stutter and i let people walk all over me and i didnâ€™t respect myself at all. i was genuinely suicidal for over a year but i would just mask it and almost be like beta if that makes any sense? i didnâ€™t care about my own life enough to produce anything that would upset another person and i was fine with it until the quarantine hit and thankfully i got help through speech therapy and i can go weeks being perfectly fluent now. because i feel really alive right now ironically, iâ€™ve been expressing myself more, verbally and on social media as well, posting more or things i find funny or music because iâ€™m enjoying being alive and i have lost a significant amount of friends or had people dislike me or unadd me because they think iâ€™m
annoying or hate on me. i genuinely had a group chat that someone i knew was in who would send my snapchat stories just to talk shit about me and use me as the center of their humor. i realized it was kind of endearing but itâ€™s really hard when you feel like youâ€™re finding yourself more and more but more and more people are leaving when youâ€™re finally unlocking happiness. realistically i have 5-6 people i care about and love and make time for but like i never had any issues with these people and it just hurts to be disliked when youâ€™re happy. anyways, do you guys think i should continue to not use social media? i deleted snap last week but will redownload it every couple of days because itâ€™s easier to contact drug dealers (i delete it after) and i just recently deleted my instagram. i donâ€™t know i just feel like iâ€™m alone 99.9% of my life even when iâ€™m with someone and all iâ€™ve been doing to cope with all of this is smoke and listen to lil peep because it helps but i need your guysâ€™ input. please comment your thoughts if you took the time to read this. i hope you have a blessed day or evening ðŸ˜Œ
