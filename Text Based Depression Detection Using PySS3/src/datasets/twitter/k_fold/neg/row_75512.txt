25 extremely depressed, struggle to feel any sense of importanceAlways knew I'd post here. Just can't deal with life anymore. I work 40+ hours a week, go home, and am alone. I have a big heart, I feel, but nobody is ever interested. I try to offer support, but no support is ever given back. I feel like I try and try and try and nobody ever wants to try for me. I'm done.
