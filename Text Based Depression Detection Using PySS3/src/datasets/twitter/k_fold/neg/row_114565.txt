Withdrawal from Paxil is no jokeThis is horrible, this drug should not be legal if this is how you feel while trying to get off of it. Feel like I've had motion sickness for the past week. Cannot find any relief for the nausea or vomiting. Actually felt like I was shaking last night.. if this actually lasts 6 weeks there is no chance I'm going to make it.
