no friends, suicide hotline won't pick up, I am alone.what's the point. i have lost everything and I don't even know what I did to deserve it. there is no one who will listen to me and no one who even gives a damn if I live anymore. i hope I find the courage to fucking end it all soon. i just can't take it anymore.
