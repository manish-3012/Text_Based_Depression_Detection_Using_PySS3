I want to have a failed attemptI donâ€™t necessarily want to be dead. I just donâ€™t want to keep pretending everything is fine. I want it to be so blatantly clear to my family that Iâ€™m anything but okay that they finally start to listen to me. I tell my mom about my problems all the time, but I donâ€™t think she understands how bad they are. Even though I told her Iâ€™m suicidal, nothing changed. 

I canâ€™t do another school year of people thinking Iâ€™m perfectly functional. I just canâ€™t. It nearly killed me. Iâ€™d rather be stuck in a psych ward than keep pretending to be fine.
