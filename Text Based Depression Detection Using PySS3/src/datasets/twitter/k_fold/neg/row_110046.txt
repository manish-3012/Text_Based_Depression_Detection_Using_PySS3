Growing up in a cult is devastatingMy brother and I were raised in a cult. I am the oldest, and despite us both being in our 20's, I still see him as my baby brother. We both left the "organization" in our teens and we both came out with severe physical and emotional scarring. I have spent my time since then learning how to navigate the real world and I still feel culture shocked, like I don't belong. My family has been torn apart. The majority of my family is still involved in the cult and they are encouraged not to associate with those who leave. This has caused further emotional damage and my brother and I both suffer from major depression and suicidal tendencies. I have somewhat adapted and have learned how to at least cope, even if my mechanisms are unhealthy. My brother, however, has not been so lucky. I have talked him out of suicide countless times and it has reached a point to where I have nothing left to give. He has been to counseling and taken medication to help, but it doesn't. I can't tell him anything other than "I know". Medication doesn't help me. Therapy is less than cathartic. It doesn't get better. But how can I say that to him? I want him to live so badly, but he gets worse and worse. I spent mycentire life trying to protect him and I couldn't do it. I cannot help but go with him. If he jumps, I will to. He is the only family I have left and I cannot bear to live life without him. I have nothing left to give, say, or do but go along and stay with my little brother forever. I don't know, I wanted to get this off my chest. I don't know how much time I have left.
