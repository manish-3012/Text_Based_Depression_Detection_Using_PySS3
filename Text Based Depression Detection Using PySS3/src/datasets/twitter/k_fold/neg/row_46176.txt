Came to the realisation that no one cares about me and will never care about meJust about all the people on here who've killed themselves had lives that are 10 times better than mine (I wish I could trade places with my shitty fucking life). I'm not going to give you so bullshit sob story because I know you don't care and neither does any of my family or friends that I thought I had. Would of killed myself years ago if guns were legal here but I'm still here and fucking wished that I had have died earlier in life. I really want to fucking die bad but I'm too much of a pussy dipshit to go through with any other methods. Recently considered suicide by train and want to go through with it but I don't want to be seen dead. I live in Sydney NSW if anyone could suggest any platforms that are far out from central and in which most trains don't stop you'd be a real help thanks.
