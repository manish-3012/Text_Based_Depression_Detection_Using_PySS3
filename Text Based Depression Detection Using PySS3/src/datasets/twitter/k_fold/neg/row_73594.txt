im tired.im tired of going to class. im tired of thinking about my future. im tired of having to think about how to breathe everyday because i forgot how to. im tired of having my friends worry about me and holding in my tears every time i see them because i dont want to bother them anymore. im tired of thinking about the one guy, who had understood me and helped me feel like i could breathe again, now hating me because i fked up our relationship. 

im tired of hurting others. all i want is to erase everybodys memories of me so it would be easier to leave.
