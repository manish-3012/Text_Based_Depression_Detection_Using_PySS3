I don't have anyone else to talk toI'm still suicidal. 

I want so badly to have someone but more than that I want someone to have me. I want to be someone's first choice, that person that we all respond to first, who we want to hang out with. It feels selfish to still be suicidal. I have people who care for me, I have privilege, I have support, and I still want more. 

I'm lonely everyday. It's this sinking feeling that you don't matter and you have no one to tell this to. Even if I do it wont solve the loneliness. I feel so empty and alone everyday that I just sleep everyday off waiting for someone to notice that I'm not okay.
