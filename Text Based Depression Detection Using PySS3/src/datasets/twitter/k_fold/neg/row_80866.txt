I Don't Know What I'm Doing AnymoreI feel like no matter how much I try I wont be enough or worth it for anyone I care about in my life. Time and time again I'm either replaced or forgotten about, or just simply don't measure up to what people want. And it's leaving me with this feeling of what's the point, the world would be a better place without a leach like me in it.
