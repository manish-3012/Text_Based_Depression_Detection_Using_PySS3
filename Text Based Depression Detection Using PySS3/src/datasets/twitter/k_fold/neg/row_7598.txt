What's the point of living if no one cares?I don't want to be here anymore. Nobody gives a shit about me. My family only talks to me when I go to their house every week. They don't text me, I stopped trying to keep in touch because they all either take hours to respond or don't respond at all. My siblings have nothing to do with me. I have depression and social anxiety and I don't make friends easily. I have one best friend but she's always too busy for me since she just got married. Everybody I know my age is either married or married with kids. I live alone and haven't been in a relationship in two years. My last relationship lasted two years and he was emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive. I got myself out of it.

I work and go home, that's all I do. At home, all I do is play Skyrim or watch anime. Nobody ever visits me or wants to hang out. There's nothing in this town for me to do to meet new people and when there is, my social anxiety kicks in and I chicken out. The loneliness is killing me. The feeling of despair is so strong. Daily I imagine myself taking a whole bottle of pills or driving my car off the highway. A part of me doesn't want to die, but hurt myself enough to have to go to the hospital so maybe somebody would actually care enough to take care ME for once. Because of my job I am always taking care of someone, nobody ever takes care of me. I keep failing at things and I feel like my family looks at me as a failure. So many things have happened to me over the years and I just can't take it anymore. The only things stopping me from doing anything are my cats and the guilt of upsetting my family.
