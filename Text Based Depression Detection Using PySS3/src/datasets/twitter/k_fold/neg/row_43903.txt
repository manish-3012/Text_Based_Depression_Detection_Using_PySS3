How can I stop wanting to kill myself?I spend almost every night lying awake thinking about how great it would feel to put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger, I sometimes can almost feel the bullet ripping through my head and it feels relaxing, like im being set free. The only reason I don't do it is because i know my family and friends would miss me. I live a pretty good life but im such a fuck up and im tired of constantly fucking up and people telling me i fucked up, i just want to end it all but at the same time i dont. What can i do to stop thinking like this? Ive been having these thoughts for the last year and every week I get closer and closer to doing it. Last week I went to the top floor of my dorm building and sat there for an hour and pictured myself jumping through the window. Theres so much of life I havent experienced yet but I cant stop thinking about how great it would feel to die. What the fuck is wrong with me?
