I need help.What will happen if I tell my doctor I'm suicidal? I'm 18 and I live in Canada. 

I've been suffering from what I believe is depression for the last four years, but recently its gotten worse. I've found myself wondering about all the ways I could off myself. 

I plan on getting some help soon, but I need to know what to say to my doctor. I dont want her calling anyone if I tell her I'm suicidal.
