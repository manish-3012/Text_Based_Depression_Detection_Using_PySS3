ApathyI've lived a good life so far. I graduated from a decent college with good grades. I enlisted in the Marine Corps because I felt like it was something that I had to do. I don't think I'm being a narcissist when I say that I think I'm well liked, even respected, by my peers. 

I just feel so damn empty. 

It's not that bad when I'm actually doing my job, which I guess is a good thing because that's when I've got the best access to a means of killing myself (my rifle). But in the quite moments when I'm by myself I realize that there is no point to my existence. I'm just going through the motions. I don't care. The only thing stopping me is that I don't have a convenient means of ending it.

Seeking help would just completely fuck up my career and give me an actual reason to kill myself. I could talk to the chaplain, but what's he going to do? He'll listen to me bitch about my shitty little life and tell me everything is going to be okay. Reddit can do that just fine.

I was hoping the infantry life would offer me a meaningful death but we literally aren't fighting anyone right now, at least not in the conventional sense. We're not even doing any direct action shit in Afghanistan anymore.

I don't know why I wrote this.
