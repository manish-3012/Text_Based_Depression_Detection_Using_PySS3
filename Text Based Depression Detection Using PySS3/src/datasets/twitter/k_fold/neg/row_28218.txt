How long to wait?Hi Reddit. Never posted, browsed occassionally, but this seems like the right place to temper my own understandings. 

To be brief, i have a very long history, and 2 attempts. Had a 7 year good stretch, then the last 5 have been worse than any other part of my life. The trouble i went through as a teen has been the only real life raft for me; without it, surely attempt 3 would have happened years ago. But even that only got me so far, hence why i'm here.

I'm ready. My family isn't. I love them dearly. I wish it were simple enough that i could sacrifice myself for their happiness- as i am sure many others in my position feel. I understand the pain they will feel, and of course I dont want to inflict that, but i cant live life. Living isn't a matter of want and do not want. You can imagine my exasperation at others' accusations of selfishness; I hardly feel this is even my choice. 

The worst outcome is I live, but was discovered. This would make an already untenable situation become a prison of unholy proportions. 

The best outcome is that i wake up into godhood and tell my god-friends about this crazy dream i had about "humans" and how awful and wonderful and loving and hateful they were. Such contradictory creatures we are.

I've thought enough on the subject, and i have what i need in place. I have several tan ABG 60's, not for the event, but to keep me alive for the time being (without them, idk that i'd have cared enough to post this). They're also responsible for this, likely atrocious-to-read post being so verbose; i sincerely apologize.

How long should I wait?
