It May Be to Late, and I'm Scared.I made a post a few days ago explaining everything [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2sles3/years_of_love_forgotten/).

I'm not sure what else to do, I'm scared for my own life. I want to keep on being part of this earth, but I just can't keep living with this feeling. This feeling of worthlessness, it feels like it's consuming me. 

I've talked to her a few times since she left me. It doesn't seem to  impact her at all while I sit here a wallow in my own pity. 

I don't know how much more i have in me guys I'm scared i don't want to leave i just need some help but no one was there to help
