Iâ€™ve had a feeling for a while now, this life was always meant to be miserable and that it would end in a similar note but, is it avoidable?TW: some terms that might be delicate

Hey everyone happy holidays
Not a very orthodox opening for a post on this sub, isnâ€™t it? Ha, anyways....Iâ€™ll go straight to the point listing the main stuff so it gets more readable(?) 

ðŸ“Iâ€™ve been suicidal since like august with waves of it coming and going in different intensities. I am diagnosed with depression and GAD, got off meds this year .
ðŸ“The way I see life, lives have -in lack of a better term-purposes...like, maybe in this life you are meant to thrive and be happy or to have a hard road to the top but with a good lesson learned, or if you are like me, you are just a background character, someone meant to be unhappy, because there also has to be unhappy endings in the world you know? 
ðŸ“My life from the beginning has been a sad story, Iâ€™ve move past every happy/mentally positive philosophy there is, saying that itâ€™s all up to you to be what you want, maybe I am just meant to be a sad person with a shitty life and a pathetic ending, and Iâ€™ve accepted it.
ðŸ“However, from time to time, I wonder if thatâ€™s actually not true, if maybe my life will not end in misery of on a sour note because no matter how hard I try every time I try to look into what the future might bring, I see myself still being unhappy and eventually taking my own life.
ðŸ“is it maybe a final silver lining? A trick my brain plays on me based off itâ€™s own survival instinct? I know it might be. A lie, something my brain makes in order to avoid self destruction....but, what if it isnâ€™t? Maybe itâ€™s something else from within me that knows it doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be a sad story.
ðŸ“As you can tell itâ€™s a very conflicting flow of ideas that keep me confused and in the border of being â€œI might be okâ€ and â€œfuck it, Iâ€™ll cut the story short and slit my arms tonightâ€  so yeah.....I just wanted to share that.

Do you guys have similar thoughts? 
Just thought I might share it....idk 
I hope this doesnâ€™t get deleted I still donâ€™t know when moderators think something is wrong or wrongly tagged or whatever the terms are....
