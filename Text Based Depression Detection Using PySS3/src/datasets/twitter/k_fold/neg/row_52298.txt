School counselor.I'm thinking about talking to her when the next school year starts about my feelings and thoughts and that I'm suicidal. but I'm way too scared that she will tell my parents because, she can, im not over 18 yet. but I dont want my parents to know as they wont accept it nicely at all, and I dont want to go through a Coming Out phase.

What should I do?
