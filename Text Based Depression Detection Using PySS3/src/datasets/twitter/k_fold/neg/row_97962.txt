whats the point of living anymore...I'm tired of life, tired of how my future might play out, tired of how I'm wasting air, space, time, and everything my parents and friends have done to me. I'm just at the point where I feel like living is the worst thing I could do. My parents don't help me. The therapist I talk with doesn't help, and I have just had a total feeling of distrust towards all of my what used to be, my friends. People hate me In this world that judges long before it sees.. No one loves me, I'll always be worth absolutely nothing. i know that no one will care if i died because they would just be happy that i wasn't there to take up their time. Can someone help me find something to make my life worth living? I can't stand people wasting their time and money on me. I'm so worthless... Don't you agree?
