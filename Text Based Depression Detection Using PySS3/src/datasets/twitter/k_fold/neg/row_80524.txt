I don't know what to do about my low self esteem.My self esteem has been slowly plummeting for absolutely no reason; I've got plenty of friends who all seem to like me, a girlfriend who cares about me, parents that love me. And yet I feel so god damn talentless and worthless and unlikable. I'm in the middle of a play right now, and I feel like my singing and acting is absolutely awful; people tell me I did a good job, but my stupid brain ignores them. I perpetuates all of these fictional problems, and no matter how much evidence points against these problems, they still manifest themselves. As of late, this low self esteem has gotten so bad that I've begun to have suicidal thoughts; looking into ways to kill myself, ways I could get access to said methods, etc. I'm just tired of always inevitably being crushed by so many stupid thoughts with no basis behind them; furthermore, I'm afraid to tell anyone even a little bit of the problem because I'm burdening them. Hell, I'm burdening them now with my inability to simply be happy or enjoyable to be around. I'm like Kafka's bug thing from the metamorphosis; I feel atrocious, disgusting, and everyone around me is some day going to run out of sympathy and stop caring. What should I do? I don't want to kill myself (in fact, I'm afraid to), but I don't think I can deal with these cycles of rock bottom self esteem. I just don't know; what's the point of living if life keeps going to crap? What's the point if my enjoyment of life is a net loss and is mostly bad? What's the point when no matter how many good things happen to me, I feel depressed?

Thanks to all of you who paid attention to this, it means a lot to me; I have no outlet to put any of this, and I know it's a lot of complaining, but I'm in a bit of a tight spot right now, and I'm so grateful that all of you are helping me.
