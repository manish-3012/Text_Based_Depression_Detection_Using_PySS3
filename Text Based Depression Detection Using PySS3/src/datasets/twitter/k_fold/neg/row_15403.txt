My guilt over things I've done back then is killing meI've done things in my life that I just can't handle the guilt anymore. No I can't just "move on" or "forgive myself", I've stained myself with disgusting actions throughout my last 8 years without giving a care. My morals were pretty much gone until lately they've come back, and I realized how bad all that I've done was.

Post here, in private messages, whatever I just need help with this. I'm losing my mind.
