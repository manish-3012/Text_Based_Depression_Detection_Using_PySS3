Help.I need help but donâ€™t want it Iâ€™m only young and have been holding on to this for almost 3 years. Itâ€™s getting worse. I cry myself to sleep, try to make myself throw up and look into the mirror and tell myself Iâ€™m worthless that I should die and that Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I know people have it much worse than I do and Iâ€™m sorry for putting this on you. I feel like this is the end I donâ€™t see a future for myself anymore.
