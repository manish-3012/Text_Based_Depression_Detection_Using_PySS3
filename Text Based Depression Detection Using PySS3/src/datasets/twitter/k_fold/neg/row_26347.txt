My best friend tried to kill herself last night and it was my fault. I would do anything to help her but I am just not sure how. what should be my first words to her?I have explained what happened in another post https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6tre0x/my_best_friend_tried_to_kill_herself_last_night/

I need help and I can't focus on anything right now. I like to tell her how fucking stupid I was for saying those words and that she has a whole world in front of her and she will be okay. but I am afraid that she might think I am only saying these because of what she did. but that's not true. I was fucking wrong and stupid.

What should I tell her? should I talk about this with her parents first?
