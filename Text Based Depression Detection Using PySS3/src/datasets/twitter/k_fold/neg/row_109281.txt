I donâ€™t want to do this anymoreI canâ€™t stand myself. Iâ€™m a fucking loser with nothing. I have no social or conversation skills and I feel Iâ€™m so far behind my peers. I wake up wishing I hadnâ€™t and I go to bed hoping I donâ€™t wake up. I honestly donâ€™t give a shit anymore about what happens to me. Iâ€™m just going to start numbing myself through isolation or substances. I hate my life, I hate myself, and I hate everything. I canâ€™t remember the last time I was genuinely happy because I put up an act constantly. My birthday is soon and I donâ€™t care. I canâ€™t remember the last time I ever did. Thereâ€™s nothing worth living for.
