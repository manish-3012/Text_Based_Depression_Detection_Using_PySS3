Had a really bad nightI sort of tried to kill myself last night by drinking on medication that could cause me to pass out while having a rope around my neck tied to the bathroom door. It didnt work. I didnt expect it to but I wanted to try. I dont have a gun or better method. Therapy is expensive so that's not an option. I've tried it before. I've been to too many psych wards it wouldn't help to go there. My boyfriend just reamed me out before this about all my flaws and what I did wrong the past 9 years we've been together. It made me feel so fucking horrible that I tried killing myself for the first time. I dont blame him for what he said hes right and that's what made me feel so horrible. It makes me feel like a bad person. My depression or what have you has sapped the motivation out of me. I pray to Jesus all the time out of my desperation but I cant escape feeling trapped. Ive read the bible as well. My boyfriend is the only person i have in my life. I have no friends or family I can count on. Thats why his criticisms rock me so hard. I feel so discouraged I just look at the future as full of work and pain. I've been trying to make friends for years but people only want to use me. I feel so lonely even my boyfriend cant reach that dark corners of my mind.
