I wish I could end my life without hurting those who care about me.I have OCD and intrusive thoughts that hound me constantly. I worry about actually stepping over the line and doing the things I think about, although I never have. Execpt that I cut myself for the forst time today about an hour ago and I want to cut again. Although It would hurt my husband If I killed myself I think it would be better if I took myself out. I have ceartainly made him miserable with my depression, outbursts and i can't go on. I'm a piece of shit.
