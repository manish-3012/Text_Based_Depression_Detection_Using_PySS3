I'm a former detainee at a medium secure mental facility. I got out by lying, and everyday I look into my loved ones' eyes and keep lying to them. Near enough everyday I think about killing myself.I spent six months in a FCAMHS ward at the highest security under 18s can be kept in in Britain (Medium). During that time I had to come up with all these bullshit strategies to stop me going to far into depression. I have been diagnosed with ASD, Anxiety and Depression but I have always refused medication, 'cos I don't care for artificial happiness. I'm not here for help, I just feel I need to get it off my chest and I don't want to burden friends or family with this shit. But as I say, I just keep lying and saying I'm fine and don't feel like killing myself again. I once tried to drown myself in a sink during a break in a meeting, I told some people about it when I was drunk but I don't think they believed me. I feel that each time I don't succeed it's God telling me it isn't my time, that's how I justify being too pathetic to even kill myself. I just wanted to fucking die, but I just can't. I can't bring myself to do it, so I wallow in my depression and act like I am doing just fine. Sorry this was ranty but it feels good to take off that mask even if the internet is a mask in itself.
