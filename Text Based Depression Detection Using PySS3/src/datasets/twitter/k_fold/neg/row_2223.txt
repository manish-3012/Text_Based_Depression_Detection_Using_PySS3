Genuinely hate my life and feel like I wanna die every daySurvived an od last Friday while trying to kill myself and got put in the psych shithole for a week, Iâ€™m on meds and getting therapy now I was undiagnosed on depression and anxiety. Iâ€™ve had thoughts of killing myself for as long as i can remember I feel like nobody deserves to live like this. Recently those thoughts have been a magnitude stronger and the feelings of depression is unbearable. Just wondering how everyone else copes with living with this fucking disease. I know even with the help Iâ€™m still going to feel this way as they only help you cope with it, it doesnâ€™t get rid of this shit.
