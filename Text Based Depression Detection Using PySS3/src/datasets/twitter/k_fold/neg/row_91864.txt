struggling to bounce back??on july 8th i did something horrible out of pure impulse- i really messed up. i did significant damage and ended up in the hospital. i was in a lvl  1 psychiatric unit for a week. Iâ€™ve been discharged since Friday but iâ€™m not feeling.. right?? I feel like iâ€™m more shaken up &amp; having hard thoughts than i was before it happened. iâ€™m questioning things &amp; myself- iâ€™m just thinking of why it didnâ€™t work- why did it happen? &amp; what do i do now?
