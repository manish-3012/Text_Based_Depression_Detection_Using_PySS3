Failed my first Suicide attempt, could really use some advice on how to get help. I feel pretty emberrased about this all but here it goes:


I've tried to commit suicide on monday by hanging and failed. Right now I am doing fine and im not suicidal anymore, but i'm afraid that I will attempt it again and succeed. Other than depression I don't know whats wrong with me, there is so much shit in my head that I have no clue how to even start to explain how I feel or what bothers me the most. I've tried calling my countries suicide line but as soon I heard another voice on the other end of the line I froze up and couldn't get out a word and hung up. I've never ever talked to somebody about my problems so far, its as if something is keeping me back and I just can't bring it up in me to be honest about how I feel. 



Perhaps the most embarrasing thing is that I havn't seen a doctor in 6 years, no regular checkup no vaccinations and it doesn't bother me at all. It does bother me that it doesn't bother me, but I just...meh I really don't know how to explain it. 




 Last week I found a post on /r/selfhelp which was the first time I felt some relief. Somebody posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/egrzs/is_there_something_wrong_with_me/) topic which almost describes how I am in perfect detail, ontop of that I have moodswings that can turn me from feeling completely awesome to borderline suicidal and its scaring me. 



SW...How can I get help ?



**Edit: Thanks for the replies so far I really appreciate it. Its pretty late here and I got class in the morning so i'm going to try to get some sleep. I'll be replying in the morning. **
