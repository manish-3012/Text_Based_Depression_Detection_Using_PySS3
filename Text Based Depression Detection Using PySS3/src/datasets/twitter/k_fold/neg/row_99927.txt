I have a questionWhy is wanting to die such a bad thing? I understand a lot of view points on suicide come from religious beliefs. But yet most if not all talk about a better life after death and suffering in this one. Why do we celebrate births and mourn deaths. Just my last thought I had to ask. Why cant suicide be accepted why most people dictate what others do with their lifes. I'm looking forward to my death where I can find my true happiness.
