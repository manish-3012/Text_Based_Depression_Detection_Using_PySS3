Well, you could kill yourself NOW and you wouldn't have to get up at 4am for work...Pretty much how I always think now. I just keep waiting till things are bad enough for me to give in to that constant urge to hang myself-slit my wrists-stab myself with something sharp-jump off a bridge. Like seriously it sounds like the best thing in the world. I know it's messed up, and I have been struggling with it for years. Honestly I kinda thought I had beaten it for a while there, at least became stronger than it...but it has a way of creeping back to me. I just want to WANT to live more than I want to die. It sucks not being able to have the one thing you actually want in this life more than anything. To die. I just want out of this whole thing with all it's miseries and fake happy moments and real happy moments that don't last and messiness and uncertainty and unfairness and headaches and confusion and disappointment. Only a quarter in to my life and I already know there is nothing in life I want enough to stay. Not love, not success, not fame, not caring for people who dont give a crap about you in the end, there is nothing so i would rather BE nothing or face the afterlife than deal with another stupid random pointless day that may or may not go well depending on-well, nothing. It just turns out how it turns out and you gotta deal with it. Again and again. Life deals and you either call or fold. Life is like a schizophrenic bipolar, it's like a booby-trapped maze full of mirages of purpose, tempting treasures, wicked traps, and endless periods of boring repetitiveness. 
I want my ticket out.
