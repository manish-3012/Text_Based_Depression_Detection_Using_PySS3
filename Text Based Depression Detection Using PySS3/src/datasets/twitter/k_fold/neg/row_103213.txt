I lost the last person who cared about me from my own doing.Last night I had a mental breakdown, and it escalated to the point where my now ex-girlfriend is scared of me and has just taken her last piece of belonging away with her. She was the last person who truly cared for me and I lost her because I'm a fucking animal that needs to be put down.

I'm ready this time.
