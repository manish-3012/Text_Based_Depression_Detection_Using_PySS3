I hope my boyfriend doesn't see thisI can't be bothered to make a throwaway account just for this subreddit even though that's the safe thing to do because my boyfriend is on Reddit with me so it's risky. Anyway, just wanna die at this point. Everything is going to shit everyday even though nothing particular is happening. The guilt of the things I've done is slowly but surely creeping up and the intensity is a little too high at this point for some reason. I am actually waiting for an opportunity to either blow myself out of this world or for someone else to do it but with literally nothing to do this painlessly, I kind of wake up everyday and wish I would just be dead at this point. This has been going on for a very long time but still I would stretch on by telling myself what a nice life me and my boyfriend will have in the future but now...the world is dying, I wanna die too so my will to even want to be in that future is all gone. I just don't care now I want out. This is unbearable and no amount of consolidation or future plans are gonna get me out of this unless somebody takes me out of this fucking place. I don't even know why I'm posting this but I don't wanna bother anyone I know with this and the anonymity of Reddit people and people on this subreddit gives me comfort because for once I can't be judged all the time and I won't be told that I was the one who caused all this. Even though it is true, that it's all my fault I'm in this shit but it's nice to hear once a in a while if someone tells me that I was a stupid kid who didn't know so many things that were done wrong by me and that my past immature and pre-adolescent brain actions shouldn't be held against me all the time.
