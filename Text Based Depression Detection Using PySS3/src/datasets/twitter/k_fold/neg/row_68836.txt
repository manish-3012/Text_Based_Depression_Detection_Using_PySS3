I don't think I will ever get better.I know I've posted on this site many times recently, but I just keep feeling down. I feel better for a little bit when I take my mind off of things, but then the feelings come back. 

I know that all of my problems are my fault, but I just don't think I can fix them. I try and I try and I do everything I can, but I just can't shake my feelings. Everyone says "Think positive" but I can't. Everyone says "Don't care about other people. Focus on you, " but I can't. Everyone says, "Love yourself" but I can't. No matter how hard I try, my mind just won't be happy. And I don't think it ever will. Maybe that's just the way it's meant to be. Maybe I'm supposed to die. Maybe my death will cause the positive change and impact that I wanted. Anything is possible.
