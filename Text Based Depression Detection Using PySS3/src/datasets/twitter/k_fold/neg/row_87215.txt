Gonna die, need to vent.Every human being I've come in contact with, from my parents to my peers and everyone in between has treated me badly. My parents destroyed any self-esteem or confidence I might've had from a young age. They made me anxious around people so I was considered a freak at school and bullied from age 5 onwards. 

Every girl I've let past my defences has made me into a doormat, that is until I get too depressed and then they leave. Even girls who claim they're more depressed than me.

The people who've said they cared about me hurt me the most and the only conclusion I can come to is that they never cared about me to begin with.

People aren't able to care about things beyond themselves. A child is simply an extension of the parent's ego, a charitable act is preceded by pity and revulsion, no-one cares about being a good person anymore without the threat of religious/spiritual consequences.

We are cancer. We destroy the planet, each-other and ourselves without thought. Each one of us a mutant cell, part of the larger disease with no purpose except to reproduce and spread.

I can no longer sit by and watch the world burn, it gives me great pleasure knowing that soon all of my suffering will lose all its meaning.
