So AngryI feel so angry but also tired I need to go outside but Iâ€™m so exhausted but I canâ€™t sleep but if I canâ€™t calm down I think Iâ€™ll end my life today.
Why am I like this, I canâ€™t understand anything my head hurts no one gets how hard everything. 

I feel so fucking lonely if I cry now my neighbors will call the police again.
Idk what Iâ€™m even writing canâ€™t concentrate, maybe iâ€˜m just crazy or something hahaha
