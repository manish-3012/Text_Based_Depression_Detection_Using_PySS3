I honestly cannot find in myself to live after breaking up with my girlfriendTime heals. I know. And I believe I'm on my way to self-recovery despite knowing it will take a while for me and my ex to be friends. Everything in that department is something that I'm currently riding along, so that's not the issue.

But I realized something. Every achievement I have, every waking day, every work I do, feels like nothing. This is because I've grown so connected to her that her constant presence is what makes me keep living.

Now when I wake up, everything I do feels meaningless. While you can argue I can do this for myself, I don't feel a sense of pride at all. I have many achievements. But all of them are meaningless. I cannot feel happy when she is not happy. 

I am going through the days with a numb mind. I am so eternally bored and empty. I am so tempted to text her "hey! I got a job" or "do you want to hang out?" But I know it will make things complicated. 

Everything I do feels meaningless. I'm in a void. I can't move without her. I can't find meaning without her. My dreams and goals are dry and gray without her.

I feel gone when she is gone. Life feels so underwhelming.
