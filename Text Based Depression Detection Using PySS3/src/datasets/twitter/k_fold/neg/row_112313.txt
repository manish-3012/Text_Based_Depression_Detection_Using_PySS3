I can't take it anymoreThere's something wrong with me and I can't take it anymore. Every time I think I have a friend and it seems to be going well, I get tossed aside. What's wrong with me? Why can't I figure it out?  
  
It's been like this all my life. In grade school I had one friend. He eventually stopped talking to me after grade school. In high school I had one friend. He eventually stopped talking to me after high school. In university I had one friend. He eventually stopped talking to me after university. Last year I met someone and we've been talking for a year. We shared secrets and we were close. We ended up being good friends and talked to each other for the past year quite often. We helped each other a lot. But even she now wants nothing to do with me.  
  
I'm broken. Time and time again I loss everyone. Now I'm back to zero. Alone again. There's something wrong with me. I'm not compatible with other people. Eventually everyone gets sick of me. A few months ago I read in the paper about some sort of seed from Taiwan that kills people who eat it. I ordered some from eBay in June. They arrived not too long ago.  
  
Every time I felt like this I never had the loaded gun. I always wished during those times I was living in a place that made it easy to acquire a gun. Now, I have my gun, so to speak. Now I can't stop thinking about the seeds. I'm broken. People don't enjoy me. Why should I continue to exist? Why continue to be here when I only hinder and hurt people?  
  
It's not like I can change. I'm 29 years old. I'm about half way through my life. If I haven't learned by now how to be human, how will I ever learn? There's no hope for me. So why not save people the trouble of getting to know me? Eventually they'll learn I'm not normal. Eventually they will learn I'm not human. So why force people to put up with my existence? Is it not the right thing to do?  
  
I can't take it anymore. Becoming close to people only just to lose them. There's only so few people who can tolerate me and even they can only do it for so long. It hurts so bad.
