I cant find a reason to liveI cant keep a job. I cant afford to go to school. Due to my ugly face and being incredibly shy I get labeled as a creep by every girl. Im in my mid twenties a virgin and have never done anything with a girl. im still stuck living with my parents. Randomly just have past mistakes pop in to my head and make me feel even more like shit. some stuff happened over 15 years ago. I cant go to a therapist cause I dont have the money for it. I live in a country I hate. Working my ass off Just making enough to live sounds way worse than death.
