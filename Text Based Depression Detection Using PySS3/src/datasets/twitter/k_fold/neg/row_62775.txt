I'm so alone, useless and unwantedEveryone on the outside may see someone who has good things, but it isn't the case. I hate myself everyday. I don't have a stable job. I'm not prioritized in my relationships and it makes me feel unwanted. I want to say something about my sadness to my SO but was told that it isn't his responsibility to deal with my sadness and he has other things to do. I feel like no one wants to deal with me. I'm a useless member to society and I just want to die. I tried to kill myself with a kitchen knife years ago but my brother held me down to stop me. No one is home right now and I can easily do it, but part of me is also afraid and lost and confused. I feel like the simple thing to do is just end it all and not have to stress anymore. I have all these suicidal thoughts and even when I tried to get a therapist they wouldn't accept me. I'm so useless.
