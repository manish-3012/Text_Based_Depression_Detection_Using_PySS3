idk what to do anymoreiâ€™ve started doing online school because going, physically, to school and being around a lot of people i donâ€™t know gave me too much anxiety and iâ€™m very insecure. Itâ€™s been about 6 months since then and other than seeing my gf i havenâ€™t seen any of the few friends i have and my gf lives pretty far so i can only see her on the weekends. Iâ€™ve been spending nearly everyday alone in my room and i cant take it anymore, i feel like iâ€™m going insane, everyday i feel worse. Iâ€™m starting to believe maybe i was just meant to die, life and me arenâ€™t just meant to be, like dying is my purpose or something. i need help. please
