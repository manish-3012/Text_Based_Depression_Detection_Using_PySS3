She was my whole world and now she's goneMy best friend killed herself on Thursday. I have no reason to hang around anymore. She was everything to me, and the thought of not being able to see her or hold her or hear her voice ever again? Nope. No use prolonging the inevitable. I'm only hanging around long enough to see her bf on stable ground and then I'm out.
