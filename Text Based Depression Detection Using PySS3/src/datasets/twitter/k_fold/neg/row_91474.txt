Tired of being tiredAt this point the feeling is so prevalent I don't blame my past anymore. I have happy periods but ultimately I just end up wishing I wasn't alive. No one around me cares nor do I expect someone to want to be around me when I'm so pathetic. I've tried to be happy so that I stop wanting death so much but the pain always comes back and I don't know what else to do to stop it. I've tried therapy, prescribed and unprescribed drugs. Nothing works and are all short term crutches to a long term problem.
