Im going to kill myself, I don't see the point.What's the point of life, we get up, we do the shit society tells us to do and then do nothing. What's the point in going through life that will end in death. Why not end it now? I cannot see myself living past my early 20s. I don't see the point in doing life. Like why. It fucking sucks. It's full of sadness and no matter what I'm going to die. So fuck this I'm done with life.
