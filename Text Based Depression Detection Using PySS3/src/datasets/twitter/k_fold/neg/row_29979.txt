Thinking about killing myselfI am 20 years old. I started talking to this girl and started to fall in love with her. My friends (also her friends) told me to tell her how i feel. They were sure that she felt the same way. So i told her how i feel. But the feelings wasnt mutual. And now we dont talk with eachother anymore. Still go to school with her. I have to see her everyday. So everyday i get more depressed and more suicidal. I feel so lonely. I have a piercing loneliness that wont go away. Even tho i have friends to talk to/hangout with. In 5 months i will never see her again. And i think thats the day iâ€™ll kill myself. The loneliness is driving me crazy. Started having a hard time remembering things. This is killing me
