Things cant stop going wrong     My dad died recently from a car accident, my mom and I cant afford to keep the house. I'm losing all my friends just because I need time to compose myself. My whole world is crumbling so quickly. All the sudden it's just me and mom, besides that I'm alone. 
     I can nearly scratch up enough money for us to eat. I just cant take the pain anymore, the only reason I'm still here is because I know mom would be destroyed if I just killed myself. Nobody in our family will help us. We just getting put in a deeper hole. I cant go to college and get a degree, all I can do is just work at low pay jobs and work myself into exhaustion. When I dont work I find better jobs when I dont do that I'm at home trying to find some sort of excuse to just get my life over with. I need someone anyone just to talk to me and say everything will be ok.
