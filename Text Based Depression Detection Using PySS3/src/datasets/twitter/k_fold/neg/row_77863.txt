Afraid of what I might doSuicide has been on my mind every day lately. I don't feel comfortable telling anyone so I want to vent here. It's become unbearable. I'm in the middle of finals now and it is nearly impossible to get myself to do anything. I'm trying, I'm trying so hard. I don't want to die, but I'm afraid of myself. I'm afraid I'll do something impulsive. I feel so numb. I used to feel sick imaging what my family would do if I killed myself, it would make me cry. But now I don't feel anything. I'm so sorry. I just can't take it anymore. I want it to be over. I want to be nothing
