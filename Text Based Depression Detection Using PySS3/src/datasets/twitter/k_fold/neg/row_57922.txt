What do I do nextSelf-employed. Business not doing well. A number of issues and expenses in life. Taxes, loans, medical bills, all unpaid. I have skills, but a criminal record stops me from getting full-time employment. (That and at my last job, years ago, i was laid off, I blame anxiety and issues at home for preventing me from staying competitive) I did not have the chance to "save up" before starting my business. I was unemployed for almost a year and landed a client, so I started my LLC the same month. I can't possibly afford my own health insurance. I am in NJ, and I do not qualify for any state programs because I have my own business, unless I am misunderstanding what I am reading. My plan is to find out once I stop trembling in fear. I have bad teeth, have spent over 25,000 in dental work in the past 10 years, and I am scared to death that my most recent tooth break will become as bad as the one that resulted in my fear of hospitals. I am freaking the fuck out. I cannot get a loan, terrible credit, no savings, fortunately no credit card debt. I'm better off than some but I feel like I should have just taken my life when I couldn't cut it at my last job. Or years ago when I couldn't decide what to do in college. Someone tell me, if the state won't help me (why should they, I am worthless), what do I do next?
