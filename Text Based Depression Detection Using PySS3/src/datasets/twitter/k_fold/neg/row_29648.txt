This should be the happiest time in my life...im pregnant (6 weeks) but im alone it feels and i actually want to dieI relapsed a week ago on heroin before i knew i was pregnant and now that i know im obs stopped... my boyfriend found out and hates me now im worried hell leave me. He doesnt wanna talk but we obvs live together hes so angry and i understand. 

Ive never felt more terrified and alone in that terror in my life. And i have seriously considered killing that...but i already love this baby. I want to give it a wonderful life. I know i can...but this feeling of terror has me shaken
