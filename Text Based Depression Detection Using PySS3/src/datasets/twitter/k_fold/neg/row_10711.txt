Iâ€™m lostI donâ€™t know what to do anymore, Iâ€™m overweight, and failing university,I consider myself a disgrace to my family .im that one family member everyone talks behind his back.
Me being overweight caused my mom to become depressed. Iâ€™m a burden, I have psoriasis,dandruff and I have tried every single product to fix it ,I have anxiety swings ,one day I might be social and Iâ€™d talk to people ,the next day I would lock my self in my room and stare at my phone. Most of my high school friends left the country to study and now I have no friends, people at my university are mostly acquaintances as I only say hi to them and thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m so depressed that I donâ€™t think I have any emotions left in me. I just wanna end it but I canâ€™t because Iâ€™ll disappoint myself as I consider it cowardly. Every time I think I do something right another huge life problem pops up.
