Whatâ€™s lifeWhy would I wanna have a job that Iâ€™m gonna have to work for most of my life preparing for it, to then be too late to retire and not enjoy anything? Life is a cruel world weâ€™re just existing not living no more. I go on my day just existing ive lost total motivation for everything. I know I need help but how to ask for it? One may never find the correct answer. Where is my mind? Iâ€™m just existing not living. As a kid I had such big dreams now I realize my dreams were too big. People arenâ€™t the same anymore. Society hates everyone. Especially people like me, this world isnâ€™t meant for people like me. I wanna start living instead of existing but the days seem so long and bland, that I just see the days go by and everyone doing so much, yet Iâ€™m in a sort of trance where I just see everything happening slowly. Iâ€™m sick of being so sad all the time. If I were to die, I wish I couldâ€™ve been the person I so much everyone thought I was. Iâ€™m a fake. Iâ€™m not who I portray to be, Iâ€™m sad, hopeless, unhappy, dead. All of the above Iâ€™m not who I wish I was. Iâ€™m trying but you can only try so hard. Whatever we do in life will ultimately be insignificant but itâ€™s important that we do what we wanna do because no one else will. So I emplore u to go out and no give a fuck about anything or what anyone says and do what YOU wanna do. If ur happy doing it then ur FREE. Your free to be your own person. Iâ€™m trying to be someone selfless, I shall keep going till I make it. Thank u, -xx
