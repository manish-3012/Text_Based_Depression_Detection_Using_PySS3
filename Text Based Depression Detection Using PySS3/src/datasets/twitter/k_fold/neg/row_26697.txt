When the time runs outIt will be decided. I have given myself 10 years, I will be 30 then. If I don't get out of this mess, I will make it so. It's gonna be hell, but atleast then my sister will be old enough to understand. I don't see myself living a life when the majority of it is plain suffering. Let those who enjoy living live, I guess not everyone is meant to live happily ever after.
