I'm so sad...I don't know if I want to see what 2021 or beyond is gonna be like. My business venture has failed. I tried to start an investment group, and it failed also. I'm letting down every one who actually believes in me. I cry uncontrollably. I'm just tired. I'm tired. Of everything. I don't have another 'get up and go' in me. My life is pointless. I wish things were different. I wish it was better. But it's not, nor will it ever be. I'm so out of touch with people, until I question whether I'm even human. Or am I actually just some ugly, smelly, horrible being that sees itself as human but really am not. I feel disconnected from everything. I've felt like this for quite some time now. I'm tired. 

I'm tired.
