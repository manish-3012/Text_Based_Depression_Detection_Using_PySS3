Iâ€™m not suicidal but I want to dieYesterday I made a post in r/confession about wanting to die. You can read it on my page if youâ€™re interested. I feel incredibly shitty and guilty for feeling this way. My brother called last night and cried; heâ€™s going through a very difficult time as well. Iâ€™m scared for his physical safety, but I donâ€™t know what to do as we are several states apart. Today, my mom was laid off. Her and I live in a studio apartment on my aunt and uncles property. Aunt and uncle are having their own family issues that kind of make me scared to be on their property. I feel like Iâ€™m need to be the strong one for my family, but I feel so damn weak. The helplessness im feeling just makes me want to disappear more. I just want to quit life, to go to sleep and never wake up. 
I donâ€™t want to kill myself because I donâ€™t want to cause any more hardship in my family, but damnit I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do this.
