What should I do with the last 20 minutes of my life?My lungs are collasping after smoking something i'm highly allergic to. I think i have maybe 40 minutes left at the most before i die of co2 poisoning since my lungs are turning oxgyen into c02 very much and i feel pain all over my body. My throat is closing too. I wanna go out at least somewhat dignified
