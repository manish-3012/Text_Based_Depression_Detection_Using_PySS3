A good friend of mine has been battling depression all his life. Today he very casually told me that he has picked a day that he is going to kill himself.My friend is currently an Economics professor and cerebral brainiac. He was taken away from his family early on in his life because his parents were alcoholics and abusive. His "high school sweetheart/soul mate" married someone else. He ended up becoming a merit scholar and did his undergrad through PhD at Stanford.

Now he lives by himself. He has low self-esteem. He's very awkward. And almost afraid of interacting with other people. He recently disconnected his phone. He disconnected his wifi. He has a car but refuses to use it. He basically is disconnecting himself from society.

And just today he told me very nonchalantly that he has picked a day to kill himself. He said that he had picked a day last year but his new professorship changed his plans. He said he has less than 75 days left.

He believes he has no friends and no one cares about him. He's also started giving his money and possesions away. I tell him pretty regularly that I care about him but that doesn't seem to make a difference. He doesn't seem to want my help.

I'm not sure what to do.
