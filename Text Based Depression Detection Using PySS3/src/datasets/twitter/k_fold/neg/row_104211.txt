I called the suicide prevention hotline and got hung up on twicePretty much what the title says. It hung up on me twice last night, in the same place, before I ever got to talk to anyone. I'm trying not to kill myself. I don't want to hurt my family or leave my dog without anyone to take care of him. I'm just so overwhelmed and can barely function and everything I do just makes everything worse. I'm so ashamed and I don't know how or where to get help.
