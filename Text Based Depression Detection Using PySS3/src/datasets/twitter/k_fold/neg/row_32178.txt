I can't feel anythingSo I'm 17 year old and I have been diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety disorder. I'm also suicidal.

So, here's the thing. I feel inadequate: I can't speak properly because of a speech problem, I still can't see a pic of mine without sobbing and I'm profoundly lonely - I'd met a girl with whom I got along very well and I trusted her (and she told me she'd be there for me and that I could count on her) and told about all this but she's been just checking on me to see if I'm still alive and I feel humiliated by all that and regret having trusted her. My family is extremely dysfunctional and those last days have been hard: my scumbag father (who's also a bit of a pedo) was convinced by a witcher (I swear that's real) that my scumbag mom would kill him with a PONTY object. I can't feel anything, I can't cry, I can't laugh, I can't scream and I feel suffocated. I also can't feel any pleasure reading (I tried reading Absalom, Absalom! and some poems by T.S. Eliot and I didn't feel any pleasure and I couldn't even concentrate), listening to music, watching tv/movies or doing anything that used to please me.

I used to be a gifted child, everyone used to say I was going to have a bright future. Now, tomorrow I have a Chemistry test and I'm going to bomb it because I couldn't keep me concentrated and/or awake during Chemistry classes and couldn't study and I feel so ashamed about this that I feel like killing myself only because of that. This year, I have to take entrance exams for universities and I feel like I'm going to fail them and I feel so ashamed about it that I think about killing myself only because of it. I often think about how I must kill myself after thinking so much about it and how suicide is the only way out of loneliness and a miserable life. I've tried to find some support in religion, to deal with the loneliness and my parents, but unfortunately I've also found that I'm very much incapable of believing.
