Why I Want 2 VoMy health isn't the greatest and I'm uninsured, trans and need medical attention that I can't get because I'm poor. My family is too poor to help and we're not close. I'm single. My daughter lives with her adopted family thank God. I always get offered the hard jobs in my life because of how I look and I work them and end up screwed in the end. I've never had a good relationship and not hoping for one. I was abused at home and school as a kid. I thought my parents would kill me before 18. In my adult life it's still hard to trust and believe despite the help I've got for these issues. So I have few I talk to. I've lost my apt and I'm abt to lose my car but IDC. I'm tired of feeling like this everyday. I need relief!
