I have enough antidepressants to do itAnd also painkillers and sleeping pills, in hope it is a pailess death during my sleep. I have nothing to look for on life anymore, no more hope, no more dreams. Fear still holds me back a little, and also my family, but each day I'm more decided to chug all my pills down and stop life in this painful messed up world. I can't meet everyone's expectations, I can't be this happy person with high self esteem that you have to be in order to live peacefully in this world. I looked everywhere for help but it appears that you have to find happiness and a reason to live yourself, nobody can do that for you, and if you can't do it, you're better off dead. Thank you for reading this, i'm in great pain for years now and I really hope i find other way soon, but am truly doubtful.
