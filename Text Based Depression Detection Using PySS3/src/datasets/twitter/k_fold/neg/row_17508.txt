â€œDonâ€™t kill yourself! Things could improve!â€My biggest fear when I first became severely suicidal at 10 was that Iâ€™d kill my self the day before the best day of my life. I now know that day will never come. I wake up with the desire to die. I have never been happy. The holidays are grating on me and after taking down my fall decorations I stare at a blank wall and cry, I donâ€™t have the strength to put up decorations. My dad has become more abusive than ever, constantly in a bad mood, yelling, screaming, and mocking everyday as well as threatening violence, but because I am 18 I am seen as a leech and not a dependent and everyone I talk to says I should just leave home. I want to die, I remember when I was young i always thought things would improve, Iâ€™m loosing hope.
