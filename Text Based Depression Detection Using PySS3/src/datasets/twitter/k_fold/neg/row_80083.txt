I've reached a dead endMy life as it currently stands is destined to be a sad greentext tale-

Be me.

Have roughly a fifth grade education because your religious fanatic parents homeschooled you to protect you from the devil. 

Return to public school senior year.

Socially and academically unequipped. 

Develop drinking problem. 

Fall deeper into disordered eating.

Flunk out.

Do nothing with your life.

Die.

So far I've only reached the "Do nothing with your life" line and am going steady with it.

I can't drive and I live in a rural hell hole with no public transportation. 

I can't seek treatment for my mental health for the same reason. 

I couldn't hold a job anyway because I'm emotionally unstable and nobody hires dropouts. Motherfucking *McDonald's* turned me down because I don't have a diploma. 

I have no practical skills. 

I have nothing going for me.

I'm literally betting all my chips on finishing and publishing the book I began writing two years ago because I've ended up with no practical options, but let's be real, making it as a novelist isn't practical, either. 

I don't really want to die. I just want to actually, truly live. I don't have the resources to do that, though. I feel like I'm already dead.
