No answerI called my ex after not speaking for a month and she didn't answer. She broke up with me 3 months ago and I'm so broken about it. Thought about killing myself everyday after that . Real reason I'm so depressed about it, is because the reasons we broke up wasn't that big and can be fixed . I don't know I just feel so sad about it and only way to get rid of this pain is ending it all . I bought rope and plan on buying a gun . It's harder to buy a gun from where I live . Trust me I've heard it all, time will heal everything, plenty fish in the sea, go out with friends meet new people, and exercise. I do half of those things and still feel so out of place . I just want one more chance to see her and get closure .
