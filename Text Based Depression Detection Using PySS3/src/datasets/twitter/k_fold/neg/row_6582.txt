37 weeks pregnant and I can't do it anymoreI just.. I don't know I'm heavy and weighed down by the burden of this baby. I'm 20. I've not had an easy life but I found someone who loves me and has helped me through so much but I'm just so sad. I feel empty. I feel like in not connected to this baby at all. I want to kill myself. I want to sever the connection with life and hopefully my fiancÃ© will make it in time to save this baby and he will be happy.

I'm not making much sense I realize that. I feel all muddled and confused and just empty. When will the sadness end? When will this pain end. I want to burn the nursery and I want to run away and I want to slit my wrists and call 911 just in time for them to save my little boy. I'm not stable enough to raise a child. I can't be a mother. I can't breastfeed I'm sure. My fiances mother tells me day in and day out that I will struggle with breastfeeding, that I'll want the epidural and that I'm not going to get what I want in that delivery room. 

My belly hurts I have an infected gallbladder and I can't stop crying. My car payment is due on Wednesday and I keep calling off of work. It's probably going to get repossessed. So I'm thinking of selling my body just to get by because atleast then I won't have to face my peers at work or school. I can block out sex, I've done it my whole life. 

I'm drowning. I'm drowning and I need help. But there's no one to tell because they all know I'm crazy and they tell me it'll pass but it won't pass and I'm in pain and I don't think I can wait until the baby is born to kill myself. I don't think I can wait anymore. I'm sorry.
