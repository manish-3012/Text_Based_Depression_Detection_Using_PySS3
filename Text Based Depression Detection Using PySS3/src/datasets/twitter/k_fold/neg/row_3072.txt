Fuck everyone.I'm destined to be a failure in life, ever since I nearly failed high school I can't get into college or get a job. I got my first job interview at a grocery store and even they rejected me. All of my friends have left me and the ones that know I suffer from suicidal thoughts are ignoring me. I failed my driver's test today because the instructor claims I did a rolling stop which is horse shit and I drove in the middle of the road despite cars being parked on BOTH fucking sides of the damn road. I'm sick of putting up with bullshit in this world and I found a way to stop it. There's a bridge a few miles from me I think I'm gonna tell the people who gave up on me goodbye and then end it there.
