Perhaps better than talking to myself.I'm really, really not sure why I'm here. I'm mad at myself because it feels to me like I'm asking for help, and I've already told myself that's not an option. But I'm alone with my thoughts and though I want to protect my ability to implement a plan, I suppose I don't want to feel quite as alone as I currently am. Anyway, I've never been on reddit before for anything, and I suppose I should say more or something introductory since this is my first post, but I just can't at the moment. I suppose I'm putting out feelers to see if I want to stay on the site.
