The only thing that keeps me going is others.IF it were up to me, no sadness around me, I would be gone. I hate my life. But, I'm hanging on to others. It would be selfish of me to tear myself from everything, but I need help. I'm so bottled up I cannot sleep. I need somewhere to vent, I am afraid for my Mother's life, and I can't do anything about it. The lack of control drives me insane. How can i come to terms with my lack of power?
