I want to kill myself. I dont know how to help myselfI've been suicidal for a few years. It was never serious and I never felt like I wanted to attempt until now. Recentlyi lost my boyfriend and one of my closest friends. Both said, "I can't deal with this anymore." I'm sad and anxious and slightly suicidal, and I guess I depended on them too much. I just wanted my friends to help, and I lost one. Clearly there is something wrong with me. I think its better that I off myself because I cant deal with this anymore. I dont want people to leave me. I feel so lonely

I dont know what to do. I'm currently in therapy and on meds but idk if thats enough. I feel like I'm a danger to myself but I'm too scared to kill myself. I'm afraid that if I tell someone they'll lock me up and I cant finish my school work. I'm in college and its important that I succeed. I have a 4.0 and I can easily get all A's or A- at the end of this semester, and I dont want to ruin that by getting locked up
