I'm starting to think that suicide is my only option.I am just tired, I am 17, turning 18this November, and I just want to die. I am tired of suffering, been like this for 7 years now since when I was in 6th Grade, been bullied whole my life and experience colorism from my peers and even family relatives, I live in a shitty country with a bunch of just rude prejudice people. I am tired. I can't recall the time were I am genuinely happy, no one really cares about me, maybe except my parents, but they don't understand what i am going through, even if I try to explain and, they won't understand especially my dad. My family is broken, I am isolating myself for years now and I just socialize maybe 2x a month approximately, I've been diagnosed with OCD, MDD, and Social Anxiety before but I am out of treatment right now because of lack of understanding of my dad about my mental issues, I am planning to get help again next month but my mental issues are becoming unbearable now, I usually sleep 4 am at night, can't enjoy anything, even the things that I used to enjoy, especially music, I just became apathetic, I always try to fight, I always push myself to always learn something new and do good at school despite of my condition, but it's taking a toll on my mental health too. I tried meditating, exercising, all of that jazz but they don't work. I am currently one of the best students on my class but I don't feel anything about it, and I don't know what to do with my life. I just want to stop fighting and end the pain. This is too unberable, the loneliness, anhedonia, and I just can't get out of this loop that I am in, it feels like everyday is just the same as yesterday, I am trapped on this rut and I can't get myself out of this shit. I did fought hard but life is just too powerful to me. I feel like I am losing hope. I feel like I'm gonna be unhappy and just like this for the rest of my life. I am tired.
