I am officially revoking my stake in realityI just wanted to state this here and make it official. I am tired, exhausted, and defeated. I am deciding that I will take my life most likely sooner rather than later. Once my funds run out I am taking the last of my money and will go to a place where I can die in peace. I am currently generating income through equities trading I am not sure when I will go just that I will. I am ending it at a point I can say I was proud of my life. Not looking to be talked out of this, I wanted to make this post for myself. Maybe I will make another one later about my brief life. 

Its surreal to think about, part of me wonders if I was suppose to have a major impact on the world. If my death will influence anything in a substantial way. Was I suppose to have a 'purpose' an objective? Then I figured, That's none of my concern.
