To the person who posted then deleted - can we talk?[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b1zt2/im_done_with_everything_im_killing_myself_tonight/) wasn't up for long.  I do hope this person has changed their mind. However, it might still be a good time to come back and talk about things.
