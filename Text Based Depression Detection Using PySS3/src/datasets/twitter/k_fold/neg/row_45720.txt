What is the point of life as failed cog in capitalist machine?This is another story of another loser. No useful skills, no interests, no friends, no ambition, you know it all, you read it here many times.

What is the point of life, when one can look forward to nothing else than working miserable jobs just to pay for food and shelter. What is point of life, when one can look forward to nothing than being fired again and having to bow and scrape and beg to find another one before one ends on the street. What is the point, when one can look forward to nothing else than failing health and death of old age, or death in nuclear war.

Only reason why I am alive is because I am big coward, too afraid to kill myself. Afraid of the pain, afraid of failing and, you can laugh now, afraid of hell. I am atheist, but I cannot free myself of the fear that I can be wrong and hell and satan are real.
