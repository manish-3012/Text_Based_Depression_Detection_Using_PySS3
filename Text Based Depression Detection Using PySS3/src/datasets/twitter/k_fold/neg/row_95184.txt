My storyHi so Iâ€™m 22, Iâ€™ve always had suicidal thoughts from a young age, I grew up with an alcoholic mother and an emotionally unavailable father(although heâ€™s done everything for us in a financial way). I suffer with social anxiety, anxiety in general, depression and Schizotypal personality disorder(or so I believe) 

The past 12 months my suicidal thoughts have gotten so intense that I quit my well paid job that I had(even though I hated it), distanced myself from all my friends and stopped leaving the house. I have no energy in my life nor do I have any interest in doing things. The struggle is real. 
When I wake up in the morning I just cannot wait to go back to sleep. Long story short, I attempted suicide last week by hanging. Had my noose tied, drank my alcohol and wrapped it around my neck and pushed the chair away... I really struggled but somehow I got myself out of it...It was very uncomfortable and left my neck bruised quite badly I donâ€™t know how I got myself out of it if Iâ€™m honest but if anything it was just a reminder for me that no matter what I do, I make an absolute shit show of it. 
After my failed attempt I went to my bathroom and just started slitting my upper arm (even though Iâ€™ve never done it previously) and cried my self tears that I havenâ€™t cried for years.
It took me so many months to build the energy for this, but Iâ€™ve had enough and I know it wonâ€™t be long before I try it again but the next time Iâ€™ll make sure I have zero means of backing out of it. Letâ€™s face it, life is a piece of crap. I love my friends and family and theyâ€™ve tried to reach out to me but I made my mind up in my younger years &amp; most decisions Iâ€™ve ever made have been on the basis that I wonâ€™t be here for long. Iâ€™ve probably been truly happy for 1 year of my 22 years of life, the rest has been nothing short of hell and in many ways I feel like Iâ€™m cursed... of course I have blessings but the curse always fucks me up, nothing has weighed heavier on my shoulders. My anxiety is crippling and the panic attacks have took over my life, Iâ€™m forever insecure, I get really bad paranoia before i go to sleep at night (although listening to sounds of raindrops has really helped me so much to sleep). Iâ€™ve been on different types of medication but in the long run they have made me 10x worse. Iâ€™ve monitored this page for the past few days and truly appreciate peopleâ€™s stories on here, weâ€™ve all gone through different things but we come to the same conclusion... that this world is run by ill minded people who use money as a way of control and that were trapped in this illusion of life. None of what life has to offer appeals to me in slightest way. I just hope that when I finally get the energy to commit again I donâ€™t get reincarnated because to me, this is what hell exactly is.
