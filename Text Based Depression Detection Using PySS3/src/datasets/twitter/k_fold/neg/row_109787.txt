Life will never get better and I don't matterI remember at 13, I was told online that all I have to do is keep on pushing. Get my degree. Move out. And my abusive family will have no power over me. *Life will get better*

What a bunch of mother fucking lies. I'm 22, and I have had the most shitty life possible 

Horrific childhood abuse combined with bullying, and ended up with major depressive order and borderline personality disorder.

Shit Zoloft and therapy doesn't work 

I got sexually abused and bullied in college and my school doesn't give a shit 

Why....why did I not jump out of my window at 13

My mom wanted me dead, and she died from cancer. Why not fulfill her wish

I have no family or friends

Goodbye
