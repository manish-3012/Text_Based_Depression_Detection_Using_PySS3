please dont worry about mei dont think i will ever actually kill myself, i just think about it all the time, like so much. Thinking about actually dying is kind of scary but thinking about making suicide attempts sometimes gets me through the day. I cut myself all the time just to feel like I'm making some sort of progress or like I'm trying to at least do something to make everything go away at least for a little while. I drink all the time and it just means i cut deeper and deeper, and it is slowly getting worse and interfering with my academics and my personal life. I have a hard time getting close to people and that makes things so much worse, I'm so sad all the time and my mental disorders make things so much worse. i dont know what to do, things just slowly get worse, tbh im drunk right now and i dont expect anything to get better and i fully believe i will kill myself one day because i do not think i will ever be happy and i am so sad and dont know what to do
Im sorry im bothering people with my problems, I'm just running out of things to do and idk i dont know what to do and I'm scared
