I made plans for tonight.Tonight's a perfect night to do it.  Everyone's out of the house who would normally interrupt me.  Trouble is, I'm still scared.

A few weeks ago, I was informed that the house would be empty for a couple of nights, so I decided to start convincing myself to finally end it.  I stopped talking to anyone who I thought could help, in the hopes that it'd put me in a position where it wouldn't hurt them quite so much.  I'm also pretty sure the stress from it has caused me to develop some kind of kidney problem.

Without getting into my life story, it's been an awfully long road to get to this point, including one previous attempt.  I find it very hard to believe that anything or anyone could make my depression subside.  It comes and goes as it chooses, and it has been coming on very strong, lately.

I'm not entirely sure why I'm posting here.  I'm relatively sure that no one will even respond, or that they could say something that would change my mind one way or the other.  Maybe I'm just venting the nervous energy, since I'm still terrified of what it would do to my family.  I can't just grow old in despair and loneliness, though.
