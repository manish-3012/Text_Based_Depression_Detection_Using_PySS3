I just can't do this anymore.My life is falling apart.. yesterday we were given an eviction notice and our lease was terminated so we have to leave our home in a month. I live in Australia and this is my final year of school and it ends in November so I have to face the prospect of being homeless for three months while finishing high school which sounds horrible in itself.

I've also previously been homeless last year for two months and honestly it was the most horrific experience of my life I wouldn't wish that on anyone and having to face this again is making my mind spin. I've been avoiding going to sleep because I don't want to wake up to the realization I'm going to be evicted in a months time with nowhere to go. I can't stop these thoughts in my head I just can't stop them and It's freaking me out.. My 19th birthday is soon and I've been thinking of ending my life then. I've tried having hope but honestly it's useless because it's just false. 

I just needed somewhere to vent.. I just don't know what to even do I can't even cry about it but I just want to breakdown.. it's like a sadness that doesn't want to leave me and honestly.. anything is better then this.


Update -  thankyou guys so much for your comments, it really does mean alot to me
