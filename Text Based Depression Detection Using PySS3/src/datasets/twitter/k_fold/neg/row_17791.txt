Im so tiredIm so tired. I just want someone to tell me that I can make it through this. A year ago I got close to killing myself. The thought of suicide feels comforting, and thats what scares me. It's like talking to an old friend and asking them for advice. Recently I've been feeling so alone and so tired. Thats what I tell anyone when someone asks me if im doing okay. Im tired. It's true. I am tired. The only reason I'm alive is because I don't want to hurt my brother. He doesn't deserve to get left behind. 

I just want someone to tell me that it'll be okay and that this will all go away and one day I can be happy. I want to feel important. I want to love. I want to be there for my brother when he grows up. I just don't know if im strong enough anymore. I've tried to cry and get angry to feel something, but recently all i've felt is nothing. I feel hallow and boring and bland. Im tired im so tired and i just want someone to say i'll be okay. I want someone to care about me. I want someone to know that I'm suffering. I want someone to acknowledge me. Please. I feel so alone in all of this. I dont want to burden my boyfriend anymore, my brother doesnt need to know that his sister is thinking about leaving him behind, and my parents wont care. I just need someone to tell me that they care
