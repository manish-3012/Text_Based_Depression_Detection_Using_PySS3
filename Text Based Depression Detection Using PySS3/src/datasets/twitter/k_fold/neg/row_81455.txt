I order things impulsively online because ita the only thing that gives me hope in lifeWhen I order packages, it's something to loom forward to. Its something I can track online. Its something that I can wait for. Its something that might make my life just a tad bit better once it arrives. It's like a christmas box that I can open, even though I already know what's inside. 

But I've just come to realize that its almost the only thing left in my life that gives me hope and makes me wait. I find the black cloud of depressing thoughts is occupying almost all other corners of my mind. But die the brief moment when I click "order item", it lifts. And I see that little estimated time date and i get some hope again. And I think "maybe one day I'll end it. But first, I need my cheap offbrand Wish T-shirt".
