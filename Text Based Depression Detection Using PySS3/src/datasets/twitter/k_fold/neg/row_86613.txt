I've been planning out my suicide and I can't talk to my therapist about it. What do I do?I've been planning out my suicide and I hate myself for doing it. I know I can't talk to my therapist about it because I'd risk getting Baker Acted (Florida thing) or something. I have too many obligations like school and family that I can't miss by being institutionalized or something. Can I talk to my therapist about this or who can I go to?
