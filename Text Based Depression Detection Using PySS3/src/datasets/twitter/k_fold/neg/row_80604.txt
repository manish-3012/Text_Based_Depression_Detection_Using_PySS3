Idk what else to do.
I want to leave. I want to leave this world and Iâ€™m heartbroken for thinking that way. My heart hurts to know that I want to leave this place and Iâ€™m only young, Iâ€™ve not even begun yet but I just donâ€™t see a beginning to me being happy; completely happy and not just putting on a brave face for those that I care for.

Why am I feeling this way? I donâ€™t understand, I was such a happy child and so full of life yet I now cry everyday and I have a constant feeling of loneliness and dread when beginning my day. Iâ€™m not alone, I know Iâ€™m not but I feel it. I feel so deeply this loneliness constantly and I donâ€™t know how to shake it.

I donâ€™t want to be here because I donâ€™t deserve to. I have no drive, I have no passion for anything, Iâ€™m just a burden and a worry and I donâ€™t deserve the life that I have been given. I feel so guilty for feeling this way. I have a wonderful family, wonderful friends and a boyfriend who thinks the world of me. People who love me and I love them but I just want to die and I wish there was a way I could do so without hurting anyone. 

I donâ€™t see a life for me anymore, nothing feels good. I feel numb most days and if Iâ€™m not feeling numb, I feel so anxious that I donâ€™t want to move or I canâ€™t stop moving. I donâ€™t know what to do and it hurts so much.
