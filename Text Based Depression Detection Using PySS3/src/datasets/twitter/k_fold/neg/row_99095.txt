I'll make this short.I realize there's a limit on what anyone can do for me through a comment on reddit, so I'm going to cut to the chase quickly.

I'm 21 and I live with my parents.  I'm not attending school and I don't have a job.  I spend most of my time on the internet. I have a very low self-esteem.  I'm not fat, but I am ugly.  I'm also a virgin.  I'm afraid to try anything new, partly from a fear of failure and partly from a fear of what people will say.  I have one friend that I haven't talked to in months.

I've had these problems since I was a kid and until now I haven't had to truly deal with them.  Whenever I'm alone my thoughts turn to suicide and when I happen to think about my future I feel hopeless.

What I should do seems obvious, but I don't know how to gain the courage / strength to even begin to take the right steps.  I appreciate any advice.  Thanks

**EDIT: Thanks everyone for the replies.**  A lot of you posted solid advice that did get me thinking in different directions.  I know I don't feel comfortable talking to people about my feelings mano-a-mano at the moment, but talking to strangers anonymously is obviously doable.  I'm unsure about how helpful talking will be for me, though.  I think about the things I should be doing all the time.  The problem is getting the cojones to go through with it. 

**FAKE EDIT: After re-reading the edit I just made I realize I'm being dishonest with myself.  That paragraph sounds far to chipper and hopeful in comparison to what I'm actually feeling.  This happens often.  I'll act like I don't have a problem or that I've put it past me, but as soon as I'm alone again I'm back in the same spot.   I don't know what it is, but a big part of me feels like I can't change and I don't know how to get past this mental block.**
