I know I will regret it the moment I jump off the roof, but I regret being alive every single night I go to sleep even moreFirst of all, sorry for my bad English.


I will kill myself. Its that simple. My life is not worth living. I nuked all my social accounts (this one is new), I lost touch of all my friends (on purpose), I quit school even if its illegal and all. Im currently 17 and I am waiting to get my drivers license when I reach 18. Then I will crash into a wall etc to kill myself. Fast and sudden. No pain. Getting a gun is very hard in my country so thats probably not an option. I dont want to jump of a roof because I know I will scream "NOOOOOOO" in my last few seconds. I dont want to overdose because I know I will be crying when I start feeling the effects of the drug. I want to die in a sudden. When I get the courage that moment, I want to end my life. Im an atheist so I dont believe in hell, but if there is a god I will surely confront them! I didnt choose to be alive. Im in this world only to suffer. This was my attemp for some attention because Im extremely depressed lately. I spend my days mostly in Reddit, browsing and making memes like everything is alright, but Im just fooling myself. I miss my friends, I miss my girlfriend, I wish my life had a potential but no. Everytime I fool myself that things will get better, they get worse. Sorry for wasting your time with my bullshit, Im just waiting for 18 now. I think I will keep wasting my days with Reddit til that.
