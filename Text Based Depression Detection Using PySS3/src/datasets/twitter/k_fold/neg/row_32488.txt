42 years old with wife and 3 kids. I'm going through severe depression right now and told my wife I am not safe to be around with my mental state and I will live in my truck until it runs out of gas.My depression and past brain trauma are keeping me from working. I only have a 1993 pick up truck to live in and am afraid I will end it very soon. My wife ironically works in mental health and knows when someone is serious or seeking attention. I'm at a loss with no where to turn. I'm afraid I will provoke someone to shoot me or beat me until I'm dead, or worse, my rage takes over and I beat them until their dead.
