How do j get better when the focus of all my fear and depression is focused on getting betterIf consider anything percieved as an act that could change or work towards changing my life for the better in a meaningful way then i get flooded with an emotion of dismissal. If i don't stop at just saying "no" to the action then i start making up reasons. Most don get padt this as i have to fight my logical mind breaking down all the why nots and fears and the initial feeling of dismissal that has weakened in this second stage.

 It gets really bad if i get past that, i get an intense deep unbearable barrage of terror towards the act, i cannot handle that feeling, i end up full of adrenaline with my heart pounding and i get tired from it. Now here is the make or break point, the very small amount of things to get past this i actually either end up working on for a few minutes until the dismissal comes back and i have to bypass the reasoning aswell to keep working. This is one outcome.

The other is the worst of the worst, i will have a mental breakdown filled with stuff like forced smiling while reapeating arbitrary actions ( clicking a bookmark over and over or scrolling through social media for  damn near an hour with my eyes completely out of focus). These breakdowns are what will kill me as i'm not myself, i can't think clearly, i don't want to think clearly in that moment. These are awful, if there us one thing i'd choose tobnever have restricted it's my mind, so these are a personal hell for me.

 My environment already makes it really hard to make changes for the good, this on top of that makes it impossible without outside help or a different ebvironment.
