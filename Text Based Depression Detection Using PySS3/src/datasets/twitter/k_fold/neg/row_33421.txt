hello, please do not judge meIâ€™ve been a member of this group for a few weeks now, and i just wanted to share some things.
(please do not label me a sociopath)

sometimes, i think about killing myself. not because Iâ€™m extremely suicidal, but so everyone who ignored the signs can feel just as miserable as i feel right now. I think about my â€œfamily &amp; friendsâ€ who would â€œmiss meâ€ but i donâ€™t care. i donâ€™t care how much pain they may feel, how sad they might be, but i donâ€™t care. i donâ€™t think it would be anything close to the deep sadness i feel almost every day. i am invisible no matter where I go or what i do, and i havenâ€™t been happy for more than one day in almost 3 months. i know that what I go through is probably nothing close to what you all feel and Iâ€™m sorry if this comes off as melodramatic but i just donâ€™t know who to tell this to.
