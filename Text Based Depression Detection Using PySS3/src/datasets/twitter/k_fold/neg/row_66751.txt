I woke up this morning...Made some pretty bad choices last night, and when my eyes fluttered shut, I was pretty sure that would be the end, but it wasn't.  Feeling a bit disappointed today, and sick and tired and alive.

I turn 33 in two days, I told myself I wouldn't see that birthday, I'm working hard to make sure I don't.
