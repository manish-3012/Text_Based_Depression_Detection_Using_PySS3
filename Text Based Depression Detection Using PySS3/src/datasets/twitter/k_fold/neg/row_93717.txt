I'm ready to go but it will fuck up too many things for those I leave behindThe realization that no one cares if you're alive or dead hits hard. I'm like a toy they used to play with when they were children, the one they've forgotten about, moved on from; the one they left on a shelf randomly until it was thrown into a cardboard box and left to rot and decay forever, buried underneath a tower of cardboard boxes, like a landscape of beige mountains. I've always remembered them, hoping, probably in vain, that, one day, light will flood my casket and I'll feel their fingers wrap around me once again, and hold me tight. Somewhere, buried deep inside me, I know the truth is that I'm forgotten. No one cares if I'm alive or dead. No one cares enough. Nothing's ever enough for me, and I hate it. I hate this thing inside my head manipulating everything to make me look like a selfish monster who takes and takes and takes and never gives anything back. I'm not like that, yet why am I finding myself starting to believe it? It's going to fuck everything up until I'm completely isolated and unloved, consuming whatever's left of my blackened soul along the way. Then it will kill me. It won't be suicide in the end. That's what it'll look like, yes. But it'll be murder. I'll be murdered by my own head, by the bully which crushed my soul and gave me my monster. I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of living for people who don't care about me. Maybe I should just hang myself. But why do I still care when they don't? It's the only thing stopping me from doing it. Knowing that what I'm going to leave behind will fuck up their lives badly. I love them, but I was always just a distant but intimate connection to them. Just another burden in their busy lives. They don't need me, there's a plethora of people they can turn to when I'm gone. That's what's sad, being so replaceable. I could disappear tomorrow and no one would blink. Everyone would just continue with their lives as they have been. Why can't I do it then?

Sorry, that was a bit long, I don't even know anymore. No one will read this. I'll be forgotten somewhere, as is normal for me now.
