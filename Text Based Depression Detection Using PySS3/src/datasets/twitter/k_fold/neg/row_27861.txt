Have a gun, about to do it.I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m meant to get from this, Iâ€™ve drank for the first time in 6 months. 28 beers deep. I owe the government $46,000. Just found out my wife has been cheating on me for over a year.
Iâ€™m drunk, home alone and for the first time in my life holding a gun. 
I think Iâ€™m going to pull the trigger.
