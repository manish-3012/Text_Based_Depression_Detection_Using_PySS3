I am so close to doing itEverything just falls apart. Ex cheated on me 4 years ago, been single since until August. Now that relationship also fucked up because of me being jealous piece of shit. I just can't take this anymore. I keep repeating my mistakes and always fuck everything up and don't have anyone who cares about me.
