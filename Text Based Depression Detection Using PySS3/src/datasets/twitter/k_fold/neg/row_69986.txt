Lost and confusedTL;DR: a vent that might not make sense about surprisingly making it to 18, several suicide attempts, severe depression &amp; suicidal ideation

So.. where do I start?

Well. I made it to 18 last month (honestly shocking since I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d be alive once 2018 ended) and I made it to 2019. I was diagnosed with depression back in middle school and itâ€™s only getting worse. Iâ€™ve had a few suicide attempts, most of which were trying to overdose on Zoloft/Lexapro (fun fact: that shit clearly doesnâ€™t kill you and Lexapro is a bitch to overdose on, itâ€™s not fun). Honestly, I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d make it to where I am now. I remember the hospital stays, the attempts, the nights I stayed up feeling so anxious or depressed and breaking down. I wanted to die so badly. I cut and pushed people away. I had no hope in getting better. I tried to kill myself again towards the end of 2017 but that didnâ€™t work either, only made me feel even more like shit. Fast forward to early 2018. Finally started to feel better and left an abusive/toxic 2 year relationship. I was hoping things wouldnâ€™t be as bad as they were before. Guess whoâ€™s hopes were crushed! Me. Halfway through 2018 I got sucked back into an abyss of depression and suicidal ideation. Iâ€™ve tried to talk with a therapist, Iâ€™ve tried to get in contact with a psychiatrist (gave up on both since we canâ€™t find a psychiatrist thatâ€™ll accept our insurance and I had a really bad experience with my last therapist). My parents almost got a divorce, which in all honesty I wish wouldâ€™ve happenedâ€”my dadâ€™s one hell of an abusive parent. I lost all hope again. I tried to kill myself again but it didnâ€™t work and my depression got a lot worse after that. I was sure I wasnâ€™t gonna make it to finish the first semester of senior year. Iâ€™m not sure how I did it but I managed to pull through and here I am now! 4 months away from graduating but Iâ€™m still getting worse.  I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be walking with my friends, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be in that stupid red cap and gown. Will I make it? Probably not. If youâ€™ve made it to this point of my vent, congrats! I have no idea what the mess is above me. Iâ€™m not sure if this is a cry for help because Iâ€™m constantly thinking about killing myself, no plan or anything, just wanna die yâ€™know? These thoughts scare me a little and sometimes I wish I didnâ€™t even exist cause Iâ€™m tired of feeling this way. Feeling depressed, anxious, numb, etc. Iâ€™m lost and confused. Why do we have to fucking deal with things like depression and suicide?
