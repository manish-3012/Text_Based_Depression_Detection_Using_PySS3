I was just about to do it, then I realised my dog would be here by herselfI had 25 zapain, 24 paracetamol and 11 quetiapine. I also had my freshly bought blades. I started cutting, not too deep and I realised wow this is it. I felt so ready to do it, almost at peace. My dog heard me crying and now she's sitting on my feet on the sofa so I can't move. I didn't want her to be here on her own with a dead body.
