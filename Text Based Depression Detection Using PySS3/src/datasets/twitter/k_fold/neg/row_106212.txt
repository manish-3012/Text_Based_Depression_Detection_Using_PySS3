Online counseling really just rejected meOnline counseling literally told me I was too messed up so they wonâ€™t even try to help me I get it I need real therapy but donâ€™t they think that if I had that option I would try it first I havenâ€™t gone a day without hurting myself for about a month now and that was really my only other option I have no one else to talk to who wouldnâ€™t get mad or invalidate my problems apologies for the lack of punctuation and stuff if anyone cares
