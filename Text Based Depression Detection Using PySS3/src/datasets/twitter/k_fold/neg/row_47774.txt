life feels like a prisonI am someone who believes heavy in buddhism each day has grown darker and darker as i realize there is nothing on this earth for me. I feel like my body is a prison and my soul and mind just want to roam free. All these politics mass shootings wars deforestation it all jus rings inside my head. This earth is disgusting and i want to leave. I feel like thereâ€™s more for me in the afterlife than to life itself. Itâ€™s not a depression nor anger nor nothing. I am feeling pure tranquility especially when i think of leaving this earth. what do i do
