What do I do if the root of my depression is caused by school?School used to be enjoyable - grade 6 and below. But once I started grade 7 (middle school), I started getting panic attacks everyday and it caused my depression to worsen each day. Forward to grade 12, to what I am now, I can barely show up to class, no matter how hard I try to push myself. I failed 2/4 of my classes last semester, and the other two classes I passed with low 60s (which is not expected from me). Everybody I know is forcing me sub/consciously to enter university right away after I graduate from high school. It gives me debilitating anxiety because I know I wonâ€™t survive the first week of it, no matter how hard I push myself. Iâ€™ll just get a mental breakdown everyday, to the point where I have to be sent to the ER for psych evaluation. If this is my life, Iâ€™ll take it. I just canâ€™t continue with school. Maybe I was meant to have depression.
