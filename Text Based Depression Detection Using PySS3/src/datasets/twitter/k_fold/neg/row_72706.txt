Homeless just as life starts to look up for meAfter a long, depressing few months, everything seemed to be getting better. Of course something had to come up and fuck everything up. My dad has no intention of keeping a helpless drug addict in his home. I no longer have a place to live, or a job that pays me enough to find a place on my own. I can no longer attend college due to no longer being able to pay (was being covered by parent). Thereâ€™s no chance of me going back, and I donâ€™t have any other family or friends I can stay with. Iâ€™m in my car sweating my ass off debating whether I should find a bridge to jump off or hop in front of a metro train tomorrow morning. Exciting!!
