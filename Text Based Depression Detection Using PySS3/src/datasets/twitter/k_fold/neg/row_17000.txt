Time to leave this world.Another update to my recent depression spree. My girlfriend has officially left me, no longer loves me, isn't going to be there for me. My parents just told me today that they will be leaving this weekend, so I have decided to kill myself while they are gone. I will be choosing Charcoal Inhalation as my way to go out. I don't think anyone can stop me now but feel free to ask any questions. 

Fortunate Update: Thanks to some inspiring words from you guys I did not go through with it (although one night, my ex called me and it was tears and sadness and I sat in the bathroom and almost ended it) but I got through it. I had friends over last night whom even though I can't talk to my problems about due to my own pride, I was able to ignore my problems for a good amount of the weekend. Thank you all again.
