Talk to me.Iâ€™m a complete fuck up.
Itâ€™s approaching one year that Iâ€™ve been single. Before that I was living a double life. I had a house with one woman that my family and friends approved of. Iâ€™ve always had mental health problems so I stayed with her for 3 years because I felt proud the people in my life thought I was finally ok. But I was actually seeing another woman, that was love at first sight. Obviously I got found out eventually.
I lost the plot and ended up in a police station having my love letters thrown in my face like it was a crime.
Now Iâ€™ve tried to move on and better myself, therapy, throwing myself into work, treating women better etc 
Iâ€™m a nurse and I can no longer take the emotional toll of the job. Doing this job was the only thing that made me feel worthwhile in my life. And I canâ€™t do it anymore.
Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts constantly throughout my life. I donâ€™t want to kill myself but I have no desire to live anymore. I spend every day torturing myself about what Iâ€™ve done to the women in my life. 
How does one completely rebuild themselves at 31? I need a new career to make myself feel like a real man again.
