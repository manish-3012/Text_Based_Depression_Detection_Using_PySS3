I think about suicide every single day but would never do it - should I seek help?I am a 19 year old male and I have pretty much everything in life going for me. But I still find myself being depressed all the time and being a generally very unhappy person. I think about suicide every day of my life. Thinking how I would do it, how it would affect those around me, why is would be best to commit suicide etc. But the thing is - I know with 100% certainty that I would never actually do it. I would never ever actually consider or try to commit suicide, I just THINK about it all the time. I would propably describe it as a fantasy of mine that I explore on the daily, without actually considering or wanting to make it a reality. Is this something you've experienced? Is this normal or should I seek help?
