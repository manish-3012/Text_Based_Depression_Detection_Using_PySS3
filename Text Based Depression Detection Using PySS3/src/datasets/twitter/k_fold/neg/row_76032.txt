I thought I wasn't at risk, but maybe I'm wrong.Six years ago I had a major struggle with depression/self-harm/suicidal thoughts, etc, but after lot of therapy, meds, and hospitalization, I've been pretty well recovered these last five years.

About a week ago I began having those old feelings of worthlessness and those thoughts of "this is all your fault," and, "you're a terrible person, you know that."

It was fine, but the last few days I've felt like my wrists have been super sensitive and about fifteen minutes ago I got such a strong urge to rip them open. I could almost feel the pain of it and the relief that I would feel after.

The thing is, I'm not even all that bothered by it. That's probably what concerns me most. I'm going through life pretty much business as usual, but this urge, this sensitivity I'm feeling... it's a lot like last time. As though my body *wants* me to hurt it, it's making me super aware of this patch of skin that feels so good to hurt.

It's so messed up.
