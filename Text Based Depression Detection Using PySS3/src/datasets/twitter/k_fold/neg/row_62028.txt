My mom is too nice for this I'm 21 and have been really depressed and deal with mental issues. I have tried getting   help but nothing I've tried has worked. My knees, back, and hands are fucked. I work +60 hrs a week in the +40Â°c heat.

My mom is such a great person, she does fundraisers for our community. Volunteers in so much. She works her fucking ass off and has been dealt a pretty shit hand in life. She doesn't deserve to have to bury her oldest son and have to live with that, but honestly i don't want to be alive anymore.  Recently my depression has gotten worse and i haven't been able to sleep in days. I don't want to go on.
