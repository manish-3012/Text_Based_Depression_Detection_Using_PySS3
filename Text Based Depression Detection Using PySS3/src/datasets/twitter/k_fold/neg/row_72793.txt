I promised myself that guilt would only be a temporary reason to be alive. It's been almost a year since I said that.I can't take it anymore. I look around and feel like I should just die. I feel suffocated within my own life and not a single part of it seems to be showing any promise of getting better. I try, good fucking god do I try, but shit just becomes so hopeless to the point I really feel like if I could just press a switch and simply dissapear, no slow death or fucking up but simply dissapearing I would've been weak enough to do so.

But I can't, because I managed to surround myself with friends who even though I love need as much as love and support as the one I desire. I can't let them down I can't fuck up yet again. Even if I will no longer be there for the guilt just... I can't even imagine letting them down, thinking they will have a lifetime without support after being told how much I help.. I have to put up with this from guilt alone.
