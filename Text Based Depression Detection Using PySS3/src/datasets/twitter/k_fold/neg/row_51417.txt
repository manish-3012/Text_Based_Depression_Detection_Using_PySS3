Struggling HardHello everyone. Salutations, as it be.

I'll be honest; I never wanted to join or even come to this subreddit. I thought that if I did, I would be invalidating all of the progress I've made and basically admitting that I've given up. I've struggled so long on my own to get to even a slight sense of normalcy - this is kind of a last hope.

I'm struggling with a strange addiction. I'm not sure if I can even classify it as such yet, but I'm already feeling it. Long story short, I think I'm addicted to one of my meds (Bupropion) after taking more than my prescribed dose (and over the upper limit of dosing). Sometimes, all I can think about is wanting more. It's slowly killing me, but I want more. I'm afraid that tomorrow I'm just going to take all that I have from before and take it all. I don't know if it would be lethal, but I almost wish it was.

I'm alone. Making a list of friends the other day, I realized my list of close friends is exactly zero. That's mostly my fault, but I'll go into detail if someone cares.

Honestly, there's not much more I want to do right now than either drink myself into oblivion or just end it all. Does anyone have any inspiration or ideas? I'm sorry for all of this, but I can't tell this to anyone else.

Thanks for anything and everything.
