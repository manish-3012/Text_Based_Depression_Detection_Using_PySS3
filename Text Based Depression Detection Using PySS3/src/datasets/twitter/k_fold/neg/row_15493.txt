There's no point to this...I'm not going to kill myself... Every time I've tried, I've failed. So I'm stuck here another day, praying I don't wake up tomorrow because it'll be another day I have to face how fucking awful I am... Because I hurt the only person who ever truly made me happy and now she just sees a monster in me.

And then the empty words of the people around me: 'You're not a monster', but I am... My heart is hollow, and the only reason I don't leave them all behind is because I can't fight the pain long enough to just become a fucking ceiling decoration. I wish I had died before I could ever have hurt her...

Dear God, or whatever power is out there, please just don't let me wake up tomorrow...
