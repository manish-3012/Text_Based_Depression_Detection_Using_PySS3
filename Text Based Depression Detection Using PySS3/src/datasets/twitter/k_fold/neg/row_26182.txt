Iâ€™m fed up dealing with suicidal thoughts and Iâ€™m going to take my own lifeI grew up abused by my father. Nobody in my family cared, and I never told an outside person. I joined the mental health hospital services when I was just 12. I was diagnosed with OCD, anxiety disorder and depression. Later in my life when I was 18 I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I canâ€™t even describe to you the pain of living with these illnesses every day. I have no control over my mood swings. I can go from being mildly okay to suicidal within the span of 2 minutes. This is no way for someone to live. It is beyond exhausting. I cannot do this anymore. I have been seeing psychiatrists my entire life and Iâ€™ve never felt any better. Iâ€™ve been on a million different meds and nothing helps. Its the end. Iâ€™m so sorry to my mother. Iâ€™m going to take a mixture of all of my medications that Iâ€™ve hidden and steal all of the painkillers in the house and drink a bottle of bleach.
