All my progress had been in vain, and disappearedMy summer was awesome. I thought i changed. 
No i didn't. I'm still that depressive piece of shit. School made my whole progress, all my efforts, all my changes disappear like nothing. I thought i renewed myself. I thought it was over. I really did. After years of being tired, after years of me wanting to die, i though i finally made a progress.

And then i realize, that i'm still STILL stuck in this condition, no it did not go away. It never goes away, and i'm afraid it never will...

 I'm still a massive, ugly piece of  anixiety and i hate it. I want to die, but i know i can't. It's so stressful, i hate it so much. 
I wish i wouldn't have to feel like this. I wish i woudn't have to exist.
