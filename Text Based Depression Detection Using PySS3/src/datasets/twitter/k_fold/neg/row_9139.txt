Abusive Relationship is killing me. Please help.Hi.

Im a male in my twenties. For a really long time I have been quiet about this, but I cant just stand it anymore. the pain is too big. I have been suffering emotional and physical abuse from my mother all my life.

Its unbearable. The constant humiliation. The guilt-tripping, the lies and the manipulation. The feeling of whortlesness. Its eating at the core of my being. And snatching away my dignity.

My parents separated when I little, which left my mother as a pile of alcoholic mess. where she would DUI and spank us violently. then she would lie to all of the family saying nothing happened, and they all turned a blind eye.

Nowadays she doesnt drink as much, but her violent episodes are still there. Where she tries to phisically assault me, then goes to the relatives or the police accusing me of beating on her.

The worse of it all, is that in the eyes of everyone, Im always at fault. Because Im a "bad son" or a bad person that doesnt do what my poor frail mother asks. All the guilt for her behavior, has always been directed at me. The feeling of helplesness and the crushing loneliness is just too much.

I cant take this anymore. Shes destroying my life and Im miserable. You guys will certainly say that I should just man up and move out of the house because Im an adult. But How? I have not nearly enough money to live by myself and pay for college. Theres just no way to do it working haltime where im from. I see no way out.

I am grateful for all shes done for me really, for paying for my stuff. but I guess this isnt an excuse to making me feel like shit.

The depression has been affecting my academic performance, I have been bailing classes like crazy. Thats what everyone doesnt get. I just can bring myself to do anything for I dont have the willpower. How can I have the strenght to study and to sustain myself If Im too depressed to do so.

I feel that I have been carrying all my life the weight and guilt of her frustrations. Its just too much of a burden.

Last week after another violent episode, where she flipped because I had the audacity to stand up to her trying to humiliate me. Im just left as a mess. I cant do anything. No relative will help me. My father from his comfortable position from very far away thinks I beat up my own mother and my family thinks Im some kind of villain.

Im posting this here bacause the thought of suicide has appearing on my mind at an alarming rate. At this rate, I think the pain will be just too much for me to cope with. These feelings of desperation, loneliness and shame are eating my soul. I need help.

I wanted to live a good life. I wanted a girfriend, I wanted a loving family, I wanted professional success. I dont have that big of a dream, I just wanted to be normal and happy. Thats all I ever wished for, but I just dont see myself with any of those.

I just wanna live.

**edit:** Im feeling a little better now. My mother is giving me the silent treatment, which is good because atleast we arent fighting. Thank you all for listening, I didn't expect to receive such an understanding response. Im a mess, but I'll try my best.
You guys are saving lives here, never forget that.

**edit2:** She just said to me that she wont question anything I do and if I should cancel my college I should do it. All conviniently ignoring the matter about the abuse and all that shit that has been going on. You could cut the arrogance with a knife. I just didnt have the strength to say anything, I just cant fight anymore.
