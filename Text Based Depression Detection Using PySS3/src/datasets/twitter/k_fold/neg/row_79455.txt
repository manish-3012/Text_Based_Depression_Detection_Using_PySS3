I can't handle seeing others so happy, while i want to die.its not fair. how can others be so happy, while i just sit here every day and night trying my hardest not to kill myself? is it even worth trying to not kill myself anymore?  I know it's selfish for me to think like this, but it's hard to really care anymore. I've tried for years to truly feel happiness, even if its just for a short time, and i've failed. It'd be easier if i finally had the courage to buy a gun and shoot myself in the head, like i deserve.
