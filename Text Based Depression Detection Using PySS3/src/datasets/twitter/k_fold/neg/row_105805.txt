I'm ready
It's finally coming. I just have one last chain to break. I'm scared, nervous, unsure, but also exited, and relieved. My words never meant anything to anyone and I guess that's makes it easier. I knew me being alive was a mistake or at least I was the one who was suppose to die instead of my sister. Then again if she was alive then she would have been the one raped and toyed with by the family I was born into. I'm a living reminder of their sins. Even now as they move on they try so hard to keep me silenced with fake love and gifts. Blaming me for anything bad happening to them. I can't even get help without it being my fault and trying to make them look bad. Guess what! Even if no body knows what they've done, they will continue to be unhappy and rot. I don't understand, I was just a little girl, what did i ever do to them? I guess it doesn't matter now. I'm just as horrible and disgusting as they are. I hope I can at least see my cats before I go to hell like they've always told me I would go. I'm okay with going to hell since I need to suffer for all the things of done. At least I'll have found the place where I belong. 
If I could have one last wish, I wish I can be reborn to at least just once, just one time, just one tiny moment, feel what it's like to be truly loved by someone.
