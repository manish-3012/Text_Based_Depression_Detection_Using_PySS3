Why were you not paying attention?I got into an accident not too long ago. I had collided with someone because I was not paying attention. Fortunately no one got hurt and everyone got out alive and pain free. One thing haunts me are the memories of the family who were involved as I slowly daze imagining the kids in the back crying and traumatized of what had just happened while I stood next to my car. As soon as I think about this, I start to think about why wasn't I paying attention, why did I get into a car accident, why didn't you notice the car in front of you. At this moment, the insides of my body is getting pulled in as it it was a black hole. Tears roll down my eyes blurring my vision. My hands are cold and numb at the same time. I can hear my own heartbeat pulsating throughout my body. I remember now why I wasn't paying attention, I wanted to die. I was ready to disappear. Until this day, no one knows why I wasn't paying attention. As I am writing this, the black hole slowly coming back. Hands are getting cold. Thoughts are becoming hostile. I don't know what to do to distract me from this.
