how do i help myselfi am in my worst mental health. my thoughts are deafening. i feel like a fraud, like a faker. ive been told that i like being depressed, that i like the attention. when i said i'd give anything to not feel like this, they said "well thats not true". it seems like it isnt. i constantly imagine myself actually doing it, not being scared to actually go ahead and end my life. like i have something to prove? like i really am sick, see? i want to be a normal functioning person. i take my medicine, i have a job, but all other life functions are inhibited by paralyzing anxiety. every moment away from my bed, i am counting down the minutes it will take to get back there. Then i lay in bed for hours, doing nothing, DREADING the next time i need to leave. I dont want to do this anymore, i think about killing myself everyday. I have several plans, no courage to execute them. Its my secret, i don't tell anyone about them. I yearn for a relief, a release from this painful existence.
