When you have people around you and yet you feel alone.Hello I'm here because I feel as if Im need of some help. (of course I  really don't want to have to need it, I want to take care of it on my own)  
Like many others I have had thought in my head that for some reason tell me I'm a worthless piece of shit and that I don't deserve anything. Of course the things that happen to me in my life involving 0. (family,friends and love life) just kinda justify the thoughts in my head. 
Iv always thought that I can never hurt myself because it's would only really be hurting the ppl I care about and that care about me but its been increasingly difficult to push all those thoughts back and I just want to end it to not have to feel  all this bullshit. 
I have friends but the majority live out of town now, I message them to talk sometime and sometimes get really down and ask them to talk because I just need a friend at the moment (they will answer sometimes but usually not). 
I talk to my family and they just say the samething(telling me im not worthless but not really giving me justification to why I'm not, I know they love me but I also know it's not enough)
Iv felt like this for so long now that I just don't want to involve other ppl anymore and feel like I would just be a burden  on everyone if I tried to do so.
And I know my life could be alot worse and that others lives are probably worse in someways but whenever I think of that I just feel guilt for feeling this way.
I feel so alone all the time I feel like I'm living in a world where all I want it to just not be alive anymore and I just feel trapped like I can't do anything.
