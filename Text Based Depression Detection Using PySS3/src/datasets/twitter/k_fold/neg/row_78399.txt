Getting closer everyday.I have almost everything. 

I have a nice girlfriend who loves to cuddle. I hate putting on my mask for her, but she has a hard time dealing with my problems. She has more problems than I do, but she is somehow happier. 

I am not worried about money. My family is wealthy, I have never wanted for anything.

I have friends. I am active in uni societies, and even on the committee a few years ago. All superficial, and all the real ones are back home.

I do lack motivation and discipline. Like so many redditors, I was praised for my intelligence as a kid, and thought I could get by with just it. I got into university and through my undergrad without trying too hard. But my Masters is what is going to kill me. I am totally fucked. I have too much social anxiety to talk to my professor about it. It's too complicated, and I am too undisciplined to overcome it. A lifetime of ease does not make for good mental conditioning. Even if I do pass it, then what? I will continue in this pattern of behaviour for the rest of my life. I will never amount to anything more than mediocrity, and I will think I am a failure for it. I have always been told that I have a 'destiny' about me, that I am special. If only they could see me now.


The fact that I have everything makes it even worse. Despite all my advantages in life, I am still going to fail makes it that much worse. I am rich, white, intelligent, sociable (albeit after some training my mask), handsome (+ some chub). It seems like the only way out is death. I have been depressed for at least 8 years now. I tried antidepressants, but they do not work. Because I didn't have the discipline to take them, and when I did, I developed a medical condition which prevented me from essentially getting out of bed.

I just feel completely fucked. And the only way out is to kill myself.
