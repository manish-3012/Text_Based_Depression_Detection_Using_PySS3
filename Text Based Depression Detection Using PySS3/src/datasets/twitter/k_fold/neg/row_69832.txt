Everything fell apartThis year wasn't my finest hour. I've been suicidal on and off most of my life. Mostly triggers and shit circumstance. Well 2020 has pretty much topped that off. I've lost 12 family members including the woman who raised me (grandmother). Found my wife cheating on me for apparently months. Found the photos, videos, text exchanges etc. Found her dude and told his wife so he could feel some pain I feel. Doubt it affected him much. I pushed as hard as I could to help my wife finish school (she did with honors) she said I didn't help her at all, and she did it all on her own. After she graduated, she emptied the house of her possessions and took our son. She filed a restraining order against me for being suicidal. It included our son. I'm all alone. I latched onto a beautiful woman for emotional support, she complained about her marriage too. I tried my best to give her advice and recommend she give him a chance as she admitted he has improved and is doing better. Through all this I think I fell in live with her. She cared more about me than my own wife. Butt she'll never leave her husband, and I don't want to be responsible for that. I won't do that to another man, not what was done to me. I filed for divorce today, it should be served at the court hearing for my restraining order. I expect the order to become permanent. I expect to lose my inheritance because of that. I'll be all alone, no heir, no heirlooms, family is nearly all dead as it is. I wanna go home, I want to be with my family and remember what love feels like. I'm one of the best liars you'll never meet. Inn public I'm successful, confident, driven.... But that's business and inside I'm hollow, torn, and lost. Fought in war, done many things, found a few friends, but they have their own lives to live. They can't provide the support I've been needing. My wife was supposed to be there for me during these times.
