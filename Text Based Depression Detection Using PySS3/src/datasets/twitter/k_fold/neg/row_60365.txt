TiredIâ€™m tired of being sad
Iâ€™m tired of crying 
Iâ€™m tired being alone 
Iâ€™m tired of feeling worthless 
Iâ€™m tired of dreaming of a life i will never have 
Iâ€™m tired of feeling empty inside 
Iâ€™m tired of pretending 
Iâ€™m tired of needing help 
I just want to numb this feeling forever ...
