I'm 15 and almost killed myself today, I want to get better but don't know what to doI've had suicidal thoughts since I was 12 but ever since the pandemic started I've been more suicidal than usual.

I just got done with an argument with my sister and mom, and realized I don't even have the energy to be angry anymore. I wrote a note, and deleted my social media accounts. I texted my dad that I loved him, and called my mom to say the same.

I called an uber to drop me off at this bridge by my house, I felt numb as I got in the car but when we approached the bridge I had a sudden realization that this was it. I started crying and asked him to drive me back home.

I feel better now but I don't know whether I should tell my parents. If I tell them, they might think I'm just being dramatic. If I don't, my dad will wonder why he got a notification from uber and a out of the blue text saying I love him. I want to get better, but I've never been that open with someone, let alone my parents. I'm worried I might drive off a cliff when I get a car, or purposely overdose on something. I'm calm now, but I know I'll have the urge to do it sometime in the future, does anyone have advice?
