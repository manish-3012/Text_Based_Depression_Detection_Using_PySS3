Life is painful for people who feel empathyMy family doesnâ€™t know what it means to feel â€œempathyâ€ and they scare me. They know how be manipulative and say a lot of words on how they care but donâ€™t do shit to actually help the people around them.

My dog has been abused with no potty training for 4 years and he is a companion dog meant to be around people 24/7 and being active a lot.

My family doesnâ€™t walk him ever, and I mean ever. Also no itâ€™s not my dog or my complete responsibility, my sister forced him into the house and kept him there.

So he isnâ€™t walked and he canâ€™t always be around us because the fear he will poop or pee in our rooms.

He is crying half the day and I donâ€™t even blame him for doing it. My family treats him like garbage and they treat me like garbage to, empathy is not a gift to have in todayâ€™s world, itâ€™s just a fucking curse.

My dad tormented me daily all my life since I was born and my mom kept her mouth shut, then I had a long te relationship cheat on me and every day I have to live with the fact that cold hearted people are the only ones who can be happy in this world.

Seriously fuck anyone for thinking god exists, just fuck everything. The only reason I am not dead yet is because I think these fucks deserve to burn in fire for 100s of years.
