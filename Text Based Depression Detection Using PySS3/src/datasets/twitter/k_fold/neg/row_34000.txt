My life is guided by my death wishIt has been years since I started to think seriously about suicide. The thing is I know it will be very painful for the few people who care about me.  But I want to die so badly ... Eventually I found a solution. I wanted to make it look like an accident. So I started to skydive with wingsuit basejumping in mind. What a cool/fun way to go, and my life would have been much more interesting before dying.

"He died following his dreams" is much better than "He killed himself because he was to weak for this life".

I ran out of money before having enough skydiving experience to do wingsuit. So I dropped out of college, joined the military. Fed and lodged free of charge = More money for skydive, more fun and dying faster. 

But I got badly injured, and I'm stuck in my parent's house. I don't know when I will be able to go back to work, go back to skydive, and I really want to end everything right now. 

It was so painful to fake smiles today. Some years ago, I found a peaceful and painless way to go, and I really want to do it now ... I feel like I cannot wait anymore.

Sorry for my english, it's not my native language.
