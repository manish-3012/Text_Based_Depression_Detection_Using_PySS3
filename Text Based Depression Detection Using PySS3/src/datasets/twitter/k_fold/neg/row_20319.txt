What do you even do if you don't find life itself interesting?I don't find life itself appealing. Nothing it has to offer. I could travel, see places, do things. I have the time and money, but I don't want to. I find life in general to look rather ugly and things are mundane and boring, no matter how I look at them. Then what is left? I know everyone has their own struggle, but I figure "at least" if you want love or money you have something to look forward to.

But nothing is left if you find life in general boring.

Now I can just wait for my parents to die. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. There are peaceful methods to end my life. It's all so hopeless.
