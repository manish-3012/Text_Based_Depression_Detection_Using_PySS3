i've been thinking about maybe killing myself latleyI'm 23. a man, have the job i wanted, went to school for years to get it. I'm unhappy with my job, burnt out I guess. My co-workers are starting to notice, my brother ( who also works there ) says they say they notice I'm moving slower, and seem lazy, even the people who I thought were my friends, won't tell me these things but, they go to my brother. They think I'm confrontational, because they do see me fight with my brother sometimes. (were twins, we deal with everyone thinking were exactly the same in every way, we live together currently because my company doesn't pay either of us well. (At least enough to move out without living on our shitty jobs and welfare. But, just like normal brothers we butt heads) My family sees me as confrontational in the same way, and they just, generally don't seem like they like me at all. It might just be in my head but, it feels real. To the point where I say, well I don't like my self either. They try to calm me in the worst ways possible, by just telling me absolutely anything they can think of that might be wrong with me. I don't blame them though, even though I get angry about it because, I think the exact same things. So tell me if I hate my life, and my job and, all I'm good at is making my families life worse than is already is, why shouln't i kill my self? The only reason I haven't tried is because, I'm scared. I've tried a therapist and, I just couldn't believe anything they were saying. It didn't sound genuine, it just sounded like they were trying to say what they thought I wanted to hear.
