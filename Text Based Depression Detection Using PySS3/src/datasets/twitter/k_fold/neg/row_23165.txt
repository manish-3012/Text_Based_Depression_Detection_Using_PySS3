Problems at homeHi I am a 16yo kid who moved to Germany 2 years ago.I've been living with my mom,brother and my dad sometimes(He still doesn't have his visa) anyways when I moved I liked it here but since the beginning of the summer of 2019 I started to feel depression..I miss my friends,my family,and everything I had to leave behind.But it was not a hard depression then..I was only feeling sad etc...But since the beginning of this year(2020)My mom started to call me a failure,a loser,many animal names,and she hits me alot of the times..I used to cry alot about it and I would just let her do that to me(my dad is not with us currently but he'll come soon)...But I started to have suicidal thought and I became more violent and aggressive..When she hits me I sometimes hit her back,she tells me that I should kill myself and threatens me that she'll call the police even tho she hits me...Today she said something that made me really angry and I broke a picture in the house,she saw that and she started to beat the shit out of me,I said thst I broke it and asked her to leave me alone but she just doesn't want to...So I grabbed her and tried to calmly take her out sithout hurting anyone,anyways she just left the room and started to talk about some shit that's irrelevant(she changed the subject all of the sudden)I sat right next to the door and my dad called and I didn't answer.He said to my mom that he'll call the police on me and thst he doesn't want a kid like me in the house.I just said "LEAVE ME ALONE ALREADY" but they didn't want to.My dad was on the phone talking to my mom...Anyways I let her in the room and she sat next to me and started to call me alot of names,she said thst no girl wants me and that I am a failure and thst she doesn't want me and I learned not to cry so I didn't.I told her to leave the room but she just didn't want to and she kept going,talking shit.I accidentally broke a mirror that was next to the door and I thought about killing myself with it but I didn't.It's been a couple of hours now since the incident and I think that I'm starting to get mentally ill...I get angry very easily and I get violent(I break things) I also don't care If I live or die and I think I have EID,ADHD,Anxiety and Depression.Anyways that's my story
