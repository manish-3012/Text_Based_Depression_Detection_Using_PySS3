I feel nothing anymore.The only thing I feel is my growing comfort towards death. I donâ€™t belong here, Iâ€™m getting drained everyday, and Iâ€™m starting to feel it physically, too. I lay in bed now, feeling absolutely nothing but complete hatred for myself, and even hate is too tiring for me. I just wanna die. Painlessly, that is. Iâ€™ve had my share of it. The countless times I wished I could just pass away while sleeping, Iâ€™m just getting jealous of people who pass away like that.
