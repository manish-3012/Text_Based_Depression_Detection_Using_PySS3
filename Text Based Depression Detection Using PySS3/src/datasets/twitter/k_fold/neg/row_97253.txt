trappedMy anxiety has become unbearable without being intoxicated and I dread after waking moment sober. I'm not sure what to do. I lost a good job because I couldn't handle it anymore. I don't have health insurance until about 1.5 months when I reach the end of my 90 day probationary period with my new job. I need mental health now. I need something other than alcohol to make me feel OK as the hangovers are getting worse and I feel my health declining. Should I just financially ruin myself for the sake of my health? I don't really see any other options.
