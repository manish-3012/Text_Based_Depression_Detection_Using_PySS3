Friends is reletable.Is it just me or the tv show "friends"'s intro is so reletable. its just my life summed up in a couple of lines.

" So no one told you life was gonna be this way  
Your job's a joke, you're broke  
Your love life's D.O.A  
It's like you're always stuck in second gear  
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month  
Or even your year. "

This is even sadder than the fact that I'm hanging on for doctor who.
