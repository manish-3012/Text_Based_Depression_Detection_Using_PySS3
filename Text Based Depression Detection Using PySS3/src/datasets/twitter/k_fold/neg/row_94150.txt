Seeing people in serious harm or overdosing.Although I have thoughts all the time seeing this has made me feel so off about all of my thoughts. These people didnt choose to be here and even if they did it just seems horrific. Wether you are being attempted to be saved or whatever it just seems horrific. Maybe this will help offset my feeling?
