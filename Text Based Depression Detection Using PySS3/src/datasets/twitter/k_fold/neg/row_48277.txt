BPD 90% survival rate i think i might make it 89I dont know who you are but most people dont understand how it feels... you cant feel it if u dont have it... u can only pretend... 

a few days ago i was on a bridge with my phone in the middle of the night and ways like
â€žif none texts me right now ill jump and see if i can make it (a river with very strong currents)
well i got someone so i didnt do it but i was never that close

still i cant stand this rollercoaster of emotions anymore so im trying to numb it with drugs and..alc..
it only makes it worse..
i guess?..
i cant really tell..
i havent been sober in a while or had a normal live..
woke up today and i felt really good wtf but well i started again feeling like shit again
i just hope that i overdose someday maybe today on alc 
i dont want to die but i cant stand those feelings anymore mhhhh... fml... thanks for listening...
