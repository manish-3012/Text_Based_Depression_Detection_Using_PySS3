It all hit at once. :(It all hit me at once that my best friend is no longer alive and he won't be able to celebrate Christmas. He won't be getting any presents, he won't have a big smile on his face when he wake's up cause he won't be waking up :( 

I just wish I could rewind time and stop him from killing himself. It kills me inside that he asked me to come for a coffee with him the day he killed himself and I said no because I was busy. 

He was the happiest person ever and I have no clue why he did it, but I guess everything just got to him. He was feeling the same way I am right now and I miss him so much.
