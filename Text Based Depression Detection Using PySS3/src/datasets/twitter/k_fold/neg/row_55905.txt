What a shame.I'm only 20 years old but in the next 5 mins I might no longer be here. I don't know what to do or what will help. I want to be held while I weep. My heart is heavy. My heart is crushed. The weight of the world is on my shoulders. Serenity, Isaiah, and Dru. Brother loves you guys so much and I'm so sorry for being so selfish. I'm so sorry Gardenia, you've been a wonderful girlfriend. My few family and friends that have been there, I'm sorry as well. I don't mean to be weak but there's no other options. I can no longer do it. Don't mourn my death but celebrate my life. I'm so sorry...
