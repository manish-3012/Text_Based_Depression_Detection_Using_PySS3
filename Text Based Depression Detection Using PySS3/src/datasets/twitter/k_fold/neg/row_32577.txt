Chronic illness - im just sick of fightingI'm looking for advise or just somebody to tell me its alright to think this way and possibly commit to it.

I'm 24 years old. I have a lot going for me academically. I have had a great family etc. However i have lupus and not the typical case. I have kidney, lung, nerve, and brain involvement. I just lost one of kidneys a few months back. I have these killer headaches and i lose time. Coughing up blood is not an unusual thing. Im losing the ability to do fine motor movements with my hands, etc. Ive tried everything under the sun to treat it and the only thing that comes close to treating it is cytoxan, which leaves me weak and in even more pain. I just feel so damned tired all the time. Ive already come to the realization that im not going to have a long life. If i live to 30 id be surprised. I just cant take the pain, its always something and even when i have a good day theres something in the back of mind thats shouting that its only for the moment. That the clouds will come back. I just want to end it. Get an (redacted) and call it a day.

The only thing that keeps me from immediately doing it is my family. I love me father, my mother, and most especially my brother. I cant even imagine what my death is going to do to them. I cry when i think about it.

Tl;dr: Am i right to want to kill myself given that im living on restricted time and in extreme pain more than 90% of the time.
