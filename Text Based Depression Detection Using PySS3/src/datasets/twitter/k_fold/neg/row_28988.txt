Would rather die my own way instead of dyingAlright, here I go.

I am a girl in the middle of my teenage years.

I've been abused by my parents half my life and abandoned whenever people see the problems I have and realise that i'm not normal or perfect.

Someone I love and who might truly love me too promises me that he'll save the both of us someday, but I know that it can't happen even though I love the thought of it.

The reason? I'm slowly dying and realizing that even if I do live, I won't have freedom anyway.
I'm terminally ill to the point where I could fucking die any second and it's likely all my fault. You know, karma and shit for being a terrible person when I was young.

My mother always tells me how useless and helpless I am and that I won't ever be able to live alone, so i'm taking that shit to heart because she is always correct about me.

I'd rather kill myself than die suddenly, or keep letting myself be a bloody punching bag for everyone to use. It's all been a disgusting joke.

Maybe then when I get reincarnated i'll finally have a better life and then someday find the person I love again. I know of it.
