it doesn't really matter if i'm here or not.The sun will still come up. Time won't stop. The pain of my family and ''loved ones'' will only be temporarely. The only difference is that i won't be suffering anymore. I won't be fucking exhausted anymore every fucking day from this constant fight i'm losing inside of my head. Dear God release me from this life i don't want it anymore.
