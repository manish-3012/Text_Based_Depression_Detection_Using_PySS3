I can never do anything rightNo matter what I do, no matter how hard I seem to try, I can never do anything right. I'm never enough. I'm always screwing up. When I'm not 100% perfect then I'm fucking things up. When I'm myself, I'm too emotional, too sensitive, too much of this or that, but when I'm not myself and I'm being conservative with my personality, I need to 'just be yourself more.' When I tell the truth I'm "lying", when I just tell them what they want to hear, I'm still "lying" and apparently, I'm lying to myself too or I don't understand the situation or what I've done wrong just because I can't see how I fucked up. No matter what I do, the moment I do make a mistake, all my efforts go down the drain and I'm just seen as a piece of shit. It's always my fault. It's always me. I'm always blamed and I'm always blaming myself too. I've cried for help, I've tried therapy, I've tried psychiatry, I've reached out. I feel like a burden. Why am I so broken. Why is it so difficult to be with me. Why can't I do anything right. Why do I feel like such a fucking failure and a let down and a waste of space.
