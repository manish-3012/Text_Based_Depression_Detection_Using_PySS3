Rarely ever feel happy &amp; afraid to get help,I'm just tiredSo tonight has not felt very good. I shouldn't have a reason to even been feeling this way considering that the stress I feel right now is so minor I shouldn't even be discussing it. I feel like my behavior is bothering others and has been for a while dispite whether or not they tell me it's fine. I don't feel like it's fine. I have felt off since June of 2018 when my emotions just spilled out and I never regained my old self. Instead a newer person emerged and has taken over. Compete with a new mindset that tells me I need to die. And I believe it. I've self harmed very little,but haven't done that in a long time because I just don't have the energy for it. Minor problems and even just the thought or discussion of my future such as looking for a job or studying for a drivers permit/taking the test just drives me away further. Fuck social anxiety. If I don't get my shit together soon,I have no other choice but to at least try and leave. It's to a point where if I even see anybody look like they are enjoying themselves I just think to myself "where did I go wrong?" "Why do I feel this way" "why can't I join them?" Because I don't work hard enough and I'm lazy as fuck.I don't know how it got this bad to where I feel the only way to ever feel satisfied and not annoyed or just exhausted and broken feeling is to die. I always think of negative scenarios where my life is in danger,because if I feel this way all the time then why not life dangerously? I just hope someone reads this and understands. Also I haven't reached out for help from a therapist or called/texted any hotlines because I'm scared of the outcome. I feel like it will go wrong. I'm just wasting my time here.
