Help. I don't want to feel like this anymoreI'm so lonely. I'm losing the few friends I do have and I'm emotionally alone. I am at the end of my rope and I feel cold. I don't know what to do. All my emotional support is gone. I'm in counseling and enjoy it very much but its just not enough. I feel so cold and alone. I will soon have no friends and it will just be me and my depression and I don't know how long I can fend off this depression alone.
