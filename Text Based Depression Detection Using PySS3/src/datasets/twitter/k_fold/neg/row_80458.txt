Dont feel like trying anymoreI feel mediocre at everything I try. I hate myself honestly. I have really bad Social Anxiety also. I see all my old friends succeeding at life, one of them owns a successful business now and is on their way to becoming a millionaire. Comparing their success to my shitty life just makes me cry. I can't get a job due to my anxiety causing me to fuck up every interview i go to. I've never had a girlfriend either and still live with my parents.

I just feel like I have literally nothing going for me. it seems like people who are really bad socially like I am, usually have something they are extremely talented at which gets them places. and vice versa for people with little or no talent, they have great social skills which also gets them places. I have neither.

I have been wanting to kill myself for almost a year now. whats the point in living when I am so inferior to everyone around me? I'm 25 and have never even fucked a girl for christs sake. the only reason I haven't done it already is because I am scared of the pain.
