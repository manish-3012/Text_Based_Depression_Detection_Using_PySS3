Is life worthy after 30 years old of living?I'm just going to get to that age soon and i can't avoid think that nothing good comes after that age, each new year it's just about getting older, being each year more near of lose my parents (nobody is inmortal after all), from get old and see my body withering. I miss study and get new goals in my life but sometimes i think it's simply too late for something like that. I really can't find any good reason to live after that age, everything will just get worse each year. 

Is there any hope about it? can it really get better somehow?
