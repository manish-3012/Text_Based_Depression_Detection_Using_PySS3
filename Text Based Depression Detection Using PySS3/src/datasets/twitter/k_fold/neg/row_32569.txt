UK MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS SO FUCKING INCOMPETENTNHS has treated me so badly I resorted to private therapy which they are now stopping seeing me because Iâ€™m TOO DEPRESSED. So now I have to turn back to the NHS

My NHS psychiatrist does not show any emotion to me and takes phone calls during appointments. I tried to see a community psychiatric nurse, I was left waiting in the doctor office for hours because THEY FORGOT. Just tried to have a telephone appointment to see a psychologist. Guess what THEY FORGOT.

Given up hope. They are fucking useless. Good thing Iâ€™m killing myself next week
