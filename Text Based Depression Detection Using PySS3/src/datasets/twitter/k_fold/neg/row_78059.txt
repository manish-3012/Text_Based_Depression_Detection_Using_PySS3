I've pretty much made up my mindPeople hate me and I think they're right to. I'm a terrible individual. I've had 6 people tell me to kill myself in the past year and I stuck it out longer than I expected but I think it's about time. The only thing that would stop me is how much it would tear up my mother and I'm not sure if she could go on and she's the only person I give a shit about. I'm pretty useless and fuck up everything I touch I can't hold a human relationship for more than a month unless it's with another sociopath. Everything is an act nobody knows the real me and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. I know I can do better I look pretty good and I'm good with my hands so my work options are pretty open but I can't hold a job for long without verbally degrading any coworker that crosses me. I don't like that I derive pleasure from making other people feel like shit it's just who I am at this point. I've been socially ostracized because I made a stupid mistake and didn't really know what I was doing but theres a large population of people that actively hate me and hacked my google account and shit they're probably reading this right now. That's fine by me I have nothing to hide at this point he even told me how to hit my jugular vein when I kill myself. I tried to go to another state and he still fucked with me. Nobody is on my side it's like I live in a psychological thriller. I don't think most people would have made it this far with the shit happening to me. I already planned my funeral it's going to be nice and small about 10 people in an open field it'll be great. At first I got hung up on the whole heaven and hell thing but I've come to the conclusion that I'm no different from a spider on the wall that gets smashed into a tissue and forgotten or a cow to the slaughter. Most people don't think about the cows emotions when they're eating at outback steakhouse or whether it's in heaven or hell. It's just kind of gone.
