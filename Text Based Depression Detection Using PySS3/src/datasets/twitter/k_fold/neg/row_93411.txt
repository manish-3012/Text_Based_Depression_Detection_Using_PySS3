Think I'm starting to have fun againI posted more than enough bad news here, last year. Now, I have good news, at last. I have a new job, I've been working for more than a week in a residence attached to a psychiatric ward near Quebec city.  I couldn't get any better than that for a job. I'm working directly with people everyday to help them get better in order for them to get back to life in society.
