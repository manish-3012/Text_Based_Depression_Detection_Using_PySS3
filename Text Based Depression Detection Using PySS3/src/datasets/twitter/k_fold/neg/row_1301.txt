How do I talk to a counselor about casual suicidal thoughts without risking involuntary hospitalization?I'm trying to get back into therapy and really need to find a therapist who I can discuss these thoughts with without getting hospitalized. 

I have suicidal thoughts but they aren't serious to the point where I need to be hospitalized. I've been struggling with mental illness for over a decade. I know when I'm a danger to myself. At this point, being forced to go to the hospital would make everything 10x worse. I'd miss work and be unable to pay my bills, and the psych hospitals around me are just a joke. 

I just need to be able to talk about this stuff with a professional but I don't know how I can with a counselor without getting sent away. 
How can I bring this up when finding a therapist?
