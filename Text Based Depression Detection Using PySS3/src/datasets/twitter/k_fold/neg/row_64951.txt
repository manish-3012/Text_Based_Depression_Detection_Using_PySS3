Unbearable anxiety?I donâ€™t want to die I swear, maybe I shouldnâ€™t even be posting this here...

But Iâ€™m at a point where a suicide attempt seems inevitable. Iâ€™ve ruined all of my personal relationships, Iâ€™m now jobless, running out of money, my romantic life is completely non existent... I just cannot deal with my how awful Iâ€™ve been feeling for the past few years. 

Nothing feels real anymore, I guess you could call it depersonalization. Nothing outside of my own thinking seems to distract me anymore. My hobbies donâ€™t mean shit, my friendships are fading, and school leaves me feeling like a ghost. 

Iâ€™ve had a bad self injury problem for a while now (a complete secret to everyone that knows me) and itâ€™s becoming more and more of an obsession. 

I know it wonâ€™t kill me, but the compulsion of slitting my wrists from palm to elbow is unreal. The only thing keeping me from doing it right this second is the reaction from my family. Iâ€™m just so trapped. 

 Every sober moment from morning to night (when I start drinking) Iâ€™m on the verge of tears and nauseous from pure panic. I literally cannot live like this anymore. AGAIN... Iâ€™m not going to do anything right now but I just need to vent a bit.. Iâ€™ll probably delete this post later on but right now I canâ€™t believe how close I am to killing myself.
