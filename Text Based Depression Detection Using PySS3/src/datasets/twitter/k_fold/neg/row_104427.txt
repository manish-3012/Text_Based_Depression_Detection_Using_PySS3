I almost did it yesterdayI had the pills in my hand, ready to put them in my mouth. For some reason, I hesitated. I don't know why, but it felt like a rope was tied to my hand, and at the other end was an anvil, holding my hand in place. I ended up putting the pills back in the bottle, and I cried for a solid hour. I don't know what made me pull back. Stubbornness? Fear? The dying hope left in me that everything will work out? I might never know. What I do know is that my life is sad and boring. I can't even find motivation to play games. I just wish I could disappear and never look back.
