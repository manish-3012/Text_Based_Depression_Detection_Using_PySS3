Another friend down the drain...So last night I basically collapsed, i think my depression follows this sort of circle that lasts from anywhere between a week to 4 months. But anyway Iâ€™m back to square one, feeling anxious and depersonalised and numb, but also feeling pain and bitterness. My father has alcoholism and he and my mother abused me pretty bad until 10-11yrs. Last night he drank around 15-20 beers so i stayed out his way.

Anyway I was extremely depressed and felt worthless and my â€œfriendâ€ made a joke that they wanted 20 beers. Now obviously this really upset me and I asked her to not make jokes about engaging in the same behaviour as my abusive alcoholic dad. She replied I needed to â€œgrow upâ€ Iâ€™m â€œnot the only person in the world who has it badâ€ trying to liken depression to a well adjusted person is bullshit. The irony is she has depression and yet sounds so dismissive and uneducated. So yeah I donâ€™t know what to do, I suppose Iâ€™m asking what do I do now? Iâ€™ve got 1 friend I can actually talk to about this now. Do I try to solve it or just move on?
