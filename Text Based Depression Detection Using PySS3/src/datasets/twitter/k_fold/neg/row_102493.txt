My final timeThis will be my final post. 2 hours and I am doing it for real. Will be overdosing with Tylenol and also Xanax and a bit of Ambien. I'm sorry. Someone I wish to never hear from again just texted me and I just broke down. Please don't convince me otherwise anymore. I'm tired. And I just want to be in peace with myself for my final hours. Goodbye. And I'm sorry for everything.
