Im sufferingNothing helps. Im at the point now where I take 4 pills daily and they don't help and ive tried so many different medications and nothing helps. I feel like this depression is wasting away at my brain and body. I could and should be doing so many better things with my life but for some reason I cant. I truly wish I was never born because I know that I wasn't meant for this world.
