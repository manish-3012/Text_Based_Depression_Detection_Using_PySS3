im still herei turned 14 about 2 weeks ago despite constant planning to off myself before that

i dont know whether to be happy, but I'm definitely not

i dont know how much longer I can carry on but still, im here

i dont have hope but I wouldnt mind if my life just turned around and became less shit, but it's never gonna happen
