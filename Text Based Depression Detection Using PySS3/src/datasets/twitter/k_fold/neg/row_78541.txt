There really isn't any help, is there?You literally just can't tell anyone that you want to die. You'll be institutionalized against your will, rack up an enormous hospital bill, and ultimately won't receive any more assistance than you do from a regular psychiatrist visit. 

You can try medications, but they'll fuck up your body and not even make a real difference. 

You can hold on to the vague hope that your mental illness will go away, but then I suppose you could hope to find a briefcase with a million dollars, too. I'm not holding my breath.
