Birthday, best day to end it all.I've been contemplating death for a long time now, 2 days from now is my birthday and i planned to end it all.
I don't want that life of misery, i don't want to be unhappy, i can't take it anymore.
Everyday when i wake up i'm the same : "Why am i still alive, please?"
I can't tell anyone about my will to die, everytime i tell someone it's like me wanting attention or bluffing, i can't stand anymore people judging me and treating me as a clown.
Thanks for reading.
