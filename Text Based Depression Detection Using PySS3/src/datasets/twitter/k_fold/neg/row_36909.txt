Iâ€™m on the verge of ending it all because my ex cheated on me.I know how stupid the title sounds. Iâ€™m F19 by the way.

In the span of 6 years, I lost my mom, my home, my family. I lost everything I had to my name. I moved to another new town month by month. In high school I had a long distance relationship with someone from my hometown. At first things were good but they turned bad fast. It lasted 2 years.

He cheated on me constantly, and he wasnâ€™t shy about letting me know about it. He compared me to them, always found something he didnâ€™t like about me. Because of my low self esteem and the fact he would threaten suicide everytime I would leave, I stayed. He called me worthless, a ret*arded orphan who would never have a chance at normal life. He told me I was broken and nobody but the lowest of the low would want me. That I would end up dead in my 20s anyway. Even though I had a job, even though I graduated high school, even though I at the fine made a purchase for a new PS4, something I really wanted, and he had none of it. He was deeply jealous of me, that much was true. I still cared for him.

I moved out at 18 on my own. I left him after some particularly nasty things he told me. A few months later I dated an old friend of mine. But I canâ€™t stop crying every night. My ex was right. My depression and anxiety are so rampant it makes it hard for me to focus on school work. I donâ€™t know what I want to do. My confidence is dogshit. I get jealous at the mere sight of another woman to the point where I get constant panic attacks. I havenâ€™t left my apartment in months (helped by recent events lol). I got a therapist again but she doesnâ€™t seem to believe how bad it is. Everytime I log onto YouTube and see any female ESPECIALLY ones with blonde or reddish hair, gothic, weeb-ish, punk, I seriously think of harming myself. I almost tried it a week ago after a video where this girl talked about how she was Wiccan (something my ex cheated on me with, a Wiccan girl). I canâ€™t look at pandas, golden retrievers, the color purple, certain tv shows, without harming myself in a depressive state. I canâ€™t stop crying. I hate how much he changed me. I want this to go away. 

My current relationship is suffering because of my insecurities. Iâ€™ve already accused him on cheating on me by talking to one of his friends. Heâ€™s tried to comfort me through multiple panic attacks. E wants to stay but I can tell heâ€™s becoming distant. Itâ€™s only a matter of time til he leaves me for another girl, I can feel it. I know itâ€™s going to happen. I never asked for any of this. I just wanted to be a normal girl. I canâ€™t take it anymore. 

Iâ€™m sorry for my mom. She died while in so much pain, being a single mom looking after an ungrateful brat. And Iâ€™m ending it because some stupid boy cheated on me and the thoughts wonâ€™t stop screaming in my head. Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™m going to hurt my boyfriend. He loves me so much and Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to traumatize him if I do something. Iâ€™m so scared, nowhere I go is safe anymore.
