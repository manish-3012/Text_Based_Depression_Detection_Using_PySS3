I want to dieI don't know what to do anymore heres some backstory on me

I'm 16 bisexual gender fluid human

at the age of 5 i watched my grandfather die from cancer, i watched my father hold a rifle to my mothers head, not to long after that i was taken from cps i never got to say goodbye, for the past decade I've been moving from house to house, on multiple occasions i witnessed the death of someone, on November 1st early mornin my uncle was shot in the head i didn't go to his funeral and now regret not doing so, my best friend in 3rd grade died from cancer, one of my old foster parents did everything they could to hurt me for being BI, not long after i was taken from cps i tried hanging myself but the rope broke, another time i tried shooting myself but the gun exploded in my hand instead, in Juneau a kid pushed me into the road as a car was passing i wasn't harmed, cps said i'd see my parents instead i was put up for adoption with my 3 other siblings 2 boys 1 girl we got adopted by a family the female guardian is nice and the male guardian yells at us even though he knows that i have an anxiety attack from yelling.

I feel alone, unseen, and unheard. I'm afraid of death yet it seems everyone wants me gone. all i know is that if i remove myself from life everyone else will be fine

all i want is for people to feel safe and happy, noticed and loved, i fell the best way to achieve that is killing myself. I'm sorry i don't know what to do anymore. I wish everyone the best in life, i hope that all of you achieve your dreams and that your wishes come true. I want to die but for some reason something is stopping me. I'm probably going to hang myself in the garage. I'm sorry. goodbye.
