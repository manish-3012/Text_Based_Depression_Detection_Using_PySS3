Partially Deaf NowLiterally overnight. Monday Night I could hear just fine. Tuesday Morning at 5 am I woke to both of my ears blocked with earwax. I panicked because at the time I couldnâ€™t if it was because I had impacted earwax or I literally lost my hearing. That was on Tuesday. Today is Friday and Iâ€™m still partially deaf because weâ€™re broke and I canâ€™t afford debrox to break down my earwax. Iâ€™m still afraid I mightâ€™ve lost my hearing. Iâ€™m so on edge of killing myself because my life seems to only be getting worse
