Iâ€™m failing in college and I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m so confused. Iâ€™m failing 4 out of 5 of my classes and I just kind of let it happen. Iâ€™m just disappointed and I feel like a failure especially because I wasted tons of money and time for literally nothing. Itâ€™s so sad itâ€™s making me go crazy. I donâ€™t even know what this means for my financial aid. Iâ€™m staying up late trying to pull together this one class thatâ€™s on the fence but I donâ€™t think I can do anything. Does anyone know how financial aid works? How I think it works is that I have to maintain a certain gpa and pass my classes but now I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s gonna happen. I mean I already owe the money so I just donâ€™t get how this system works at all
