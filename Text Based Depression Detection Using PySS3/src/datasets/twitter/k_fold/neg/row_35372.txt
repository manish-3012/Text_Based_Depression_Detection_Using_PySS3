I feel lostI feel lost, my girlfriend left me today, my whole life i've never been loved like that and i am certain it will be impossible to find someone who will love me like that again. 
I just feel like taking bottles of sleeping pills and just fade... Please, someone, say something, until this urge passes, please!!
