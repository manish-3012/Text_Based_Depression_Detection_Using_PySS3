Anyone here with low-to average IQI just took a 3 part lattice test online. The first I got the answers right and it said my IQ was between 100-120. I took a second test, I only got one right because I'm terrible at spotting differences and I have a disability. It said my score was &lt;100 and I feel like complete shit now. Im terrible at math and science, but I excelled in History. I feel really hurt, like a fucking plate been hit over my head. I'm about ready to grab a knife and plunge into my throat. I can't deal with people having higher IQs and better paying jobs than me, that makes them better. Why the fuck did this have to happen to me!!!!
