Everything I love is gone.I'm 30 years old. Two kids. My wife has been having an affair for almost a year now, apparently. On Sunday night she emptied the bank account and took the kids somewhere. I still don't know where. Probably to her boyfriends. I'm pretty sure I'll never see them again. I just wanted someone to love me, I've spent my whole life being rejected. I'd be an idiot to think the common denominator wasn't me. 

I don't have any money for anything fancy, so I'm thinking I'll just duct tape a hose to the car's exhaust pipe and roll up the windows. I hear it's fast, right?
