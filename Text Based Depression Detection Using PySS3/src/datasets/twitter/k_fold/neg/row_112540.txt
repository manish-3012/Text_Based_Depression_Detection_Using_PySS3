I'm just so tired.I don't want to kill myself. But I don't want to keep living either. Everything I do is an effort. I feel like a failed experiment that was supposed to be some big success but never amounted to anything more than mediocre. I'm one of the best performers at my job, but it's thankless, has no merit-based means of advancement (everything based on seniority and not even then if you don't meet the demographic they want to promote), and it's only barely slowing me to make most of my ends meet (that's not to mention student loans which I can't even begin to start paying back). This job is killing me mentally. I went in yesterday morning, psyched myself up to start working, took two calls, then couldn't do it anymore. I don't understand why we spend a majority of our walking life working with just enough time in between work weeks to handle your day to day issues, and that's without finding time for yourself to enjoy. 

I want to find my way forward. I don't want to be barely making ends meet. I've been told since I was a depressed child that things get better and I have just have to hold on, yet I haven't seen any evidence that would suggest this to actually be true. There are plenty of people out there who have failed at life. Just because I put a lot of effort in doesn't mean I'll get anything back. 

And I feel so disconnected. Like I forgot how to love people. My friends have all moved on to bigger, better things and better people. I just ended my first relationship (at age 25) because I couldn't feel the same way he felt about me even though I wanted to. The more I tried, the more I resented being with him. My family says they support me but they don't even hear me. It's frustrating. They're the ones who tell me it will get better but no one will tell me how or when. They're the ones who will be broken forever if I killed myself, so now I have to go on in a life I don't care for because they'd be destroyed. I don't want to hurt them but I'm sick of hurting too. 

I've been to various therapists over the years and none have been remotely helpful. I can't help but put on the mask of everything being manageable, like I'm actually able to get through all of this, and so they never think I'm experiencing abutting other than "light depression". What do I do? I just feel fucked no matter what I do. I don't even know what I expect from writing this. I feel like I've barely even scratched the tip of the iceberg with my issues here. I just want to find a way up in life, cuz right now it's looking like the only option is down.
