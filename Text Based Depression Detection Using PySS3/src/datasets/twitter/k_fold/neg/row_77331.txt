What was the pointSorry in advanced if anyone who actually decides to read this has any trouble, the truth is I don't even understand myself what I feel right now.

This is my second post in here and I just came to the realization that every moment of pain I've felt for the last 2 months were for nothing.

Ever since I fucked up and lost my dearest friend I've been having trouble sleeping, I wake every morning wanting to kill myself and I hate every inch of my body.
Today for the first time in 2 months she spoke to me and I finally had the chance to get closure, apologize. 

I wasn't anything to her.

She didn't even consider me a friend.

For the last 3 years I've felt like shit daily, been depressed all the time and have been feeling as every day I turn hollow. I feel broken. And this 2 months have been hell for me, I have been inducing pain to myself in diverse ways, I've been regretting everything that happened, wishing to never have met her in the first place. Even if she meant a lot to me.  

Nothing was worth it, the pain was never worth it.

I wouldn't have been any happier if this hadn't happened, and this is for sure not the reason for my unhappiness but it for sure hurts a lot. 

I guess I just can't change that I have depression and anxiety disorders, I can't change the way I feel towards myself, i hate myself and now I don't know what else there is to it

I'm hollow. I'm broken, I don't know anymore what to do.
What is there left to life now, I've met some wonderful friends in the time I was hurting because of this situation but what if I don't mean anything to them.

There's nothing left of me, I'm hollow, I'm broken beyond repair and now the only thing left of me is what I hate the most.

Myself.
