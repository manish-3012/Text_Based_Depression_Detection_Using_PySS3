what's the point of living with mental illness as severe as bpd?shit like this doesn't ever leave, it's constant mental anguish, anger and sadness boils in me every single second of the day. how can i even begin to imagine a lifetime of this shit? i have serious doubts anyone ever makes it through or recovers from this cancer. i absolutely hate my life
