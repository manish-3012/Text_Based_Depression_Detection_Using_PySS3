its real suicidal hoursðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜‚ðŸ”«

I'm so fucking fed up with everything 

I'm constantly angry and irritated

I don't really cry anymore

Been dealing with suicidal ideation and existential crisis since I was fucking 13 years old

Just going through the motions

There is nothing in this life

Wish I could go to sleep today and just magically stop existing :)
