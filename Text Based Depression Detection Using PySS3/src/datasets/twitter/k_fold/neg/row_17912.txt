I think I fixed myself.I've posted here before on a different account. I made a new account for this as I'm not sure who will see this. I apologize for this being poorly written; I'm just throwing sentences out. 

It started a few months ago. I'm not exactly sure why, but I became more and more depressed. My grades slipped. I stopped caring about everything. There was a physical pressure on me. I was under quite a bit of stress. Job, school, parents. It was all dragging me down. Then thoughts turned to suicide. 

I wasn't scared. I was ready. Ready to go through and see what was next. Over the course of a month, I had the chance to try several times. Each time, I set myself up, stood on a chair and stopped. I'm not exactly sure what it was, put each time I untied the rope and stepped down. 

At the beginning of this week, I was sure it would be my last. I was waiting for a suitable time. I tested my rig one last time and waited for a suitable time. It never came. 

Yesterday morning, I woke up and something was different. About halfway through my morning routine, I realized what it was. I didn't want to kill myself. A huge physical pressure I didn't even realize was in my head was gone. I was on cloud nine all day. Nothing knocked me off my good mood. 

You don't really think about it, but waking up and realizing you don't want to kill yourself is a great feeling. I wanted to share it with someone. I told my wonderful girlfriend who helped me through this whole thing. 

Looking back, those last few months were hell. I don't remember many details. It's like a black fog hangs over them. I know what happened, I don't really know how of that makes any sense. It's weird and I can't really explain it. 

I'd like to thank you all for helping me out. Hopefully this is the last time I have to post here but I look forward to helping out in the future.
