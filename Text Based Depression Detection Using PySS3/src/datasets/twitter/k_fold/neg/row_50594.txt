I'm terrified of the futureI screwed up yr 12. There's no fixing it. My results are very low. I don't want to go through studying anymore even after hs, I'm stupid and useless. I'm ugly so I can't just go be some instagram model or sugarbaby. I have no talent such as art. I'm not athletic. I have no passion in life, and don't know what to do after high school. It doesn't help I have social anxiety, I lock myself up, shut others out and stare into space like a creep. My parents have spent so much money on me for tutor, I'm just leeching off them and giving them nothing except stress. I've been losing sleep and I'm in a bad physical condition right now.

I've never worked a day in my life. I lied to my school but what I really did was stay at home instead of volunteer because I didn't know how. I failed to get a license while everyone's already driving. I'm sick of being me, I wish I was someone else so bad. I don't care about being unique I wish I blended in. Everyone can see I'm a social outcast. I'm seeing people here and there blossom and grow whil I'm left behind. People always tell me to smile more don't be depressed or else it'll be bad when looking for a job. It's like they think I'm not self-aware.

I don't even know how to kill myself properly. I've searched how to stab the carotid artery with a kitchen knife. I wish humans had an off button so it wouldn't be so painful. The last thing I can fail is suicide. There are billions of better people to replace me.
