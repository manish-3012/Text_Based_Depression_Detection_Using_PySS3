I'm sorry for everyone who came into my life.This isn't really a post for "suicide watch" it is a goodbye post. I'm not active in this community at all, but I have no where else to write my goodbye. I've been through a lot, and I really mean a lot. From the daily physical abuse from my father the 6 years I lived with him, losing the love of my life and our unborn child, to being alone on this earth without any family, nor friends. I live across the country from my hometown, I have no connections with any blood relatives. I'm just really tired of being alone, I've tried and tried and tried to get better. I admitted myself to a healthcare center for outpatient services I've been in therapy since September, I've been taking the meds my psychiatrist prescribed. I'm just really tired guys. I've tried living off the whole "it gets better" saying but time and time again I've fallen lower than where I was standing. I don't even want to be happy anymore, I just want the pain and battles to stop.

To those who think it's selfish to take my own life, I actually think it's selfish of others to force me to stay here and suffer, I'm finally doing something for myself. Falling into nothingness. 

Thank you to those who read this. Goodbye, I hope the rest of you find love.
