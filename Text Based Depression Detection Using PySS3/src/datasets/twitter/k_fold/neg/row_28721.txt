I'm afraid to go anywhere else. So strangers, I guess.TL;DR I don't care anymore. 

Just in general. Life, people, whatever. I don't care. 

I don't care what happens to me. Sure, people would miss me, for a moment. My mom would lose a son, but she has a much better daughter. My employer would lose an employee, but we're all replaceable. Some people would lose a friend, but I was a shitty, distant one to begin with. 

I've always made jokes about killing myself. The kind that would only be made out loud because through text I can't make it sound like I might be kidding. The other day on the bus, I overheard someone talk about going through chemo, and my first thought wasn't, "Oh, that poor person. I wish them the best." It was, "Chemo? If I found out today that I had cancer, I'd be doing everything I could to speed it up, because then maybe it could do what I've been so chicken up to this point to do myself." I hear stories of people getting held at gunpoint and I only think of what I would say in that situation. "Please, I'm begging you. Do it. I don't have much, but you can have it all if you just do me in."

I know I'm messed up. At this point, I'm used to it. I want it to end. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't have any major plan to end it. But goddamn if I weren't given a golden opportunity to get rid of myself, Godspeed to those that would stop me.
