can someone give me a reason to staythere is no reason for me to continue this shitty boring life with a shitty boring job doing so unbelievably bad in college for a degree to land me in another shitty boring job for the rest of my life. please get me out of here. please give me reasons to stay that donâ€™t involve guilt tripping me with friends and family and pets or dumb life experiences that are so short lived. there is no reason for me to be here. i dont even want to be.
