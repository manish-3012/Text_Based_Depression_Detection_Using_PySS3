Suicidal thoughtsI keep having suicidal thoughts to the point where everything I look at I think of how I could ise it to kill myself. My counter meassures to stop me from killing myself just aren't enough anymore. I fear I will end up killing myself soon enough but deep down I don't want to. How do I stop having these thoughts?
