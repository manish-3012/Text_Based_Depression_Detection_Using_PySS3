Last friend just quit talking to me.The sad reality is that no one fucking cares at all. I have no one to talk to, I'm stuck on a shitty property surrounded by shitty people. My last friend just basically said "I don't wanna talk to you anymore" 

That was it, that was the last straw. They were the only reason I could get through the day and not feel shitty when I go to bed at night. 

That small comfort was the only thing I had in this entire world that dulled my pain and now it's gone. 

It's okay, though, I get it. I'm a shitty person, why would you be friends with me? Why would you wanna hear any of my shitty, irrelevant problems? I can't even keep a friend. 

At this point I'm completely convinced no one will ever actually give a fuck about me. People will say they're there and they wanna help you, but what happens when I ask for help or need them to be there? I usually just end up crying myself to sleep because I trusted another person that I shouldn't have. 

I don't even know why I put this here, I'm just so fucking done with life, it takes everything from me.
