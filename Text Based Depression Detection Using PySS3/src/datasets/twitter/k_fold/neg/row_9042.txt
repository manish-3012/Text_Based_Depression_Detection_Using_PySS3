A final message to my best friend before I end my lifeHey dude, I just want to tell you I love you, I don't know how the rest of this will come off , but understand that no matter how badly I choose my words, I love you is all I mean. I want to thank you for putting up with me for all this time. There's no words that can describe what you meant to me the past couple years. You made me feel more confident and full of purpose than anyone like me has any business feeling.  I have no doubt that the task of being my friend was an exhausting experience that you put yourself through because you had faith in me.  I don't want you to ever have any shadow of a doubt about the influence you have on other people. The things you've said and done have effected my life in ways you'll never understand. You have so many good things ahead of you and I want you to kick the worlds ass. I'm sorry I never lived up to the potential you saw in me.  I'm sorry you put so much time and effort into me. You will never be able to understand how much I appreciate it.  I love you and I hope you understand.
