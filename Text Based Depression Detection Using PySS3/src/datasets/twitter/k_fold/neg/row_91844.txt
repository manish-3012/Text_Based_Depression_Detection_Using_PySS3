It's so dumb I think about killing myself all the time but the thought of dying from covid terrifies meI think it's because all the deaths I daydream about are ones where I don't know it's happening, like getting crazy drunk and ODing on sleeping pills so I'm already unconscious when it happened. Like going into it without the true awareness of knowing I'm not going to exist later. Thinking about slowly choking to death in a hospital with a ventilator down my throat? Absolutely terror inducing. Somehow dying tied down in an empty hospital room while nurses walk around outside oblivious would be way worse than just hanging myself alone in my room. Actually maybe it's because suicide is about control for me- the thought of choosing to control how I end my life feels good, while the thought of dying with absolutely no control over my last moments is horrifying.
