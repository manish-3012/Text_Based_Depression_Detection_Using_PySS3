Reasons to stay aliveI feel like killing myself but I won't because I fear the permanency of death, the possibility of eternal damnation, what it would do to my family. I have a teenager brother and I don't want fuck up his future. He's struggling in school now, how bad will his future be if I kill myself.
My family has financial troubles. I  don't want my family to lose the house which is my father's greatest accomplishment.
My father is 64 he could die of a stroke if he discovered my dead body.
