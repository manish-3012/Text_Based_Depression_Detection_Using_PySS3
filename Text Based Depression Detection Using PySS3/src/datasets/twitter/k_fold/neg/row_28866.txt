Just want to go!I'm 38 and always felt like a screw up.

I'm one of those people that when things start looking good, I'll always fund a way to mess it up and end up back at square one. 

I'm constantly down and always thinking about ending my life, like every day.

All that's holding me back is the thought of leaving my 2 young kids, but it also depresses me more knowing how much of a loser their dad is.

I've tried 3 overdoses with Zopiclone which did nothing but I have been practicing with hanging while sitting, I came close to passing out 3 days ago with belt in door but fought to save myself as I knew mrs and kids were due home.

I cant shake the thoughts.

Debt + gambling addiction + pure unhappy
