Kind of wish my pathetic attempt a couple years ago was successful.I almost killed myself over a parking ticket, do you find it funny or pathetic? I haven't decided how I feel about it but I think it's kinda funny, the only pathetic thing about it was that I didn't have the resolve and determination to go through with it.
