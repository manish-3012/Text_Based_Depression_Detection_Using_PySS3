I think I just flunked out of my dream programI had a panic attack during a final exam for a course I'm taking for the third time. University policy is after failing the 3rd attempt, a student is required to permanently withdraw from their program.

I've wanted to do this since I was 10. This is my dream, this is  the sum of everything in my life up to this point. And I've wasted it and I'll never do the things I wanted to do in life.
