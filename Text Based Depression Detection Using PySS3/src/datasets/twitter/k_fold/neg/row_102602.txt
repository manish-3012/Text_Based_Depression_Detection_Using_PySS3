attempted to hang myself 3 times and failed. idk what to do now.hi, new to reddit and only here to get this off my chest. might be spelling mistakes because i have 0 energy to correct them, haha sorry.

16 year girl here. i have depression, social anxiety, ptsd, and self destructive tendencies. living in a terrible household with a very narcissistic and gaslighting father. gonna try and make this as quick as possible.

my mom and dad always argued a lot. my dad could never admit when hes wrong and always shifts the blame on someone else. each argument my mom and dad had (which hes usually the one who starts it for little petty reasons) i have never once heard him apologize. even when he hit my mom and she started to bleed.

my dad and i dont have a very good relationship. he tends to hit a lot, or threatens to do so. sometimes when i tell him hes wrong, he gets threatened and hits me. sometimes i fight back. he never seemed to understand my mental issues and doesn't take them seriously. my parents started taking me to therapy to "help" me. my dad stated to the therapist that he wanted to build our relationship up since im "disrespectful" right after i explained to the therapist how i wanted to kill myself and how i failed my suicide overdose.

recently, my dad saw my fresh cuts i had. instead of trying to talk to me, he hit me. called me selfish and said "no ones doing anything to you" and "you want me to go to jail." he only cares about himself. then after that situation he left for a few days. 

i told my therapist what happened. she decided to call cps. she was on board with the whole thing after she saw what happened to me with my dad by the way. 

dad comes back now and immediately comes in my room to yell at me. calling me names and threatening to beat me. saying the therapy isnt helping me at all. 

after a few days my mom and dad are finally talking again. ignoring everything that happened and sweeping it under the rug until they argue again. now my moms against the whole cps thing and saying that therapy isnt the solution and how medication fucks up your head. my mom was my number one supporter through all this. and my therapist. now i have no one and im stuck in this house for another 2 years. i decided i couldnt take it anymore.

got a few towels and made sure they were tied tightly. got a chair and started to tried and tie it around it my neck. to be honest, my first attempt was just a test run. i had it around my neck pretty tightly but i was managing to still breathe somehow. i was thinking about if i should tell my closest friend goodbye and then all i remember is ending up on the floor. i felt lightheaded and my neck burned a bit, but other than that i was fine. it was painless, which caused me to do it again. and again. and i failed each time because i didnt know how to tie some damn rope. each attempt i was 
telling my friend, "just one more"

gave up after a while. my friend's telling me to go to the police station and tell them everything tomorrow. sneak out and tell them how much of a shitty person my father is, show them my cuts, make sure i dont go in that house again. i just dont have the courage to do that. i wish i could, but i cant.

im still here in this shitty household and i dont know what to do now.
