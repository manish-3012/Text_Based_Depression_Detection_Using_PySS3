Hey everyone. So yeah, its my birthday today and for the last week I've been feeling suicidal. Like ill be casually doing work and the idea of blowing my head off just casually comes to mind. I've been able to brush it off as best as I can but today lots has gone wrong and I feel like I'm now in this hole I cant get out of. I feel incredibly sad this this idea of suicide is just looming over me. I dont really know what to do. Im taking Celexa but I dont think its working anymore.
