Delusional paranoia and crippling psychosisI'm scared I'm being watched by everyone. They can hear my thoughts. This place doesn't feel real. I think I should kill myself to be free from this insanity. I don't wanna keep living in this bizarre world. Nothing makes any sense to me. I went to get some rope the other day but it seems really painful. It's just so frustrating. I can't stand these crazy thoughts but I'm so scared of dying. It's giving me anxiety thinking about it. I think about it nearly every day. Keep living in this insane state of confusion and fear or face the infinite void and sleep forever.
