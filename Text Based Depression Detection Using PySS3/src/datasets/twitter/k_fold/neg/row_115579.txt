Its too muchSORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH I DONT LIVE IN USA OR ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY
Im 17 and dont have noone, I have never known my father and Im just dumb, ugly unloveable and useless as fuck. 2 years ago I was drinking and getting high everyday and I had some suicide attempts. Then I met my only one friend, we broke up because of my ex gf that I'm obsessed with. When my ex gf broke up with me I started drinking again and taking pills, I lost all hope in my life, Im just weak and dont know what to do, idc bout my parents and younger brother, only purpose that I'm alive is my friend. But I know I wont take this for long anymore. Every single day I'm thinking of commiting suicide because if I did that all my problems will be gone, I tried psychiatrist but it didnt help. I cant talk to anyone about my weakness and problems, im trying to act like cool guy who is fine but I'm really broken. Problem is that 8 months of breaking up has passed and I think I love my ex gf more, with every each day I'm falling deeper into that and I just wanna die. I had some hobbies back then but I'm just suffering in my body which I hate too now, nothing can make me happy, cca 2 weeks ago I stopped talking to my parents, I stopped talking to classmates, probably everyone expect my friend. But I think im just fucking it up, I really want to die but I'm afraid, not of that but of failure
