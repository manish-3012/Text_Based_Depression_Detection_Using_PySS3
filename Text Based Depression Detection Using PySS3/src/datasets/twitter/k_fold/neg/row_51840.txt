does anyone else think thatafter reaching a certain age killing yourself just makes more sense at that point. I kinda do, i've always thought around 25-27 would be when I do it. not because of anything really other then I have no ambitions. Family, Car , Job, Money, basically insert anything any normal person would want and I couldn't care any less about it. I'm sure it would be fun growing old with the right people but that will never happen i'll just eventually end up becoming houseless and die cause I don't care so I might as well get it over with before then. I just want to die cause there's nothing here for me I guess. I told a friend this once and he said if thats really how I feel I should just do it, so I planned it all out and a couple years from now i'll be dead. I don't even know why i'm waiting until then.
