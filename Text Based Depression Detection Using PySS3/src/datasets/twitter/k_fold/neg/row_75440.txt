im done.iâ€™m absolutely done with my life. full on one hundred percent. iâ€™ve tried opening up to close friends and have had them call me an attention whore, become distance, and some even stop talking or stop having any form of relation to me whatsoever. these are the people that say that theyâ€™d never judge me no matter what and all, so i have wicked trust issues which led to the end of a long term relationship; in which my ex then said that if i died, â€œeveryone would get over it quickly and it would be just be a minor incident everyone would forget about eventually, as youâ€™re easily replaceableâ€. found out that he also had a side chick when we first started dating right before the breakup. the friends that iâ€™ve made through him have cut contact with me. he called me that i was going insane and our whole relationship was bullshit. i eat lunch at school alone, as most of my friends have disowned me. iâ€™m the last pick in gym class. iâ€™m rejected from groups. iâ€™m not even finished high school yet but i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll make it out alive. i have terrible social anxiety which makes talking to people a nightmare, let alone getting new friends. my grades and extracurriculars are suffering. there is really nothing good left in my life. people will see that iâ€™m visibly upset and will whisper to their friends and ignore me. people have stopped talking to me after seeing the cuts on my arm. even some adults. and i try to be as kind as possible to evreyone, in which i only get pushed aside. my parents are allowing me to be a guinea pig for psychiatrists and i have attempted many medications he therapy for years. nothing helps. and they just tell me to stay positive. my extended family barely acknowledges me. 

iâ€™m done. i just donâ€™t know how to kill myself and just needed to let this out somewhere. sorry if i wasted your time. thanks and best wishes to the rest of you.
