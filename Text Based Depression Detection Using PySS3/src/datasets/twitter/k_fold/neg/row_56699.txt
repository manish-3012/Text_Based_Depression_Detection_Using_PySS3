i have nothing to live fortheres nothing good about me. I have no hobbies or amazing skills that i can be proud. I havent even finished high school yet and i dont think i can. My parents and sister say im just being lazy and should do something with my life, but how the fuck am i suppose to decide what i want to do with my life if i dont know what i care about. Looking at people around me, they all something; jobs, relationships, hobbies, talents. And all i do is sit around and waste everyones time and money. I just dont want to a burden to anyone anymore. Why should i even bother with living if i have nothing to look forward to. I just wish someone else could my have life so i didnt have to waste it.
