Does anyone else have a set date for when they want to end their life by?I'm 19 and all the way since I was 14 I told myself  I will end my life by the age of 25. I take antidepressants and I get counseling but nothing feels like it helps and I still want to end it in 6 years. I've never been admitted to the hospital or anything but I've cut a few times and held plastic bags over my head. I just am too weak to go through with it but by setting the date of age 25 it gives me a little more pressure to do it. Is this weird?
