I am the worst lolI know this post wont be noticed and it is trash like me ,lol. I am the worst at everything. Whatever I do, no one cares about, well who would, whenever I type something in my friends chats and all, they ignore/dont reply, i know i am kinda ugly ,i dont sound nice and all but i am  also human, well, i dont get why u are still reading this and i am pretty sure no one is. In my online classes, I submitted the homework a week before the submission date, but still the teachers only relied to the people who did it later and also praised them, even though they just copied th ework i posted before the deadline of turning it in. I dont get it, whichever team i support, loses, if I am in a team game or project it fails, i dont score good marks because i hate this education system and I know it wont do 1 bit to me in my future, but who cares, they want me to study. I hate it, I am not allowed to play with my friends too, it s just nonsense who caresanyways, And Ifeel my friends are also fake, just simply there, just keep saying yes to all things i tell them, anyway, u might be thinking this is some fake ranfdom post if you arre reading till here, but it isn't fake. I just want to write my feelings somewhere since i can not tell them to anyone. Just trashy life i have, teachers, friends, everyone, just alll negative to me. I also feel that i don't have any presence anywhere, if i go somewhere, everyone will just miss me out and everyone else will be counted, lol, i dont think you  even understood.
