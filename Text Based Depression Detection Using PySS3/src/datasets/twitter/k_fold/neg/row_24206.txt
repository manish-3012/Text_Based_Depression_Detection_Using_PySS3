Back Where I StartedLast Christmas Eve it was too much to bear. I told my husband we had to leave. I had decided that day was going to be my last and I couldn't take it anymore. Surrounded by family - but already dead inside, unable to feel any connection, any future, any purpose. 

I was hospitalized the next day. The first of 7 inpatient hospitalizations over the course of the next year, including one stay in the ICU after a foiled attempt. 

I have tried everything. I have had 29 ECT treatments. They work, but I need them on at least a weekly maintenance basis, and it is impossible to sustain that and work and maintain any sort of respectable cognitive functioning. So they put me on clozapine. Nobody knows what to do with me anymore. 

My husband left me during the most recent hospitalization and later filed for divorce. I have nobody. I have nothing. I am 31 yrs old and am living back at home with my parents who trigger my CPTSD. My mother is also ill but has never been medicated and it is a toxic environment for me. They are angry about the divorce. They have not once sat down and tried to comfort me and tell me that everything will be okay - that it will all work out for the best. Not once. Instead, *they* are embarrassed. "What will people think?" 

Every time I pass by a funeral home I wonder if I should put down a deposit. If it would meet my parent's "standards." 

I just can't find a means I am comfortable with. I am going to die anyway, so why not expedite the inevitable? Everyone's story ends the same way, and nobody is reading mine anyway.
