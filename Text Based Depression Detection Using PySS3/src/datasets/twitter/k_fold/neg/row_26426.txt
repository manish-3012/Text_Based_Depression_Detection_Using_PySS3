(Rant) Just about tired!Iâ€™m just about tired of people telling me that I should get help for wanting to constantly commit suicide. About a year and a half ago, I saw a site that showed you the pain levels of certain suicide methods, and how long it takes to kill your self with said method. That page had long been since removed from google search, but when I try to find the page again, all Iâ€™m given, is 

â€œPLEASE DIAL 1-800-273-8255 IF YOU FEEL SUICIDAL!â€

â€œDONT KILL URSELF GARBLABLABLABLA! There is hope!â€

â€œGo Call the suicide hotline!!!!!1!!!!â€

For the record, you donâ€™t know me, you donâ€™t know that I can barely get a job, you donâ€™t know that I struggle in school, you donâ€™t know my luck, You donâ€™t know that I donâ€™t have much to live for. With no friends and literally the worlds biggest loser. So stop saying that I should get help when all Iâ€™m trying to do, is follow through with plans that I had since I was 13.
