My family cant stand me anymore and im completely without supportHi so idk what to do i feel so incredibly hopeless. Im 17 and i have anorexia and ive been in recovery (after a relapse) since january. I am better physically so no one is worried about me but mentally its hell. I deal daily with body dysmorphia and i cry about my size every other hour. My family is completely fed up with me and refuse to give me any support or talk to me at all especially when im having a rough day ED wise. They never try to help me and when i try to reach out bc i feel myself relapsing they tell me what a burden i am, and how selfish i am to care about the size of my legs in the wake of all this corona and stuff. And the whole reason I developed my ED was because i feel like a burden and i just wanna be as small as possible, but now ive gained weight and everyone hates me and all i wanna do is just go back or for it all to end. I cant live in this body i am a complete burden and waste of space and i truly feel as if ive got nothing to live for because I contribute nothing to this world and the only thing in good at is having anorexia but now i dont even look like i have it bc i was forced to gain weight, and now that ive gained everyone has left me
