Not thinking of ending it, just need to talk to people.My names Jacoby.

I'm a Jew living in Dallas Texas, I was born to an emotionally and Verbally Abusive Alcoholic Mother and a Emotionally Absent and Critical Father. They didn't pay much attention to me and because of that I had a rough time for years making friends and talking to people my age.

I have a younger brother, 14, Hunter, he's everything my parents ever wanted; Crazy Atheletic (I'm not unhealthy but I'm a Theatre kid) He acts like a bro, is close with both of my parents and is the baby so they always gave him everything, praise and critiques. Meanwhile I got drunken remarks and cynical advice that never did anything but hurt.

I also have an older sister, 22, Heather, she's awesome, rough around the edges but she knows what I've gone through and she's always been there for me; she's got her own life though so I never see her.

I'm a Sex addict, in the past 2 years having encounters with 35 women, many times in evil ways that led to a break down of relationships, I've slept with friends girlfriends, moms, best friends. All because of ONE girl.

I fell for a short white girl, Rhea, she was everything to me and we had a severely sexual, intimate, close, bonded relationship. She cheated on me and then ran off with him to New Mexico. Since then I've been unable to trust people, commit to women, or even open up to the idea of being loved.

I feel lost, I thought I had gotten out of my low periods after my Brother in Law was killed but it's only gotten worse over time and I don't know what to do. I'm in between women all the time, unable to open up to my friends for fear that they'll only see who I really am. I need someone to talk to, to get my mind away from life and this shitty New Years Bullshit.
