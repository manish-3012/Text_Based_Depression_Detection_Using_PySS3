I'm so doneYou know, I've never asked for much in life. I just wanted to be happy, without ever wanting to be rich, famous or anything like that. I just wanted a loyal girlfriend and a happy and peaceful life so I can live through it and then die with someone I love. Yet, I always seem to get stuck. And then it drags on for months. Why do I have to be stuck in a relationship with a person I imagined to be perfect, but they're not sure whether they love me simply because of their mental health. I hate life. I hate everything about it. I hate the loneliness, the unknown. I hate that I've given everyone nothing but love and support and everyone turns their back against me. I hate that my own girlfriend doesn't even seem to care. I hate to not matter. I hate it. I hate it all and I wanted to end, finally. It's been two years. I'm so done.
