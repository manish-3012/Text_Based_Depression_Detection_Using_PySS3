you know, they say life gets easier but it hasn'tI'm a 15 year old, living in a rat infested house

who everyone wants to argue with, we genuinely have barely any money whatsoever 

And my parents barely if not at all get along.

my friends online pretty much abandoned me or just use me for venting (not that I'm complaining, I don't want to have conversations with everyone 24/7) 

my dad pretty much has told me he doesn't care if I die or not 

life totally gets easier, 10/10 would recommend 

I'm moving the hell out when I'm 18 but man, can't wait to see how much trama I carry in my adult years.
