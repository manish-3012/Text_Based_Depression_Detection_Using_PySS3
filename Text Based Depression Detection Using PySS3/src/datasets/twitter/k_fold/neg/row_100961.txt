I tried to do it... I need helpI sat in the car last night with a knife, trying to muster the courage. I couldnâ€™t do it, so I went back inside and couldnâ€™t stop crying until I fell asleep. I hate being alive, all I want to do is end it but I canâ€™t.  If anyone has attempted, what was it that made it easier to do? What pushed you there?
