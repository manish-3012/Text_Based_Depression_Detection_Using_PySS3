I just want to escape this world..I don't know if this is the right place to post, but anyways.

I recently receive my grade from a math exam. I was expecting a really good grade since I studied so hard for this test. But..nope. I failed at 45%. 45%&lt;60%, which means I don't pass.

This isn't the only exam that I have failed. The worst thing is that I'm in junior year in HS, which means this year is really important for university. My dream is to become a doctor but you need to be really good in math and science. I have good grades in every other subject but I'm struggling in math. My parents are starting to think that I'm hopeless. They'll even kick me out of the house and tell me to never come back. I also recently broke up with my first girlfriend (I still have feelings for her..)

I just want to kill myself. I feel worthless...
