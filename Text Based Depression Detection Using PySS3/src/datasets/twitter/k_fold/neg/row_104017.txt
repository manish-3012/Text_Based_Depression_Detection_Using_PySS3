I donâ€™t like myself, one can even say that I hate myselfAs I reflect upon my life and how I lived it, I feel that I have been a bully. 

I have, in many cases, picked on the smaller and weaker people in my life, tormenting them simply because of size. They were outsiders too, seeking friendship where they could find it. 

I despise myself for ever being in their lives. 

With being a cunt behind me, I have spent the majority of my life with other people, but not really connecting with anyone.

This all of course being my fault.

I Never fully became a part of a group, simply because of my awkwardness, or as people from the past would know about me and how I acted; some mistakingly giving me another chance, but when I would genuinely get comfortable with them, would drift away. 

Somewhere along the line, I started having suicidal thoughts.

I am afraid that in the years since me being in high school, that I have started to alter the nature of my self. I feel I have started to lie about the things that happened in school to create a new identity for myself, one that fits a narrative in my head. I feel that I am trying to make myself not an asshole anymore. That I am hiding my identity under layers of falsehoods. That I am trying to make my face become one of those masks that can be seen in theatres. I feel this and canâ€™t help but think that I am somehow a hypocrite. 
But most of all I feel that like what happens so often when I donâ€™t react to anything, I am going to breakdown. 

I feel that I have acted for too long, and that my identity is a facade. I donâ€™t even know what to do anymore.
