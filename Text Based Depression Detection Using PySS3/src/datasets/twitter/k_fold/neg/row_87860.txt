Spending another Christmas thinking about the same thing as every other dayAnother night where I spend hours trying to fall asleep but can't.  I've had depression for many, many years but haven't killed myself yet because of family.  When I try to fall asleep most of the time, I usually can't unless I'm totally exhausted, and I write down my thoughts if I can't fall asleep, which usually just ends up being a paragraph on why I hate my life and why I should kill myself.  I don't know where to go to make things better and I don't want to bother my family with this shit anymore.  I don't know what to do to be happy, I've had years of therapy which didn't do jack shit, and I'm on anti-depressants and still wanna kill myself.  I've heard everything in the book people said about feeling better, but still feel like trash, which makes posting here seem pointless, but hey I'm still hanging by a thread and it's something I haven't tried yet so why the hell not.  I just don't want to live this life, learn and work, it's such a boring cycle and realizing it makes me wish I hadn't been born because I'm already sick of it.
