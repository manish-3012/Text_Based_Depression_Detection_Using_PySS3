Is it weird Iâ€™m only suicidal because Iâ€™m ugly?I find the source of all my problems go back to my looks. Iâ€™m objectively ugly. Iâ€™m part of that small percentage

I should be going to the gym but I feel itâ€™s all pointless if Iâ€™m just going to be a butterface. I want a relationship, I like fashion, makeup, parties but I feel like thatâ€™s only for other people. I donâ€™t suit any of it. But I never get invited out anyways

I canâ€™t live with looking like this. I wish I had an average face at least. I donâ€™t know why I look like this when I have such a good looking family. People often say I look adopted
