Lost itI have fucking lost everything.

Hearing voices all day and all night, they make me out to be a sick pervert, i'm celebate now, i have been for awhile.

Its too the point where i'm afraid of sex, i'm afraid that if i have sex i will get blamed for some perverse shit, every moment of my life is some stupid test to see if i will love someone enough to have sex with them.

Its too the point now where i dont even care about living, why do it/? is this adulthood?

just lying and tricking each other and shit until we die, i have to run somewhere for someone or somethign all the time.

been homelesss for so long, i dont remember why, used to have love in my life and people i cared about and now i just dont care. My brain is just a machine that pushes my body through the lifeless shitty day and i do nothing and am nothing and feel nothing.

People seeem to me to be greedy wastes of life, they are constantly fighting and fucking each other, i feel like an alien, they call me arrogant but i just dont like them. i dont have to like them.

They make me sick. Shouldnt we care about each other? I guess not i guess we just fucking hurt each other the strongest survives blah blah. Morals dont exist its just sex and greed and idiots who dont think about anything other than those things.

I found this parking ramp that seems high enough its 8 levels i think which is 8 stories. i go up there and people from the street tell they'll have sex with me if i just jump off of it and that i should just do it. I ran up ot the top once because i thought if i could get a running start then i could do it, because i'm afraid of heights but im also ultra poor and so i can't buy a gun, i dont understand my life people live in my head and tell me shit and it doesnt make sense.

Its like ive regressed back to being a child because i'm so fucking disgusted with everything about "life" or the extant, i dont want to go outside or talk to anyone because i'm afraid they'll just dick me around like all the people i tried to help on the streets or wherever i was who lied to me. There all fucking liars it seems, and if they dont get sex out of talking to you then they dont care.

&amp;#x200B;

So why would i give a fuck about anyone? I dont. I just play video games and ignore life as much as possible until i finally get a gun or the balls to jump off of that ramp which may not even be high enough. I keep hoping i can find some h or fetanal again and just end this shit or maybe if i say enough fucking ignorant shit someone will just shoot me.

Tried to join the army but i cant on accoutn of my tatoos, i thought if i just went front lines that i could just fire the ar15 and get killed instantly and die a "hero". But i need 500 to get the tatoos removed and then i need to go through basic and all this shit and it seems like to mcuh work.

&amp;#x200B;

every job i get is a lie or fake or just an excuse to make me feel bad, i feel there is no hope and this cunt screams at me all day and all night and she neever shuts the fuck up and i'm worried shes my subconcious mind and that killing myself will finally kill her and she will shut the fuck up and i can sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont care if people like me anymore i'm fake because i feel the world is fake and i reflect it back to them and fuck them all. If i was real no one would talk to me because i am negative and hateful because ihave been lied to by my own family and friends for so long.

&amp;#x200B;

I just dont know what to do? I want privacy, i want peopoel to leave me alone, i want ot be myself and be allowed to work at a job whether i'm an asshole or not. Maybe i deserve to die? Maybe my life is worthy of work. 

&amp;#x200B;

jUst really dont know what to do anymore. my dick is fucking raw from beating off too much, i probably have covid 19 and i never really liked this shit anyways, all the good times i had seem like a dream.

why do you keep living?
