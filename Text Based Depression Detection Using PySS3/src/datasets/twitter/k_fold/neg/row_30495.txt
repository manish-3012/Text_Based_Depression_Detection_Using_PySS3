No point leftI went through a really low mental stint lasting about two years. I had pulled myself out of it but unfortunately during I had self isolated and other shit so much that I ruined pretty much all relationships I had. I don't care about most of the severed connections, honestly, because I didn't really have a lot of close friends since I'm a mostly private person. 

Except for two. And they were really my closest friends of all. I've tried to reach out to both of them but have just gotten...silence. And they're sisters who live together so I feel like they would have at least mentioned me contacting them to each other? 

But I just. I don't know. I thought I was okay now but if I can't get my friends back? When I know I'll never have that kind of close relationship with anyone ever again? Humans aren't meant to be alone. Why even keep trying when I don't have anyone? When I'm not going to? It's just fucking soul destroying
