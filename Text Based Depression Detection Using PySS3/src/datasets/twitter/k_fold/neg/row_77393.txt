Life is... (offering help)Life is....
It can be beautiful. It can be ugly. It can be perfect, or just bloody horrible. It can be fun, sometimes boring. It can be full of laughter or tears.
But life is a one time thing. At least, this life is. The one youre living now.
If you believe in rebirth or reincarnation, think about all of the people you have. Maybe parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, the guy at starbucks, the girl at the safeway, that stray cat, your dog....
In your next life, they won't be there. And you'll miss them, I assure you.
Strangers can be cruel.
But others want to help
I know how you guys feel, trust me.
I want to help those who are going through some tough times, who want help.
Please, feel free to PM me if you ever need anyone to talk to.
