im fucked, im going nowhereim so stressed. my teachers expect so much, they give me 300 pages to read and illustrate while other students get 90-100. I can never speak up about how i feel because ive kept this facade of a charismatic personality for so long everyone finds it disturbing when i talk about how i feel and serious topics. im at this point wishing someone would treat me badly so i could feel something other then everyone around me's disappointment. im about to go from an A student to a C student and my mother is going to be so dissapointed, shes only ever done nice things for me and i cant even repay her by being a good kid. hbjihbgvhujihgvhujiaksjhok she found out i self harmed too, her reaction was calm, but when i looked in her eyes she was furious. ive never felt worse. i want it all to end
