I have a diagnosed personality disorderEveryone hates me. My best friend won't talk to me. I have borderline personality disorder. It's ingrained in me - I can't have stable relationships. I'm sorry to all the people I hurt. I shouldn't have let the problem get so bad. I'll make everyone happier when I'm dead. As my best friend told me, all I did was make him unhappy. I'm sorry. 

Thank you to all the nice strangers on the internet who offered comfort when I needed it :)
