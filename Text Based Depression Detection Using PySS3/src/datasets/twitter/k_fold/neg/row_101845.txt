Feeling really low today...It's the perfect storm I suppose, last night deciding whether or not to go no contact with an ex, and learned an Uncle was dying.
 I tried to take the high road and was ultimately disappointed. It's so hard to make that clean break. Even if he is a bit of a c*nt. I hate that when I try to live my convictions, I end up getting burned. 
(Trying to be a big fan of the high road. Being open, fair, and honest are important to me as well as not getting into the muck...but I'm a slow ass learner when it comes to others and what they are willing to do to someone else out of cowardice or selfishness ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸)
Then there have been the deaths around me. A beloved teacher, and now I'm just waiting for the call saying that my Uncle has decided to leave ( hospice has it down to hours)
I'm a caretaker (which is absolutely, totally, a strain on my mental health) but it's family so I'm compelled to "do my duty".
I woke up this morning feeling run over. I still had to do the "minimums" and while I was driving home I felt compelled to just jerk the wheel and end it. 
It's been awhile since my urges have presented so... AGGRESSIVELY and urgently. The "what does it even matter?" Urges and questions flooded in.
 Obviously I didn't do it, and I'm home, but it scared me. And it scares me that it's lingering so strongly.
I'm going to start accessing my "mental health toolbox" try to take a high road for myself and to try to mellow out but I just needed to vent it out.
Good luck everyone else going through their version of this shit. All the love â™¥ï¸
