I'm just done.I hate my life right now. I hate feeling how I am feeling. I want it to stop. 

My entire life I've had anxiety troubles. Especially as of recently it's become overwhelming, to the point where I couldn't even hold a job without getting physically sick and massively depressed. I thought going back to school would help and I guess it did for a bit. 

I was living with a girl at the time and she was kind enough to support me while I got back on my feet. After the economy went to shit I was laid off from a job that I absolutely loved to working for shit people and shit companies and doing shit jobs. But then she cheated on me. She was virtually perfect for me. This has just pushed me over the edge. I desperately want to know what I did to ruin our relationship but I can't get a straight answer. Now I'm stuck somewhere I can't afford. I can't afford to talk to a professional. My anxiety has skyrocketed, I don't even know if I could convince myself to talk to someone even if I could afford it. I feel like she is the only person I could talk to, but she hurt me so damn bad that it just makes things worse.

So here I am. Getting drunk. Trying to find a sturdy enough rafter.
