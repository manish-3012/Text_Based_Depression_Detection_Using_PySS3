Tired of being broke.Throwaway.

My mom grew up in severe poverty and every day it seems like we're getting to be that way, too. Both her and my stepdad have $10-12/hr jobs. My mom just recently had to borrow 3k from my biological dad to pay off bills. She told me (before he lent it out) that if he would, we'd be in a better position. We're not; it's so much worse now. They made the agreement that my mom would pay back $300/month but we can't afford it.

I want a job so badly but I live in a village-type place, so it's tiny. *No one* is hiring. When my older brother (who is now almost 19 and lives with my dad, has a minimum wage job with plans to go to the state university) turned 16, he immediately got a car. My dad said soon after that he was making plans to buy me one too. He got hurt recently in an accident and doesn't have a job (though he owned the business) so he can't get me a car. I'll turn 17 in February.

If I had a car, I could get a license. If I had a license, I could go into the city. If I could go into the city, I could get a job. If I had a job, there would be another income. It wouldn't fix everything but it would make things *so* much better.

But no. I'm stuck wearing the same clothes days in a row, eating unhealthy food because it's cheap, and not even being able to visit my family 8 miles away because gas is too expensive. EDIT: and going without the therapy/medication that I still desperately need because we can't afford to pay for appointments.

Yeah, I know it could be worse. But I guess it's the little things. The depression realization that quality of life is dependent on money. The lack of hope for my future. The reoccurring suicidal thoughts that I'm so sick of. Maybe I don't want to die, but I don't want to live like this anymore.
