nothingI reached the point where nothing stop me for killing myself, I will be homeless next month (family doesn't support me) (go get a job right? how fun is that) life is over for me ,  all hopes and dreams I had in life are gone . I never thought I will do but  I can't take it .
Sorry if my ideas aren't straight
