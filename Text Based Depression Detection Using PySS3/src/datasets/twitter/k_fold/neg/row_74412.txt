every time i try to fix my life i always sabotage myselfi just want to feel like i'm worth it, but honestly, i feel so alone. i don't have a goal for five or ten years down the road, because i don't see myself alive that long.

im scared and really just need someone to hold me. anybody. im tired of being alone with myself.
