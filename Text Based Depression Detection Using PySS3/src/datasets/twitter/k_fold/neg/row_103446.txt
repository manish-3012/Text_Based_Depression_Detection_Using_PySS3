My life has gone from bad to hell, I'm fucked and it's all my faultSo I was forced to move out of my moms when I was 15, drop out of high school to pay bills yatta yatta yatta.

I got into the trades, got a car, kinda was doing well until this year, now I am fucked.

My car started to break down months ago, I missed a lot of work because i am a framer and need to drive, I applied at about 150 places that pay minimum wage but only got one callback and didn't get the job (since all my experience is in construction) I fixed my car, had just enough to make it to work from the 26th to 31st to make enough money to pay my rent.

I made the mistake of drinking 3 beers on christmas eve and driving 5 blocks to the bank, I was pulled over, 3 day license suspension, 3 day impound fee, so I haven't been able to go to work, so I decided to sell my car at a discount to someone who said they could get it out of the impound for me, the cops left the lights on and my car was completely dead so he didnt want to buy it.

To get it out of the impound it's 340$ and an extra 30$ every day.

Nobody can lend me 350$ to get it out, I will still owe this amount even after they auction my car, my girlfriend just left me so I owe 800$ rent this month and I only have 30$ to my name.

My life is fucked, there is no fixing this, I'm gonna be out on the streets in two weeks, I have no job, no car, no support nothing.
