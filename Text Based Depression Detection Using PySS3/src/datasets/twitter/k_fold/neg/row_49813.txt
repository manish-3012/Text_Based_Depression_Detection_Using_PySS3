Just need to vent anonymously, and I feel this may be the best place.In the last 2 years I have never been truly happy. It feels like there is always something in the back of my mind stopping me, I just think Iâ€™m too sensitive and things affect me more than others. Itâ€™s gotten to a point where Iâ€™ve sort of accepted thatâ€™s just how I am and will always be I guess?

It all started when I got into my first starting seeing a girl when I was 19 years old, and I completely fell for her.  After a few months she ended it and it completely crushed me, I couldnâ€™t sleep, eat and had no interest in socialising. Although it was a few months it was so intense for me as she was my first and it was the first girl who had really shown any interest, so it was a bit of a shock to the system and I just couldnâ€™t handle it when it finished. It took me a good 4-6 months to get fully over her, we both went out every weekend and sort of mix in the same circles so I saw her a few times and my heart would just sink every time I saw her. 
I am now fully over her and I actually feel I have a grown as a person because of it, and we talk occasionally now and I would consider her as a friend. However the same sort of thing happened again recently and it has hit me just as hard. The worst thing is that I thought I had grown out of this and thought I was stronger, but it seems like itâ€™s just reassured me that I just canâ€™t handle whatever this is. I canâ€™t just â€œget over itâ€. 

I just find it all so constant and exhausting. Itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t have a support group, I have a brilliant group of friends who I see constantly throughout the week, and I just feel like I shouldnâ€™t be like this. There are people much worse off than me, but Iâ€™m just never going to be happy. 

I don't want to kill myself, I just don't want to be alive.
