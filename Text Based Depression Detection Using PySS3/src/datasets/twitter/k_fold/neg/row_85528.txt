Please talk to me.I've gotten in a huge argument with my roomate tonight and I've said very hurtful things. It was so stupid and ridiculous. I've really fucked up. He went to bed mad at me, just had to walk away because he has to get sleep for work tomorrow in the middle of it. I kind of snapped out of it but no amount of sorrys help when they're walking into their bedroom. 




I already called the national suicide hotline but it didn't really help me. I talked for about 40 minutes but kept talking in circles and didn't really get anywhere, eventually she had to leave me to take other calls. I took some sleeping pills (the right dose, not an attempt) because I can't fall asleep. I hope they kick in soon but I'm terrified of tomorrow. I don't know what terms we'll be on. Will he act like I'm not there, will he start being rude to me, will he act like nothing happened? I want to make it up to him. 




He said hurtful things too, but they're just hurtful because I don't like thinking about them. What he said about me is 100% true. What I said to him was an immature, exaggerated retaliation because I got defensive. And wow. I have fucked up. I've fucked up so bad. I can't wake him up and go into in depth apology about how much I appreciate him. I've done those before - what I say is true and heartfelt - but it doesn't mean anything to him. And frankly, it isn't sustainable for me to live up to. He's the kind of person who takes an apology over the course of peaceful days. 




I don't want to lose him as a friend. Tonight he doesn't want to live with me anymore, but is basically not kicking me out because he doesn't want me to be homeless because he knows I need him right now (pity). I havehad a huge, annoying crush on him (somewhat part of the argument), but I know those feelings are pretty stupid and logically I can see we don't get along or have the same outlook/goals in life.
