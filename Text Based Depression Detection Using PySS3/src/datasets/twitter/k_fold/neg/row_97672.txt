Nothing urgent, just need to get some stuff out.First off, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I've felt suicidal for a long time, several years. It started when my ex fiance broke up with me out of the blue. We'd been engaged for three years and she was my first love, needless to say it hit me pretty hard. I went to a shrink and also went to a support group at my school. Nothing really helped. My life pretty much fell apart afterward (in my eyes at least). I had planned my future around her. We were far too involved in each other's lives for the relationship to work out, she just saw that before I did. After the breakup everything just seemed so pointless. I became co-captain of my college team (not going to say what sport as that would be an easy identifier) and I tried to throw myself into athletics. But that just distracted me temporarily, and not very well. Not a week has gone by since the breakup that I haven't thought about killing myself. I think the only thing stopping me is my parents.

I have the absolute greatest parents in the world. They love me unconditionally and would do anything for me. I know just how much it would hurt my parents if I killed myself. It would devastate my mom. My father actually has been fighting cancer for quite some time and I feel if I killed myself it would kill him as well. With my dad and I gone I don't know what would happen to my mom, I only know that it would hurt her more than anything. And I don't want to cause any pain to my father either.

Despite that I've wondered if I would really stop myself if I had a gun. That's how I would do it anyway, quick and painless. I feel part of me would want to just say "fuck it" and end it all if I actually had the means. I've thought about swallowing my current girlfriend's sleeping pills, but I'm not sure if that would really do the job. And I don't want to survive if I attempt suicide. I feel failing would make my life even worse. There would always be those wondering if I did it for the attention. I think I'd become even more depressed. So I haven't swallowed the pills.

I've lost all purpose in my life. I had a clear direction I was going in and the path just disappeared from under my feet. I haven't been able to find my way since then and despite having a great life (I really can't complain about anything) I just want to end it all.

And don't get me wrong, I'm not pining over my ex. Yes, I will always have feelings for her, just like anyone would for someone they loved. But I have no desire to get back together with her. This is about what my life has become since then. I'm lost, unmotivated, I have no direction, and I don't think I will ever find my way again. I seriously think once both my parents die I will kill myself. Yes, I will hurt others who know me, but no one cares for me like they do so it won't be as hard on them.

As I said in the title, this isn't urgent. I'm not going to kill myself tonight, tomorrow, or even next week. But it's something I feel I will do eventually. I'm a young adult that should have his life started by now; but I feel I've started over and I'm stuck at the starting line, unable to exit the gate. Is this reason enough to kill myself? Probably not to most people. It certainly feels selfish and unreasonable to me. But sadly it also feels the most right as well.

Thanks for your time.

Edit: I've also had several health issues over the past few years that I feel have added to my depression. Some of them are permanent and some will eventually get better. But they still suck.
