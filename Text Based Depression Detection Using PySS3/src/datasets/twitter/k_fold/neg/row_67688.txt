I tried to kill myself last nightLike the title states I(f28) tried to kill myself last night, I would probably be dead if I didn't freak at the amount of blood pouring from my wrist and didn't want to leave a bloody mess.   I'm over this, I've been over life since I was about 5 and has just been getting worse ever since.  I always wish I had died in hospital when I was 14, or that I might die in my sleep.   I woke up even sadder this morning at the realisation that I didn't bleed out in my sleep.   I don't feel like I belong on this planet.
