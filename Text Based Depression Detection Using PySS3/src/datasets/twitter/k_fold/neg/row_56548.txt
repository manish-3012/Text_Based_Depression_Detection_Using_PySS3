Do we care.Do people really care? I wish I knew if I still did. I have reasons to be happy. But I can't feel it. I feel nothing. People close to me are beginning to feel like they mean less and less. They say suicide is selfish. But, why should I care? There is a lot I would like to say. But I find it hard for me to want to even try to say it. I just want to let go, before I lose myself, and those around me Completely. I don't know. Pressing submit is a lot harder than I thought.
