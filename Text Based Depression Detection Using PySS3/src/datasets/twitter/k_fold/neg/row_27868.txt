I Canâ€™t StopI have terrible intrusive thoughts every day and theyâ€™re getting so much worse. I think of killing myself all the time now. The stress that accompanies the intrusive thoughts is just awful. Most of the time Iâ€™m able to keep it to myself but sometimes Iâ€™ve been saying my thoughts out loud or groaning from the pain. Itâ€™s been happening so often that Iâ€™ve fallen into a pit of despair where all I can see are my failures, inadaquicies and the ever-present â€˜way outâ€™. What can I do? Iâ€™m so scared and I feel like I canâ€™t talk to anyone about it.
