I wanna kill myselfEverythingâ€™s just so tiring nowadays, since quarantine started Iâ€™ve been just fucking my bonds with everyone of my friends, i feel so miserable, my girlfriend is sad and i canâ€™t even go see her, I donâ€™t have friends anymore, my parents hate me, if I just end everything I guess no one will notice and everything will just fade away, just like my meaningless life.
