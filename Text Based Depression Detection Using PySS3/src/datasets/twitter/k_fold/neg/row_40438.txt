How long can i do thisIt seems like everyone i know and trusted is using me or lying to me. My parents have been going through my property and reading personal diaries.I know because my diaries keep getting moved from the usual secret spot i put them. I confronted them about it and they said i have no privacy in the house and they have a right to read what they want to read including my personal things.I'm 18 years old getting ready to leave for college and i wouldn't let this get to me so much if it wasn't for the fact they treated me bad for my whole life.My self esteem is very low and i have weight issues I've always been told i'm fat even though i know i'm not but i still purge anyway. I've put down and mistreated badly even by my so called friends.I found out my bf is cheating on me and doesn't even care if i know so i guess i shouldn't care either right?But i do.My so called friends have been talking bad about me to everyone and its not like this just started its been going on for awhile i just recently found out.I found out its been going on since we've been friends back in 5th grade.A part of me knew though.I try to act like nothings wrong but its getting to me and it hurts.I've started cutting myself to punish myself for being such a fool.I've been a loner pretty much my whole life I've only had a group of friends who were fake anyway.My parents never seem to really care about me.If my wrist bleed in front of them i don't think it would bother them.So i put up a mask everyday to hide the pain i feel inside because even if i show it no one will care.I guess being a loner and cutter is something i'll always be.
