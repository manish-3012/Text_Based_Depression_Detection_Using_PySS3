I... would like someone to talk to. About all of this darkness and seeming despair that is not mine.It is difficult...

I feel selfish for even saying so. A lot of people are trapped in an unhappiness of their own. I am currently in a better place, but some things just don't go.

Regardless, I tend to worry for others and it complicates my own life and feelings. I have tried calling a hotline before, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for. It was as if all the same motions were being made, and the same thoughts echoed without solution. Only an air of extreme caution born of self-preservation and professionalism. And... I don't expect a solution, truthfully. Because sometimes things just don't have one. Or at least one that we like. I just... would like someone to talk to about it.

It's bizarre. I just... trust reddit more, I suppose. It is an irrational misplaced sense of community that comforts me. As if someone like-minded would be here. I am hoping someone will have a Skype, or be comfortable with voice chatting. If not, a chat system or even simply PMs.

I do not know, really. I am echoing thoughts in a vulnerable moment. Perhaps even being selfish in my expectations. At least, if nothing else, I know I am not alone in the complexities of the world after reading some of the posts here. There is both comfort and sadness in a shared unhappiness.
