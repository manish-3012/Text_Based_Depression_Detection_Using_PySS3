Nothing takes the pain awayI've taken meds...became religous and even bought self help books but absolutely nothing takes away the emotional pain.  

I'm a loser. I work a pointless Government job, I'm in debt, can't get a date. Have zero friends. My family won't talk to me. No significant other nothing. 

What the hell can I do?
