I have a day and a planIâ€™m nearly 40 and Iâ€™ve been battling this for my whole life. Iâ€™ve had my plan which is a backup after having been hospitalized once. I now have a date, today I decided to do it on the day I turn 40. 

I still need to figure out a place and time and organize a farewell tour.
