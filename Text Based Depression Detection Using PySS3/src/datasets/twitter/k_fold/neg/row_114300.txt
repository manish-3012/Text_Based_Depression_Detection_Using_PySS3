Iâ€™m 18 and only now just realizing how incredibly stupid and incapable I am.I never was very smart, but it took me a long time to realize. I would have occasional moments of frustration with myself when I was younger while in class, but I would internalize it. As I grew older, into my teens, I really should have seen it. I had countless problems suddenly with socializing, my behavior, keeping up in class, and horrible outbursts with my family. I found a sense of self in art, which is the only thing Iâ€™m good at. This allowed me to ignore most of my issues, and even allowed me to think I was highly intelligent. My principle even called me a genius, and I thought so to. Looking back, it was so incredibly obvious that I was far, far from a genius, and far from your average person. I can think of countless things Iâ€™ve done that I thought were â€˜smartâ€™ that were actually INCREDIBLY stupid, leaving it out in the open for anyone to see how dumb I was. I once thought putting your hand on your chin and staying still was how you thought, or that it was completely normal (if not amazing) to wear a trench coat and sunglasses everywhere you go. I  have no work experience, Iâ€™m lazy, unfocused, and only now, only now just realizing how pathetic I am. There are plenty of children who have achieved much more than me, and who could easily spot me as the idiot in the room. I have no doubt about it anymore, my life will be hell.
