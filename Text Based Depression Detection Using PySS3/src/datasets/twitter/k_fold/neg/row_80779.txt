Everything is the sameThere is no good or evil. There is no order or chaos. There are just  things to bring us comfort until our inevitable death. It's all the same thing at different times. Someone probably thought the same thing I have. I don't know if any of this makes sense but what I'm trying to say is that nothing is grounding me to this world and I might just float off.
