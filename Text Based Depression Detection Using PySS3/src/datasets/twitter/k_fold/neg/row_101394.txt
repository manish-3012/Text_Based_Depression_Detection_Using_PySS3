Is there any point in continuing to live? What is the purpose of life?Recently I lost something that made me want to keep living, that allowed me to endure the sadness of my life and now I have nothing to avoid it, basically I can no longer enjoy anything I used to enjoy like watching movies or playing video games, I even have no appetite, I only eat to avoid stomach pain. I can't concentrate on school, homework is piling up and it's getting harder and harder to do my work and pay attention to class. Something similar has happened to someone? and if so, what do you recommend doing? because it's getting harder and harder. All my classmates have plans for their futures and have their lives planned out but honestly I don't see a future for myself. Please and thank you very much.
