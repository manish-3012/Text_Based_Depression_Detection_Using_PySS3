I'm seeing some post on internet that suicide is the most selfish act a person can doBecause all my loved ones will suffer and will be sad about my sudden passing.

But what if those loved ones never actually cared? I can't imagine them crying and being sad about my passing and i actually feel like they're going to be relieved that they finally lost the one that keep leeching off of them.

I have this feeling of guilt that im only here to make their lives miserable. I always think about ending it all every single day but i cant because i atleast want to repay them for taking care of me all these times.

But now im reaching my limit and just cant take it anymore. I'm so worthless that if i could only give my life to a deceased relative i would do it. I've been thinking about ending myself for so long that if i ever get my hands on a gun i'd pull the trigger on my head without second thoughts.
