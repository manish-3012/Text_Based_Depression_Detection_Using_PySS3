Does anyone else feel guilty about self harm and how it makes others feel sad/negative?If I'm suicidal, I'm always passively suicidal. Idk what happened on Sunday but I self harmed for the first time (unsure if what I did as a kid counts as self harm). I stuck safety pins into my left wrist because I didn't want to feel any more emotional pain that stems from having an abusive mother (low contact right now).

I told the guy I'm dating because I was at his place. There was other drama that impacted it. He wasn't at home (we were at the same event but I left early). He knew I was having panic attacks and spiralling while being really drunk, and I ended up leaving with some close friends (who came to take care of me) before he got back to his. I tried to take all my stuff but unfortunately left the safety pins on his bed. Unknown to me, there were also pills left there. The pills were phlegm loosening ones because I'm sick, and they must have fallen out of my bag, :/. He didn't know what they were. He came home to that and freaked out.

Skipping some of the details here (incl. Dating dramas with this chick who keeps flirting and being all over him in front of me, when he was - past tense post our discussions - ok with it). His ex used to self harm a lot and threaten suicide and had a recent suicide scare. This incident with me has made him very uncomfortable and brought back bad memories. He's not in a good place because of what happened.

Does anyone else feel scared to open up because it might make others feel negative or bring them bad memories? Or even just because it might hurt them to see you like this or because it might break their hearts? This makes me so sad because, now I'm feeling a little better, I want to let a select few people in (e.g. Dad), but it's scary!!
