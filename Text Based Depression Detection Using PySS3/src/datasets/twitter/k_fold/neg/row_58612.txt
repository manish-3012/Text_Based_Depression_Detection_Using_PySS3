idk what to do anymoreI love my boyfriend more than anything. I really really fucking do. but I just dont know how much longer I can keep trying to get better. I only eat because I dont want him to relapse into his ed but in reality I dont eat and lie and I feel awful and ?? rye last few days I've been trying so hard and I dont blame him for not believing me because I've lied about it before but it's just so fucking hard!!!  I couldnt live with myself knowing I lost the only person I love, who I wanna spend my life with, the only reason I even _want_ to get better- all to end up deadly under weight. I almost wanna break it off, starve myself for as long as it takes to get to like,? 90 lbs or some shit, and then kill myself. the only reason I'm not is because I dont want him to relapse of kill himself because I did. I dont wanna fail and wake up in the hospital to be told hes dead. I'm just so fucking lost and I dont think I can get better. I dont think I'm selfless enough and motivated enough to fix my ed. I want to be, I want to be so bad and I'm trying but?? just 2 days of trying made me have like 3 break downs and hurt myself when I still have a thigh gap and probably havent gained any weight. I just dont know what else to do,,

if he goes to the hospital or idk somewhere hes safe from killing himself I'm gonna do it. if it dosnt work I'll try again as soon as I can and over and over until it fucking works because I'm just fucking tired of caring for myself. I'm tired of trying to care because as much as I try I keep fucking failing and I dont want to get better if it means I gain qeight?, I mean  I do but I dont. I just dont know what I want or what to do and I feel like if I just stopped it wouodnt matter so long as I know hes safe. that's all I care about. as soon as I know hes safe from doing the same I'm gonna find a gun or break the safe with my meds and just do it because I'm exhasted of everythinh
