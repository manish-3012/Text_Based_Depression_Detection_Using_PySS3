Ceiling bar broke mid-hanging.I don't know why it happened (I know it was a weak wall or some shit, but WHY in a more abstract sense is what I mean) but I wanna thank the people who commented on my earlier post because I think maybe that had something to do with it.  Anyway, I'm taking a breather and a drink and have had a serious wake-up call.  Maybe it means something and maybe it doesn't, but either way I'm gonna try to figure out the shit I planned to die for before I go again.  And fix my ceiling.
