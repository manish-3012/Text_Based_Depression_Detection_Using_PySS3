A permanent solution to my permanent problem?How would you advise someone to persist in life being a generally bothersome and rotten person? 

I hate most activities and the few things that I do enjoy doing, I fail at. I'm not interested in studying anything or any career. I'm a disappointment to my surviving parent and practically a stranger to everyone else that knows me. It's my own fault, I've always drifted at the edges of social groups, because to my core, I'm just not very interesting. A peripheral character, if you will.

My conception was an accident, and the result of an affair to boot. My birth ruined two lives and broke apart my father's original family. I'm a financial burden on him, and before she drank herself to death, was a shitty son to my mother. I should note that I essentially gave up trying to help my mom a few months before her death and allowed her to kill herself. 

I guess I just don't see why I should continue to exist. Even the "good' days I have are tainted with thoughts that I'm a worthless piece of shit who doesn't deserve to experience them.

**tl;dr** I'm a friendless loser who does nothing but consume resources and hate everything, myself included. What ***wouldn't*** killing myself fix?
