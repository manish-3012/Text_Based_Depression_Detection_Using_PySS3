Please help I'm worried sick my friend might have gotten injured and possibly died, haven't been able to sleep or eat.I know he's probably safe, at least I really hope so, but last thing I heard from him he was feeling bad and going to do something and now he's gone from everywhere. I hardly have begun to get over my anxieties and starting to live as an actual human being all thanks to his help and now thinking about him being gone I just can't do this alone. And the worse part is the last thing he might have heard from me is something really shitty I wanted to take back, but what if I never have the chance now? I'm a horrible person
