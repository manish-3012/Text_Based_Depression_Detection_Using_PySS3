musicI played a really good set tonight. My gf broke up with me last week and that made this a really emotional show. The thought of her not being here to see how good it was or how good the last few months of shows were just really hurt. I don't want to live like this. Playing music and knowing that she hasn't heard me in months and that she won't hear the music that she inspired me to write makes me want to throw it all away. I fucking hate this and I hate that I can't even do what I like without it feeling so deprived of meaning. God I want this to end
