Fading &amp; HearingAfter my father's suicide, I began hearing voices. It's always the same thing, "Kill yourself. You deserve to suffer. Burn." Unlike any other mental phenomena, I can feel no familiarity or ownership when it comes to those thoughts. At least, until they pass. I'm not sure if this is true psychosis or masochistic self torture. 
Everything I used to distract myself from depression is failing. I used to love creating art and simply walking through my imagination. Slowly, that ability has faded. I can't create anything, not even a well written paragraph. I devoured texts during my teens...now I feel nothing looking at all the wonderful books left to read. My intellectual curiosity is also ebbing; it's clear that in a year or two it will be gone too. I'm terrified no one will attend my funeral because I'll die far before I'm buried. I have no access to treatment or connections who could help. Any help or advice would be wonderful.
