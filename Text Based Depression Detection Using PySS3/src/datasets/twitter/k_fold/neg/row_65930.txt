Not happyI'm married 25 and have 4 kids.. college grad.


Ever since I was younger all I ever wished for was a family sence my family abandon me...


. but still I find myself depressed.   I feel everyone life is better with out me.. have been thinking for quite a while maybe I will end my life soon..  I feel everyone will be better off with out me..
