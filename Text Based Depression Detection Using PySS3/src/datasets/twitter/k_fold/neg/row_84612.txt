It feels like I have an aching hole where my heart should beIâ€™ve been through a lot. Sometimes it feels like I have more bad memories than good. Iâ€™ve struggled with severe depression for years. Every time I think Iâ€™m getting better, I get knocked down again. 

I attempted suicide last summer and survived. I started to improve after that. I wasnâ€™t suicidal for months. I didnâ€™t self harm. But I keep getting hurt. Things keep going wrong. And now Iâ€™m back in the pit again. I cut myself for the first time in ages. I feel so broken and worthless. Iâ€™m tired of trying to patch myself up. Iâ€™m just tired of everything. 

I donâ€™t have energy to do anything except shower. I havenâ€™t eaten in days. All I do is lie on the floor and cry. Sometimes I run out of tears so I just lie there until it starts up again. 

My chest feels hollow, but it still hurts so much. I want it to stop. I told myself Iâ€™d never attempt suicide again. But if I see an opportunity, and I know for sure I wonâ€™t survive, I think I will take it.
