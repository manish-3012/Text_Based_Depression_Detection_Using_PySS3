The stigma won't go awayI'm doomed to live the rest of my days with that stigma of "Asperger's".

It hurts, it really hurts... I hate when people talk to me as if I were a child, it hurts when they don't take me seriously, it hurts when people just ask me help and then I'm forgotten...

Ever since I remember, things have been like that... I was always being put down, used, mocked and eventually ignored... 

Many people tried to warn me, from teachers, to friends and my own family, but I was stubborn, and I didn't heed their warnings.

I thought I was doing the right thing, I thought I was making the world a better place, even at 0.0000001%... But I was wrong.

Not only I became a clown to others, but I also rejected my own humanity by suppressing most of my desires and needs,
turning into a machine who only lived for the rest, and not for himself.

Right now, I'm feeling really, really down... I'm scared that I'd end up dying alone, and no matter what I do, nothing will change that fate.

It's like, every single thing I used to believe in ended up being wrong.  My ideals, my dreams, my beliefs, my morals, everything was wrong...

Like a guy I met on college said: "In life, the most successful is the most ambitious, not the most noble".

I'm a beta at best, and an omega at worst. I fucked up, I feel like I want to yell, scream or beg for help...
