I'm going to kill myself on my birthday.Happy birthday to me. I'm sick of a family of liars, bleak job prospects, and false friends. 

College was a time where I tried to expand my boundaries, I got out of my shell, I tried drugs (legal and illegal), work, partying, meeting women, therapy, atheism, volunteering, and all forms of exercise. All the things people recommend. And you know what? It didn't help a damn bit. I've changed and grown immensely, but I'm still the same person, and I hate me and nobody likes someone who hates themselves. And now that I'm forced to leave that little bubble, it's only going to get harder for someone like me. Might as well take myself out at my peak.
