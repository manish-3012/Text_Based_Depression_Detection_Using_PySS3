If I had a gun right now I would end itMy only "friends" never text me, never even acknowledge my existence unless I contact them first. One of them, the only girl I have ever truly felt I had something special with, has rejected me twice and now has a boyfriend. I will never have a girlfriend, never marry, never do anything with my life. My motivation is sinking through the floor. In all my classes today I just put my head down. I started crying in one of them, but I doubt they even noticed or cared. I'm only 14. I know it's young, but I have never been more willing to go than I am now.
