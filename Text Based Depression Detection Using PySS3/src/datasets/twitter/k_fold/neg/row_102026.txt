dude this world is fuckedmy ex girlfriends mom called me this morning after i tried to talk to her. Her mom married someone who she knew raped my ex and gave her coke. She made her sleep on a floor for months. Im somehow a bad person because i tried to talk to her after we had a fight last week. The fuck is wrong with people. Maybe if i would have raped my ex we would have had a lovely conversation and she would have tried to marry me instead of give me shit for caring for someone who her family obviously didn't. I guess ill never understand why my ex still cares about her family so much as most of my family is dead, but if people did shit like THAT to me i would hold someone like me who actually cares close. Maybe i dodged a bullet, usually the apple doesnt fall far from the tree. I just wish i still had someone who cared about me in my life. Fuck.
