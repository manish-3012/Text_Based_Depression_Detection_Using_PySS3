I'm scared I can't keep myself safe and equally scared of getting helpThis past week everything has gotten worse. I started speaking and moving slower. My head felt heavy. I felt no pleasure in anything. I started having thoughts I'd never had before. That the struggle is pointless. That there is no ideal state to reach. It's all just stuff happening, good, bad. There's no reward for the stress or the pain or the perseverance. 

I'm concerned about my safety. Last night I had a restless nights sleep. Today I've felt completely numb. It's been on my mind all day and I've tried to push it away. 

I had these thoughts on the train platform, uninvited. It felt disturbing and like I wasn't in control. I was grateful they had safety barriers along the whole platform. I couldn't stop the thoughts of ending my life. Loss of control like I said. They didn't even feel like my thoughts. 

I was in a daze. I walked home, taking a detour. I felt like I could go somewhere and hide from everything. I don't know what to do. It's making me feel disorientated in myself. I've never had such strong thoughts of suicide before. It feels like my mind isn't my own. These thoughts aren't me but they don't seem to be going away.

I'm scared to tell anyone. I'd rather be left alone. I don't want to end up in hospital because I was thinking maybe things will get better themselves but it's been a month and things have deteriorated from mild to severe. I don't know what to do. I don't even want to die but I can't stop thinking about it. I even thought about writing notes for the people I care about as preparation incase it happens.
