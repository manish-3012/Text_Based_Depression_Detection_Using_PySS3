Why I still have some hope?My best friend avoids me because he thinks that he always hurt my feelings when he's around. He never appoaches me anymore since that day.

My parents doesn't consider my feelings when I am at distress and always ends with neglection, saying that I am so dramatic. They always compare me with another person or a thing and said that I am the worst or a burden.

School is very fucking stressful that one more mistake then I will fail this semester.

I don't know what is holding me back when I am at the place where I can suicide. Life is pointless now if I think things throughly. I couldn't rely on anyone anymore. I want to die.
