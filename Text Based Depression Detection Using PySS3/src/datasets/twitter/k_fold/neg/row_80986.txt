I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrongOn mobile and not in the mood to format so sorry for the impeding text block.

I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I think about dying constantly but I donâ€™t want to.. but I also do. I frequently end up crying because of the fight in my head being so intense because I want to die so badly so often, the voice in the back of my head tells me not to and that itâ€™ll get better eventually while the rest is telling me to grab every pill bottle in the cabinet.

I didnâ€™t have a fantastic childhood but regardless I lived, things arenâ€™t too bad right now so why? Whatâ€™s driving these thoughts into my head so often? Whatâ€™s the trigger?

Itâ€™s gotten worse after I broke down a while back in front of a friend of mine admitting the type of the thoughts Iâ€™d been having without actually going into detail about how or anything and she completely brushed me off. This friend has forgotten and no one else knows aside from one of my grandparents but theyâ€™ve already said they â€œdonâ€™t believe meâ€ so may as well be no one. 

Iâ€™m not entirely sure why Iâ€™m typing all this out but I feel like I need it off my chest somewhere to someone or no one where I wonâ€™t be looked at like saying the wrong thing will cause me to lose my shit like Iâ€™m made of glass or something. I also didnâ€™t want to post anywhere that might trigger other people just going about their reddit business and I figure this is the place.

To condense this entire ramble:
I both do and donâ€™t want to and I guess my fear is that one day that voice fighting back will stop and what will happen to me then?
