Done?.I think I've reached my limit. I've said those words before, things have turned around before... Things are just different now. I'm a burden to everyone I constantly hide behind this show of happiness. I'm exhausted. I'm tired. I want to get off the ride. I don't have anyone to talk to. My friends have their own battles. My significant other doesn't seem to care. My co-workers all think I'm happy. This mask I wear everyday is wearing thin and I'm tired. I should have ended it in high school. 23 years is a good life right?
