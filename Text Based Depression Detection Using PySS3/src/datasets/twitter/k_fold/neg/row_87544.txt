I literally wish for death everyday, I ironically.I absolutely canâ€™t stand my life because of myself and the stupid shit Iâ€™ve done. I fuck up everything, I have lost everything I ever loved. I have nothing and no one. My parents encourage my suicidal thoughts even more by constantly insulting me and asking me questions that they know I donâ€™t have answers to. I have no friends, no one that loves me, I have nothing and no one. I feel like I was born to lose and that I will always be destined to fail. I havenâ€™t listened to anything but sad songs in weeks. Therapy was helping me at first, but now it just feels like another chore that doesnâ€™t help me at all. I wish that I was fucking dead. I have lost everything because I am such a selfish fucking idiotic piece of shit. I donâ€™t deserve this life. I was not meant to be here. I just wish that I could grow the fucking balls I need to pull the trigger on my dadâ€™s gun some day soon. No, people. It DOES NOT get better. It gets better for some, but not all the time. Stop lying to me with the same cliche bullshit like â€œit gets betterâ€ and â€œjust give it timeâ€. It does not fucking improve, ever. Nothing ever gets better.
