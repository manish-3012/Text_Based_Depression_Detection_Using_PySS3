this is honestly my last fucking hopei am in such a fucking bad state right now that i dont even feel weak, my body literally has just become used to being numb.

im 17 and the shit ive been through is so bad and the shit i feel and think is so bad that i cant tell my friends because i will have to comfort them because they cant handle anything. i once told my friend about my biologically dad abandoning me and he started tearing up and i had to comfort him... people cant handle the stuff i have been through so i seek people who have. i was dating this girl for 4 months (not even long i know) but because she knew what i was going through and had experienced thew abuse i had as a kid she made me feel safe and loved, but she left, now i feel alone, empty, i want to die.

i got told that i probably have BPD by my doctor, but because of my age and my pre-existing heart condition, i cannot be given meds and therapy is obvs not on. it shocked me to my core when i heard her say that because my ex has BPD and it explained so much about the way i feel and the way i act.

but i just cant explain how i feel right now, its at a point were im snapping at people, crying for hours, self harming, dying for love and affection... i cant find anyone like my ex... i dont even want her back, i just want someone who can fill the void she left.

this is very poorly written, i am sorry, i am just writing down what comes to mind
