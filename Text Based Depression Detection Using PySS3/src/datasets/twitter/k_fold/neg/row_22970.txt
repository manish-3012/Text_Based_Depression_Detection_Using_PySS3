I don't know why i'm here but i don't know where else to turn.It seems like the easy way out and i usually hate that but now i just dont care anymore. Im sick of feeling like this and i know it's only a matter of time before my friends get sick of my shit. I wish there was a way i could do this without hurting them, i know they don't hate me but i will never mean anywhere near as much to them as they do to me and i hate putting that burden on people. II'm sick and tired of screwing up im sick of fighting my anxiety and getting like this. People told me for years to get help so i finally did this week and i just feel worse. All the dr did was make me realise my feelings for my friend, i can't have those feelings. She's meant to be a close friend and nothing more. It's not fair on her. I should never have told her.

If i left everyone would be happy, sure my family and close friends would be upset but i know in the long run they would be happier. Not having to deal with my problems or screwups. And just thinking about them having fun, enjoying themselves. That kinda makes me happy. I just wish there was a way i could disappear without everyone having to deal with death. But i guess it's only a matter of time before i really give up anyway.

EDIT: The worst part about all of this is how selfish it makes me feel. I read through this sub and realise how greats things are for me and that i should be happy. I shouldn't be anxious and i shouldn't want to kill myself in comparison to the actual problems other people have.
