Is this a 'plan'?I wasn't sure if I should post here or not.  I thought about going to /r/depression, but I chose this place.

Furthermore, while we're on the subject, you have my personal assurance that I am not in any danger of killing myself right now.  Okay?  Okay.

Typing this is hard because it's something that I've kept to myself and it's a truth that I don't want to accept.  It's always there and it's like, everyday it's getting just a little closer.

Maybe I should talk a little bit about me, eh?  I'm 28 years old.  Male.  After high school, I decided that trying to make something of myself was utterly futile.  I haven't and I probably will not pursue secondary education.

For the hard truth part, while I don't know for sure, I think that right now, I'm living for my brother and my father.  If I ever kill myself, it will be after they've died because the impact won't effect the people I love the most.

While they're alive, I'm going to fight these feelings with every single thing I have at my disposal.

I thought typing this out would make me feel better.  It doesn't.
