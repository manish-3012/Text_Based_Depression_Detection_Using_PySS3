It's goodbye, I guess.Any moment now, I'll fail an entrance exam at the most prestigious school in my country. I've done everything I could; I studied and everything. But it wasn't just good enough. It's really bad for me because my siblings passed that exam and have graduated from there. But me, I just failed and sucked. I don't know what will people say because I suck ass. If the result comes out, I'm gonna do it. I'm sorry.
