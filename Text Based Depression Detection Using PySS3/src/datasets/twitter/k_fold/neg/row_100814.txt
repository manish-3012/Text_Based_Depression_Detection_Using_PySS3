I wish I landed head first when I jumped off the bridgeTwo years ago I jumped, broke my ankles and fractured a leg, messed up my spine. Some fucking person just had to "save" me and call an ambulance. After being rehabilitated and able to be in a wheelchair I was locked in a psychiatric ward. They tied me down to a bed like I was some kind of animal.

After I got out, I can no longer be prescribed anti depressants (I was on them when I attempted suicide), and I can no longer tell my therapist I want to commit suicide in fear of being sent to the psychiatric ward.

Every single day I wish I would have just jumped head first. I'm in special education at school, I haven't made a friend in 10 years since I've moved to America when I was 8. I have selective mutism which is packaged with crippling social anxiety. I have diabetes. I have dyslexia. I have ADHD. And don't forget severe depression. I fail most classes which are 3 years behind my age level. My parents shipped me to America when I was 8. Then I was adopted by religious psycho fucks. Then I was molested by a priest a few months after being in America. He told me if I told anyone I would go to hell, dumbass me believed that for a few years until it was too late. People already know I am mental nobody will believe me. Now my parents are kicking me out of the house in a year and making me homeless because I don't believe in their religion (or rather, cult). Gee, thanks God (is what I'd say if he existed).

I am in love with my step brother, he's 3 years younger than me (15,18) and everyone thinks I'm a child molester (even though that would be legal in Canada). He makes me happier than anything in the world, but it's considered incest, THAT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING. So I'm not going to be able to be with him romantically. But on the other hand, becoming transgender is TOTALLY normal and acceptable.

These flamers on the LGBT train claim "love is love" but when it's me and my brother, "that's disgusting".

So yea. Real parents hate me. Adopted parents hate me. Everyone hates me except my brother but that's not allowed so. I'm all alone. Absolutely nobody in my life at all.

Any reason why I SHOULDN'T kill myself?
