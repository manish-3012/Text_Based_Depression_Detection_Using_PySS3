I just need reassurance I guessI'm not an attention seeker (or maybe I am) but I just want someone to tell me it gets better, that life will get better, that I'm going to be ok, you know? I just want someone out there to let me know I'm not a total waste of time, that I'm more than just my problems and my body, that one day I'll be someone in the world and I just want someone to remind me cutting isn't the way out of my problems. 

Sorry for wasting all of your time &lt;3
