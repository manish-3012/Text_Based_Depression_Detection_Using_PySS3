survival instinct is a bitchthe other day i went over to this 300 ft bridge thinking about jumping. when i looked over the edge, fear flooded my body and it was just like, ok gotta step back from this physical danger.

i think next time im going to drink copious amounts of alcohol so that this doesnt get in my way again
