Please just let it be overAlright time to vent because Iâ€™ve been bottling shit up for weeks and I have no one that I trust in my life to talk about at least not anymore. If youâ€™re here for coherent thought probably not going to find it here. 

I seriously donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m doing anymore Iâ€™ve been scraping through university I actually have more fails then passes at this point and Iâ€™m in my second year. Pretty sure Iâ€™ve failed every subject this semester and I didnâ€™t need to. But I canâ€™t help myself Iâ€™m self-sabotaging I destroy my life every single fucking time I get it back on trackâ€¦. Every time.  

Finally got a great bunch of friends is that what you called them? I think more of them are acquaintances. The one friend I thought would have my back when shit got rough didnâ€™t well no surprise there so much for equality. If she has a problem I was always there for her to talk to but when Iâ€™m spiralling into a dark place is she ever there for me? No of course not why would she be Iâ€™m obviously not worth the time so fuck her and her friendship. Iâ€™m your close friend when I need support but if you need it Iâ€™m not even going to try and talk to you. Seriously fuck friendships Iâ€™m so done. 

So Iâ€™ll probably fail this course no surprise I donâ€™t really have the personal aptitude for university or this career path but then what sure failing university isnâ€™t the end of the world but I think it should be at least for me. The thought of existence without purpose drives me crazy if I fail what am I supposed to do? Go find some shitty as job so I can pay bills to live a mundane existence alone? Why fucking bother Iâ€™d rather just go kill myself and if it comes that point I think I might actually have the balls to pull it off. Iâ€™ve always been a coward because thereâ€™s always some glimmer of hope but fuck it I donâ€™t care anymore everything I do is pointless. 

I just spent two weeks ignoring the world and now Iâ€™ve re-emerged I know every I knew thinks of me differently. They donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like judgemental ass-holes getting everything in life handed to them on a silver platter. 

I just want it to end this life of mine its not worth enduring any longer all is for naught.
