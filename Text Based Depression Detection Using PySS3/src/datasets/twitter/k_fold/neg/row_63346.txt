I've been unemployed for almost 2 years since I graduatedI can't get a job anywhere. I failed at every interview and my mental state just keeps getting worse and worse. I also try to learn new things (something that'll make me money) in my free time but I just end up giving up on every single one. I don't think I'll succeed at anything.

It also doesn't help that I don't have a single friend left and been extremely lonely and isolated during this period. My confidence is at an absolute all time low.
