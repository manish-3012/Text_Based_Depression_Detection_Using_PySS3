No hope for a 20 years old futureHi everyone, thank you for reading this. I am a 20 years old male and i am about to graduate from university. I have injured my back when i was 15 from an accident, ever since my back has been a problem and i had to give up playing sports which i loved. Up until recently, my back pain has increased considerately and starting to spread to my legs as well. Nothing helped and my only option is a spinal fusion surgery but it is extremely risky especially my age and the likelihood of further surgeries in the future. I just couldnt accept it because the risk is just too big and i dont wanna be a burden to my parents if anyone goes wrong in the surgery. I will most likely will become disabled due to the progressively increased pain and i am just so helpless. The thought of my being in extreme constant pain 24/7 and i have to rely on pain killers makes me wonder what is the point of living if i am just prolonging my suffering... I personally do not mind being dead because i know i wont feel anything once my brain shuts down but the thoughts of making my parents heart broken.... I cant even imagine that, my only hope is that when it comes it, i really wish they understand that my departure isnt something to grieve about and its a relieve for me.
