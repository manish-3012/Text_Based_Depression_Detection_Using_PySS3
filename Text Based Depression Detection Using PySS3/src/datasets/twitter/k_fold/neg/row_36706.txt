Killing myself would be doing the world a favor.My girlfriend and I just recently broke up and I feel worthless. I don't want to live anymore. I cut myself and think about suicide every day. I want it to stop. My friends make fun of me every single day, I tell them to stop but they don't. The only other person that knows about my depression is my ex. We still talk and she supports me every time I tell her I'm depressed. She is the only person that's keeping me alive. I don't like telling people about my depression but it feels good to let it all out. Killing myself wouldn't me selfish, it would be doing everyone a favor. Thanks for reading this.
