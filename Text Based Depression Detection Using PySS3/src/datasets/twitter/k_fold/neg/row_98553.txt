unable to find meaningbut iâ€™m also not brave. very afraid. most of my energy is spent in just being. i wish i could find a way and slip out of this as painlessly for both me and everyone around. a partner, raising a family, a fulfilling career are all so unappealing to me despite the temporary satisfaction it may bring. 

whatâ€™s a poem i should read so the last thing i see is beautiful?
