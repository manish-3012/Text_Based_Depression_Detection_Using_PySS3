Does anyone have recommendations or experiences with New England inpatient/partial programs? Kind of running out of options.Sorry in advance if this is not the right place for this. A couple of my providers have been really pushing for me to attend some kind of inpatient or intensive outpatient program but I have been wary because of an incredibly negative experience being sectioned for 48 at Bournewood hospital.

I was diagnosed with PTSD a couple years back from my time in the military but have been able to cope until recently where I have just completely broken down. My concern is that I don't really do well in confined environments and I am really uncomfortable with the idea of not being able to have an out.

I have been in outpatient treatment for years, going through A-Z with medications and have tried multiple different techniques (CBT, DDT etc) with multiple different providers; at this point I really don't know what else to do. Before I used to be able to bounce back, but doing basic self care is an accomplishment now and I have no intrinsic motivation to live. I really appreciate any input or advice!
