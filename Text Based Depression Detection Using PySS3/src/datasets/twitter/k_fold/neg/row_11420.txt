No one asked to be born. Why is is demanded we stay alive?This is something that's been bothering me a lot lately. No one asked to be born. I certainly did not. I have wanted to die since I first attempted suicide at 9 years old, by hanging myself in the closet with a coat hanger for about five seconds before it broke. 90% of the days since then I have thought about killing myself, wanted to kill myself. The other 10% do not make up for it. They just don't. It is too few and fair between and they aren't that great anyways.

Last time I attempted suicide I got really close. I was on life support for a couple days. It was the best time in my life, the darkness. Nothing, not even dreams. It only seemed to last a moment though before I woke up. I feel that having life forced upon me was the ultimate violation. I did no ask for it. 

I long for the blackness and nothingness. I look forward to making a choice, taking my choice back and ending this horrible existence. 

If I have my life insurance policy for two years before my suicide, they will still pay out. That way my family that is financially dependent on me will have some money. Only one year and three months to go.

On days like today though I don't know if I will make it. I can't imagine another year and three months of this torturous life. This horrible feeling inside my brain. I just want to smash a bullet through my brain so the feeing inside it will finally stop like it did when I was in that wonderful blackness. I can't escape it even in my dreams. 

There is no point in typing this. No one can help me. Certainly not internet strangers. It helps to make it through the day though. To type it out of my head. I just have to make it day by day for one year and three months. I need help to make that goal. I don't know if I will.

Edit: No one gives a fuck to anyone. Fuck everyone.
