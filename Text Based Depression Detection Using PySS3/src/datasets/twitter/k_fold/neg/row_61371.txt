I don't know how I'm still aliveI've posted here a few times over the past few weeks because I am really at the emotional depths of human existence. I am not sure how I have not killed myself despite, at times, desperately wanting to. My emotional state waxes and wanes, with lower highs and lower lows. 

Three days ago was the lowest bottom so far where I decided to kill myself but fell asleep before I could take action. I am on my way to returning to that state and I don't think I will survive this time.

I frankly don't really care. My life is a sad joke anyway and is going nowhere. I'm giving myself until I return from vacation tomorrow to come up with a plan and execute. "Things" will NOT get better. "Things" will get worse. My life is meaningless. A few people will be greatly affected by my death, but for everyone else, I will be just a number. And I am okay with that, I have lived a fine life of 25 years. It is time to go.

Thank you for reading, and if there is anyone out there willing to talk for the next day so I can pass time please reach out.
