Why is anything, but suicide? When you bring up the idea of suicide, they look at you like you are a threat to their most dearly held ideals.

Try anything but suicide, cope, cope and COPE some more, but you can't give up, we are together in this misery and no one is allowed to leave.

That goes to all kinds of therapy like CBT, antidepressants (we don't know how they work), reframing, focusing on the present moment and not the pain, the present moment is fucking PAIN.
