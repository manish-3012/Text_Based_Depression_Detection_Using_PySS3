Fuck lifeI'm a person who has one single friend left at this point (who constantly bails out on me and acts as if im a burden), im bi-polar causing me to more or less only experience extreme emotions (mostly negative ones), I have very bad social anxiety keeping me from meeting new people, I've ADHD which makes my thoughts race making it so i cannot concentrate at all, Ive zero overall confidence, im not attractive, and i have every last person in my life attacking me because im so down out without even an ounce of support ( Instead of talking to me, they push me to "go out and stop being such a drag", and cousins i was close with decided to "teach me a lesson" they would stop talking to me, and just talk shit behind my back...you know to help me out.... yeah that fucking helps). I always see people trying to convince people not to take their lives on sites and message boards, and honestly i envy the life most of those people have. If need be i dont even have a single person i can call to truly "talk to". Im going to end up killing myself weither its tonight or next year. You dont think about something every day for 10 years without due reason, im curious what reason i shouldnt end my life people can come up with. i highly doubt even a single valid point can be made
