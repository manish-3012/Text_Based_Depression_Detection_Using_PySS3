...I don't want to be whiney, but I don't care if you read this or not. For so long I've felt shitty I don't want to live anymore, I know deep down people love me but I don't love myself.

I don't know why but I feel like everyone is against me, I know it's unhealthy but I can't stop. It's so bad I can't sleep some nights.

I don't know what's in the afterlife which is the only thing that stops me, I want to feel happy but I never can. It's even starting to effect my school work everyday it gets worse my grades are slowly dropping and I can't do anything.

I want to feel happy, i want to feel warn when I'm sleeping not like I want to die, I'm super sorry if I bothered you.
