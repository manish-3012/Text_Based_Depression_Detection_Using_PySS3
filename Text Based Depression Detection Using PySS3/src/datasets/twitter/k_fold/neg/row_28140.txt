Someone save me please, I canâ€™t take it, I just canâ€™t do it much longerI finally have some friends who are able to show affection physically and itâ€™s made me realise how starved of human touch Iâ€™ve been in my life. I would give a lot to spend a some time just curled in someoneâ€™s arms finally feeling safe. But for some reason Iâ€™m too scared to ask them to hug me even though I know they would have no problem with it and do it immediately. And the amount of time Iâ€™ve spent imagining someone holding me as I go to sleep is comical.
 
Please just hold me when we see each other again like you do for Eliyan and Evie, u guys run across rooms and squeeze each other tightly and then sit down sometimes arms linked or leaning on each other. Ik I havenâ€™t known u guys as long as uve known them but I rly need u guys right now, even if I donâ€™t say it. I just need a shoulder to cry on and someone to tell me it will all be ok because right now Iâ€™m panicking, and I canâ€™t take it much longer. I can feel myself snapping, all this crying, bleeding, and now lying as well. We all know if I ever say Iâ€™m fine Iâ€™m still crying inside, no my eyes arenâ€™t irritated those are tears Iâ€™m trying to hide. Someone save me please, I canâ€™t take it, I just canâ€™t do it much longer
