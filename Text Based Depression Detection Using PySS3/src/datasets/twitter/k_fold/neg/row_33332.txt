Officially alone on Christmas for the first time ever.Life has been miserable for a good long time now. I mean I can't really ever say I've ever been all that happy, but the last 6-7 months have been a new low for me. 
And honestly I'm fairly annoyed that I am letting the holidays get to me... I haven't ever been much of a celebrator... But my first Christmas alone. Its already completely miserable.
I've been lying in bed for hours, thoughts of suicide eating away at my mind... Just boring a hole right through me, getting stronger, louder... The only thing keeping me alive at this point being the apathy I feel towards even getting up.
