I have trouble believing anyone cares.I just feel like I'm seen as a means to an end, and more importantly, that is how I see myself.  I'm stuck in a shitty job that takes my free time for minimum wage, I can't help but feel that my "friends" only care as long as I entertain them and have no other way of making friends, I'm obviously my parents least favorite.  I don't feel comfortable venting to anyone and my anger at the world has been festering for a while now. 

But I also don't know if I want help.  I know I don't deserve it.  It was fortunate for my boss there wasn't a train passing by on my way home.
