I'm sorryI'm sorry if my post is stupid

So, I am in my late teens, and I feel like my entire life has just been hopeless, and I have felt this way to a degree for as long as I can remember. My situation is somewhat impacted by my life at home, in some ways. On the surface everything seems normal, and maybe it is. I go to an online school, since I previously had been home-schooled for most of my life. Since this is how things are, I have never had any friends, and have barely communicated with people of my age. I am not allowed to go outside on my own. My parents take me to the store with them on the weekends though. They also sometimes put me in classes, driving me there, but all of the other people are adults. Anyway, I am also not allowed to have social media for the most part. I have been told that I could have one someday as long as my parents were my only followers, and I kept my account only accessible to them. Regardless, I have been socially isolated for my entire life. I have no memories of friends or playing with other kids. Maybe once or twice, but my parents made sure to stop that from happening. I have no real-world experiences, and I spend almost all of my waking hours on online school. It is honestly way more work than normal school, at least I've heard that. I have to spend a minimum of 9-10 hours a day doing it, and sometimes as much as 14. I have no extracurricular activities, and I have straight A's.

I am of course not allowed to learn to drive, and I am not allowed to get a job. If I get money at any point, not very often, regardless of who gave it to me, it must be used for me and what I am purchasing must be heavily analyzed. Around once or twice a year, my school has events where students can go. There is usually very few people there, and they don't talk to me due to my parents being glued by my side. However, my mom has told me a few different times that she would rather kill herself than take me to these school events. One of my big issues is that my mother does not like me at all. She has told me throughout the years that she wishes I was a different person. She hates who I have become, and she believes that the only positive parts of who I am are due to her raising. They also say that even though they are not perfect, they are extremely close to it. Why would you say that? I have contact with only one family member that my mother sometimes threatens to cut ties with sometimes.

I cannot choose where I go to college at all and I only get to apply to one. This is why I am not allowed to take the SAT because this school doesn't need it. My parents don't want me to move away for college, and they don't want me to take out a loan. They want to pay for it, which I guess is nice, but I have no say. With scholarships, my tuition could be free, as I have the requirements for state-offered scholarships. My parents don't want to pay too much, so I guess this is good. However, my mom tells me she wishes I would go away and become a new person so that she could finally be happy, by going out of state. I am still not allowed to do that, but she wishes it would happen. I don't understand this. My parents don't want me to leave the home because they feel that I am needed so they can purpose. My parents often don't want to spend any money on me even though I can't make my own. They get angry at me for wanting new clothes when everything I have has holes in it. They yell and tell me I am ungrateful. It just frustrates me because my parents make well over 100K a year and live in a very nice neighborhood. My parents spend hundreds to thousands of dollars a month on decor items in the house. But $50 dollars of clothing is a huge deal.

Regardless of this, there are a few things that have happened in the past that have impacted me today. One of these things was when I was suicidal when I was 8 years old. It sounds ridiculous, but I spent a decent amount of my time plotting suicide at that age. My dad found out and told my mom. My mom screamed at me for an hour angrily telling me that I should never feel that way because she has given up her life in order to raise me. She would not talk to me for a while after that. It just made me feel guilty. For my entire life all I have been told is that everything that I am given is not what I deserve, and that I must be guilted for everything that I own at all times.

Other things include my parentsâ€™ hatred of teenagers. My parents have told me that they hate all teenagers on various occasions. Regardless of who they are, they hate all teens. They hated being teens, solely because they hated other teens too. Because of this, my 13th birthday "party" was decorated with baby pictures of me, to show that I had effectively died, at least until I am 20. My mother has said that she stopped liking me when I was 5 years old. She says she wanted a baby forever, and she resents me for growing up. Literally no one would notice if I died besides my parents. They restrict me to inside the house, but yet don't pay a lot of attention to me. I do a large portion of the house cleaning, while my parents sit there and do nothing. They play loud music when I am doing school and watch TV until 1-2 AM. 

I am just sick of having no meaning in the world. I have no hope for the future at all, and I feel like I am just floating forward in life. I have barely any passions. One of the few things I have always loved is music, but I have no skills in it. I only write weird poetry secretly, with about 100 poems. I wish to be able to create music, but obviously that is not a career, especially considering I literally have no knowledge or skill in it. My mother doesn't really want me to play an instrument because she didn't when she was a child. She doesn't want me to try and be "better" than she was.

All of these things lead me to feel pointless, hopeless, and suicidal. I feel bad honestly for being this way. I am just another stereotypical suicidal teen. And I am ugly and not good at anything. Even if I could do something well, there is obviously nothing making me special. The world is so competitive that I don't even know how I would succeed with my impeded social development.

My biggest dream honestly is just to be happy. Truly happy, not just small moments once every few months. I want to be able to live on my own, and to be able to have good people in my life who don't see me as an accessory. However, I am too bad at everything for anyone to ever want me. And I don't know how I would become financially stable.

I feel like mild depression is my norm, but sometimes I get these periods of feeling so helpless I don't know how to function. I can't even scream. Not like I could anyway, I am expected to stay completely silent in the house most of the time.

There is so much left unsaid, honestly probably most of what is causing my issues. But they are normal, so I don't think about it. I am just done writing. I am just done with life. What even is the point? I don't know, and probably never will. I am honestly just depressed, suicidal, and bored.

TLDR: I have been socially isolated for most of my life, so I feel pointless and suicidal.

I may just be stupid and entitled though. And I am sorry for wasting anyone's time
