what are the chances of surviving if you hang yourselfI might thinking this could be the day but i dont want to suddenly survive and get brain damage or something like that, i got a kind of worn rope but tough enough to pull a car and the place i'll hang is made of steel so i guess is not going to break, nor the rope or the ceiling and i am a skinny 6ft tall guy, is there is any chances to fail this?
