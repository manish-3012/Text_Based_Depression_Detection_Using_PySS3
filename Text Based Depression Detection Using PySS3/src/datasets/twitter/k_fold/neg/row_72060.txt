I'll kill myself this weekI'm a boy, I have a friend, she is a girl, I'm in love with her, but she has a  boyfriend, she told me to wait and see the future, but I can't stand the pain anymore, she wants to be my friend for the moment, her boyfriend doesn't love her, but I do, I want to marry and have kids with her, all I want is her love, I will survive with her love, but without it I just can't, it's just too much to me. I have too much love to give, everytime I try to give this love to anyone, I suffer. She is my last hope.
