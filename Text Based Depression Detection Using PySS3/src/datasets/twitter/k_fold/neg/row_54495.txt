I can't take it anymoreEvery day it gets worse. Every day I'm crying, I feel so terrible I can't even describe it. I'm having panic attacks every few hours. I just want this to be over. Please just let it stop please I really can't do this anymore. I tried, I really did, I tried so hard to keep living but I just can't take this anymore please let it stop. I really don't want to hurt my family, but I don't know what to do anymore. Thinking about killing myself is the only thing that calms me down slightly but I get another panic attack when I think about how it will affect them. I just want this to end.
