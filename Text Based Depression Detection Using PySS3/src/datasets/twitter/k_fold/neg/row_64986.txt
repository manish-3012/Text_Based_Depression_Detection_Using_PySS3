For the last 5 years, nothing Iâ€™ve done to improve my life has been enoughMy husband owns me. He decides how I feel, what I think, what I do and where I go. He never takes responsibility for anything inappropriate he does and it has become beyond my capacity. I am so much younger than he is. I am a child compared to him. He taunts me, belittles me and gaslights me. I have spent no more than 3 days apart from him in the last 5 years. I have to go.
