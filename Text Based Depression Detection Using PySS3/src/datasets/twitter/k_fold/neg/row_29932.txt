Fuck me.If I had access to firearms, I'd choose that. I guess maybe a hanging. I don't think I'm serious.

Im tired. Tired of fighting with thoughts everyday, trying to convince myself I'm not a worthless, sack of shit.
Mid thirties, work in healthcare.

I take the meds, talk to the therapist. But here I fucking am.

I woke up today and literally from the start of the day said "__ don't listen to those thoughts and feelings, they lie and they are just thoughts and feelings. You're not piece of shit". But how many times can I remind myself of this in one day? 

Have some tough shit tomorrow to deal with. Feel like I can't cope. Sleeping late.. Great. I am ready to just die and be done. I kept thinking it would get better... But here I am, and it isn't. 

I know I won't do anything. I would have to somehow fake it so that my friends and family don't have to deal with suicide loss. Irony, I've dealt with that too. Sometimes I think about positioning a bar against the steering wheel of my car pointed into my chest and do some head on collision with a wall or median.... Seems like I could survive though and that would suck balls. 

Maybe oneday I'll travel. Haha, NOT. Covid. 
Maybe I can look forward to the future. Haha - 2021 masks, lockdown, more pandemic, don't see friend and family 
Fuck me. 
Thanks for reading.
