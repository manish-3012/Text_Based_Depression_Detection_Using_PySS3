I just want to be normalI have no one else to talk to, other than family but I don't want to talk to my family about my issues.

I'm 19 and have no job, friends, hobbies, I feel like a failure I see all other people from high school and they have jobs, friends, cars and I have non of that, I can't do anything, even though I know what I want in my life, I want a job, a car, money, scientific hobbies, and maybe turn those into a carrier by going to trade school or college, I want to volunteer and help others in my community, and so much more, I know life can be amazing and I know I have to work towards it I want to, but I just can't, I have this constant struggle within me, I feel like I'm taking a back seat in my own life and watching myself in third person destroy it, over eating, sleeping in, doing nothing, scary thing is, I know what I want, I know what I have to do, but I can't do it every time I try I get dragged back to my old self and get locked in the back seat, 1 step forward 2 steps back, I've watched videos, read books, tried all sorts of methods and nothing so far. I don't know how much more I can take, why am I here? I never asked to be here. Why can't I just be normal, why is everything so hard for me, I don't know what to do I feel like charlie and the football I convince my self that this time I'll get it right this time I'll finally be a better person, and time and time again I get bamboozled back to square one, this cycle has to end, there's no hope for me here
