How to make my suicide easy on them?How do I make my suicide easier on the ones I love? My sorry excuse for a mother is moving away, taking my kids, abandoned me, told me it would be awesome if I left and never came back, and is using my college money to buy a car.  I don't want to hurt the ones I love with my death but I can't push through this much further. Nobody gives a shit. When I reach out they do fuck all then guilt trip me for wanting to die. They say it's selfish to commit and push me paain on others, you know what's selfish? To see someone in constant pain and to try to force them to keep going so you don't have to deal with their loss when all they want is some peace. Deep down I don't want to die, I want to be happy. But it's become clear to me that happiness is An illusion and will never truly be achieved. The only way I don't have to suffer constantly anymore is by killing myself and that's what I'm going to do in three days time I'm going to drink until 420 am then I'm going to hang myself in the woods. In my phone there will be letters in my notes and farewell video in my camera roll. I didn't want to hurt anyone I just dont want to live in constant pain. How do I make their pain less when my death goes to public?
