So..yeah , I'm here.Hi , I'm sorry to waste your time when there are people with actual problems to attend to , but for some reason I felt the need to post this. I hate myself. There , I said it. But it's not just "oh, I'm not pretty enough" it's pure fucking hatred that won't go away. I used to be able to push my suicidal thoughts till nighttime when I could be alone, but they've been creeping up on me in the day now too. I'll be in class and tears will well up in my eyes as I quickly turn my head away. I don't feel happy anymore- even over things Ishiuld be estatic about, I'm not. The emotions I feel are pain, misery &amp; sadness.I hardly sleep but I'm used to it now, I'm tired of pretending, being 2nd best &amp; most of all sick of living. I've been called gorgeous- but I'm not . Smart - negative. I hate if people say good things about me- because I know they are lying. Innocent name callings from family hurt, because I'm not so sure they're really innocent. "loser" "dumb kid" one of my brothers told me to go play intraffic, to go die, and another occasion he told me he wished I'd never been born. My other brother hated me for 13 years, picking at me constantly, tearing me down.. I'm only 15 why do I have to live in my sick disgusting mind? Im a worthless piece of shit &amp; the world would be a better place without me, but I doubt it would make a dent in this world- because who the fuck cares about me? I sure as hell don't. My own mother- who is the nicest lady you could imagine never believes me if I tell her I'm sick or have an injury of some sort. If I bring it up , she won't respond- so I'll say it again and shell roll her eyes. For some reason that makes me feel like total crap. I don't want to live. I figure I'll jump off of a fairly high bridge onto solid concrete sometime this summer. Sorry for taking away these moments of your life.
