So it isnâ€™t for me, itâ€™s for my girlfriend, she keeps saying she â€œcanâ€™t think of good things to out way the badâ€ which is what she did to help when she got depressed, (clinically)  sheâ€™s really behind in school, her friends have stopped hanging out with her, which is when I would say this started. And she just got on her period and thatâ€™s when things get hard because then she becomes in pain constantly and she keeps saying she canâ€™t handle it anymore and that she canâ€™t take it and Iâ€™m scared because idk if she might do something
