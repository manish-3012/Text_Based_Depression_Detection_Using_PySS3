Feeling incredibly guilty for suicidal ideationI'm a mess. I was raped 2 months ago. I can hardly function now and think about death constantly. 

I feel so guilty whenever I end up sharing thoughts like these with my boyfriend. Not only do I not want him to worry about me, his mother committed suicide.

How do I stop feeling this every single day
