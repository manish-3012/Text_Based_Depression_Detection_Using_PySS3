Considering overdosing because of a pathetic reasonI've been having suicidal thoughts for months straight lately and I just feel trapped. Nowhere to go, no one to hang out with because im homeschooled and have no friends, I'm emotionally numb and the one person that actually made me feel something I'm never going to see again. It all happened too fast and now I've lost everything without realizing it. I just want it to be over.
