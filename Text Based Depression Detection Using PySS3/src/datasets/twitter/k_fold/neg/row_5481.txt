Is there a way out?I feel trapped in an endless loop in my head. For so long my mental state has quickly deteriated and I haven't been able to find happiness. I'm only 16, but I've attempted a couple of times, but tonight my thoughts truly got the best of me and I am very scared of losing it all, yet at the same time I want to do it. I don't have the patience to wait for something good to happen, either. Even my closest friend said "I don't know", when I asked them how I can get help. My mother is no help, she won't take me to a doctor or let me even get medication. I hope one of you can help me find a way.
