I love youI know this may seem odd or cliche but, I love you.  Don't forget that.  You are beautiful.  You are talented.  You are wanted, needed.  You are unique.  I love you just the way you are.  I love the person you can be, and the person you were too.

I've been there.  Late 2008 I tried to kill myself.  After several hospitalizations and therapy I was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and I'm now well into recovery.  I still get depressed, but I haven't been suicidal for over 7 months now.  

That time changed my life.  It is of my opinion that live changing experiences are meant to be shared.  That's one of the reasons I got 'Love' tattooed onto my arm.  People ask about it and I always answer the truth, that I got it to show my support for TWLOHA and often I tell my story.

But enough about me.  If anyone in the Greater Boston area ever needs to talk about anything, anytime, just let me know via PM.  Have car, will drive.  Or let me know and I can call you.

Hugs!
