I've never been so close to ending it while soberI've made attempts before while drunk, but I'm sober right now and so close to ending it all right now.

My ex left me to get back with his ex. It's a whole thing. Since then I have good days and bad days, but today I was off work and stuck with my thoughts and am so close to killing myself. 

I hate waking up alone, I hate that nothing brings me joy anymore, I hate living my life trying to avoid them both....

I don't think I can do it. 

I know he isn't worth it, but I feel like my life is empty right now and there's nothing to live for anymore.
