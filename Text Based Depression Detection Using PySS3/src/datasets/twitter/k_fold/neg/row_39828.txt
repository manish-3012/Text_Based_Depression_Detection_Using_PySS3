Leaving your life behindI'm wondering if anyone that has contemplated suicide has thought about dropping everything about your life and going somewhere new. If your life sucks so bad that you want to end it, why don't you, in a purely metaphorical sense? Why not leave everything behind and do exactly what YOU want to do? If you have done it, how did it turn out?
