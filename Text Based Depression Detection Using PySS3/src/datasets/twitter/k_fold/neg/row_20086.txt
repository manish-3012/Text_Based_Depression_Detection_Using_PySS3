I see no light, I have tried for many yearsI have been depressed for a long time, I also lost my father a couple of years ago, I invested my inheritance and made a bunch of money, "get swole". Went to the gym, got a six-pack, now what? "sleep with girls", well I slept with over 100 girls (all asian), now what? most of them told me they only date Japanese or Blonde guys (yes, I have been used forsex), btw I live in Japan, I have lived on 4 different continents, Europe, Australia, USA, and Asia for the last 3 years. 

I don't mean to humble brag in any way, what I mean is, what can I do?! People keep talking about self improvement but, I don't know what else to do, I have been trying to improve for so many years now. I just feel worthless, even worse is that I live with 3 Swedish flatmates who all get multiple girlfriends and friends kissing their asses for simply being blue eyed and fair haired. I'm not even that bad looking, just very short (5'8). 

For 28 years I have felt completely alone, and I lost my best and only friend, my father a few years ago. I don't know what to fight for anymore.
