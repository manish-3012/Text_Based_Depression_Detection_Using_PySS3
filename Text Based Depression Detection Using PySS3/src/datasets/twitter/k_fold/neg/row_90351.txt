My dog of 15 years just died and the pain is unbearableIâ€™ve had so much job loss and other problems that I wasnâ€™t paying as much attention to him as he needed as he had serious health issues.  I promised myself I wouldnâ€™t let work stress affect my ability to take care of myself and my dog, but I did and I missed some important signs and I lost him.  I have an empty apartment and a horrible career.  Not good things for the majority of the day.  Iâ€™ve had years of struggle and now that heâ€™s gone Iâ€™ve realized he was the only thing keeping me going.  Iâ€™m so lonely and afraid and donâ€™t know how to live without him.
