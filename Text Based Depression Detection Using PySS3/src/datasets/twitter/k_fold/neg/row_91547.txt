Iâ€™m always aloneYesterday I went on a college accepted students day and I hated it. The students... I was there with my friend, but I felt like they were all so judgy and had no interest in being my friend (and more interested in her and the other ppl that were there.) I donâ€™t rlly have social media because I hate taking pictures. So besides the small â€œfriends â€œ I have at my school I talk to no one.  Even then those friends rarely talk to me outside of school. And when they do they take forever to respond. Yesterday they asked to go to the movies and I ended up going to the wrong theater apparently so I watched the movie alone. Iâ€™ve tried tinder and other sites to try and find people like me. Not be lonely. But I feel like Iâ€™m the only one. I have to go to prom since I already bought my dress but I feel like I have no one to go with. I feel like Iâ€™m going to cry once I get there. I feel like Iâ€™m going to be like this forever. I donâ€™t see the point in anything... the point in living...
