i want to die but iâ€™m too scared to do it myselfi hate being bisexual in a homophobic family. i hate being in a family that judges everyone but doesnâ€™t ignores their own issues. i hate they way my family uses gay as an insult and says the â€œfâ€ slur. (i hate slurs) i hate the way my family yells at me when 
my family doesnâ€™t believe in therapy or anything like it and think forcing information out of a person and trying to â€œhelpâ€ them will work.
my family looks down on people who try to/do kill themselves and people who cut. if they found out i cut theyâ€™d probably force me into telling them why and i know they wouldnâ€™t get me help. if i walk a certain way i get yelled at, if i talk a certain way i get yelled at, if i sigh i certain way i get yelled at. and yes, yelled. they all yell at me because iâ€™m the youngest. im forced to be around them because iâ€™m underaged. too young to move out, too young to drive, too young to get a full time job. i get yelled at for the type of music i listen to, literally. like they get mad at me, look at me as if i have three heads, and proceed to yell at me. if i told my family i was bisexual they would probably disown me or harm me. i hate being the different one in the family. i cant help the people i like or the other stuff i like. i wish i was never born this way. i wish i was never born at all. my family thinks gay people party all the time, sleep around, and live a sinful life. cause they must ALL live like that, cause that makes so much sense. i hate the way my family can see two guys holding hands and silently whisper â€œfaggotsâ€ i hate they way they get mad when they see a masculine female or a feminine male. yes, theyâ€™re those people who literally get angry around people of the lgbt community. theyâ€™d get angry at me if they knew. i donâ€™t want to disappoint them. they always look at me like iâ€™m a disappointment if i saw i donâ€™t like being around people or i like a certain of something. theyâ€™d be so disappointed in me. if i tried to kill my self and fail, theyâ€™d be disappointed in me. if i donâ€™t get the normal career, theyâ€™d be disappointed in me. theyâ€™ve been disappointed in me for not having a girlfriend and not having guy friends. cause in your teenage years dating is just something that has to happen or else somethingâ€™s wrong. i donâ€™t want to date girls or guys anytime soon. iâ€™m not ready. whyâ€™s that an issue. why am i such a disappointment. they love me, but they wouldnâ€™t love the person i really am. the person i hide when im around them. i love them but i donâ€™t like being around them.

i never talk to anyone about this because i could be in a worse situation. who am i to complain? i donâ€™t want peopleâ€™s sympathy and the whole â€œitâ€™s gonna get better thingâ€ i said that two years ago and things got so much fucking worse. maybe iâ€™m just overreacting. maybe iâ€™m just being a teenager, is being a teenager this soul wrenching? whatever, iâ€™m even embarrassed to post this. 


i almost â€œaccidentally slippedâ€ off of a cliff in hopes of hitting my head on a tree or something dying. i almost swallowed a bottle of pills in hopes of dying. i almost suffocated myself in hopes of dying. recently iâ€™ve been feeling so much worse about myself. i want to die but iâ€™m too scared to do it myself. what if it doesnâ€™t work? i donâ€™t want pain either. but if death means pain, then so be it, i just want it all to end.
