I feel the need to punish myself when I perform bad in school.My performance in school (grade 11) lately has been the worst so far, Iâ€™m almost failing 2 of my classes and I can barely manage a decent grade. I miss school a lot so I can avoid quizzes and tests to have extra time to study but I always procrastinate and end up doing bad on them. I have the tendency to do behaviours that would punish myself like binge drinking or taking painkillers, anything to numb the pain. 

Grade 11 has been the worst for me and my sleep just keeps getting worse each day. I canâ€™t keep everything in balance. Iâ€™m taking meds and counselling but itâ€™s not working. Iâ€™ve tried my best guys. At this point I just want to skip this entire week of school, Iâ€™ve already missed 3 days in a row.
