I'm going to end it. Eventually.I'm going to eventually end my life. I live with moderate and sometimes severe depression and anxiety.  Over the course of my life I have had ups and downs, but it's generally been a decent life. 

I have been on multiple medications spanned out of the course of the better part of a decade.  The meds do help. But I lost my sex drive.  I mean no desire at all. I can force myself to have sex, in which case my body becomes aroused through the usual processes (the body partially functions), but I can never finish. So sex is forced, meaningless, becomes a chore and a source of constant frustration.   A  healthy relationship cannot function without sex.  Imagine tomorrow this was your life.  You probably could not fathom never having an orgasm again.  At least I couldn't. So I made a decision.  I quit the meds.  This is one of the best and most sound decisions I have ever made.  Along with consistent therapy I have been med free for 11 months.  And I've had the sex. Alot.  And now I'm having the best sex of my life with one person. Best. Of. My. Life. 

However the suicidal thoughts have crept back in.  In fact, they have been there the whole time.  But I have not acted on them for the sole reason that I actually don't want to die.  I cannot control these thoughts.  I can't control the waves of sadness (this word really does no justice to the feelings that can manifest themselves in physical pain in my stomach and chest).  These feelings just come.  I'm older and wiser and do not let them send me spiraling into the depths of depression that I have experienced before. The very bottom of life where you feel hopeless, worthless, unloved etc.  I fight to keep that from happening.  Not everyday.  It doesn't work that way. But often. Maybe weekly, maybe monthly. The point is, I'm winning.  I'm still here.

I'm deciding to end my life not because I can't take life anymore.  Not because I'm emotional right now. Nothing specific or new has happened to precipitate this decision. It's just a decision I have made because I'm truly tired of the battle.  It's quite exhausting putting all of this work into life.  Even on meds, I must work hard at keeping my head above water.  This is why I have decided to take my life.  It will not be today. Or anytime soon.  I will not go out in a fury of tears.  My body will be alcohol and drug free.  I plan on doing this after I accomplish a few more goals that I am currently working on.  I need to finish what I started before I go.  

I am posting this not to be talked out of the decision.  Just to show people that suicide can have other sides to it.  That a person can be rational and of sound mind and understand the consequences of their decisions and behaviors.  

I realize this may upset some people.  I am not encouraging anyone else to take their life.
