Donâ€™t see any reason to not kill myselfIâ€™m 25, bipolar, overweight, unemployed and live with my parents. I no longer have any close friends. Iâ€™m on several antipsychotic and antidepressants that numb my emotions and have made me impotent. I have no motivation to improve myself. The only time Iâ€™m at peace is when Iâ€™m sleeping, which is essentially my only activity. All I think about every waking second is dying. I used to be deterred by not wanting to hurt my family along with my fear of death. These are both fading. 

For years Iâ€™ve always known in the back of my mind that I would die young, and in recent years with several devastating battles with depression, I knew I would be the one to end it. My life collapsing has been a self-fulfilling prophecy. I keep putting it off but Iâ€™m certain one day, even if I make it through this episode, I will put a gun to my head and pull the trigger. And I donâ€™t see any reason not to anymore. Iâ€™ve been dead for some time now. 

Why shouldnâ€™t I do it now, before my life gets worse?
