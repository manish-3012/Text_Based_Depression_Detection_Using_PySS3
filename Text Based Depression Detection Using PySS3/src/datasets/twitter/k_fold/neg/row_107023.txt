I'm just tired...I hate knowing I'm not the only person who is just tired.. I am truly sorry for everyone out there that just has a hole inside of them..for the ones who are in bad situations and feel like death is the only way to peace. I'm sorry for those that don't know why they want to die when life is going really good. These thoughts are so loud and so painful. I hope to god that others are able to find peace. Life is hard enough without feeling like your life here on earth means nothing. I'm so tired... and just know that if you feel alone.. there are people out there that care. This place is fillled with kind hearted people sharing their warmth with others who have none in their daily life.. I don't know if I can say this life is worth the fight.. but what I can say is you matter.. even if you only matter to this group of people who are feeling the same pain.. you matter to someone.
