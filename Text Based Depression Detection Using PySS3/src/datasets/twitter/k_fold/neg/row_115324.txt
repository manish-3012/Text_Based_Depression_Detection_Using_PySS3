All my friends left meNot that I had many friends to begin with, but now I'm alone. One of them just vanished some time ago, throwing me into suicidal depression for the first time. Others left *because* of said depression. I shouldn't have told them. I shouldn't tell anyone. But now I'm afraid I won't be able to keep going without them. They loved me, and I loved them too. Now I'm alone and I just want to die. I'm feeling so bad it hurts physically. I'll try and get my mother to find me a psychologist tonight. If that doesn't work I guess I'll just kill myself in the middle of the night so nobody notices.
