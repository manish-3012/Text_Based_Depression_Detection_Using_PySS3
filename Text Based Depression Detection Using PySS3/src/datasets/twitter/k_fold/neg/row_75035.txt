I want to die. I can't feel anything. I can't eat sleep or breatheI'm done . I can't function in life. I can't do anything anymore. I'm empty and finished. I can't even cry my eyes just burn. My chest hurts . my head hurts. I want to throw up all of the time. I can't breathe. I can't speak. I'm suffocating . my brain is holding me hostage . I want to die and free myself and i don't want to go back to an asylum it will work this time.
