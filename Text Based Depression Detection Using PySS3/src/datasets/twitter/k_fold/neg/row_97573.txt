Help me understand the purpose of these things.No, I'm not suicidal, so you can downvote or whatever to keep the attention of more important posts. I just want some insight from some of you without getting flamed for it.

But I don't get how something like this subreddit or a hotline is going to help anyone who **actually wants to kill themselves.** It seems like most of the posts here are just people seeking attention, or making genuine cries for help but lack the will power to actually kill themselves anyway.

It's like people come here just to hear someone tell them that everything is going to be alright, rather than actually talking them out of suicide.

So in that sense, it's less like r/suicidewatch and more like r/depressionhelp with all the *passive* suicidal thoughts and the lack of will to actually do it.

Thoughts?

*(btw, it's not like I can't relate at all. In fact, I'm currently passing the time for a couple hours before I have an appointment with my doctor so I can tell her how this cocktail of anti-depressants she has me on still aren't doing a goddamn thing. I've been diagnosed with major clinical depression for 3+ years already, I'm just not suicidal even though it seems like I should've offed myself awhile ago.)*
