having trouble sleepingIâ€™m having a lot of trouble sleeping for the first time in a while. Itâ€™s currently 4:42 AM in NYC and Iâ€™m laying next to someone who loves me more than anything, but I canâ€™t stop feeling like I just want everything to end. Iâ€™ve been pretty depressed recently, and havenâ€™t been able to go to bed before 3 AM or do any school work, or even take an interest in my life. 

This time last year I was slowly getting over a serious drug addiction for good and getting my life back on track. To any outsider it seems like Iâ€™ve been doing well. I have a loving relationship, I fixed things with my parents, got my own place, and am finishing school. Even my friends who have seen me at my worst are really happy for me, and I canâ€™t bring myself to disappoint them by telling them how broken I feel.

Quarantine has led me to self harm again, something I really havenâ€™t done since high school. Even though I have proven to myself and my parents that I am a mature adult and capable of being independent, I feel overwhelmed by everything and I want it all to stop. Iâ€™ve been independent since I moved out at 18, but the 4 months I spend quarantining at my parentâ€™s house made me feel so helpless. Not because of them, but because it just bridged this trench I dug between by old self and new self.

I havenâ€™t like this in a really long time and I feel so helpless. I know I wonâ€™t act on it, but I want to so badly. My mind canâ€™t stop thinking of the world ending and my family dying. The intrusive thoughts have really been getting to me since I canâ€™t distract myself with parties and restaurants anymore. 

I will probably delete this when the sunrises and I put my mask of normalcy back on, but for now I feel like screaming into the void. Can anyone hear me? Am I just alone locked away in my own head
