I dont want to die by my hands, would rather die by other meansThe last couple of days I've had suicide ideation. I'd rather get hit by a vehicle on my way to work or have something fall off of a vehicle I'm following. It's been a long time since I've felt this hopeless and pointless. I feel like I have no quality skills or traits to contribute to society or to a relationship. I couldn't even check on my  family since it meant driving past my exes house. I don't even know if she still lives there, but it's a trigger regardless. I feel like such a loser. I made big changes in my life even and nothing really seemed to change for the better.
