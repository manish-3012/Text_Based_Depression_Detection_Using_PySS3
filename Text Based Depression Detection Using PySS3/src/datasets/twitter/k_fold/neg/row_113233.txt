I'm tiredI really wish i could reach out for help. But I cannot due to my job and lifestyle. I don't believe I can be helped and i'm running out of hope. Iv'e lost 30 pounds in three weeks, I'm getting weak and tired and confused and all i wan't is for it to stop. 

I just trudge through my day fantasizing about going out into the woods and finally doing it. I don't think I'll last long anyways, something is wrong and i'm not willing to get treatment.
