Urgently need help boyfriend sounded upset now heâ€™s stopped answering me.My boyfriend had a physical therapy appointment yesterday and told me he didnâ€™t want to go home because he doesnâ€™t want to be here anymore. Itâ€™s a long distance relationship so when I woke up he was still awake and told me he was in his car this is 6 hours after his appointment. I asked him where he was and he said he doesnâ€™t know and he drove to somewhere he didnâ€™t recognise he was also crying and saying he wasnâ€™t good enough. I talked to him up until this point and he hasnâ€™t replied to my text or calls. Iâ€™m so worried I want to believe that his phone just died but I feel like heâ€™s done something. I donâ€™t know his phone number as we use an app to keep in contact I contacted his family on Facebook I donâ€™t know what else to do can someone help me.
