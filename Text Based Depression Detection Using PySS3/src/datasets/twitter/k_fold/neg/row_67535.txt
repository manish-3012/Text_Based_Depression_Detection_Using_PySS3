Welp here I amI'm (21/M) sitting at work on "break" just wanting to step in front of the nearest heavy equipment I'm not really interested in living right now and I can only blame myself. I have everything I wanted as a kid a stable job making ok money an amazing fiance who is there for me when I need her a home where people actually care but now I don't know if it is enough.
