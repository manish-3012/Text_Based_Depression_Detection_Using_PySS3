through with meStocked up on sleeping pills, Have a rope.

Was thinking of just staying up all night watch the sunrise one last time and hang myself by the riverbank.

Already packed my things.

Gonna be homeless on Monday.

No point anyways. I've dragged this on. I try every year to  try kill myself.
