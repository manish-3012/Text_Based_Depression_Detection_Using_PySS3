I couldnâ€™t be any more alone than this.Ive hit rock bottom and regretted so much about opening my mental health to my closest and only â€œFriendâ€ that I talk to. 
The incredibly cold-hearted response hits me like a train of realisation how everything has been a fucking lie.

.. I just need someone who understands. Please... just one person in my entire life..
