I truly cant think of a reason to live anymoreI am 28 years old and if i didnt think it would destroy my parents i would have killed myself already, i would do it right fucking now, and as time goes on i dont know if even to spare them will stop me, i need out soon

At this point i feel like i have seen everything life has to offer for me, I am uncapable of making friends, of any kind of career that requires schooling or anything like that, and obviously not being able to make friends i will never have a relationship of any kind.

All my life consists of it going to my shitty minimum wage hardware store job, coming home and going to sleep and repeat. 

nothing would make me my life better then dying in my sleep any of these nights, i just want out i give up.
