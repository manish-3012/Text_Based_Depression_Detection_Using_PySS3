I feel hopelessMy life was great up until about 7 months ago, my girlfriend broke up with me and I was very emotionally attached to her, all Iâ€™ve wanted out of life is love and I thought I would finally get it, she left me because she learned she was lesbian, my mother has given up on me, Iâ€™ve lost my job, almost all of my friends, and Iâ€™m failing school, I donâ€™t know how to explain anything to anyone and I just come off as rude to other people, Iâ€™ve been comtemplating suicide almost every day since the breakup and itâ€™s looking more and more like itâ€™s the only way I canâ€™t be at peace, Iâ€™m so tired and I just want to be with my girlfriend again she was the only person that made me feel okay...
