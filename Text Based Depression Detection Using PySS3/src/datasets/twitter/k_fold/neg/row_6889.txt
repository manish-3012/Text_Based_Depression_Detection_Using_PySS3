Is this Covid craziness killing me or is it something else?
For some reason, recently, I do not want to live. I do not want to die, I swear. But I do not understand how to live. Strange, unsolvable equation.
I look at the world from aside. People buy clothes, people negotiate, people travel and people love. Sunbathe, relax, spend and earn a lot of money.
Why do I always feel that I am worse than others?
That Iâ€™m unworthy of a big, beautiful, fat life.
I donâ€™t understand how they do it.
Where does this energy come from?
I hate them all.
Or am I afraid of them all?
I do not see my future.
I really want to taste life again.
I want to truly understand that life is a gift.
I'm so tired of this quarantine.
Long before him, I was tired of my city.
I live in the apartment where I lived as a child, since 1996 and I donâ€™t go out because I know every corner there. Now my parents are dead and live here alone. I work from home and only communicate formally with the boss and crazy relatives.
There is nothing interesting outside and I don't want to explore the city.
Fuck it.
Now I am 30 years old and I feel absolutely empty.
I used to want children, but now I fully understand that I don't have resources for this.
I did not find a therapist who would help me.
Previously, the cashierâ€™s rude word in the supermarket did not hurt me because I had friends. Now I shed tear if someone was rude to me, what the hell?
I just want a genuine human interaction live.
I feel invisible. It's been two years.
When will I feel better?
When will it all end?
What is the number?
I just want to feel alive.
