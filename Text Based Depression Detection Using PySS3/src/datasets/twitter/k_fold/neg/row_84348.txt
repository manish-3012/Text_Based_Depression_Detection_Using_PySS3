After years of rape and molestation, I just want to end it. I could really use a (female) friend.My first sexual assault was around the age of 7, and my most recent just five months ago. I don't want to live in a world where my body isn't mine. I'm so tired of not getting to choose, and I keep falling into these traps with men who only want to hurt me. I can't deal with the memories, flashbacks, and triggers anymore. Years of therapy and several medications have failed to help and suicide has been seeming more and more like the best option for me. The only thing that's helped even a little bit is talking, which is why I'm here. If you'd be willing to talk â€“ particularly if you've been through anything similar â€“ I'd really appreciate it. I have a hard time with men because of my abuse, so women would be strongly preferred. Thank you in advance. &lt;3
