X-Mas present suggestions for someone who has tried to end it all.Hi, my nephew this summer tried to kill himself but got help at the right time. I'd like to get him something special to boost his optimism for the new year. He's a 20 something w/ no job, likes video games of course, but has a learning disability and doesn't read books. I'd like to get a book if it's simple enough (I'm thinking perhaps a graphic novel) but maybe people might have some other ideas. Thanks!
