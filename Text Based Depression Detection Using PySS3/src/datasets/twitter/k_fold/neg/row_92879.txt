I think I'm done now. I'm not sure if this even belongs on here, but I feel like I have no one to turn to.

Besides all the other shit going on in my life right now, I've been dealing with depression for 9 years. Honestly, most of it was probably caused by my depression. I won't get into it all now. That would take too long, and I just don't want to think about it. At this point I feel like my depression is never going to go away. Living like this isn't really living. It's not a life worth living. If my depression is just going to stick with me until I die, I want to die now. I've been dealing with suicidal thought about as long as I've had depression. I go through months were not a day goes by that I don't want to die. After that I'll have some months that I don't think about my death. For some parts of it I still feel depressed. The other parts I actually, kind of feel normal. Not that I would know or remember what normal feels like. Does anyone else here feel that? Not know what normal feels like that is. Back to what I was saying, I don't think about my death for awhile, but before you know it I become suicidal again. Next thing I know I've thought about suicide every day for months. It's like a cycle and it never fails.

Sorry for the long post by the way. I promise I'll be done soon, and feel free to leave. I'm mostly just doing this to get it all off my chest. You see, I hinted at this all in a message, to the one person in my life that I feel like I can open up about all of this deep dark stuff to. Why do I feel that way? He's experienced this all to. Makes it easier to talk to him about. I feel like this would scare anyone else away. Then I realized that today is his birthday though. Just became his birthday. I can't dump this on him now, so I deleted the message and said "happy birthday" instead.

I'm finishing now, I promise. This all leads up to me deciding today that I'm ready to end it. I am ready to die. In all the time I have thought about suicide, I've never really meant it. It was more of a wish. It was something I planned to make myself feel better in the moment, but never meant to follow through on. Now I mean it though. Does it break my heart to leave my family and friends behind? Yes, more than words can say. Great, now I'm starting to cry. I cannot continue living like this though. It's too much. I am simply exhausted. I have tried many things as an attempt to help. Nothing has worked. If it has it has only been temporary. Even if I have a good day (there aren't too many of those), depression is there to choke me at night. I've also given this plenty of time. Almost a decade. I think that's about it

If you read all of this, thank you for caring. It truly means a lot.
