I got my wisdom teeth pulled TWI got my wisdom teeth pulled and they gave me hydrocodone rx. I haven't been taking them so that I can save them when I want to end it. I suppose that if I take what I have left with a couple shots that will do me in. The pain I feel in my jaw is the worst physical pain Ive ever been in. I took some day off work but not enough. I told my boss that I would need more time off and they are giving me shit for it. I think I might just end it now.
