Today was the first time I actually thought maybe it would be better if I was deadIâ€™ve always had a lot of suicidal thoughts and ideation. But they were always more out of being mad at myself for one reason or another. 

But today I truly felt the sentiment of wanting to not exist. I just thought it would be so easy to not be here anymore. It would feel better to feel nothing than how I am feeling lately. And Iâ€™ve always been terrified of dying, an existentialist nightmare. But now I just think I want peace, and isnâ€™t death the ultimate peace? Like a nice long nap, where I donâ€™t have to be in pain anymore.
