Subconciously trying to kill myselfI've tried to kill myself once in the past and I have a history of hurting myself to deal with intense stress.

I'm living with intense stress for extended periods of time now, I keep myself from hurting me, but as a result I react in weird, self-harming ways and I'm afraid it'll end up turning me into a cripple and possibly hurting innocent people.

I like riding my bike and recently I occassionaly have the urge to kill myself popping into my head. Like not slowing down while driving towards a crossroads. It could be so easy...

Then there's moments where I subconciously disregard my safety, pick pointless fights etc. 

Just an hour ago I almost got hit by a car, the car owner was a little shocked and pretty mad and when he yelled, asking whether or not I want to fucking die, the answer in my mind was "Yeah I guess so".

Not always are other people involved, sometimes I may just be on a mountain road heading downhill and considering not hitting the brakes. This already happened once and I ended up breaking my right arm and hand with abrasions and bruises all over my body. The medics were pretty surprised my head was unscathed which seems to have been pure luck or maybe survival instinct idk.



TL:DR
I'm resisting the urge to kill or hurt myself but I regularly experience brief moments where I conciously or subconciously expose myself to great danger.

I'm afraid to end up harming other people or ending up as a cripple rather than dead.
