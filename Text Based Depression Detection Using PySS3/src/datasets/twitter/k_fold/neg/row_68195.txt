I can't fall any deeper. Done.I'm a 21 year old guy, who is just sick of living this world. I used to be the hunk/funny guy back in my town that girls liked and guys were friends with. But in 2014 i moved from my town to college and it all has been rock bottom since then. I have no real friends here, although i can stand some, it simply doesn't feel like real friendship. I've gained about 20 pounds, all of my summer has been spent in front of the computer and /or eating. I'm in law school (which i hate) because i've never known what are my abilities. Things as simple as brushing my teeth have become a titanic task because of how depressed i am. The only times i feel alive again is when i go back to my old town and see my friends, but i am tired of being a useless piece of crap the rest of the days. I don't care for girls anymore, the few sexual encounters i've had, i've had erectile dysfunction, i just want to kill myself but i'm afraid even that (as everything i do) i will do wrong. Everyone seems to start being succesful, meanwhile i've never had a job, a real sexual relationship, travlled around the world, and hate my career. Just wanted to vent. Thanks for reading this.
