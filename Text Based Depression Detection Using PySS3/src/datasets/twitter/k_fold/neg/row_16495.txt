I think nowI have the courage to do it, go to sleep. Fold away into nonbeing. Whatever. I think now I won't be afraid of the moments *after* I take the action all the way. After cuts, after blood, to see the colors of myself on the inside, and open all my veins. Then I might finally do the thing that feels like it can't be done, the door at the end of a dream's corridor. If I shut my mind and push all the way. Maybe - but I dont want to go alone.
