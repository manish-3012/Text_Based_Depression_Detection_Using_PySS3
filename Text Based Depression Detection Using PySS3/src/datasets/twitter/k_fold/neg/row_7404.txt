I don't think I'm sickThe doctors want to label me as bipolar or depressed for my substance abuse problems and suicidal thoughts. After being commited to two hospitals and given ECT and drugs, I don't want to accept their assessment.

I'm not telling anyone to be defiant or skip their meds, but something amazing happened this morning. I forgot to take my night night meds and I woke up with euphoria that I have not felt.

I will go on record saying that I believe ECT is cruel and unusual punishment. The reason people feel good a few weeks later is because the body has recovered. To be honest, my body is also rejecting the meds and trying to get me to where I was before.

I don't think I'm sick. I think it's unusual for people to not consider an escape route when they feel trapped. I think doctors are too quick to drug and label people.

Again, if you're suicidal, reach out for help. Maybe I'm just in a hypomanic state, but I don't want to accept blindly the assertion of doctors.
