I canâ€™t take this pain anymoreI canâ€™t take the pain of having these problems anymore. My depression, lonliness, and suicidal thoughts r caused by my problems and I canâ€™t get rid of them. I have no friends, no girlfriend, online people keep leaving me, my only friend I ever had left me over a year ago and Iâ€™m still sad about it and I miss them, I donâ€™t have any skills. I just canâ€™t bear this pain anymore as my problems continue to exist. People just tell me to talk to people but I canâ€™t do that. Then they get angry and abandon me. No one understands me, no matter if they say they do. My only option at this point is just to kill myself because I wonâ€™t have the pain and all these problems.
