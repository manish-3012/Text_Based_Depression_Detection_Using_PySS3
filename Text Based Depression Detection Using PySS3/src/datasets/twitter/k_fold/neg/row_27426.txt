its all the sameI am suicidal and have been methodically planning my own death for a long time now by cutting ties to people etc, making it the way i see fit. in this time i have been browsing this subreddit and it makes me even more sad, everytime someone threatens to kill themselves the answers or responses are formulaic. To believe some people actually feel that saying, you will be loved, or your job will work out, or any of this bullshit is a good reason to live is more depressing than anything i know or can think of. 
So i came here to ask one question, why do you live? or What is a reason for me to live? 
If you can answer that in a way that is not centered around the biological desire for societal succes, or group value/emotional ties, or any other bullshit that keeps the world running, it will truely be an answer that will cause me to have an epiphany. Otherwise, it only saddens me even more to know that people can live with such meaningless reasons...
