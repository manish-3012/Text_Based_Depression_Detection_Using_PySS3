I can feel myself fading awayLong story short, I have bipolar depression, anxiety, ocd, ptsd, an a eating disorder. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself twice in the past year and a half. First time I was so close and the second time was just a stupid attempt of an overdose. Now as time goes on, Iâ€™m not sad or at a all time low but more so content with taking my life. I used to think about how itâ€™ll impact my family but now, itâ€™s nothing more than a passing though. I know theyâ€™ll get over it eventually. Iâ€™ve stayed as long as I could, Iâ€™m at peace with this decision.
