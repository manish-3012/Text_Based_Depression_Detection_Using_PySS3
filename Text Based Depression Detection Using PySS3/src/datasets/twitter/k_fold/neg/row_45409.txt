22 yo old male, lost any hope to be ever succesfulI am reaching 23 this year and I haven't achieved anything yet. I am starting a college this year when all of pepole in my age gradiated.
I am virgin living with parents. Never had girlfriend and don't even trying to get one 'til I will get a job and own space. I will be 26, maybe 27 years old then so who would even want a miserable loser? Yeah, I may lower my age on Tinder and lie that I am not virgin but it's only good for some ONS and not getting any relationship.

Girls never liked me, I was always repulsed and I was the guy who just follow friends but they didn't want to talk with me and I was always behind. No one wanted to talk with me even if I tried. I am feeling like a worthless shit and I am thinking about suicide.

I was also in mental hospital and strongly bullied in school so I am probably fcked up for rest of my life
I am right now fat 6'1, exercising, trying to get super-fit but I am not confident, I can't talk with girls and I am boring. I am even to afraid to be on gym with others or just say "hi" ans that's why I am exercising early morning or really late evening.
