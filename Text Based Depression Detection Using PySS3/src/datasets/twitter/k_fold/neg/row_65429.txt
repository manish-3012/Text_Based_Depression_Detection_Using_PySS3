I hate talking about my problems but even when I want to, I'm scared to be honest.Don't like to talk to people IRL about my issues which is why I barely see psychiatrist anymore. Too anxious and avoidant to face or talk about problems but when I do feel like it, I'm still afraid.

I imagine being at doctor's. I don't know laws well enough. I'm scared to be committed or sent to jail or deemed a nut case, etc. I don't know if I can be 100% honest if I talk to them. I bet I have periods of intense honesty and other times will be a pathological liar.

Back to my worries about law and being committed... yeah should I tell them I fantasize about buying a gun and blowing my brains out as I sit at home by myself, numb and useless to society? Or overdosing on all these opiates I have? Or that I have urges to be a rapist even? Like I don't act on anything so that's ok right? I'd rather they give me the electric chair than commit me to mental ward forever or have me labelled as a loony to everyone I know and can't get a normal job or life ever anyways
