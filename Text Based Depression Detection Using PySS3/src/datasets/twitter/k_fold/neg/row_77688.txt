Thought about chugging some benadryl this morning, I just want to be asleepBeing awake is so horrible, it's like my head is chasing itself all the time with anxious thoughts about how worthless I am, how my future is set in misery and how there's nothing I can do to stop it. I have to work so hard everyday just to police my thoughts into Not Panic Inducing and it's exhausing. 

When I'm asleep everything is better. I don't feel anxious or scared, I don't have to watch my every though because the bad thoughts don't show up. I dream of these happy wonderful fantasy worlds where everything is nice and soft and sweet and it feels so so good. I want to go back to that. I just really don't want to be awake.
