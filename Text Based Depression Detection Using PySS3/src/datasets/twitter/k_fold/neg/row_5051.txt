Every day seems worse than the previous.Been having suicidal thoughts since forever. Was never social. I'm not too fond of people and generally stay away from most of them. Life after corona has been a complete shit show. Lost my job. Started a bake from home business which doesn't make me much. Expenses are still more than income and I'm slowly going broke. I'm a 26 year old guy with no hope for the future. Not religious but have to pretend like I care out of respect. The only thing keeping me sane is my gf. But I see no future with her too. She's a Muslim, her family is strict and will probably object to her having anything to do with me. Every day is a drag. I wish I could just disappear. Or swap my life with a child with an incurable disease. Atleast they'd be able to make the most of it.
