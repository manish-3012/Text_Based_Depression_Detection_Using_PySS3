Life just seems too hardI feel like life just always finds a way to beat me down when I'm starting to feel good about things. I feel it's all trivial too. People have real problems and all mine seem small and insignificant. I have never been great with money but recently I have stated to get a head just a little bit. Then last Friday after a particular good day I'm driving and boom my car just stalls out. Find out it's going to be a somewhat pricey fix so it's going to wipe me out and then I had to borrow money from my parents to finish paying for it. It just feels that every time I'm starting to get ahead in anyway shape or form life decides to punch me in the balls and remind me of my place. I also feel that I'm being over dramatic. Life just seems to hard for me someday and I feel like I would better off not here. Well that's my rant thanks for reading.
