I wish I died of covid tbhIt wouldâ€™ve been much easier but i unfortunately have a strong immune system I guess. I wouldnâ€™t have to disappoint my parents at least. 2021 will be another shit year and thatâ€™s almost 2 years if my life wasted. My life has been a waste since 2015 so why do I even bother. I have no friends, bf or passions anyway and itâ€™s too late for me anyone bc im depressed and self sabotage
