Worsening thoughtsI've always been somewhat of a masochist but my thoughts lately have felt somewhat vile to me. I've been having daydreams of someone stringing me up by my throat and disemboweling me while ripping away at my innards, my thoughts have grown even more violent and awful compared to before where I'd just simply be passive to something killing me. Now I just feel embarrassed and guilty for letting my mind wander and I feel like a bad person for even wanting people to hurt me. Before it felt like a simple pleasure but now my entire brain is just obsessed with me dying at someone's hands. I have no urge to hurt myself but in my head I know deep down that I wish someone on the road would swerve to kill me, backing up to grind their wheels while crushing my ribs. This isn't normal but I don't know how to even feel since all I can feel at this point is desensitized apathy
