I don't have plans to kill myself, but I can't see why it's a bad ideaSo a bit of background: I'm male and 21 years old. It's only been in the past few months that I've completely lost interest in everything that I used to enjoy. I've been doing well in college as a Computer Science major and enjoyed that, but like I said, I don't see any more interest in that either, so my career prospects are pretty much null. Life has become a boring chore and I'm tired of dealing with it.

I do have a lot of people who love and care about me, and no one in my life who is toxic, and I know that they would be upset if I did commit suicide, but I think they're too stupid to realize that they don't need me in their lives. I really think that if I died that they would (or should) get over it within a year or so.

Also, don't worry about me harming myself. I'm too terrified to do that half the time and I wouldn't want to leave a mess for anyone to clean up. I would just choose to disappear without a trace, given the option, so no one would put themselves in harm's way trying to rescue me. I'm not even sure why I'm posting this here. I guess I'm just maybe trying to see if I should have any reason to continue being alive. If it helps, I haven't bothered seeking treatment because I don't see how it's going to fix anything. I've probably had depression for years and it's ruined so many things for me already.

I'll be going back to work, but feel free to post here and ask questions. I will be back later to answer any questions you all have.
