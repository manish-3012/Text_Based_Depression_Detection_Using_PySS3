Near the end of last summer I thought abojt ending it, Summer has started again and im only 2 weeks in, the thoughts are already here.My girlfriend hasn't talked to me for the past two days, we got into a fight. My friends all won't hang out with me. I don't have the motivation to experience this loneliness anymore. Anyone wanna give me a reason to live?
