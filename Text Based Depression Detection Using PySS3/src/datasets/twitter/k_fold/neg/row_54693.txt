I hate having GI problemsI have different health issues effecting different parts of my body, but the most significant would definitely be my GI issues. I've had them for a few years now and I suffer from chronic constipation. Every time I get constipated, I become extremely depressed and suicidal, and this feeling is only relieved when I am able to go to the bathroom. I've only gone a little bit in the past few days and my stomach hurts. I hate that the GI doctors don't know what's wrong either. I feel like I want to kill myself and don't know what to do.
