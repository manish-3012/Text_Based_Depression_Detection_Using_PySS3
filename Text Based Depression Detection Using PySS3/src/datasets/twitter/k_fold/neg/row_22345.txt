Life and what it has to offer?Hi I'm a 30yr old male who's currently contemplating life and what it has left to offer.

I'm not going to preach but the basics are I've been raised well. I have amazing parents/family who've raised me with nothing but love and given me everything I've needed to flourish in life.

I have a good profession which I exceled at and become well respected for. I had my own buisness  at the age of 25. I was on the way to success  my ex partner legally took Â£27,000  and put an end to that.

I live in a criminally driven area. In turn it sucked me in at the age of 14. I've been arrested 17 times in total for numerous reasons. Been a heavy cannabis user since the age of 14 and a cocaine user since 21. 

Attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge whilst off my face and whiskey and cocaine... obvioualy didn't work just hurt a lot. 

I have reached the point where I'm contemplating what's left in life for me... I've experienced so many different thrills and pleasures fulfilled my fantasies and guilty pleasures  in life from the age of 16 to now that I feel there's nothing left for me. 

So the main reason I'm posting this is to ask all of you... what actually makes you happy? Because I don't know any more..
