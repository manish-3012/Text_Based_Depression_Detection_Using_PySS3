I fucked up everythingI fucked up my marriage. I fucked up our kids. I had sex with someone else while my husband (boyfriend at the time) and I were broken up. This was in 2013 (broken up August 2012, father died in February 2013, had one night stand April 2013). We get back together August 2013. He told me if I had been with anyone else he wouldnâ€™t get back together with me. And I was scared. So I lied. I know itâ€™s no excuse. I was drunk, 19, and mourning my father. Was felt with guilt because of this. I know it was seven years ago but it was killing me. Trying to find a counselor to discuss and figure out how to tell him. Meantime google how to cope with cheating (though I didnâ€™t cheat. I felt like I did). He saw it. I admitted. And now he hates me. He wonâ€™t talk to me. He doesnâ€™t believe it was one time. I guess he thinks I just slept around. 

What hurts is I was also going to try to talk to the counselor about an assault that happened while we were together and I donâ€™t even know how I can tell him this. I said no. But he still kissed me. I fear in my black out state I came off flirty? Maybe initiated it? I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t remember. But I know I said no when I came to. And he kept kissing me. He claimed we didnâ€™t do anything else. I kept playing in my head my bf (husband) saying he wouldnâ€™t be with me if I got with anyone. So I didnâ€™t tell him. 

He knows this guy. And I donâ€™t want to tell him who it is but he will ask. Because he would try to fight him. He would confront him. And I canâ€™t fucking deal with it. He BROKE me. I canâ€™t face him. I donâ€™t want to. I hate him. And I hate myself. 

I want to end this. My three kids and husband would be better off without me. Iâ€™m a paranoid depressed person anyway. Iâ€™m bitter, angry, and obviously a liar. My husband thinks Iâ€™m a slut Iâ€™m sure. Iâ€™m sitting here on the suicide hotline and Iâ€™ve been on this chat for 30 minutes and told it would take a few. Iâ€™m such a pussy because I probably wonâ€™t do it. He probably will leave me. whatâ€™s the point.
