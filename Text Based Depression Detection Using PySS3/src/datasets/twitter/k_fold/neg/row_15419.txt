It's crazy to think this is as worse as it gets, but then it gets worse. I think I'm finally going to do it.Yesterday, I was told that my twin brother is exhibiting behaviors we experienced as a child, such as physical abuse. I don't know the full extent of it, but I think he's abused his wife and his kids. Then my few friends I had removed me from everything and said some horrible things about me. I'm sure I have a text on my phone from my mother calling me bad names. The memories of my sexual abuse are haunting me. I don't want to eat, I don't want to take my medicine, and I don't want help. I want to die, and if I have my way, I'll be dead soon. I'm tired of everyone saying everything gets better but then it doesn't ever get any better. I'm tired of waking up just to hurt all day. I'm tired of crying but feeling nothing. I'm tired. And I'll be dead soon.
