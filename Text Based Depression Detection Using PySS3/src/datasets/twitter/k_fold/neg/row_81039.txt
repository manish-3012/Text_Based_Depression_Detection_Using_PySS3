Just remember if you kill yourself, you're going to kill people (internally) closes to you.If you hold debts, mortgages, or loans,  it's going to go over to your family. It will make their lives horrible 

Your best friend or closes family will most likley (statistically speaking) commit sucide and then his/her family falls apart and the cycle of suicides and depression continues. Dead on the outside and inside. 

So as Blissful as this sounds it's probably the most selfish thing you can do. Reconsider, evaluate, and try to find some inner peace.
