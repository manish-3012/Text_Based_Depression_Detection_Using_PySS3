Just feel like tapping out.Have you guys seen the WWE tag team matches where one person taps out so that the other person can come in? I just feel like tapping out. I do not have major problems and I know other people have bigger problem. I just feel a sense of apathy towards me and from the past 2 weeks I have been contemplating Suicide. I am sure that I do not want to llive anymore. What is the best forum to talk about it freely? Also what keeps you going?
