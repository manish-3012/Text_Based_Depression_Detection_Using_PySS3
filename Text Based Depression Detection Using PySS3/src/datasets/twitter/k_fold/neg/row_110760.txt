I'm so tiredI think that if I really tried I'd be able to kill myself tonight. I feel stupid because I don't even have a good reason to die. I just hate this shitty life. I'm supposed to be getting better but I'm not. I have someone to talk to but I can't bring myself to do it. I don't want to bother them. and im scared that'd they would do something about it. I cut a little bit a minute ago and I feel bad because I barely made any scratches. if I was brave I'd be able to do a lot more. I look at r/selfharmpics a lot and it makes me feel really bad that I can't do what some people on there do but it's like an addiction I can't stop. I've started to want to abuse my prescriptions  ut people would find out. idk why I want to. maybe just as an escape. 
if I was gone maybe a few people would care. the only reason I'm alive rig the now is my wonderful girlfriend. I'm scared for her if I were to die. but it's getting hard to deal with everything. I cat cry anymore it s all I want to do. if so many other propel have killed themselves though and the world is so spinning why not me!!! why the fuck not. 

I'm not worth it. everything I do is embarrassing. I think about stupid shit I've done in the past CONSTANTLY. and im always worried. and im on fucking 5 different antidepressants and it's not doing shit. I'm sol cared to ask to see my therapist because my mom would be all worried and she has enough on her plate now. why am I here. fuck. I'm tired so I'm gonna stop here.
