I could use some perspectiveI've been depressed for 10+ years. In the past, I had a good memory and this has led me to take note of every single social faux pas and academic failure. I couldn't forgive myself for my mistakes, so I decided to numb and dull my brain as much as I could. As a result, I can't remember the memories good or bad. Regardless, my perspective on life has inhibited my ability to feel any happiness. 

There's too much pain and misery.
I don't know how much longer I can keep going.
