I AM PSYCHOTIC AND WANT TO LEAVE THIS BODYThis is a long post, but I beg you. Any of you. Please read it, for the sake of another human. I've lost it. My thoughts are incoherent. I don't trust any of them.  I can't function day to day. I can't do anything.

I have thoughts. I don't know why I have these thoughts, I think about why I have these thoughts. I think about whether or not the fact that I'm thinking about whatever I'm thinking about means anything, and if it does, what? I don't trust the way my thoughts form. I don't know who I am. I don't know what I am.

I WANT TO DIE. DYING IS ALL I HAVE EVER WANTED TO DO SINCE I WAS 6. I have been depressed, suicidal since I was 6.

I'm crazy. I'm insane. Let me tell you about my day today. This is **ONE** example of a day of mine.

I drove 1000 miles with no break. Why? Because I was bored. For the first 5 hours, I had these thoughts. Thoughts of murder. I felt strange. I just wanted to murder and torture innocent people. I made specific plans to kidnap, rape, torture, and kill some women. I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. I have urges. Every moment of every day, my behavior is different from my thoughts and my intentions. It's as if two entities are possessing me; one controls my mind, the other controls my body.

My parents abused me. A lot. Every day. And the worst part? They genuinely care about me, and that guilted the FUCK out of my child self. Everything about their behavior said "I hate you. You're worthless. We wish you were dead. Kill yourself." and they abused my mind EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. But they love me. Their behavior is 100% inconsistent with their thoughts. They're INSANE PEOPLE. They are absolutely batshit insane people, beyond comprehension. They are more insane than I am, and I can feel myself turning into my father more and more every day and the thought that I am becoming like him absolutely crushes me.

I'm worried my urges will get worse. I'm worried I will do something unforgivable before I realize it. I want to die. I want the sweet release of death. Being in this mind is torture. 

I regret every single thing I have done in life. I can't believe I got to this point.

I have no friends, no family, no dreams, no motivations, no likes, no dislikes, no opinions of my own. I am a mindless drone, isolated and spending every second of every day alone with my own thoughts.

Please, talk to me. I tell myself I don't want help, but I do. I want help. I want to be happy. I want to have dreams. I want to make other people smile and laugh with them. I want to have meaningful connections with other people. But I just can't. All I do is send myself farther and farther down the hole.

I wasn't always like this. I had dreams as a very young kid. I was nice to everyone, and just wanted everyone to get along and be happy. I just wanted to be happy, to help others. But my parents FUCKED. ME. UP. THEY DID THIS TO ME. LIVING WITH THEM WAS **ABSOLUTE HELL**.

I'm crying. I'm a 19 year old dude. I look 12, and I feel like a 70 year old man with the mind of a tormented 6 year old. Please talk to me. Ask me questions. I want to fix myself. I want to be happy. I am going to get mental help in about two weeks, but for now, I just need something, ANYTHING. So I turn to you guys. Please, I beg of you. I just want to hear from other people. I want to die more than anything else, but a small piece of me doesn't.
