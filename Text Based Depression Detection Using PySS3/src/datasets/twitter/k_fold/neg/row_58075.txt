Bucket list ideasThese next few weeks Iâ€™m gonna get everything prepared such as notes and my will and finally say bye. Iâ€™m wondering if thereâ€™s anything interesting I should do before I go? Literally anything at all, itâ€™s not like any consequences will matter so Iâ€™m up for doing some mad shit as long as it wonâ€™t harm others. Iâ€™ve got a few things in mind already but Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s some things Iâ€™ve not though about. Any ideas are appreciated :) 

Btw please donâ€™t try to talk me out of it because youâ€™ll be wasting your time, thanks!
