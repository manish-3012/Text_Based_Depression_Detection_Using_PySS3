Trigger-Mention of Rape-Feeling suffocatedHey guys.
Donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m writing on here. Iâ€™m more of the bottle it up kind of person. But I think I just need to...talk. 

I think the thing about rape is that some people thing eventually the pain goes away. I hate the term survivor, always have and always will. I think thatâ€™s because survivor means youâ€™ve dealt with it. Youâ€™ve won. Youâ€™ve overcome it and it no longer affects you. When the reality is that it affects me all the time.

It happened when I was six years old. My mother had told me it only happened for one year. Eventually I turned the house up one day in search for answers and found documents that said he raped me for several years. To quote him â€œThere isnâ€™t a day I can recall that I didnâ€™t rape her.â€. 

Now my mind blocked most of it out. But that in no way makes it better. It in no way means that I donâ€™t deal with the consequences of it. All my relationships have failed because I refuse sex with them. It just freaks me out. Itâ€™s like giving up control. 

Iâ€™m still living with my mother now. I tried to tell her one day that I wanted a restraining order against my step-brother and she couldnâ€™t believe it. Wanted to know why. When I finally spoke up for once and simply said that I was doing it for me, she rolled her eyes, said whatever and left the room and never spoke again for the rest of the night. In her eyes, I believe she doesnâ€™t see that heâ€™s done anything wrong. Sheâ€™s kept what he did a secret from my two younger siblings because she doesnâ€™t want it to affect their relationship with him. She always brings him around despite my pleas not to.

With the strained relationship, I broke down to my dad one night and asked if he supported me...because I needed to know someone did. Thankfully he did and understood. But also let it slip that my other older brother had raped me as well....something I was unaware of and canâ€™t recall. My dad lives too far out to really move to his and with this new news....itâ€™s just too much to process. 

Now I just feel like Iâ€™m suffocating. I canâ€™t talk to anyone because Iâ€™m wanting to be a Teacher after University and nobody will hire a depressed teacher compared to a normal one. I just...donâ€™t really want to be here anymore. I want to cry, and scream, and throw plates against a wall until it finally makes me breakdown more. But most of all, I just donâ€™t want to do it anymore. Itâ€™s suffocating.  I donâ€™t see a way out of this. I canâ€™t get a restraining order. I canâ€™t leave home as I donâ€™t earn enough...I just...canâ€™t see a light. Iâ€™d rather end the pain then continue to fight a loosing battle....Nobody will ever love me. Iâ€™ll never be free of my brothers. I canâ€™t have a normal family....I just...want to end it really.
