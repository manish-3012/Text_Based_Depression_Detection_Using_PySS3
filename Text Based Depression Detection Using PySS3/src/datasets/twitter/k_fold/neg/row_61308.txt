I can't do this anymore...I feel trapped.. My children are the only reason I'm still living here.. I'd rather be homeless than be living in this roach/rat infested house with my bm.. I have no job no car nothing.. If I leave I will truly be on the streets.. I can't bare to be away from my kids butI can't keep living like this.. We argue so much I get agitated super easily I just don't know what to do.. I need help.. I need guidance.. Some nights I cry myself to sleep hoping to die.. If I didn't have kids I would've been long gone but I would do anything for them and I can't NOT wake up next to them every morning.. I'm so lost please help
