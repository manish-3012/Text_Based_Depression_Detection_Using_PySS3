What does it matter?I don't understand why it matters if I choose to end my life. I'm not a brain surgeon or a Nobel peace prize winner. In a world of billions I'm literally no one. I have the utmost faith that someone else will be able to financially administrate the school I work at during the day and take peoples food orders to the kitchen where I work at night. My kids will be cared for by my financially, emotionally and mentally stable sister who has her PhD in psychology. Me leaving would actually be selfless in offering them a better life. And I would be free from the emotional pain I carry constantly and the guilt of achieving nothing of value in my life. I wish with all my heart that I could donate my life to a baby who never had the chance to even take a breath, maybe they would be able to make better choices than I did. I wasted a precious gift. I'm ready to give it back.
