Wanna die but donâ€™t wanna hurt loved onesIâ€™ve ruined my life beyond repair and Iâ€™m ready to leave earth but I donâ€™t wanna destroy the psyches of the people who know and love me. My mom would probably die of heartbreak if I killed myself and my dad and other loved ones would never be the same. Reading stories from those impacted by suicide on r/suicidebereavement is making me feel guilty about my suicidal wishes because I dont wanna put my loved ones through grief but I donâ€™t wanna live anymore. Iâ€™m stuck. My life is no longer worth living but I donâ€™t wanna hurt people. I canâ€™t decide whether staying alive and suffering is worth not hurting people who love me. Someone please help me
