[15] Trying to figure out the least painful wayMan I've been sexually abused, lost my little sister, and have experienced heavy domestic violence, I've wanted to kill myself ever since I was very young. I don't have decent relationship with either parent. I don't think a noose would feel good and it would be loud. Overdose would hurt bad. I don't have a gun, but I figured that is the best option.
