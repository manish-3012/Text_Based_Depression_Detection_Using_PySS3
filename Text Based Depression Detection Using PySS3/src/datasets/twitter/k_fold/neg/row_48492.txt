i shouldnt be sad, that i shouldnt have these thoughts. i feel so selfishi want to tell someone so badly, especially my girlfriend because she's also my best friend and i tell her everything.
its when it concerns my suicidal thoughts and lost motivation that i find it hard to tell her about it. during my worst episodes, it ends with an argument/disagreement and let her believe that. but not today, i couldnt hold it in and i had to spill out my feelings and i feel like shit. i feel like i shouldnt be depressed, i shouldn't be feeling like this. my life is pretty much normal, i got into the college of my dreams, im in a loving relationship with my girl... but i cant stop these intrusive thoughts.
im so selfish, and i hate myself for feeling this way. i should be happy. i should be striving for a better future. she told me i need to get professional help, but i dont think i deserve it. other people have things a lot worse and have real problems. me? i guess im just sad and lazy for no reason.
i also fucking love the winter time, but i've noticed the past few years that my mood always drops to a depressive low during these times. i hate it. i want to die
