Suicidal 14yr here, tonight's the night.Tonight is the night I finally gather my strength and end this stupid life.

I've waited long enough, only to get hurt again and again. It never gets better, does it?

I won't be missed too much - barely any friends, my family will be fine without me I'm sure.

I only wish I could have made a better mark on this world, right now I'm just that annoying pathetic kid that nobody really likes.

Sorry to everybody for being such a disappointment.

I love you all, but this is for the greater good, trust me.
