Thank you for your stories RedditThank you Reddit! Thanks to everyone who posts their personal stories! I've been suffering in silence for years. My partner knows a little about it but I don't want to burden anyone with my feelings. I feel ashamed that I am so sad and depressed. I feel like I should be stronger than I am.
 When I was younger it was extremely difficult to pull myself out of these intense dark feelings, now 10 years later I still find these waves of severe pain shocking my body and my mind. As I got older it has been easier to tell myself that it will pass. Recently in the last few weeks I have felt I have dived into a tailspin. I have been adversely reacting to situations and I have been upset about everything. It has been so hard that I can't seem to talk myself out of it. I feel paralyzed and I feel immense overwhelming pain. Everyday I sit in my room and look at my doorway and think about hanging myself from it. I don't want to tell anyone, because most people think I am happy and fine. I don't want to scare anyone or become a situation people have to deal with. 
I'm so tired of suffering. So tired of the struggle to be happy but I read many posts on this subreddit and I feel like it gave me the motivation to keep on fighting at least for today. I will keep some of these posts about family members and their tragedies in mind every time it gets too dark.
