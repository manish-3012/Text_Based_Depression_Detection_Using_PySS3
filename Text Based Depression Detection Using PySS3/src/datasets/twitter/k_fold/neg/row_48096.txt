Help for a Friend, Urgent.My friend has just told me she plans to kill herself tonight and I'm unsure of what to say. She's self-harmed in the past and just went through a pretty bad break-up, although she still hasn't told me the full story. 

She said "I just can't live anymore. There's no reason for me to be here. I just can't do it anymore." 

EDIT: She just told me she's burnt her arms.
