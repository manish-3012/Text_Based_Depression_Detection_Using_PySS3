I'm not sure why I keep on livingI have no purpose. I have nothing that drives me. No goals. I just go about my life day to day just doing what I can to entertain myself. I don't enjoy this life and I have no idea what will bring me joy. I have no reason to live so I think I'm just gonna end my life tonight.
