I am drowning.I'm begging for help. Pleading. Calling people. Asking. Please. Someone help me. Begging the hotline.

No one will help me.

They all keep going without me. 

There's something wrong with me.

I deserve this.

This sad, lonely, disgusting thing I call a life.

I should just end it. Ssave everyone the trouble.
