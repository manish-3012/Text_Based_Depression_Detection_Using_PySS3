Am I being stupid?So Iâ€™m 14, I ran away from school about a year ago because I wanted to die but tbh I wasnâ€™t that serious about it to actually do it. Iâ€™d say 2 months ago, I ran away again from BBT which is a program that helps you get back into school by building up a schedule and being around a group of people. I called the suicide hotline and they helped me a lot, guided me through how to text my parents about it etc.

And now Iâ€™m just being pushed to go there again, after that and me telling them that I really feel terrible when I go there. Iâ€™m writing this while there right now. Maybe Iâ€™m being dumb but shouldnâ€™t I get help or something? Everyday I feel more and more suicidal and maybe Iâ€™m not making it clear enough to them? Itâ€™s not like no one knows about this, Iâ€™ve been with the GGZ (mental health organization in the Netherlands) for a year.
