Worried for a friend.A friend of mine has been having a hard time recently. Not to get to into it now but i was really worried for him. I let him know that I'm there for him no matter what and he said in passing that it was so bad he wanted to kill himself. After that a repeated the idea that i was there for him. I really don't think it would be good to talk to college or his parents or anything. I was wondering if i am overreacting or if not any tips to try and be supportive without overstepping and making things worse for him. At the moment i think it would be best to offer support whenever i can.
