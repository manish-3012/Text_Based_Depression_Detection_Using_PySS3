Hi, Just lost my friend and I'm losing my homeAll I seem to do is pace back and forth, I just can't stop thinking. One of my closest friends accidentally overdosed last week, at first it was just shock but now the emptiness is just overwhelming. I'm also losing my home to the bank this week, I have so much to do but no energy. Ive been seeing a therapist for about 5 years now but she is leaving which means I will have to speak with a new therapist, everything at once is just to much right now. I am so stressed and anxious that I'm afraid the new therapist will want me back in the hospital, Ive been in the psych ward more than a few times already. Ill see the new therapist in two days and I guess I'm just trying to make it to that appointment. i don't know if I'm allowed to say just how desperate I feel so Ill just leave it at that.
