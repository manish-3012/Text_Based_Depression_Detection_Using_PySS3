Because we talk about suicide, we wonâ€™t do itI hear this a lot from peers, that because we complain a lot online itâ€™s like we want someone to disagree with us, to give us a reason to keep on living, therefore weâ€™re not going to actually do it unlike those who keep it to themselves before ending it.

It feels like a challenge and only drives me more.  A cry for help or a rant never changes the magnitude of the intention.
