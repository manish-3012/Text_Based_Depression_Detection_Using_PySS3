My sister overdosed on medicine last night but is still alive.  She seems okay but I don't know what to do.  I need somebody to talk to, please.My sister has TMJ and some kind of nervous system damage that causes her to be in pain all the time.  We just moved to California to get her nearer to a pain center.  She takes Lyrica and Cymbalta as a part of managing her illness and last night she took the rest of both.  I have no idea how much she had left.

She has tried to commit suicide in the past before.  What do I do?  I think she will be ok and I am keeping close watch on her while she sleeps (making sure she is breathing) but I don't know what to do.
