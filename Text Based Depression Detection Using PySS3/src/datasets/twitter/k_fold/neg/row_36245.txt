All I feel is pain.I just donâ€™t want to live on this planet anymore, it is not like I consented to be alive. My life just is shit, I am doing terrible at Uni, I have zero motivation, I have no irl friends and the friends I do have berate and make fun of me. 

Today I just feel like leaving. I donâ€™t think I can handle another second on this earth, I am sitting in my room thinking of what is the most painless way to go. The only thing left I have to look forward too is the fact that Borat 2 comes out tomorrow... sadly I donâ€™t think I will make it to tomorrow.

Anyways, I hope you all know that if you are struggling and want to escape the pain. I understand how you feel, I do too.
