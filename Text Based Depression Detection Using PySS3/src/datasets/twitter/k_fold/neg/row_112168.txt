I hope i dont wake up tomorrowI once read this analogy about depression being like a burning building. you're stuck at the 20th floor and the only way out is through a window. you've had a massive fear of heights all your life, but at the end of the day, you still jumped down that building anyway. and you jumped not bc you wanted to, or bc you didnt fear the height. but bc out of the two terrors, getting devoured by the fire scared the shit out of u even more. 

Ive been living in that building for years now. and every day feels like im being burnt alive. i thought id at least grow immune to the pain overtime, but the longer i stay here..the more it hurts. 

but soon
one of these days
im finally going to 
make that 



jump.
