Tired of it all. [m/16]I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of it all; the drugs, the "therapy," false hopes, everything.
Parents being separated for 12 years now, still not over my ex, shattered my heart COMPLETELY. Stress from school and everyone.
I can't seem to find happiness or any positive emotion whatsoever, just some crappy horrible sad emotion, and it's the same thing almost everyday. On a good day, I might be alright but at the end of the day I always end up the same.
I've cut way too many times, I've abused alcohol way too much, I started picking up cigarettes.
I've tried committing suicide a couple times already but I usually guilt-trip myself into not doing it, because I always end up thinking about my friends, my family, people who "care."
Right now it just seems like it could be the best option, just put an end to all the misery, cause I'm tired of fighting. I've been battling depression for about four years but it's just eating at me and I don't know what to do.
No one cares anymore, I know they don't. Two therapists gone, all the wrong people I've personally opened up to, all gone. I hate it.
A song that I can really relate to right now is:
Hi-Rez - Lost In Time

I don't know if I need help, but I just need an escape from it all, even if it means ending it all.
