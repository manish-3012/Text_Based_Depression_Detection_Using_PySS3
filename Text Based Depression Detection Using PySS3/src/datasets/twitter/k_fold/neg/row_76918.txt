I'm not depressed. I'm just disappointed with my lack of favorable skills, traits or talents.I'm still a little young (age 19), but it's only now that I've truly realized that everyone is selfish and no one is good. Also, I don't have any particular special traits about me that I feel make me worth someone else's time. I've often thought about how pointless I feel in a world where everyone is smarter, better-looking, and socially more successful. I feel like a leaf being blown around in the wind.

I don't know what I truly want out of life, I don't feel connected with anybody, and I feel I could leave this world without much of a huzzah. I'm not saying this as a dopey way of expressing sadness or depression. I'm simply stating what I feel is fact. I feel I literally don't possess any redeemable talent, skill or trait that would contribute to anything interesting.

I see people leading others, creating art, and doing academic research. I thought I also had the abilities to do these things, but in school I'm constantly being reminded that I'm just not skilled or intelligent enough to pursue anything worthwhile. Why bother when there are so many others pursuing the exact same thing, only better?

My life and death mean nothing.
