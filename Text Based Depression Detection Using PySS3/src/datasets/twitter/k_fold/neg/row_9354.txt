Probably gonna kill my self within the next week or soTitle says it all. I just feel very meh about life and I donâ€™t really care what happens anymore. I was molested at a young age giving me pretty bad anxiety and PTSD issues. These are issues Iâ€™ll have to deal with for the rest of my life. Sure maybe itâ€™ll get easier but the issue remains that itâ€™s there and I donâ€™t want to deal with it so why bother. Iâ€™m bored with everything, nothing really gives me joy anymore. Iâ€™m not even really living Iâ€™m just existing. I feel like Iâ€™ve always known it would end like this. For a long time life has been a drastic swing from â€œIâ€™m feeling greatâ€ to â€œI want to kill myselfâ€ and yeah Iâ€™m ready to get off the rollar coaster of mood swings. Honestly the only reason Iâ€™m waiting so long is so I can plant my wallet in a friends car so that I can do something nice for them before I go. I know I have people who care for me and I care for them too but what good is having people who enjoy you if you canâ€™t even enjoy yourself ya know?
