I think it's timeI was suicidal two years ago. I did not see an end to my troubles, and I wrote a note. 

I thought I was ready, but then I wasn't. 

I think about how easy it would be. To end the numbness. 

Because even though I am here, I feel dead. 

I feel empty. 

And from the trend, it seems that it is *always* going to feel this way.

So why am I prolonging the inevitable?

People die anyway. I will die anyway. What's wrong with a catalyst to a reaction?
