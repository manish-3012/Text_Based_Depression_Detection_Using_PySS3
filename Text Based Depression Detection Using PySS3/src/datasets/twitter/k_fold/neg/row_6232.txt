politically suicidalhi. i've posted here many times before because i become suicidal over many things (relationships, a doomed world, self hatred, body image, sadness, hopelessness) but recently i've 
become more and more suicidal whenever i see conservative rhetoric or right wing ideals anywhere online. i dont know why its just as soon as i see something against what i believe i get super mad and frustrated but then all that energy goes back at myself and i just want to kill myself so i dont have to exist anymore at the same time as homophobic people or racists or transphobes or fascists or trump supporters or anything like that. its like i just want to kill myself so bad when i see anything like this and i dont know why
