Is there any way you can request to talk to a female on the suicide hotline?I know that this might seem like a weird request, but I just feel way more comfortable talking to women than men about my mental health. At first I tried extremely hard to deny it, but eventually I just realized that I was lying to myself by doing so. It might be because, while many women are terrible to discuss mental health with and many men are quite good at it, in general for me the women have been better. But it really is just a subconscious thing at this point and regardless of why, itâ€™s become important to me. So do you know if thereâ€™s any way of asking for a female when calling the hotline? Iâ€™m too shy to call them and ask myself lol
