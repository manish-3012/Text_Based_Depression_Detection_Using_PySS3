Just need some advicePosted this on r/help but was directed here

Keeping it short and simple.

My (20M) boyfriends (18M) dad (45M) died recently and my bf is less interested in his college classes and I came back and he was sleeping. 

His arm was covered in cuts and his dadâ€™s knife was on the bed.

Iâ€™ve talked to him about counseling a couple times, but I donâ€™t want to force him to do anything because if he doesnâ€™t want the help then itâ€™s not going to work.

But how can I help him? Iâ€™m worried he might do something drastic.

**more related-ish info**
I see him every single day.. we live in the dorms in the same dorm room (not my dorm room but I just slipped in and everyone doesnâ€™t care) so itâ€™s impossible not to.

I grabbed the knife and slipped it in my pocket. I might put it in my dorm room but I donâ€™t want to treat him like a child or like I donâ€™t trust him, but it is something he uses to cut
