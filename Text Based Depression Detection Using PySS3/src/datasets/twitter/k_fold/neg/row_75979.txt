I feel better but I need your help Well, I didn't really know whether to do it or not, but some people on this Reddit encouraged me to do so. I was ashamed and afraid to ask for help, but with all my heart, I come to ask for it. I want to start a small cake-making business so I can get through this quarantine. I have no one to support me in my personal life, I am really alone. Therefore, if any of you want to support my endeavor to get ahead, I kindly leave my paypal so that you can help me. Thank you very much to everyone who read me yesterday and those who read me now. I want it, they are the best.
