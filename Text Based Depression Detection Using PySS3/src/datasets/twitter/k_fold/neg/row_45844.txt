I think my wife just tried to kill herself, please help.I will start by saying that this is my wife's reddit account, the only reason I'm posting on it is because she had it open in this subreddit on her phone when every occurred. I suspect she tried to kill herself tonight by overdosing on Tylenol with wine. I don't know how much she took, but I found her with her head in the toilet, vomit pouring out of her while she choked and coughed, barely conscious. She has been sick for two weeks and taking this medication daily and I have no recollection of how much she had left before tonight (I found the empty bottle on the counter near the sink). The wine is odd, she doesn't drink it very much but we did have a huge fight that lasted for days, but that sadly happens a lot between us. When I found her I first thought her oesophagus might be torn and spasming from how badly her coughing has been for two weeks, but after I got her to the couch (where she almost immediately passed out) I picked up her phone off the floor and found her on this page, wine bottle in the trash and glass in the sink. No posts that I can see. She is/has "passive suicidal ideation" and talks a lot about how she wishes she could just not be around, which I hate but understand how badly mental illness hurts her and causes her to feel pain. I saw no signs of an immediate attempt being possible and I honestly am not sure if this even was an attempt or a line of bad circumstances leading to something that just looks off. If she denies it, I can't really prove it. But if she did try to do it then I can't really make her seek help, can I? We live in Canada if that matters, and I just want to know what I should do with all of this. She is still asleep and snoring loudly, I'm keeping a close eye on her to make sure she doesn't struggle to breath or choke on any possible vomit.
