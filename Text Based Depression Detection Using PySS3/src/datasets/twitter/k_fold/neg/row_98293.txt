I donâ€™t know if I have any value anymoreI have always been a problem for everyone, I donâ€™t see a point in continuing anymore, others always get annoyed by me, if I ask something they say my question is wrong, if I say something, they say I should not say anything. They say I am a perfectionist, may be I have OCD or something. No matter what I do, I am never enough. I feel like Iâ€™ve created so much issue for others just by talking, so Iâ€™ve stopped saying anything about what I want, I will just listen to them, and be a slave, may be thatâ€™s what I am worth, or may be I donâ€™t deserve to live anymore, I wrote my last note for them, and left it on the table, then going to sleep, I hope I wonâ€™t wake up tomorrow, to end this suffering for others.
