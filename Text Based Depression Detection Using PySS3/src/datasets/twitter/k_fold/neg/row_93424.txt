Feeling suicidal, scared to tell anyone irl. Scared of not completing it.I am under a mental health team, but I don't want to tell them because they will tell me to try harder, or to just do this or that. And in fact, "this" or "that" feels too much for me. 

I"ve been slipping in my mood since september, and i told my team but they dismissed it too so i see no point in telling them. 

I dont want to go to A&amp;E or anything either because i dont want that "attention" and often the people in A&amp;E are useless and make me feel worse by saying things like "why aren't you dead yet?" etc

I don't want to tell my partner because i dont want them to worry, and therefore call my team for them to call me and say the same old "try harder, you've been through this before" spiel. 

I scouted them out options for where to do it last night, there is cctv where i live though so I have to wait until 9pm when it stops being monitored in real time. 

I am also scared though, of not doing it. I am scared of not having the guts at the time of doing it to just do it. I don't want to be found or seen and have all that hoo-ha of people getting involved. 

I'm not really asking a question. I Just needed somewhere to rant this out, and get things in my head straight about my plans etc.
