Think I'm going to crack up if I don't talk right nowOne good thing I've learned from this is self awareness; I do recognise things can get a lot worse if I don't get some things out my system. No one seems to want to know. GOD FUCKING DAMN why is this world so judgemental. Apparently being suicidal is selfish. And I need to get help. Ok, so I try and get in contact with my mental health team (can't directly contact psychiatrist). They haven't called me back; they discharged me a couple of months ago. They don't want to know. What do I fucking do? I am serious about this. Why does no one believe me? I don't want to freak anyone out, but since this is anonymous, I am planning my suicide, very seriously, not some impulsive overdose. I won't go into methods here but I've spent a long time researching. And I'm trying to hold on a few months for the sake of one person. And it fucking kills me what I'm going to do to her and everyone else close to me. But what the fuck am I supposed to do?

This is the fucking reality of many suicides. They may try and get help, get dumped and then commit suicide, then get calledfucking selfish.
