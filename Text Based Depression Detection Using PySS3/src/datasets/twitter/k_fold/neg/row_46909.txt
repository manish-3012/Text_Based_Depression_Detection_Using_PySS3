First day of college and I already want to die.I can't talk to people. I just feel like I don't make the typical connections that people seek out and I get overlooked as a human because of this. I take things too seriously and as such feel way too much. 

This class was fine save for the group discussions that took up 50% of our time. I tried to participate and though it seemed fine, I couldn't shake this feeling that I didn't belong here. I can't debate and get my thoughts across because my anxiety makes me go blank whenever I have to present anything to anyone. I stumbled my words and made myself look like an idiot. 

I can't live like this. I isolated myself from my friends because I can't feel like they care about me. I honestly feel like no one knows who I am or even cares who I am. I want to die and stop hurting. I realize that this is a 'permanent solution for a temporary problem' but I've gone to fucking therapy, I've taken the drugs, I've forced myself to do things I wasn't comfortable with and I just can't. I get too overwhelmed and I can't fucking do this anymore. What can I even do to help myself?
