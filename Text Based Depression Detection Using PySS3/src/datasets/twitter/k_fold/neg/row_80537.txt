Ending my life.I am 27 years old and I am a failiure. I am 5.5, overweight, stupid (Iq of 95 on tests) and unable to hold down a steady career or job.

My life was great at one point. I met a girl, Samantha, who I fell in love with. Every day was so sweet. We didn't have much but we enjoyed ouselfves. Samantha was, and still is, the person who I turn to for help when my depression comes back.

But yesterday Samantha left me. She told me that I was too "Needy" and that she needed a "Real man". The only person I have ever loved has forsaken me. My mum doesn't love me. She cheated on my father and divorce raped him. My dad doesn't even have my number any more, the abusive cunt.

And so I have nothing. our house legally belongs to her, and I have no job, friends or property. My rent money will last until Wednesday next week, not including food.

Rtaher than endure the humiliation of the streets I have decided to end it. This subreditt says "Lets talk". Talk about what? How my sorry ass is gonna end up on a street curve. I don't think so.

As I write this I am taking the pills and drink. I just want some love and affection as I die. Please, do not dissuade me, as the act is already done. I just want some attention and human apathy as I die. Thank you.

Please do not become like me.
