The NooseI'm not sure why but I've had a very romantic obsession with the noose lately. I've seen myself, as I drive through the night, hanging there from a street light. Strung up the like a horror movie. It's not frightening. I feel more of a longing to be that corpse. Even now as I lay here ready for my bed, I think about the weak rope that I hid under the bed after my girlfriend asked me to throw it away. I felt it around my neck when I first thought about it and it didn't feel constricting. It felt like a massage around my neck. Like something negative was being released. I think might end up tieing that noose pretty soon.
