I'm so emptySo I'm sitting here outside my University in my car. I've felt absolutely nothing but the deepest depression for what feels like months now and I think I'm finally gonna put it to an end. I just tried to cut myself but I'm do goddamn useless that I just ended up breaking skin without any of the rush. I don't even see the point in living anymore I just keep getting up because I know if I don't then all my life was for nothing and I know that if I don't I'm gonna set myself back years.

This isn't the first time I've posted here, I did so a few years back too. I didn't even end up getting help because I'm so terrified of telling my parents because I hate confrontation. 

I'm pretty sure I have bipolar because a few months back I had the most amazing day where I felt on top of the world, but then the next day I didn't even get out of bed because I felt so done with everything. 

I even exercise 3 or 4 times a week but it doesn't help. It takes my mind off it when I'm there, but then I get home and want to kill myself all over again. 

I know this isn't all cohesive and it's all random rambles but I'm falling apart and I don't see any reason why this should be different.

I can't even cry anymore, I've been trying to force myself but I just end up screwing my face up and burying my head in the steering wheel. 

Nobody even cares about me anymore, I hung out with my friends today and I think they could tell something was up because I didn't even say a word and just sat in a corner staring at my computer without saying anything. They didn't check on me though, they're probably tired of my shit and I don't blame them. 

I'm supposed to be at home rn but I can't muster up the strength to drag myself back there, I just want to sit here all night and stare out the window, watch the cars go by until I have the strength to end it. 

I'm probably gonna get up and do the same thing tomorrow because there's a career fair on that I need to attend. Which is funny because I don't see myself making it past Monday. 

I don't know why I'm posting this, I guess I just want someone to talk to, because I don't want to be a burden to anyone I know, I'm not worth that.

I'm sorry.

EDIT: still cutting but idk I don't even feel any rush, it's nice to feel something other than nothing for once tho, even if it is just pain
