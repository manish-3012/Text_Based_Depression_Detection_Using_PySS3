Today I made progressTowards my suicide. I tied my rope into a noose...it was surprisingly easy. There is an abandoned bridge thing near me that I'm gonna tie it to and jump off. Apparently a drop of 5-9 ft is what's needed to sever the spinal cord at C2. It's an ideal and quick way to go...I don't want to suffocate like these other hangers, I wanna do it right, namsayin'. Thoughts?
