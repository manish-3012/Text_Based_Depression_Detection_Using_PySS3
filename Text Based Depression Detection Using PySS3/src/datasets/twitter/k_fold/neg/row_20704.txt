I'm going to be alone foreverall I ever do is make everyone's lives worse. I drag everyone down with my problems. nobody would care if I died. I have no social life, no friends, nothing I enjoy doing. I'm wasting my life. I can't talk to people because I get too anxious and freak them out. I'm never going to move on from my past relationship because I know that nobody is ever going to love me like he used to. nobody is going to care. he told me that he's doing great without me and that he's moved on. I still cry myself to sleep every night wishing that I didn't fuck everything up. I truly believe that I would be better off dead. I'm sure everyone else thinks so too
