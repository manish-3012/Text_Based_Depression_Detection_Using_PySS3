i tried to kill myself &amp; i survived [rant]it's been about 8 years since... and i still think about the 'what if'

'cuz it really wasn't some half hearted attempt. i meant to kill myself it just didn't work.. anyway... if i had died then, i think i'd have regretted it because i was so damn depressed. so my last time on earth would have been this really gloomy ordeal

BUT, if i had died maybe a year before then... i'd be really happy. like, if i had died at 17. i was really happy at that time, and it seems like everything since then has been me trying to get back to that level of happiness


so here i am. someone broke into my house recently... i had guns around they could have easily killed me; global warming is on it's way (hello miami); we'll probably have a war soon.... people hate me because of my race so if i travelling is iffy... all in alll, life will do it's best to kill me anyway so why should i bother haha

but, i'm glad i'm alive now. i don't wanna die anymore. nowadays i wish everyone else was dead (kidding) or on another planet or something. point being the problem isn't really *us* as much as it is how *they* make us feel

if anyone reads this rant i'll be surprised. hope it helps someone though
