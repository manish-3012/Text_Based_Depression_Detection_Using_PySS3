What's the point in living if love is just chemicals, humans are just biological machines, and there is no life after death?Might as well just kill myself right now. Love isn't real. Nothing fucking is. It's all just chemicals and neurons. Those fucking piece of shit scientists and their singular way of thinking, all built up on their Darwin bible and filtered through their own arrogant confirmation bias. Think they have it all figured and and tied into a neat little package with a pretty little bow. 

If I'm just a fucking biological machine with no free will, who the hell has the right to say I cannot take my life?
