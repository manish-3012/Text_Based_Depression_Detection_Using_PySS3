numbfellow readers,
i feel like i am already dead inside. i stopped living when i was about 20, almost 10 years ago. i am deeply depressed, i do have to take 2 grams of valproic acid every day to prevent myself from seizures. i feel like a zombie, a weak and aimless person. i dont know what it is like to feel the basic trust as given by a mother for example, i dont have any trust in whatever i do. the world scares me. when i see pictures of beautiful beaches i feel pain from the pressure my ego gives me for not even trying to get there. if a friend has success in his job or has a great time as a student i feel jealous and ashamed for that. i could do it. all those "coulds" ... 
it seems to be all about having adventures, a good time and making experiences. the truth is i can hardly remember anything, i think i can blame this mostly on my medication. thats an other reason why i stopped seeing my friends, its so awkward when they talk about good old times and you stand aside thinking "i was involved in that?"
my slow brain and my lack of commemoration really decreases my living quality. this progress is going on for years now but i think i run out of fuel.
what really scares me is that the thoughts about suicide are becoming more and more comfortable, they are not dramatic anymore but appear to be the next logic step in this. 

thanks for reading
