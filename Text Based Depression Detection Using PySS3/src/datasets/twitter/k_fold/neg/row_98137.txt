Lied to my doctor today about how I'm feelingI told her I wasn't really feeling suicidal anymore but I am. 

I was supposed to go on a first date with a girl I've been talking to since December on Saturday and she blocked me on facebook and on the dating site we met on. I don't know why. 

I know I shouldn't be so upset because we've never met but I thought we had a genuine connection. So tired of people hurting me. I deserve to be happy. I'm not a bad person. I don't understand why this keeps happening to me. 

I'm sat in bed crying my fucking eyes out. My friends are useless, none of them are helping me. My family don't give a shit. I'm so fucking sick of feeling like a loser every single day.
