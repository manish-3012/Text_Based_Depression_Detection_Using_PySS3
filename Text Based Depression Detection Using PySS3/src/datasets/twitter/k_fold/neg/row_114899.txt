I want to dieSeriously - in this life I *need* just one thing: absolute justice. Like "karma". So that when anyone's doing something bad - you can be sure that it'll bring him more harm than good eventually.

In reality, I don't see it. I see the "just-world fallacy", which states that if I'm going to believe in something like this - then I'm a fool. Our world is not fair.

God, how much I want to die...this is my, like, #1 thing on my wish list by now. To just disappear from this world. To not see it *ever* again...
