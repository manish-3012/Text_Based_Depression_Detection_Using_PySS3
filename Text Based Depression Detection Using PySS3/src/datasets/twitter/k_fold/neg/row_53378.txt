Am I depressed?I'll try to be as transparent as possible without revealing too much. I am a high school senior, about to graduate in \~3 months. It feels like my life has been defined by the pressure to get good grades; and while I have done decently well in that regard, it has come at the expense at my social life and a lot of other things I value. I used to love the sport I played; now it feels like a burden to even show up to practice. I feel the same way about the other extracurricular activities I'm involved in. I've been rejected to several colleges/programs already, some of which I thought I had a decent shot at getting into. Occasionally, I have what I think are real suicidal impulses, but I know that I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it. The closer and closer I get to graduation, the lower my work ethic stoops, and the worse I feel about the utterly pathetic excuse of a human being that I now am. The reason why I'm confused is because occasionally, I have moments where I enjoy myself. Where I enjoy life. It feels like I'm bobbling on a line between despair and hope and I'm not sure whether that makes me truly depressed/suicidal.
