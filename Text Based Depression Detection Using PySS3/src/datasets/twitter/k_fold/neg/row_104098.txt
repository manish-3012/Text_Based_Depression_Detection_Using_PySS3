Financial Problem. The only way out I could think of is killing myself.I'm 27 M, and live alone. I lost my job 3 months ago, and I haven't paid my rent for 3 months.


The landlord is kind enough to let me stay for 2 more months without pay, I gave an alibi that the company I'm working on haven't paid out our salaries yet. Now it's the third month, and he is growing suspicious.


I earn minimum wage, so my savings are not that big to be honest. For 2 months I've been living on bread and sardines, one meal a day, and now my savings are almost depleted.


I wanted to loan, but I have no bank account, so there's really nothing I can do about it. I don't know where to get the money to pay for my rent. It's probably a small amount for others, but 3 months rent is too big for me to cough up at once and just thinking about it makes me depressed, especially since the landlord is expecting it soon.


The only solution I could think of? Flee, be a hobo and live on the streets. That was originally my plan and I was considering it. But then I realized that when I die somewhere, no one would realize it anyway. I know its the cowards way out, but I have been thinking about it and it seems to be the more appealing choice at the moment. No more of this suffering. No financial problem to think of. No more thinking what to eat.

I like taking a nap a lot. And when you think about it, if you find a way to do a painless death, it will just be like you took a nap, only that you never wake up again. You don't have to wake up from these problems ever again.
