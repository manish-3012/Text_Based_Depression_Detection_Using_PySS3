Just talking..I dont really know where to start or how I even got to this place but I feel like talking will eleviate some of whats going on. So about six months ago I moved back home I started a new job and everything was looking great. About 3 months into my job I had saved up and started gambling I did something miraculous and won 9,500 dollars off 50 dollars. I had this great job more money than I could Imagine and things seemed like they were finally going to work for me. Well after I won things seemed to just get worse. The money I had won sat there and I was still stuck in my head.. You see nothing seemed to make me happy. I could buy anything smoke as much weed as possible and virtually do anything I wanted, but nothing seemed to do it for me. I used to be a joyful person whod get off by the little things. Even a video game would bring me more joy than I could imagine. Once I could do anything it almost seemed like nothing had galore. So I started to over compensate for my unhappyness by spending large amounts on random things that I rememberd used to make me happy. Still nothing. I even tried to find a girlfriend.. Which seemed to make more unhappy. I am simply writing this bc I have come to realization that life is what you make it.. Wether you have 100 bucks or 10,000 a gf that loves you or youre alone a closet full of everything you could imagine or one that is empty. Your mind has a funny way of working you think the grass is greener on the other side and youre so lost in that fantasy that you forget how greatful you can be about your current situation. I am suicidal in a long term sence but as of right now I will continue to smoke my cigerettes and take the most noble route of suicide. Thank you.
