the last days on earthiâ€™ve decided that on November 10th, 2020, i will put an end to my life. but before then, iâ€™ve decided to make the most of it. as hard as it is to get out bed iâ€™m going to try and force myself to do something interesting and that i wouldnâ€™t typically do before i die. and i decided to write about it everyday before i go. i have no friends so iâ€™m just going to tell reddit about my days before i go.

this isnâ€™t a cry for help so please do not tell me to not do it; i just want an outlet to speak â˜ºï¸
