Not sure what to do.I've reaches that point where I'm 24, have already dealt with the horrific breakdown of my life 1 1/2 years ago, and I've come to the conclusion that I do not want myself to live. I don't feel as if I should be alive. Every inch of my body is telling me I should kill myself. Suicide hotlines are telling me to read some Christian book (I'm an Athiest) to fix my life, and I don't know what to do. Please help
