I hate the way I feel...I feel like there's a weight on me and I can't breathe properly. Suicide is always on my mind. I always feel on the brink of crisis mode, always needing to talk to someone. How annoying is that for my friends? My two total friends. I never feel okay. No one is this needy. I've been hospitalized twice in the past year. I feel like someone who would need hospitalization once a freaking month. It's pathetic. No one is this needy.
