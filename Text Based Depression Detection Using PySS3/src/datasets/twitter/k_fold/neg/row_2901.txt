2 Siblings, Both Attempted Suicide (1 Today)Iâ€™ve had a rough couple of years behind me, Iâ€™m 18 now, a freshman in college and I have a younger and older sibling, each with a two year difference. My older sibling struggled heavily with drug abuse throughout high school, including Xanax, Oxy, and possibly Heroin (just the ones I know about). He became a shell of his former self before my eyes in the course of two years, eventually leading to multiple suicide attempts, the last of which I had to call the hotline on his behalf for which just wound up in him staying in a hospital for a week and becoming some weird, immature dude thatâ€™s certainly trying more in life but is now drinking and smoking weed again which concerns me. My younger sibling just tried to take their life today (or at least I think so). They took 9 total over the counter pills and they only weigh 130ish so Iâ€™m assuming the intent was there but I really havenâ€™t talked to them ab it yet, and I honestly donâ€™t know when I will. I thought ab my older sibling taking their life a lot back then, they j seemed so mentally deteriorated and I just didnâ€™t know what to do except encourage him (Iâ€™ve never been an emotional person). Inversely, my younger sibling hit me out of nowhere, I had no idea something like that had even crossed their mind. Depression maybe, but not a full blown suicide attempt. Both of them see therapists and I used to too before I left for college, but generally speaking, all three of us are pretty fucking sad people. My dad also has depression and sees a therapist, and my mom struggles with depression too. The weird thing is that I really donâ€™t think that my family is that different from the outside, weâ€™re a white middle-class family who went to nice schools and we all have friends and play sports but something just went haywire along the way and life just hasnâ€™t been the same since. I donâ€™t feel anything nowadays, like I didnâ€™t even cry when my sibling went to the ER today. Itâ€™s almost like my brain is thinking this is run of the mill shit, I just wish there was some inkling of emotion or compassion I could give but everything happening in my life has j made me a shell of myself too. I just wish that things were different like how they used to be. Not everyone in my family was always severely depressed. I feel like Iâ€™ve just become a mental prisoner to the people Iâ€™ve known my whole life. I know Iâ€™m depressed but I like to think Iâ€™m not suicidal, I think committing suicide after all my siblings have done is selfish and almost cowardly in a way, I want to be different but at the same time I canâ€™t keep falling down this mental hellhole of a life. Like my favorite artist on Spotify Wrapped was Alice In Chains just to give you an idea of where my head has been this last year even before today. Iâ€™m probably gonna go back to therapy but it just seems like my even if I do that, nothing will really ever change. It just feels like something life altering happens in my family and then I get over it and repeat, Iâ€™ve just lost all emotion and Iâ€™m always tired or angry. I donâ€™t really know what I need advice on tbh, I just felt the need to type this out in hopes of somebody being able to relate, bc I feel like no one ik can ever relate to this shit (ik everyoneâ€™s going through something blah blah blah). Some sort of advice even if you canâ€™t relate would be appreciated if you could tho. Thanks for reading if youâ€™ve made it this far, I appreciate you listening to my pity party.
