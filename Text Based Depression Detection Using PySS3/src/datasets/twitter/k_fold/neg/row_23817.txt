Iâ€™m sad and I want attention.Yeah, donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this other than for attention but Iâ€™m currently hiding in the toilets at school skipping my English lesson until I can go home in 2 hours. But I donâ€™t want to go home. I donâ€™t feel happy anywhere. There is no where to go. I want to kill my self on the way back. Iâ€™m looking for sharp objects in this toilet stall but thereâ€™s none obviously. I want to find a building to jump out of. I want to die so fuckimg badly but Iâ€™m scared of failing and I absolutely canâ€™t go to hospital. Iâ€™ll refuse and then Iâ€™ll get sectioned again. Iâ€™m so scared of going to hospital. I canâ€™t do any of this. I just want to be ok. I canâ€™t do this
