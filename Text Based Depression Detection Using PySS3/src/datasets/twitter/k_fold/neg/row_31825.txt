Should I involve one other person to help me commit suicide? Information wise. Okay, so I already decided to commit suicide; the pain is unbearable and cannot be fixed. However, the problem is that I lack the necessary and valid materials to actually commit it. I want to do it fast and as painless as possible, so I wanted to typically do it with a firearm or being exposed to Carbon Monoxide poisoning. Both seem relatively painless and easy, but I don't have a firearm, my own car, etc. So, should I consult someone's help of where or from whom I can obtain the necessary materials I need to do this? I have no friends or other family, so I can  probably just ask some random person from my school, but they won't obtain any knowledge of what I plan to do; That person can just point me to the right direction and I'll do the rest. Is this right, or can they still be charged with assisted suicide even though they had no prior knowledge of me doing so?
