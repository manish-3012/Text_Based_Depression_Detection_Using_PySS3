My friend from high school committed suicide.My old friend from High School recently killed himself. He wasn't like a best friend or anything but we were still friends. I'm shocked he was pushed over the edge, and his funeral is tomorrow, and I feel like I'll break when I see him. What can I do to lighten up?

Also, I'm an atheist so I don't really believe in a heaven.
