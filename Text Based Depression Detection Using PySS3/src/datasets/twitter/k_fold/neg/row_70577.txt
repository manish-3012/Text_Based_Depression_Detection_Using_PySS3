The next tomorrow will be different, but never today.â€œWell you have to keep moving forwardsâ€. Is what I get told when the last job application went nowhere. 

When I donâ€™t get hired, when no one offers a fucking finger to help â€œwell kid you just gotta pull yourself up by your bootstrapsâ€ .
 Well I told my family that sitting day after day in college learning nothing but how to acrew debt has depressed me considerably.
 But now that moma and brother are dead, well I should just surge forth and get that job now. 

Oh wait Iâ€™m just more depressed, weird.

Those completely original words of wisdom did not completely turn around the flaming train wreck that is my existence.

In fact Iâ€™m so depressed Iâ€™m going to blow my brains out, but first I thought Iâ€™d warn my family, give them a chance before I go to let me know about just how bad I fucked up. You know before you go you should really give your family a chance to confirm that they indeed do not want you.

 It wonâ€™t make you more depressed or nothing, it feels great to be unwanted. Theyâ€™d be a hell of a lot happier if youâ€™d just stop whining about how you canâ€™t stop vomiting due to anxiety or some other fake problem.  So if they donâ€™t want me, and I certainly donâ€™t want to exist for another moment, why am I here.

Wait, or I could just go get a car/learn the lovely public transportation system of American suburbs, get a job (oh wait youâ€™ll need an â€œeducationâ€ for that, and by education we mean knowing the boss personallyâ€). And then you can get hired only to be fired next month because you didnâ€™t pre-lube for the boss.

Iâ€™m just rambling at this point. Iâ€™ve gone utterly fucking mad, subjecting the only people who will even listen to this pointless nonsense.

So guys how do I completely build a life by tomorrow before my family decides they need to â€œstep inâ€ and kick me out of this house too.

Hopefully the spacing/ formatting isn't fucked this time, hopefully this is the last time I post here.

Peace, ya'all.
