I broke my own heart and cannot live with this pain anymore.I did something horrendous to push my loving boyfriend away - I hit him.  Context does not matter.  I am a monster and no longer want to live on this earth after what I have done.  I lost not only him but the person I thought I was.  I am horrible and cannot stop hating myself.
