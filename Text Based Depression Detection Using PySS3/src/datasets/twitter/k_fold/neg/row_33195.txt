I've done everything. Why keep going?
Hello reddit. 
I need some help. I feel a bit lost, and i thought Maybe you could help me, like you've done before. You never helped me for this kind of thing, but i thought i'd give it a try. 

I'm 27, soon turning 28 and i feel like i have absolutly nothing to live for. I feel like the good days are over, and right now i only keep going to not let my mom down. I'm not interested in getting a family. I'm not interested in getting any stuff or traveling anywhere. I have loads of great friends and i've had loads of great girlfriends and emotional interactions. I feel like i've had everything and it's only gonna go downhill from here. My body is giving up. The parties are getting more boring. The girls are just a part of many.
I might be hated for this, but i was spoiled as a child. I come from a good home that could give me whatever i wanted. Ive seen everything and done everything. There's no rush in anything anymore. Sure i could try to acomplish something, but it would always be for someone else. I have nothing left to do. I succeded in my career and in my emotional life already. It cant be better. It Feels like i maxed out the game of life and there wont be any new patches. There's nothing more to d, see or feel. I've done it all and from now on it Will only get worse. 
Seariously, Why should i live on? Sure you can tell me that the opposite is worse, but it is though? Atleast then i wont have to feel bad about having nothing to live for. 

Is there any rational reason for me to keep going? I'm not happy like this. I just feel empty. Sorry for the rant, I'm just a bit desperate and i dont know where else to turn.
