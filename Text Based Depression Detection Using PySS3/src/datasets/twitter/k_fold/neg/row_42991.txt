Sensorimotor OCD will be the death of me.For years, I've thought about killing myself, but I think I've finally found something that's given me a drive to go about doing it.

From the fall of last year to early August of this year, I smoked cannabis multiple times a week, sometimes as much as twice a day. I did everything wrong, didn't ask my dealer where my strains were coming from like an absolute idiot, and ended up having several greenout episodes that coincided with panic attacks.

As somebody who has faced a lifelong struggle with severe anxiety, this pushed me over a limit that seriously fucked with my head. Since that night in early August, I have obsessed over my breathing to the point where I'm nearly always aware of it when I'm awake. It's made my life a living hell, and while I thought it was getting better through the help of multiple SSRIs and exposure therapy, the past week has made me convinced that this is only going to get worse.

I haven't slept in three days straight. I didn't have anything to live for well before all of this happened, but if this is what I'm going to have to deal with for the rest of my foreseeable life... the endless hyperventilation, the daily dissociations, then I know that I need to end my life sooner than later. I can't take this anymore.
