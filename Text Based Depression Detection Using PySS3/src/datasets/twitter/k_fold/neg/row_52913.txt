Do I have anything to live for? I dont knowIts really hard to carry on. Im 13 and have anxiety and depression and im scared of everything. I cant leave the house. Speak to anyone without having an anxiety attack. School is just a spiral of thoughts leading me into darkness. People say they care, but do they really, or do they make them selves just not feel so bad by pretending to sympathise. 

Is it just me but when people say "i care" or "please dont do it" it makes me feel worse because i feel like they have no clue how i feel and dont know what its like. And when i try to speak to people and seek help, tell them my problems, im met with that phrase which most people like me  see "such a cry for help."

And really, yes it is a cry for help. Of course it is. Why else would i muster enough bravery to speak out. Instead you crush what little confidence by telling the   everyone i know "look he cuts himself, and hes depressed by the way, and hes FAKE."

When im told that itll get better, i cant believe it. My life gets worse every day. My family HATES me and has told me before that "the biggest mistake as a parent was having you as a child." They hurt me and threaten me. Physically and emotionally. 

Theres only really two things keeping me going. One is that i just get drown my sorrows in gin, and the others that, after it all, i have a hope in my mind that my family or fake "friends" will be sad if im gone.
