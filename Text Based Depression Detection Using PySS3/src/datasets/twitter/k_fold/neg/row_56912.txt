Fuck my lifeI'm literally crying right now, I'm never gonna get a girlfriend, all they care about are looks and shit like that, it's really fucking with my head, I'm constantly getting rejected and I can't take the pain anymore, I know I'm gonna end up killing myself soon, I don't know why God made me such an ugly worthless pathetic piece of shit, all I want is a girl that I can buy flowers and take out and all that jazz, but I can't seem to catch a break, I've literally been rejected over 100 times, yes I kept count, this will probably be the last thing I post, I'm tired of complaining about stuff nobody will even see
