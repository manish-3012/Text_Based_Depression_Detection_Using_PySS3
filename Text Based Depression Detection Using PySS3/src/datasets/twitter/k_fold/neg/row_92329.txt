I'm tired of thisI am so lonely. It's impossible for me to make a connection with anybody. I can't even blame other people because others have tried to talk to me but after a few days I just block their number. Being around other people makes me so fucking nervous but I hate being alone. I hold people to ridiculously high standards and of course everybody lets me down.


I am a spoilt piece of shit, I am disgusting, I am rude, I am stupid. I have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I spend all of my time daydreaming about having a social circle or having a boyfriend but this just upsets me further because it's never going to fucking happen. I am so lonely, I cry all the time, I don't know how to feel better.


I just want to be normal, I want to be happy, I'm so tired of being like this. Nobody cares about me and why should they? I am not worthy of life, I am so done with trying to sustain this miserable existence. I am done. Nobody cares, I am so unimportant and insignificant. I really fucking hate everything about myself, I can't see a way out of this apart from just fucking ending it all. I'm sorry for posting here, I just don't know what to do, I am so lonely.
