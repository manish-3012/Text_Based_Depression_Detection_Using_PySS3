leaving the world after i graduate collegehi all. my life is over as of recently. due to privacy violations as volunteering at a hospital and requesting a letter of reference my supervisor is submitting a damaging letter of reference for mef school. it can never be removed from my undergrad institution leaving a mark forever. i always wanted to be a doctor- any other career choice that involves professional school is now over (dentist, pharmacy school, law school, nursing school). So that's it. 
Next thursday I'm graduating. Next Saturday 5-19-18, i want to leave this earth. I've been praying for years to have a terminal illness but my prayers haven't worked. What are quick ways to get the job done?
