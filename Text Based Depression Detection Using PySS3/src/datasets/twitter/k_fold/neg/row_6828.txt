Please helpIâ€™m just rambling

Please help. The world is going to shit. I walk through the halls of my school and the people can laugh and complain about their stupid petty problems. They donâ€™t understand the dangers around them. They donâ€™t get that nothing matters. Weâ€™re all going to die in a few years any way. They donâ€™t get it. They act like idiots for â€œpopularityâ€. It pisses me off how people can be so care free. So stupid and ignorant. I want to believe there are good people but people around me squash that idea into dust. There are people that I like but they donâ€™t get it either. My best friend is an idiot. He doesnâ€™t understand. I know that sounds horrible to say. Iâ€™m not a good person either. I try to be. I want to be. But I have thoughts of doing horrible things to people. Iâ€™m plagued by the thought of having total sexual control of someone. I canâ€™t get them out. Sometimes I just want to destroy and kill. But I canâ€™t. I wonâ€™t. I hate that I can give others advice and give them hope but that advice is meaningless to me. I donâ€™t follow it. I say I have reasons to live but I donâ€™t. I would be fine dying, disappearing. A while back I tried to talk someone down. I told them how their method was slow and painful and they thanked me. Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m paranoid. I want to cry but I cant. I hate the idiotic feminist ideals. Fucking man-spreading bullshit. I hate it. It pisses me off to no end to see people complain about petty problems in front of them when they canâ€™t turn around and see the looming problem about to kill them. I want to help. I want to do something meaningful. But when you have your spirit, your hope, your happiness crushed by people it hurts. I want to live up to peoples expectations but I wonâ€™t. Iâ€™ll be a failure after all the encouragement I got. Iâ€™ll disappoint my family. Iâ€™ll just end up cold and alone hanging with a rope around my neck. At least then I wonâ€™t be able to feel the cold. I wonâ€™t have to shiver in the darkness. I can float. Dark. Not feeling, not aching, not alive. I donâ€™t know when. I donâ€™t know how, but I hope I can rid this miserable life soon. I want to sleep. It wouldnâ€™t matter, the world is dying while we sit on our shitty devices and distract ourselves. While greedy people turn a blind eye and continue making  millions of useless prices nylon and paper. Iâ€™m a shitty person. I get mad. I want to have control over women. I want to kill people. I want to destroy everything. I want to destroy humanity. So one day I could watch the stars. The galaxy. Did I you know without light pollution we would be able to see the galaxy. Iâ€™m sure it beautiful. But I will never get to see it. Just another great thing the â€œwondersâ€ of technology have brought us. I want to die. Iâ€™m so broken. The only reason Iâ€™m really making this post is to get sympathy. Im begging for attention. Iâ€™m going to die. Alone. Cold. A disappointment. A virgin. An idiot. A broken person with more life to live. Someone who was a waste of life. With a rope around his neck. Please help.
