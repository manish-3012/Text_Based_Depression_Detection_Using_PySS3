Someone from Texas or elsewhere, this girl needs need help NOW. I don't even know what I can do.I found this girl on tumblr. She says she's going to kill herself tomorrow (ie: today), and I don't live near her or even know her, though I would feel terrible if I didn't try to help however I could. I sent her a message asking if she wanted to talk to me (she said in previous posts she needed someone to talk to) and she told me it was already too late. It also sounds like she's struggling with drugs. I don't know what to do.
