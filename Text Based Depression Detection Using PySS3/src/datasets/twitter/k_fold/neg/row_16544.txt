My last dayWhy is it when you say "I can't do it anymore" people hear everything but that. Like "I can do it, but I don't want to or do think I should, or try". When really sometimes people just cannot do life anymore. 
The pain is indescribable. Even if I tried no one would understand still. I read every post on here and I can't even relate to most. And this sounds really shitty but when I read them I wish I had their problems instead of mine. 
I just wrote most of my suicide note earlier. I think it's off to a shitty start but I'm only writing it once. 
The days are so goddamn hard to get through. I can't live with myself. Everything reminds me of how I completely fucked up every aspect of my life. I hurt people. I ruin things. I can't forgive myself. I can't fix things. I'm jumping off the overpass tonight. I have a perfect plan and it's time to execute it. This will be the very last time I hurt anyone and that brings me peace.
