I can't take it anymoreI don't know how else I can say this anymore,  but I just can't take it.  Over the last few months, a series of events have happened, and I've spiraled. I don't know how far, and I don't think it'll ever stop. I don't see a way back. I felt so happy and one by one everything was taken away from me, friends, trust, happiness. I won't even start on my family, because they mean nothing to me anymore. I tried to explain to them how I feel and the stress I go through as a highschool student, but they just don't seem to care and belittle everything I saw. It also doesn't help that I'm a compulsive liar and lie at  every opportunity I get, and probably that's why they don't believe me. But I just know that I can't  take it anymore that's all I know. Well for now.
