I am ready to goI want to kill my self

I seriously donâ€™t give a fuck anymore. Iâ€™m 24 and Iâ€™ve spent my whole life forcing myself to do shit to be happy and itâ€™s always the same. Friends go and they donâ€™t care to see you anymore. Force myself to take up new things hoping Iâ€™ll find an answer. Push the limits of my comfort zone hoping to meet new people but itâ€™s all the same fleeting bull shit, no genuine lasting connections.

Death seems like the best option. My dad says I need to be strong and selfless and stick around for my family but I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t want to live on feeling like shit. I am 24 and I have tried so fucking hard and I always get shit on. 

All I wanted was to find somebody who loves and understands me and the older I get the more I realize thatâ€™s all bull shit. I try. I try really fucking hard. But it never works out and after countless attempts I know in my soul it never will and if I donâ€™t kill my self Iâ€™ll end up being alone. My parents will eventually die and itâ€™ll be my married siblings and their kids and me spinning my wheels like a fucking loser. Shitty fucking loser. I should just do it and get it over with.
