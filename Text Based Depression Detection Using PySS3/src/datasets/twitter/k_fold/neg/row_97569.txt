I need strength.Hello SW

I have been lurking and reading this subreddit for a long time but not until today have i felt like i need to talk some myself.

I've been having a heavy time the last 2 years beginning from nothing. Through the past 2 years things have changed alot, my mother got dumped so we'r in an economic crisis and we booth work our asses off everyday to support our house and her kids, it makes me broke, i have a girlfriend that used to make me happy in any situation but nowdays she never wanna meet. I have one friend that supports me through any time but he isnt always avaible and i feel like i need a change, i've tried working out, going outside alot, trying to look on the bright side of life.

However i feel like there is none. I have been constantly thinking of a solution when shit hits the fan, i always think.. whats the worst thing that can happen? i can always just drive off the road on my way home and it ends quick. I dont want to speak to anyone about this, i have been thinking of seeking help but i dont wanna end up as a pill addict that can make things worse.

I wanna get better, even tho i dont always feel like it, i just dont know which way to go, i feelt this bad before i met my girlfriend and now that we'r in a crisis, if she left me totally i dont think i'd last, and she is about to. Everyday i just pull on a mask and pretend im happy and great to everyone, i work with support so i talk with alot of people everyday. Next week is my birthday and i've done all i can to hide it, hoping no one will ever notice... ive been looking for drugs to mix with alcohol to soothen my emotions, but its hard to come over some where i live.

TL;DR i have the will but not the strength to break out and feel the joy of life again.

Im 18 btw. and i shouldnt be complaning since "i have my whole life before me" but thats not the deal right now.
