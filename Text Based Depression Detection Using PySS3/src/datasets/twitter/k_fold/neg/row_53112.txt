Asian Student who Might as well End his Life*This is going to involve a lot of swearing*

Canadian here. Going to Phillips Academy Andover next year, probably the best school in the US. Got a shit-ton in my repertoire that I won't expound on, but I just want to end it all. All it takes is for me to feel like I won't complete the homework for one retarded extracurricular class and I get thoughts of depression like the weak piece of shit I am. I don't understand why I just fucking can't do this shit. To add to this mess, I'm addicted to the internet and spend 1-2 hours every night watching fucking youtube when I could have been much better off actually memorizing my Latin homework. I've started cutting myself recently, but its nothing serious. I suppose all I want is some attention... I'm a fucking attention seeking whore. If someone could please tell me how to either get out of this shit or how to hide this depression and pretend that you're normal to others, that would be much appreciated.
