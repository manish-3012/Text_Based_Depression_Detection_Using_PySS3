I feel like I'm too far goneI've been a shut in for nearly 10 years and my social anxiety has become so bad I can't talk to my own family. No matter how much I want to fix it, my efforts are too small to make change. Anything besides these small efforts is too difficult for me to do. I don't want to interact with people because it's draining and I'm horrible at it, I also am absolutely hideous and short so I feel like everyone is judging me negatively, which makes my social anxiety even worse.

It's hard to see a future where I have a job, a friend, am able to get in a relationship and don't have my entire life dictated by my social anxiety. I don't even know what the point of posting this thread is. Any advice I get I'm too incompetent to do and if someone messages me I'll have an anxiety attack just looking at the message.
