On my 20th birthday, 03/20/2019, I will kill myselfIf my life improves before then, I will reconsider. But I promise to myself that if things remain as they are, I won't let this worthless life continue. Besides, you never saw yourself making it to age 20 anyways, it's only fair.

This is a scary thing to write down for me, because I don't seem to like to set things in stone. But I know that if I set this date, I won't be able to run and hide from my feelings anymore.

I guess I've passed the threshold of truly suicidal, instead of some little gay bitch who never gets things done.

If it comes to that day and I'm ready to do the deed, I'll post the past years worth of shit I've written down on my phone notes to help cope. No point in keeping my feelings a secret when I'm dead, I might as well tell my jumbled mess of a story.

I shamefully apologize to everyone in my life who this may affect. This has been years in the making, and it's finally time to act.
