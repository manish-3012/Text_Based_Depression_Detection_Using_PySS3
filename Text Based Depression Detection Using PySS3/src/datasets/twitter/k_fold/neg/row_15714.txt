4 years upon the first attemptIt passed 4 years till the first attempt of committing suicide, They were full of pain, anxiety, depression, passion, love, trying more and more to get better, or get rid of this life.. 
Now, Maybe I am not happy about my life now, but I feel satisfied with myself. I am so proud of myself. I am so proud that I didn't try to get my family sad and lonely. Even if I didn't achieve what I want.
to everyone who read this: I feel you so much. I feel what you mean when you lose your job, lose your gf, fail in exams, struggle with your family and friends, and so much more. 
You must be proud of yourself, that you are alive, you are fuckin' trying and struggling to get better, you failed in committing suicide, that means success.
You can do more. Just BE STRONG AND SAFE.
