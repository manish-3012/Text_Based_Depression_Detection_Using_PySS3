I consider suicide a lot, because of how I'm treated. 18 years, I'm treated like utter garbage by my familyNo one appreciates me, or can even give a damn thank you. I'm the punching bag for their anger, the one they insult all the time. They expect me to respect anyone older me, but I don't get the same. That women and children deserve respect, but when i was younger, the person who said that treated me like shit. I've become reclusive because of their bullying. All I want to do is be alone, play video game,s and roleplay. I can't even do that. My siblings ruin my things, and they never get replaced, giving me less and less avenues to keep myself calm and happy. It's beyond upsetting. I can't even get out because my parents won't spare the money to get an ID, and I need one
