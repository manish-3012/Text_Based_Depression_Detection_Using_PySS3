Seriously thinking about killing myself in 4 days. It'd be a pretty good day.**Major theme**: I am thinking about killing myself in 4 days.

&amp;#x200B;

**How:** constant downing of one Xanax pill at a time, a swing of booze, repeat until one is gone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why:** I just can't take this pain that I feel from the love of my life / boyfriened / ex boyfriend / shitty person - all the same person.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background (if don't want to know, skip down):** 

Known each other since we were young kids. I loved him for years, he ended up marrying the wrong girl not me. Fast forward 13 years we reconnect and instantly fall in love, which was a long time coming. Especially since he told me he loved me when we were young and now and it should of been me he chose.

&amp;#x200B;

We have been dating for 3 years. After the first year and a half, we broke up. I got distant, as I am busy in grad school, and am very independent and need space. I have hobbies, driven, passions, interest, friends, goals, etc. He has no friends, no goals, no purpose. So a lot of the time he looked to me for fulfillment in his life. And as soon as I was busy, stressed, couldn't be a fantastic girlfriend all the time (yes grad school breakdowns are real, and I was reeling from depression from an abortion). These are all things I tried to make him understand but at times he didn't, but we both acted toxic sometimes, depressed sometimes, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the first time I got 'distant' a year and a half into our relationship, he started seeing a new girl behind my back, and when I found out I LOST it. I would go over and stand outside his house for hours in the winter telling him how I feel, depressed, stressed, how much I love him, what we can do to get better. He chose her, as he said she "was a fun exciting option he wasn't going to pass up". Fast forward, a month and a half later, I decided to go home that day from work and kill myself. Right before I did, he called me. Talked to me forever. Called me every day after that until he came over my house 3 days later saying he broke up with her and wanted me. She was a rebound and he never liked her. I never told him I was planning to kill myself. However, after he was about a guy friend I had that would periodically make advances on me, but I never made advances on him. So for the next two months, he would hang out with this rebound ex of his and rub it in my face while I saw at his house crying waiting for him to come home.

&amp;#x200B;

For the next year or so we were up and down. Good months, bad months. Good summer as I had a break from grad school, but then after grad school started he became obsessed with spending every waking moment at his parent's house. (He has 2 kids, and a house himself). To the point where every day I could hang he would say he's just going to hang at his parents. Fast forward. He never came to my grandpas funeral so I didn't hang out with him 3 days later at Christmas because I was mad. mad his priority that day was to go shopping with his parents and never stop at the funeral. At the start middle of February, he got mad one night I went out with my friends, and broke up with me for not calling that night before passing out. I got mad he kept breaking up with me when he was mad. So I told him were not just getting back together, but have to talk and work on things. For the first 3 weeks he couldn't take it, he wanted to be with me again right then, and said waiting shows I wasn't sure. Then the last 3 weeks, he built a shrine of my things in his living room. So i began texting him more trying to work things out and NOT argue. But he always defaults to arguing. Then last week I went over, was going to stay the night, and when he tried to have sex, I said, not yet, we need to take this slower, he got mad and told me to leave. The week after that we talked here and there but I was angry and we argued. Finally the other day I'm like I'm sick of arging. Let's just stop, really work on our problems, maybe therapy, be honest, and I wrote him a 6 page letter being very mature and explaing what we could activiely do to really mkae this work. Then he blocked me and has me blocked for 2 days. This is something he does. often.

&amp;#x200B;

What his habits are: whenever I seem to be over it or just need time away form arguing or him stressing me out, I step back, and he comes in full force, coming to my house in the middle of the night, texting me, calling me, whatever. Whenever he steps away, says he's done, like he did 2 days ago and blocked me, I throw myself to my knees begging. Literally outside his house for hours (can't say how many times he's locked me out in the deaed of winter), text, calls, etc. It seems like he likes that I want him, even though he said he was done, he built a shrine and invited me over a week ago. This kid loves me, but he thinks I'm the only one doing things wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now:** I wasn't a great girlfriend. First I'm an INTP so I'm not heavily into displaying emotions. But I have VERY deep emotions and an over-thinking brain that drives me insane every day of my life. But he wasn't a great boyfriend either. We could argue who did worse, but I never cheated. I never wanted anyone but him even though he has self-love issues (again no friends, no hobbies, relying on me for his happiness).

&amp;#x200B;

**What I would do wrong:** he said I never made him a priority. But grad school is difficult. I'm in an extensive program. One morning after a beautiful happy weekend, I went to school then stayed out and went out to dinner, fell asleep at my friend's house and never called. He got angry the next morning and broke up with me. Then instantly wanted me to get back and I got mad that he keeps saying he's "done" every time he is "mad" at me about things I don't feel he should be mad about, or that mad about, not to break up with someone you constantly say you want to marry. Grad school is hard, it's not an excuse, but 3 weeks ago I made him cookies he wouldn't accept them. I went to his house and he kicked me out. When we together I hang out with him all the time. I even told him the day he last broke up with me that I want to go have a special night out, as he loves that.

&amp;#x200B;

What else: who knows. It's not as bad as last year when he chose that other girl for a month and a half, but I think he'll come around? however, Idk and I can't take waiting and being in pain. I don't deal with heartbreak well, but I never ever have wanted to kill myself to stop this pain from someone besides him. And this is my third time feeling like this. So I was thinking about doing it at his house before he gets home from work. I know it sounds dumb, but I love him and I was to be within any bit of his presence. I love him... Why can't he just unblock me, and tell me he wants to work on being happy too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, considering to aim for 4 days. Tuesday is the perfect day, plus its beautiful to sit outside and pop and drink for an hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Any suggestions on different ways? Questions? Additional helpful methods?** 

The first time I wanted to he knew about and told me please don't because he truly loves me. I'm not killing myself to get him back, I just can't take the pain that is caused my us.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!
