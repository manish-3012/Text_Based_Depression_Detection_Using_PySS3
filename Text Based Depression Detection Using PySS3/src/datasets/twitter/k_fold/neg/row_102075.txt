Consistently at the brink, I don't know how much more I an take.I feel like a weakling having to write this but I at my wits end, i don't have the tools anymore to keep the constant feelings of dread at bay. I've suffered from depression for a majority of my life and its crept in and ruined almost every aspect of it. its destroyed my relationships with what little family I have left and all but a few friends, and the friends I do have left never see this side of me because I disguise my depression with moderated use illicit substances. I apologize if some of what I say seems vague or incoherent, I'm really not in a good place right now mentally and I'm trying to protect some of my anonymity. My business is failing, I've sold almost everything I own of any value except my house, and the only reason I haven't sold it is because its cheaper to pay the mortgage than it is to find somewhere to rent. I don't want to sit here and chew on the end of my old shotgun, but it keeps seeming like the only way out. I'm a male,in my 40's, never been married just a long string of bad relationships. I'm lost.
