I fucking hate being sober and the only time I don't want to kill myself is when I'm in a drugged out haze...Seriously, sobriety makes me wanna fucking blow my brains out, I'm an ugly piece of human garbage and my only conceivable route to happiness is always having weed in my body to run from the fact that I'm a loser.
