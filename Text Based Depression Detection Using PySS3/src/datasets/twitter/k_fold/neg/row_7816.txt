sorryI posted something here about a week ago saying how hard I've tried to fix myself. Things didn't get better after that, though to the two people that tried to help me.. thanks, you're amazing.

I'm here again because things got worse, my reasons to live are getting fewer and fewer. I only survived a bit longer because I didn't want to let my internet friends or my mom down, and I thought that maybe I had a chance at a decent future.

Now its clear that I was wrong, and that nobody cares. I'm sorry..
