Nothing worksI'm starting to think I'm immortal, I keep trying and trying and trying to hang myself for the past 3 days straight but just the same thing happens, survival instincts kick in and right before passing out my body just gets up or holds onto the ceiling rafter. Im ready to go. Please i just want to die. Please dont ask why just help me kill myself if you can.
