About to get wasted on a Sunday afternoon and see what happensIâ€™m so sick of this empty, hollow feeling. Feeling anxious and afraid simply because you know you have nothing to look forward to or live for. Life has been a constant struggle just to be okay. I want to be happy, but it seems so far out of reach. I will never be good enough and I just see a grotesque monster in the mirror anyway.
