At my parent's house for spring break. Nothing to do... suicidal.I have no friends. I literally just lie down on my bed and stare at the ceiling... I went to a PC gaming cafe and played some games for a few hours... Is there nothing else to life? The worst part is I have to return to university which I fucking hate even more... Working on a degree I know won't get me a job after and go to a school with lots of STEM majors is agonizing. I swear the only thing that can take my mind off things are video games... I went to the grocery and stared at charcoal to consider doing the charcoal burning suicide method... someone please help me.....
