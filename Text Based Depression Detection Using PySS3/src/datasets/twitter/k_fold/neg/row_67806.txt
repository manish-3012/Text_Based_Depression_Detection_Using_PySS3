its bad againi got attached to someone and it didnt work out (plus a bunch of other stress ive been quietly hiding) and now my depression and bpd are placing bets like im a fucking race horse on which will kill me first. ive tried talking to my therapist and i love her shes good and all but idk it's not working. im "retreating" or whatever and i just don't want to be here anymore. im not seeing any fucking light or bullshit glimmer of hope or any of that other shit people spew.
