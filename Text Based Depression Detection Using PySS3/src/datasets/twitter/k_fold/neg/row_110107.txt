Going to jump in 2-3 hoursJust wanted to let someone know, since I can't say this to my friends. 

Almost ready, just need to wipe hard drive, write last notes and to gather some thoughts I guess. Had constant anxiety attacks, since I've set that date. Kinda scared right now, but whatever.

Sorry, if some of this doesn't make sense, english isn't my native language.

EDIT: And now I feel like an asshole for talking back to everyone who tried to respond, sorry about that. I know you can say only so much.

Still going with it, thanks for reading my stuff, bye.
