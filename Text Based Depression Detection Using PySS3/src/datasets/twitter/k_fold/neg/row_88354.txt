I just give upI got into an argument w my parents cuz I had forgotten or shave my underarms(my underarms like come on I forgot I'm sorry) and my mom was calling me a liar and whatnot just cuz  I forgot about it and I got mad and said "it'd be better for you if I just killed myself huh" and she just said great I won't bury you. Ive shown so many signs but nobody cares. My own mother just said that she doesn't care and that she won't bury me so much love from her am I right. I give up on god, on life, on love and on hope I'm 15 theres shit I wanna do but no I can't because my religious dumb, fatass bitch of a mother doesn't care. I'm gonna end it soon very soon. I can't believe how both my mom and dad said they don't care if I kill myself, that they'll live with it cuz its my choice not theirs.
