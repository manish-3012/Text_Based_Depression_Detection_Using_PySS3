GoodbyeDon't want to depress anyone but the alcohol is kicking in can't help myself, just wanted to say I love you. My genes are gone to void but I hope the same won't happen to you. Live well, don't be naive like me. This is not a cry for help, please don't answer the thread. Good people like us shouldn't be bothered by things like this.

Love
