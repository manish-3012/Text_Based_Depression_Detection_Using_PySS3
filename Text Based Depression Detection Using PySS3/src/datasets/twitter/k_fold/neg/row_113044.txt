Nothing to look forward to, no one to talk to30 years old and unemployed. Been living in a foreign country, looking for a job plus fighting depression for over a year now. Getting help isn't easy because therapy is fucking expensive and not having a job means no medical insurance. I don't know what's left to do now. No one knows I'm depressed. As a self stigmatized depressive, I see no way out but to go quietly. No one would notice anyway. Help.
