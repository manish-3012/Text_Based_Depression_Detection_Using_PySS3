Iâ€™ve tried my bestI have tried my best  to get better but nothingâ€™s changed if anything things have gotten worse. If this continues I fear Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I donâ€™t want to die but my options are beginning to seem limited. Iâ€™m a failure of a human. My body feels heavy I canâ€™t take this anymore I just want it to stop.
