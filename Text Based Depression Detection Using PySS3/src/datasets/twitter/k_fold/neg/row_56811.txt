I'm suicidal I don't really know what to write. I'm 17 and I don't really have any terrible problems but I just get overwhelming depression often. I've had depression on and off since I was ten and cry myself to sleep almost every night. I have a good family and everything but I just don't have the desire to live anymore. I don't like spending 8 hours at school five days a week, I don't enjoy the time when I'm not at school, and I do nothing that is productive. I don't have many friends, and life just seems like a grind that is painfully unenjoyable far too often. I haven't enjoyed my life for years and I just don't see it improving at all. I don't want to kill myself, but I want to live even less. Sorry for the all over the place message, don't feel like editing.
