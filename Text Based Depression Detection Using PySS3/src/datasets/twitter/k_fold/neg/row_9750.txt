My life is improving and I'm happier and it makes me want to die moreMoved out from abusive home months ago, landed a good job, made amazing friends, experienced intimacy, vacationed and saw great things... but it's too foreign.

I'm happy but I'm not used to this. At the end of the day I feel strange and get extreme pangs of depression over these unfamiliar feelings. I keep feeling that I don't deserve it. I CRAVE the horrid lifestyle that I had before. I don't want to but I also want to be abused and neglected and constantly in a state of chaos. 

Went out in the city with one of my closest friends today, someone whom I still consider genuine, and even with we were together, eating, she and I laughing, I still felt the same way.

Ive romanticized the things in life I've wanted to experience and now I'm just disappointed I guess. I'm bored. There's nothing I want to stay for. Hobbies lose my interest quickly. I don't know. I don't think I could ever live normally. I just want to sleep forever.
