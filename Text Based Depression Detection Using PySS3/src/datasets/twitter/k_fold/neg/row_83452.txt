19 year old male checking in.im using a throw away account for some unknown reason)

(sorry if this is a bit unreadable)


Today was the first time that i have ever felt this horrible and actually felt like suicide would free me.
I really don't know where to start. My whole life has been a mess since i graduated high school. I wanted to join the Marines and I did but, i never left for boot camp because i had a lot of anxiety and I was almost 20 lbs over weight. This was over a Year ago. I've had one temporary job for ups (during december 2010).

I have looked into college but i know it's not for me. I have been jobless for a year now and I'm planning to join the Air Force now but every time i go to my recruiters office his scale says im 193lbs which I know I'm 193 i've tested my scale with a 30 lbs of weight and I've used other peoples scales and they have all said I'm 193 lbs but my recruiter won't take me unless his scale says im 193lbs. I have been trying to lose that 'weight' for a good 4 months now and my recruiters scale has barely budged.

Today my mom basically called me out and told me she wants me to apply for a different job every day and write the number of the place down and who i spoke to on a notebook, she talked to me in the biggest condescending tone i felt like breaking her nose so bad. to add to it she basically said she's embarrassed of me when my neighbors ask her about my life. I've bombed every Interview that i have been to so that's not helping. Every day i sit in my room and watch anime or play video games to distract my self from reality.

I have one friend who still talks to me and he usually doesn't give a fuck about me, the only time we hang out is when he wants to go to the skatepark or if he wants to play video games online


My life isn't horrible beyond belief but every day is just so damn dull/ it's at a stand still. I'm not at the point where I want to kill myself, I'm pretty depressed though. I want my life to have some meaning in the near future It's hard to keep telling myself "tomorrow will be better"
