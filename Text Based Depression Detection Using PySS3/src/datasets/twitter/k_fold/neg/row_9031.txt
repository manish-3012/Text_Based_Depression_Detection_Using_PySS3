Canâ€™t take it anymore26 M - London, UK

Funny how this time last year I had just gotten back from Mexico with my girlfriend and just secured investment for my business.

Fast forward 12 months, I now no longer have a gf, no investment, destroyed relationship with family and in a ton of debt to a loan shark who has given me a final deadline for tomorrow morning. Policr are out of question due to collateral he has on my family &amp; I have no way of funding it from my end. 

I genuinely have hit rock bottom, with no solution, and frankly give up, everything that could have gone wrong past 52 weeks, has gone wrong. 

Iâ€™ve taken a lot of benzodiazepines to numb me and have researched a deadly combination prescriptions. 

Iâ€™m sorry to everyone who I have let down.
