I'm tiredI have really bad anxiety. Which makes it very difficult to be sociable and talk to people I also hate being by myself.  I don't ever seem to find happiness. I do have 1 close friend but I'm afraid I've pushed her away with my constant for reassurance and attention.  I really hate myself right now. I'm tired of being alone all the time. I miss my friend dearly and I can't forgive myself for being honest with her and making her feel she had to push me away. I don't see myself ever changing.  If I could find a quick painless way to end my life I would.
