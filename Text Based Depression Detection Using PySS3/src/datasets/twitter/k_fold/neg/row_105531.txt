Im tired of being aliveEvery time I feel good it fucks up no matter what. It's a never ending cycle. And the only thing that made me happy left me. I fucking hate myself my body is so disgusting and wrong. No wonder no one can love me. Life is too painful I wish I actually killed myself earlier tonight before cops found me. Yeah my family and maybe some other people will be sad but I'm tired of suffering and being in pain all my life no matter what. Only thing stopping me from trying again is I have no energy and i don't want my mum to hurt any more since my dad died last year.
