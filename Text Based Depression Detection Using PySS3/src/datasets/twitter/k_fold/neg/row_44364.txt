I can't come up with one reason to live anymoreEverything goes wrong at the same time. Yeah things get better but then they go to shit again. I tried for 20 something years to find one reason why I should live and I can't find one. Family and friends mean nothing to me for I have none. Live for myself, well I hate myself so that doesn't work. My fish are all sick, they kept me going but now they are suffering and going to be dead soon so there is nothing for me. I wish there was. I wish I had something to give me hope but it's all gone.  Any ideas would be nice, but I warn you I will probably shoot most of them down.
