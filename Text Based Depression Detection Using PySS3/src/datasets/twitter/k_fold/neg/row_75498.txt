I feel like life or god is sabotaging meI had many ups and downs in life and few months ago after putting in a lot of effort i reached one of my highs in life just to be put down few weeks later. Im just tired of this because this whole "game" doesnt seem fair at all. Im pretty sure i ll kill myself in the next few months but i think my mind is telling me to just wait for one more time being put down so i ll be sure something is against me so i can kill myself in peace, i cant fight this shit and i dont even want to anymore.
