i think i might have to admit myself to a ward soonEverything is still just as bad. Anxiety fills every waking moment. The only reason ive been clean from self harm recently is because of my friends, and thats not a permanent solution. I brought up my suicidal thoughts in therapy, didnt really help much to be honest. The past couple months have been torturous for me. Things have to change. If things dont get better, (and they wont because im incapable of helping myself), im going to break. Every aspect of my life is fucked. and i dont want to go to a ward, especially during a pandemic, but i dont think im going to be safe for much longer with how things are going. Im going to try and hang in for at least 26 more days, because thats when i will be able to see my girlfriend again, but if im still feeling this way at that point im going to have to go into treatment before i snap.
