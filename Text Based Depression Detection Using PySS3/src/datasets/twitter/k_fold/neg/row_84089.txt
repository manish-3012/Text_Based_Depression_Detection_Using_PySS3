I think life's great, I just HATE MY lifeI've taken all the advice I could find to help and and nothing works... It's been a year and I feel worse. My thoughts are overwhelming so much  I have to actually stop doing anything at times. I feel awful all the time I just want to be good feel good make people happy 

I'm going to OD on a bunch of Acetaminophen. I know it's not the best way to go but It's accessable. I already took 8 500 mg pills taking it slower then  last time 2 weeks ago, because I vomited after an hour.

I'm posting so I don't feel alone as I do this, but it's like 3am so no one will even see this. i hope my mom and dad understand. No future anyways
