if i do it everyone will end up betterall i do is hurt people it doesnt matter who they just end up being hurt by me

im not a good person who does bad things because i just keep doing them over and over im a bad person and when a bad person dies everyone ends up better

im a financial burden to my family and im not doing well in college and i scare them because i get emotional

my friends are scared of me too theyre scared of my emotions and my depression and i know they all hate me

i ruin peoples relationships if i had just kept my mouth shut they wouldve still been together

running away and forming a new identity is too hard as is faking my death and i dont want to be alive because i dont want to remember all of this

when people do bad things they deserve punishment and this is the best form of punishment there is because i dont deserve to live because its just a countdown to see whose life im going to ruin next

i hate myself and i hate how im a bad person and i hate making mistakes and i hate never learning from them. when i die i will make sure to leave a note telling everyone to throw a party and they will because theyll all be happy and relieved and no one else will have to deal with my actions harming others. in a way this is a gift for everyone
