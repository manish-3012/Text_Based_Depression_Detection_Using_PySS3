DissociationI have every number blocked in my contacts besides my mom, mangers , a Girl I think I love (who hasnâ€™t texted back in a week) and have no social mediaâ€™s.

some people get in touch with me via email or SoundCloud but itâ€™s only when they need or want something. I realized the few people I call â€œfriendsâ€
Donâ€™t ever really return the favor when it comes
To listening or trying to help me. Feels like everyone thinks Iâ€™m a joke they always give a basic response 
â€œNothing I say Can really help you , like you can help yourself â€œ so Iâ€™m done talking to everyone. I have a older brother I havenâ€™t spoke or seen in 8 years 
what makes a high school friend think I wonâ€™t do the same to them! Does anyone relate or am I just psychotic.
