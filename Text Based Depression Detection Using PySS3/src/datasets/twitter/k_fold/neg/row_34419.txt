Everything should be okay, but itâ€™s not.The thoughts and feelings I have regarding suicide, are something I never let anyone know about. I grew up in a country where the largest percentage of death in men below 40 years of age is due to suicide. Itâ€™s something I recognize as a problem with myself, but I never let anyone know the full extent of my feelings. I have seen the aftermath of suicide many times in my life, yet I still think of it.

I moved to America a few years ago to be with my wife. I met her whilst traveling the states. She changed everything in life for me. I left everything behind to be with this incredible woman.

It took a couple years, but I eventually got my green card. I feel like the new presidency slowed everything down.

I got through it however, albeit with some weight gain and a lot of killing time waiting on my papers.

I used to work in software, but when I could work here I decided to bartend. I like people, especially all the diverse characters you see in Nee York city, Iâ€™m a very self conscious person, but I loved being in front of people, and cheering them up with a few drinks and conversation.

This led to working for a whiskey company.

I am in my dream job. I educate people about whiskey, promote the brand, and help bars execute whiskey events and create cocktails.

The problem is the drinking that comes with it. Iâ€™ve gained significant weight with the job, and I feel like I have a hangover most days. On good days I will have 4 drinks, the worst is more like a dozen. This last few months it has been placing the darkest cloud over me. I know i should get better at turning down drinks, itâ€™s just a constant temptation. I have friends who work in the same industry who are in great shape and have balance in their lives. I think I just overdo things.

I do not think I am an alcoholic just yet, I typically avoid booze on the weekends, when I am off work. But I feel like it could be on the way.

To sum everything up: I have an amazing life, wife, family, and job. But I have always struggled with suicide and depression. Itâ€™s the weirdest thing, it doesnâ€™t matter how good or bad things are, it is always there for me.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about it more and more.
