Planning to go on Monday nightI'm not sure yet. We'll see when monday comes. Will I be brave enough to do it? Probably not.

Will I try to get help? I really hope so.

My two wishes is:

Me just dying
Me not even trying

I'm also planning to do it on another day if I failed. Argh I hate this so fucking much. I want to stop living but I don't want to die.

I don't know what to do.
