I really can't do this.It's like every morning I have to start all over. I don't have any friends, no people skills, no hobbies, no passion, nothing. I don't have a reason to be alive. Everyone I love always leaves by coincidence and I'm wondering if it's even worth it anymore. I have tried getting help, I have tried everything and nothing helped. Maybe I'm not supposed to be here. I'm sorry but I really can't do this anymore. I'm extremely miserable. I thought about my family, and I think about how it would effect them if I died, but I feel like I'm torturing myself by being alive just because of them.

I really can't do this. If anyone has any advice, that would be great. Other than that, I'm sticking to my original plan of killing myself on my birthday if things don't get better by then. I'm sorry.
