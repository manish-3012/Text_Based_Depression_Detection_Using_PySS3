It does get better, itâ€™s a stupid saying but somehow trueI have major depression, anxiety, and all that good stuff. I tried to end my life twice and luckily failed. Iâ€™ll turn 16 in 9 days and I never thought Iâ€™d make it this far. I am 9 months clean of cutting and I am happy. Itâ€™s weird saying that still, but itâ€™s true. I have more confidence in myself and smile without thinking. The biggest turning point was going to my grandmother and best friends funeral within 10 days of each other. I canâ€™t put my family and friends through that stuff again, and I wonâ€™t. If it seems hopeless, talk to me. Stay alive for your friends, family, a walk in the rain, some good food, stay alive for me. I love you, and it gets better, no matter how annoying that phrase sounds.
