I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna make it to 13I turned 12 recently, which is already a lot older than I feel. But, I just can picture myself as an adult, or even a teenager. I honestly donâ€™t think I will even make it to 13 years old. Life is already crap and I canâ€™t do anything at all, itâ€™s just going to get worse as I get older, and get more responsibility.
