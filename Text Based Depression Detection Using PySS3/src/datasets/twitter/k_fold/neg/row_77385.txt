Stop hurting othersI disasociate from me my pain. Im just horrible to others and myself. 
And as much as i know this is an illness im beginning to hate myself further. 

Peace to my family means death, they can have their own life. When you stop existing it stops the pain of you that thing stops.

I am not worthy of life
