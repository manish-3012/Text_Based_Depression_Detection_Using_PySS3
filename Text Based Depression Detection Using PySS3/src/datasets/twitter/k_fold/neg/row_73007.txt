I would like to chatIf that is possible. There is a lot on my mind. I am making progress in my own life but I have hit a philosophical point. I simply see no logical point in continuing. up until now it has been a search for something. I am not sure what one thing, multiple really. self discovery maybe a key point. 
yet I never the less end up intertwined w/ interesting situations to say the least. it has been more then 48 hours since I have said a word. I would enjoy a chat.
