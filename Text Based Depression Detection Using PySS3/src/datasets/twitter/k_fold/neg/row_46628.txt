I don't want to do itI consider myself a pretty rational person. There is no rational reason I would kill myself before I tried basically everything else. Logically I should take all my money out of the bank and go across the country going to weird places,trying weird jobs, doing weird drugs and just see if something gives me joy before I even consider just saying fuck it to the whole bag. I'm getting stuck in loops thinking about how tired I am all the time. I've picked out a method, I'm tying nooses just to see what it feels like. I'm very depressed and very anxious and I think there's something chemically wrong with me but if I seek help I'm afraid I'll be involuntarily committed. I feel lost.
