I need a little light in my lifeI'm tired. I'm stressed. I'm really done. I feel like I don't know the way. I know why I should live on, that light is beautiful and there's so much out there, think of your parents. but for I really think im done. I've got loving parents but the amount of academic stress they place on me is fantastic. I've had a rough couple semesters and I've been nothing but underperforming when i could do much better. The last 2 semesters were definitely the worst in my life due to the stress I had, I lost why i wanted to pursue my dreams and further gotten addicted to the internet. Coming home I got a realization of what i wanted to do but its faded with time. Now iim being bombarded with the need to study and do work while i really just want some time to hang with friends. I can feel myself ripping my sanity to shreds. Tonight I've gotten so close to just killing myself to inflict misery on parents. They've been helpful and loving but this constant buildup has shredded me. i figure maybe there would a better life in the next one. I want a reason to live but i keep losing it. i've had enough. i just want some peace.
