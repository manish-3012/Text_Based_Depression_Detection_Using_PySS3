Why do I even live?I really just want to end my life so that all this pain could just end it's everyday I go to bed crying thinking why should I live? I Just wanted to scream and make everything disappear I've cut myself, and almost jumped off a building too many fucking times but why oh why am I still alive why do I keep going if there is nothing for me I've gotten some help but It was just my mom putting me in therapy probably just an attempt to not have such a defective child. I really just don't feel anything except sorrow I just can't find anything worth living.
