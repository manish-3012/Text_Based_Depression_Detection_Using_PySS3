Itâ€™s all downhillMy life is going to fucking shit. Itâ€™s getting to hard to simply deal. I have two midterms (technically three lol) coming up. Iâ€™m not mentally stable enough to be dealing with the added on stress. 
Quick little background: 
I recently got some news that i have a disease, curable but Iâ€™m starting to think i got the drug-resistant characteristic too. Iâ€™m so scared, I feel so alone. I already suffered from depression and my depressive episodes are borderline suicidal, so the news just piled on top of a bunch problems. 
Iâ€™m worried about myself. Iâ€™m worried about my health, mentally and physically. I feel so alone and so judged and i feel like Iâ€™m losing my bf very quickly. 
Self harming started up again... my depressive episode is genuinely just getting worse 
I canâ€™t hold on anymore
