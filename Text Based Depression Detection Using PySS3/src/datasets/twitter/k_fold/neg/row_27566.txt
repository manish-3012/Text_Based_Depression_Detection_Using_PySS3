Not feeling suicidal, but im pretty stressed and sadWell... just now im done talking to a girl... wich was nice with me. She just blocked me for no reason, we've been talking for 2 months, and she don't even want to speak to me... That's ok i guess, she can do whatever she wants, but im sad because she didn't gave me any explanation at all... and we were really in love i guess, at least i felt like i was. 
Then there's this stuff going on in my head about what am i going to do with my life, i don't know what to do with it, im not a dude that want's a lot, i just want to make people happy and survive... i don't want a great job or a big fucking mansion... i just want to be happy, and it seems really imposible. There are moments of true happiness, where everything is ok, everything feels... childish, inocent, moments when you forget about all the shit in the world. Moments of hope, I don't know. I feel like im stuck between the blade and the wall, but because of my own mistakes. I don't blame my shit to anyone, i don't need to. i have my own problems, but i can't talk to anyone, because they don't think they're important, my problems ain't big, i don't have an abusive father, and i don't even want to kill myself, even if sometimes i wish i was dead to escape from the reallity that we live in, i don't think i suffer from depression, but more from cynicism. I would love to love, and i would love to feel loved, i would love to at least know what i want to do with my life. And i would love to stop thinking that if someone wants to rob me on the street with a gun, i just tell them to fuck of just to get a shot in the head, i need more happy moments guys, just to forget the bad ones.
Thaks for reading, i feel like talking right now, about anything, i don't care.
