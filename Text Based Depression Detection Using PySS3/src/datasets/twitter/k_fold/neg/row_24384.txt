stuckI'm a 21 year old woman with a disorder that's really embarrassing and getting worse by the day. I have other problems too but this is what I'm thinking about the most. I don't know how much longer I'll be able to handle it, because I keep thinking that it'll keep getting even worse. I have no idea what to, I can't see a doctor until May, and until then I just have to suffer and go to work and pretend like everything's gonna be okay, which I don't feel at all.
