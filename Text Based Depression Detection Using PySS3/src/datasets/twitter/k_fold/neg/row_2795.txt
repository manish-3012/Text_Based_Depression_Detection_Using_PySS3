Shattered with no thread to hang on to. My name is James, 27.http://i.imgur.com/2m7Ll.png
Took a picture so you can see the human behind this post.

Today in a calm voice after an agonizing night of never ending memories, I asked to speak to my ex of 4+ years face to face after many months if she had any remaining feelings for me, any shred of hope.

I tried so hard to be that guy she met, To be better than that. To move forward not just for her but for me so I could be happy, I was changing and challenging myself at every end. I finally felt like I could cover all my promises and much more.  I just wasn't good enough for her anymore.

I've been in /depression, /sw with another username and you guys really kept me at bay these past couple months, via skype, sms, pm. I'm grateful to a lot of you. Saw a lot of other people who also suffer, really changes the perspective.


I am exhausted of being at bay just abiding my time for a loud enough siren call to lead me.

I saw my light go out completely with her words today, I don't know what to do anymore, I'm just sitting here in front of the computer looking at my body tremble.
