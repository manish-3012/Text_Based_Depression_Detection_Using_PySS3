I'm sick of feeling like this and I just now realized that nobody cares or wants to listen...Feeling shitty, and worthless, and useless and struggling to get out of bed. Everyone I thought I could trust, and everyone I relied on to talk to about my emotions, is now just pissed off with me and ignoring me telling me to "get my shit together"... i just feel so numb, goddamnit and now just whats the point
