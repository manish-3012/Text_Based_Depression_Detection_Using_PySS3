no one cares about me....hey. so. i am posting here 58699476 time but whatever. 

i am fucking up everything good in my life. i am isolating myself and then i complain im lonely :) i had a chance to meet with my friends today, but i was afraid i'm not gonna be ready on time... so i told them im not coming.... now i feel bad because im lonely and i have no one to talk to. i envy all those people, who have friends, who they can talk to. but i have no one like that. and i dont know if i ever will. i just cant connect to people :(

if no good things will happen to me, then why not just die


well fuck it i am gonna do something about my loneliness. im gonna talk to people. i have some friends, i never talked to them about personal stuff?? but i guess just talking to someone will help. if nothing good comes out of this im killing myself
haha 1/2 person is ignoring me :))))) what did i even expect lmao.ok so the person replied maybe ito wont be that bad
