Would anyone care?Iâ€™m gonna be honest, Iâ€™m 17 and Iâ€™ve definitely thought of it and I really thought I would and some points but right now Iâ€™m not. Nothing much has changed for me but I donâ€™t want to put my family through this because of my shit. But the other day I was just thinking and o realised that apart from my family and about 1 or 2 close friends, I feel like people would forget me and move on. I had another good friend that died this time last year and he was very popular and people still talk about him a lot and Iâ€™m
not particularly introverted or anything, Iâ€™d say I was quite lucky in life if anything and I definitely have quite a few friends, some good ones, but apart from my family and maybe four or five others, I donâ€™t think anybody would really care that much.
