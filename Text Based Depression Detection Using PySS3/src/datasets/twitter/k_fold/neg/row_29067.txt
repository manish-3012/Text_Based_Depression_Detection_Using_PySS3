I'm done. Dreaming is fucking stupid.I am decided to kill myself. Idk how or in which way is possibly the least painful. I live in Colombia, a country in development. I don't have it bad tbh. Dad works in a good place and my mom has her own shop. I believe I am a piece of shit that doesn't deserve all the nice things in life. I wish some of my friends could have all the things I've been given by my father. I don't really deserve them.

For some time I have had this dream of studying in Germany after I lived there for 3 months (plus 5 months in Switzerland). My best friend lives in Germany and honestly the only good reason I am still alive. But applying has been so rough. I have been completing paperwork, getting authentication and all that shit. I learned German for a long time and studied a year at uni here because it was a requirement. I have been trying to get there for about 2 years. Now, I have all the paperwork, waiting on the admission from at least one of the several universities I applied to. Everything looked nice.

Now, I've checked the German embassy info. They don't have appointments for this month, or August, or the beginning of September. Uni starts in October in Germany. People tell me that the processing for the visa can take up to 3 months. At this point I'm so done. I'm tired of hoping for the best and tired of trying. I don't want to live in Colombia. And no. I don't deserve Colombia or Germany. But honestly I just wanted to live that dream. This is just a rant about how dreams crumble and while there are strong people who try and try and try, I think I'm not that strong.
