I want to dieI want to die so badly but I'm too much of a coward to do it. I just want the constant sadness and loneliness to stop. I feel so guilty even being this depressed because I know I have it better than so many other people but that doesn't change the fact that I don't want to live anymore. I feel like such a pathetic waste of space and I know I'm just as unloveable as I feel
