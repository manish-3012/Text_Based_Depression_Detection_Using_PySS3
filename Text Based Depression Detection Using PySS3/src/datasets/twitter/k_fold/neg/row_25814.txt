too difficultits too scary once the belt is around my neck, i just cant go through with it.

i dont have a gun or anything and dont have anything to OD on.

even when i do go through with hanging, it never seems to work (i get my feet onto something or pull myself out of the belt loop)

i cant do it. ive given up on ways to end it and now im just miserable and sleep all day
