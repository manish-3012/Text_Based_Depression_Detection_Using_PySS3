I canâ€™t take it anymore, I canâ€™t take livingI canâ€™t fucking take it. I canâ€™t do this. Why do I have to live to please other people? I canâ€™t kill myself because others will be hurt, what about me? Iâ€™m in pain everyday, I didnâ€™t ask for this, I didnâ€™t ask for this life. And what? Now I have to stay because it makes everyone else feel better. Why do I have to lie, why do I have to continue when I donâ€™t want to ? Why do I have to live with the pain so everyone doesnâ€™t feel it? Why is that my duty? It fucking hurts it hurts I want to die I want to die so badly
