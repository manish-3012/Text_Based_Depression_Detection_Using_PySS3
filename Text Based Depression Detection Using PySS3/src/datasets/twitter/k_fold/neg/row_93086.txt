Can anyone give me hope?No job, no perspective. I'm still not over that girl. All the dreams I had, they're gone. Destroyed or at least, it seems like they're impossible to reach. I've made no progress. Things are still as bad as they always were. I don't know what to do. It feels like there's no way out. I've always been someone who tought a lot and pretty much always found a way out. But not anymore.

I haven't cried in an eternity, but it's incredibly hard to hold back the tears now. Cause I know it's kinda over for me. No fun, no future, no change in sight, only pain.... what's the point then? I don't want to do it, yet it seems like the only way out.
