I can't take it anymoreI'm absolutely miserable. I'm 32 years old, almost 33.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last twenty years all I felt was this melancholy, at times spiraling into outright heavy depression. Jokes, smiles. I'm the funny guy, adorable, maybe inappropriately sarcastic, but it's all a facade. I'm an actor doing the same play over and over. Nothing ever really changes. Sometimes there's new faces but it's the same fucking play.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a degree that I hate. I stumbled through law school at a shitty university, did a five-year degree in seven, just to shut up people about my lack of education. Now I can't pass the bar, and I don't have a job, or prospects. I live with my mom, and I can tell she's tired of carrying my burdens. Nobody should live with a parent forever. I have a girlfriend that's in worse shape than me. Locked in a psychiatric ward because of crippling depression, I tried to help her, but I can't even help myself. I can't seem to find a way. My father hates me and doesn't speak to me anymore.

Friends are few, and most don't notice when I withdraw into myself, and I don't want them to notice. I feel small and toxic, disgusting. I tried to off myself two times in the last ten years unsucefully, and I'm just lacking the energy for a third go at it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therapy didn't helped, medication didn't help; all I got were labels. Anxiety, depression, ADHD. Useless.

I don't want to die. I just don't want to exist at all.
