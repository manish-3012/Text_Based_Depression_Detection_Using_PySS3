Finally going to do itI've decided that I'm going to end my life tonight after putting it off for so long

I just wanted to post here to thank everyone here who has ever spoken to me, I appreciate it so much. But I am sorry for wasting your time

I'm going to try and hang myself and if that doesn't work, I live beside a train station, so I will try and jump in front of a train there

I am quite afraid of death honestly but I have no other choice. I need to die. I'm not sure if I will be able to do it but I hope so, I'm going to try anyway

Goodbye
