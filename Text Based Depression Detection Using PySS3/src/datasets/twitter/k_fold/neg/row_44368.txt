everything sucksim so sick of everyone. kinda wanting to kms. i hate the thought of school. it's not like the adults really care about us, they sent us back even though my area has a lot of cases of covid and i got a grandma at home. they just care that they're losing money. i also hate the way our systems work. you go to school for years and as soon as you're done or even during then, you need to get a job. which i have no problem with but when you have to get a job you have to choose between a boring desk job that makes you feel dull or you have to choose a job that overworks to so much that you feel mentally and physically drained. oh or you could work at a gas station the rest of your life, til the day you die, and still barely have any money. I feel like i'm just giving my soul away. and adults always feel like younger kids have to respect them just because they're older, yet they insult and belittle kids just because they know we can't say anything back. im so tired
