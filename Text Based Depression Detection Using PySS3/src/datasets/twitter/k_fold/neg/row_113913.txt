I understand now. I want it to endI used to be part of the "why would anyone commit suicide?" group like I imagine most other people are in or have been in. Now that I've spent years with suicidal ideation and passive suicidal thoughts, I've reached the point where seeing people get "rescued" from their attempts just saddens me. To see people reach the point where they try to end their suffering only to be dragged back to life has become hard to watch or read about. In the Incredibles it's played for laughs but it rings true to me now, "you didn't save my life, you ruined my death!". I can't muster up any sort of "acceptable" reaction when someone committing suicide comes up in conversation anymore because all I want to do is empathize with them. Hopefully I can take the final step like them soon.
