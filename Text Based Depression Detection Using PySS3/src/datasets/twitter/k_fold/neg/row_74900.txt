I have waited and nothing has gotten better.Well, now that I failed my semester of university I have no hope at all for my future. I was going to go back next semester and start fresh with a new degree in mind but I dont see that happening. My depression is not getting better. In the last month and a half it has gotten to a point where I can hardly leave my house without nearly shutting down completely or having an anxiety attack. On more then one occasion this past month, I have been tempted to go home and hang myself in a closet and end everything. I am quite tired of waiting to be happy. I have waited 8 years now and I am pretty damn sure that is long enough. It doesnt help that I have developed the most disturbing nightmares possible. I am aguy who has grown up with horror movies, reads Stephen King constantly and has a generally dark atmosphere. I have never really been scared of anything besides actually dieing. The nightmares I have keep me up for hours on end so I am burnt out every morning. Since school is not looking like an option my job would need to be full time and I would make 20,000 a year. That is not even on the poverty line, it is 2000 below it. Apparently you can beat a dead horse just to make sure it will never get up again. I dont think I will be getting up again for much longer. I am exhausted and am going to bed now. Ill check any and all responses when I get up. Thanks for reading/commenting. Have a good one.
