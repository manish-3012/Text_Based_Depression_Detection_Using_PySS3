Confessed to my therapist that I tied my noose, she tried to lock me upConfessed it to my therapist. She tried to bait me into getting locked up, saying "it was just a dialog". 

When I stepped into the ward, the doctor basically told me that I was admitted as soon as I stepped foot into. Only got let out cause I said I didn't get told this.

Even promised my therapist and the psych ward to not hang myself for the time being, they don't care.

Everything is so hopeless, truly.

Cba anymore, any danes on here?
