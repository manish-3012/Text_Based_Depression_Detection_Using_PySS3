The Reason I Can't Sleep AnymoreI've not had a good night sleep in around 2 or 3 years. Growing up I always felt like an outcast for wanting to be a girl (I was born male) that I tried to take my life on multiple occasions yet to no avail. During my year 10 highschool year I was cutting almost every night crying myself to sleep. One of my best friends helped me during this rough time and stopped me from ending it all. I still think about this almost every night that everything I've done can be taken away in seconds.
Sorry if this was a bit long thanks for reading
