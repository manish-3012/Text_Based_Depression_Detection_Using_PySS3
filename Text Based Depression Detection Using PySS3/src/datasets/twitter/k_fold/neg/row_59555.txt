280:1Does anyone have any stories of how you coped with and got through your suicidal thoughts and attempts? 
I've had a rough year and Cosmopolitan just put out an article about how there are 280 people that decide not to do it for every 1 person that does do it. How many of you are in this subreddit because you didn't do it?
