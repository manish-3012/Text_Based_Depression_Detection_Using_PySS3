I did everything I possibly could for his benefit......And he still broke up with me. The day it was happening was the day an old friend of mine passed on from cancer. The unintential conflicted with both my life and his. I was dissociated. Mid-panic attack.

And he dumped me. He's the only person I ever had fallen in love with. But his job is stressing him out and .. I know he's never going to come back. I don't know what to do, I just want to fucking die so the mental sodomy stops.

He decided he wanted to be friends, we're both BPD. I can't even get on Skype/Facebook. This has destroyed me. I don't want to exist. When I asked him to clarify the reasons he no longer wanted to be with me. All he did was an endless loop of the same shit.

i have gone out of my way so fucking much to make sure he's okay. To make sure, when something bad happens, that he's okay. 

The day before he told me he loved me a lot, and we discussed meeting eachothers' parents...i cant eat, can't sleep, and it takes everything I have not to go for a gun (registered) or a razor.

He also said he still wanted me to come down to where he's located now and potentially move in. I never got that opportunity.  I am so fucking stupid, how could I fuck this up? Why is everything in my life fucked? Why the FUCK would he tell me he loves me, ask me if I as okay and tells me to call him

to fucking break up. And now I'm the one talking in circles. I had an interview last week for a job. Bombed it because I almost could't stop crying. "you need help" he says. I've only ever broken down once infront of him and it wasn't until then because of him.

He thought he was harming me before because of stress... no. he walked out of my life when i needed him most. i feel used, cheap, stupid. I've already started relapsing. I can't fucking do anything. I was actually happy with him... and fuck
fuck fuck fuck
