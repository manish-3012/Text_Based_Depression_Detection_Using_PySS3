Can't do this anymoreI don't even know what to write... you might even think that's not something serious. i don't want to die, i belive in a better life, a wife, children, a stable job and so... but i won't be able to reach them. i fucking suck at school. all i know to do is procastinate till the point i don't have time to study.. ending up in doing nothing. this is literally killing me. my ex have straight 8s and 9s and i can't even fucking get a 6. the worst part is that im doing the 3rd class of high school for the second time... everyone in my class gets fantastic grades meanwhile i can only use the computer all day. i tried a lot. and trying to convince myself to study is literally impossible. i don't want to get rejected again. i won't be able to stand the shame. i am a failure as son and person. i can't get done anything. i prefer ending my life instead of become someone people will make fun of.
