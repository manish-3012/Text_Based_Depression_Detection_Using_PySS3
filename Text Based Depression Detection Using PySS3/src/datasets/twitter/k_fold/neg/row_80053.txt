I've reached out.I reached out to my only family left. My dad died when I was in the 4th grade in a car wreck. My mom committed suicide when I was 20. I reached out to my only family that wasnt addict to drugs or alcohol who "cared" about me. Seems they are caught up in their own families they made for themselves. They get mad because I dont show up enough. But I have a hard time. They dont understand. I've tried to reach out. I just dont know how to show them im struggling. I was told I was so strong when I had to choose to pull the plug on my mom. Because of course when she shot herself, she wasn't successful. Our family is cursed it seems. She missed everything in her head that would kill her instantly. I had to look at her while she was filled with all the tubes when she was in the ICU. I was strong because I chose to have a hand in my mother's death than let her live. Idk. My mind doesn't make sense. Regardless. I'm a nursing student. One semester from "changing my life" and all I can think about is leaving forever. I cant make anything right. Nobody is happy around me.
