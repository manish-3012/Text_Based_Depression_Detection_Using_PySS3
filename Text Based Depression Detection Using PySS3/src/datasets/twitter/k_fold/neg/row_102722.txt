My best friend's ex commited suicide.Two weeks ago my best friend (since when we were in kindergarten) told me that he and one girl that I know could be in a relationship, he looked so happy, so I thought was she, they got together a couple of times and everything was great, then suddenly he told me that she has blocked him from facebook, later that day she called him by phone (I don't know exact dialogues). Yesterday she called him again and was talking about some pills and alcohol I guess? It was her last phone call and probably a dialogue ever, best friend tried to contact her friends and family and was worried about her, yet it was too late as she hung herself. My best friend had cried whole day today as I hear from the voice (we usually speak on discord, cause we live far apart from each other) I feel like he feels guilty somehow (yet again I don't know any further details about their relationship or about her). As we've always spent very much time together either irl or in discord I feel really awkward, I don't know how to cheer him up etc... I feel him really much but I still feel like I am not making the situation any better, what should I do or how should I act?
