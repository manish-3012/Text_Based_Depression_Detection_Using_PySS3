Already done, waiting if it works50 mg diazepam, 2 or more mg of alprazolam (xanax), and a can of heineken,


I am sick of people manipulating me. Even after I got kicked out of my lab, which was initially caused my them alienating me, I cleaned up the lab and others' stuff out of sentiment.


Now they won't even answer my phone calls or read my messages.


Fucking money-laundering piece of shits. I tried to ignore that, but after this, I am so done.


I trusted they were doign it out of financial necessity. I trusted in their humane side. No one fucking cares.


Fuck 'em. If I die, I'll die. 



If I wake up after liike 12 hours, I am not going to stop chasing after them until they get all their fancy PhD's taken away and locked up. I'll see them being taken away, during which I'll make them see me.


That is if I live through this attempt. I'm done. I'm done being so naive. I'm done  trusting people who are nice to me. I spilled my heart out and that person fucking ignores me. Bitch.


I'm so done. Thanks guys. Reddit reply comments are the only 'friend-ish' messages I get these days. I literally have ZERO friends. My contact list consists of my family. That's it. I'm done. I'm done trusting. I'm done being bullied.
