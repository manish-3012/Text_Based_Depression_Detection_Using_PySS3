Goodbye, and I hope I never have to come back here again! (no offense)For the first time in maybe 4 years I feel genuinely happy! Iâ€™m actually bursting with happiness now! Talk therapy and medication has helped a ton and Iâ€™m starting to feel, well, normal now! My advice: Just be patient with yourself. What I did was keep on delaying my suicide date. November became December, and then it became January, and, well, now I donâ€™t have a date anymore! I have a lengthy recovery coming up ahead, and itâ€™ll be difficult rediscovering my past self, but I have hope! Iâ€™ll be unsubscribing from this place now, but I just wanna let ya guys know that this sub has been really supportive toward each other, and thatâ€™s great! Keep that positive attitude going! Hold on to that little glimmer of hope, no matter what! Peace!
