I just need to talk to someone, please.Iâ€™m really not sure what to even say. I hope this is the right place to ask.
I am just so tired of every day. I feel as though my life (itâ€™s had quite a few hard spots) is doing nothing but knocking me down when things get better. Iâ€™m medicated but even that seems to have stopped working. I wake up, feed the kids, spend the day with them, then sit inside when they go to sleep thinking about the point of everything. I love my kids more than anything but I feel like my being lost is clouding that. I have no close family in my town, and very sparse family even after that, and I donâ€™t want to bother them with my own selfish feelings. Iâ€™m tired of being alive, and at this point it all feels heavy and oppressive. I just donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m at a loss for what might be next.
