My reasons for staying aren't enough anymoreI feel like the only reasons I have for staying are because of other people. I know they would probably be upset but I'm starting to feel like I don't have any reasons for myself. Other people want me to keep going but I don't know if I do anymore. I can't get a job, I'm just a drain on everyone. I'm sure they'll be sad but I feel like I'll be less of a drain in the long run if I'm not here. I used to be really afraid of being dead, but I feel like I'm more afraid of continuing like this. just really needed to get this out, sorry if I didn't do this right I'm new to the sub.
