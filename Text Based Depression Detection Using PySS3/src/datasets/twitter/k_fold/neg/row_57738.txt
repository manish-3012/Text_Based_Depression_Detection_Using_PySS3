I'm not sure I want to die, but I definitely don't want to life I go through the motions. My life isn't hard, but I have a hard time coping with my circumstances. I lost the only person who I could trust to talk to.
I don't want to kill myself, but I hate life so fucking much. Nobody knows the bullshit I've been through, I just want to give up.
