This probably isn't serious, sorry for wasting timeI've been alive for only 18 years, but the amount of times I felt like I failed my mom feels like it shouldn't be that number.

I don't think what I did constitutes as a suicide attempt because it only left me somewhat numb and tingling. 

I just I know that if I die I'd fail her even more. My Mom's a single parent that deals with me everyday. I feel so stupid, it's just 20 or so modules of work, but I'm practically weeping already frantically searching for suicide articles and stuff on the wikipedia page. 

I have so many blessings and good things for me but I let suicide linger on my head. I actually know my dad even if he and mom aren't together and he actually gives me allowance because he cares but I'm so shitty that I can't even reciprocate genuinely

My grandma always wishes me to do well even if she  always nagged me. I have a scholarship. My parents actually negotiated with each other  to get me a good laptop for school. 

But I'm a degenerate with disgusting kinks who's addicted to the Internet and jacking off. I have a poor attention span, shitty time management skills. I procrastinate all the time, I never go through with my decisions. I don't think I even love my family enough.  They don't deserve someone like me. I waste so much time playing games. I'm a pessimistic who always gets everyone down. I'm an ungfateful shithead no one deserves to be with. 

Why can't I just die in my sleep? Why do I keep on letting suicide linger in my head just because my mom says I need to get work done. Why can't I just want to change for better

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.
