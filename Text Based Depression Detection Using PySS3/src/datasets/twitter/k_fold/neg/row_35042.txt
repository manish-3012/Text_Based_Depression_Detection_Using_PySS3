ThinkingBeen thinking about ending it for a year or so now, and it really hasn't got much better.  I know that pretty much 100% of you don't know me or anything, I just want to vent. I have a lot of friends, but I spend a lot of time listening to their problems and no one asks me about me. I'm oversized, and I've been told I'm "akward" looking but I know that I look like a monster. That's okay tho, everyone is different. Anyway, I'm pretty drunk, but I've taken two weeks off work and I'm gonna take these weeks to make amends with anyone and everyone Ive ever annoyed, and then I'm gone. Anyhow, thanks :)
