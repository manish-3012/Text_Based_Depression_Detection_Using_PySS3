Self-PityI would like to commit suicide, I have been wanting to do for a for years now. I'm currently on anti-depressants and a whole bunch of different medicine for my poor physical health, but I don't quite want to continue living since I haven't been enjoying life, it doesn't really interest me. 

I am going to commit suicide after I've moved out of my Mum's house (I'm 17 at the moment), since that would probably break the family for a while. 

I am getting Monthly Therapy with Counselors and Therapists, and I'm extremely nihilistic, meaning I don't see the point in anything. 

So yeah, sorry for so many I's.
