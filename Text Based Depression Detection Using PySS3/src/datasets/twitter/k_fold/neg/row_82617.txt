I am a homeless guy and i am very tired of lifeI am a 52 years old man who have been homeless for year and a half, I am using the internet currently at a library.i am very tired of not being able to sleep properly in bed ,like people anymore,I am tired of begging from people just to eat a meal,I am tired of people who spit me in the streets and call me a bum.

I smell horrible from not being able to have a bath,my teeth are fucked up from not being able to brush them ,my whole life is simply fucked up,men my age are planning there retirement while me being a bum on a street not being able to have a job and live like a human being,I am tired and depressed and hungry and I don't know if can handle this anymore

Every single day , I am looking at this building where I just wanna go up there and jump to my death,or staring at the highway,where I just wanna jump at a fast car, thinking about this so much ,I am starting to have dreams about it.

Please I am very depressed, very tired, very hungry,I thinking to just end it ,

Please
