Feeling miserable and thinking about suicide.Hi,I'm 21 (male) and have been depressed for about 4-5 years on and off, but in the last year it has gotten severe. I used to think my thoughts of suicide before was really serious, but now I understand I really wasn't close at all to doing it, but now I'm scared shitless because I know my suicidal thoughts are actual real and lately I've been thinking about ending my life with both a feeling of fear and also a feeling of relief and joy because I know it's a sure way to end my suffering, but I also know that I will never find out what i may miss out on if I do it.

But the thing is I can live depressed like this, it doesn't work. I remember two years ago i said to myself, if my life doesn't get better in a year, I will concider killing myself, but I will give it one year. Now it's been two years and I'm on the lowest I've ever been... I can't find a reason to live atm, and even if I will feel some joy tomorrow, that short time of joy can't weight up for the fact I'm miserable and sad for the most of the time. 

And will it get better? Maybe, I don't know... but I can't go on living in pain because I don't know if it will take my whole life, 10 years, 5 years or if I will have this realization tommorow and live happily ever after, maybe that will never happen, and I'm not sure how long I wanna stick around to see if things gets better, I've already done that for some years... 

My life is nothing like I hoped it will turn out to be. I'm lonely, have bad self-esteem and have few friends, and I feel I have much potential I don't get to use. 

Don't look at this post as a "I'm gonna kill myself so you better try to help", I'm just hoping someone got some wise words or something that can give me hope... anything. Beause the fact is I really want to live... but not in pain.
