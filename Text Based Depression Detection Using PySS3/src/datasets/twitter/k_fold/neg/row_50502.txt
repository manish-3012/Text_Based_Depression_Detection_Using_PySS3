I donâ€™t care anymore what happens to me. Will cut tonight from the first time in years.I though I could make it and that was so dumb, I was so fucking stupid, nothing will ever be better but foremost I will never get well, I need to hurt myself I need to see blood. I hate living and everyone hates me too. I feel my heart canâ€™t take it. Itâ€™s like a wall thatâ€™s oppressing me and I feel cornered with no escape, I just feel all I have is the will to die and how to do it and how to hurt me. And I will hurt myself and hopefully I will die once and for all.
