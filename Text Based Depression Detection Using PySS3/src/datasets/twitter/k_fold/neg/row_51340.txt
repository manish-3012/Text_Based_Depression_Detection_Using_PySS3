Depression is taking overHello, I just turned 18 couple of days ago, and I must admit I've been feeling suicidal the last month. And..it's not the first time really.


I've had a rather unhappy childhood - I was beaten by my father in front of my mother's eyes. I've been thrown out numerous times(at the middle of the night),as a child, and later as a teen. 


I remember my first attempt to commit. I was about 8-9yo and I tried choking myself. Then again at 11 or 12, I started experimenting with pills. Lots of them .Like 30 at once, and I drank'em ofc with some alcohol. I was always ready to give up everything, I remember falling asleep crying, and waking up feeling disappointed. 

My only problem is that with the years I've understood that life is worth living, that I have things to fight for. 

And yet nothing seems to work out for me.I'm not changing at all.I've got no luck at all, my loved ones do not care as much about me as I do about them. And the most terrifying thing - THE MAJORITY of them laughed in my face when I plucked up the courage to tell them I want to end my life . 

"You've said this too many times, you're gonna go through it. Get a grip of yourself." 

I really need to understand. My bf of two years won't even acknowledge the fact that I'm suicidal, all my friends mock at me.I rarely talk to my parents. I have no one else. Really. 

Should I do it?
