Nothing will ever get better for meNo matter what I always get unlucky. My life is pretty much over, I never really had a chance anyway. I have asperger's, bad anxiety, i'm miserable 24/7 and I have been for years. Aspergers was bad enough now i get all these other problems. Recently I have devolved LPR (silent reflux) and I'm only 20 also skinny, It feels like something is in my throat after eating and I spit up mucus a lot and eventually my lungs will be ruined. I Doubt I will live even to 40 with lpr and my bad luck. Why should I continue to live? There is a very miserable future ahead for me. I always get the short end of the stick and things are only going to get worse for me. I'm also poor, stupid, ugly and I am out of hope.  why should i live when i'm always miserable and have shit luck??
