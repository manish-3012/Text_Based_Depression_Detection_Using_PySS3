I think tonight is the night. Thank you. I can't go on.I have nothing to lose now. I am in constant physical, emotional, and mental pain. I'm not strong enough. Every thought is to use my noose I made and here I am. I love you all and wish the best of luck and happiness to all of you. I made it 17 years and was depressed for most of it. I hope find a release and freedom and that this will ultimately cure me. I love you Samantha and I wish we could've had our future. it's 9:34 currently and I won't be doing it until early the next morning. I hope something snaps or clicks honestly but if not I'm at peace.
